            <li>you travel a lot or if you just don&#x27;t want a huge hairdryer, this is a great hairdryer.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer is amazing for its size.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s amazing for its size</li>
            <li>She liked the bag that it came with</li>
            <li>2 stars because it had a nice price</li>
            <li>This comes in it&#x27;s own travel bag too.</li>
            <li>It comes with a handy travel case.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made and comes with a handy carrying bag.</li>
            <li>Comes with a storage bag, which is nice too.</li>
            <li>because I like to use my own hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Nice and lightweight.</li>
            <li>Also comes with black/white storage bag which is kinda nice.</li>
            <li>it still dries nicely but does not stress my hair.</li>
            <li>This dryer is keeping my hair so nice people ask me how I make my hair&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives my hair nice &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Hairdryer stopped blowing warm air about a month after the warranty expired.</li>
            <li>Nice for travel.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own zebra bag for storage.  </li>
            <li>The curl-infuser thing is also really handy for getting to my roots, even though I don&#x27;t need it for curls.</li>
            <li>These were loving nicknames, though, as it did all we asked of it.  </li>
            <li>The attachments (though I never use them) are a nice addition as well.  </li>
            <li>It comes with attachments, but they&#x27;re kind of a joke.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice hair dryer, does the job</li>
            <li>Reasonable price, traveling case and attachments, very happy!</li>
            <li>nice heat and airflow.</li>
            <li>Nice compact design.</li>
            <li>great size, lots of power, perfect size, great price, love the extras, but don&#x27;t care for pink!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very powerful for its size and does a great job.</li>
            <li>The first one overheated after 3-5 minutes of use, I was able to exchange it with the vendor, and the replacement unit seems to work perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It is the perfect weight, it is cute, it perfectly in her little hands, she loves it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect the power from a full size dryer but this works great as a mini dryer for traveling.</li>
            <li>I really do think that the combination of letting most of my hair air-dry and then using a low-wattage hairdryer like this awesome Conair one is what is saving my hair.</li>
            <li>Good value and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is compact, so it is very easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>So cute and small, perfect for traveling but with great power!</li>
            <li>I love it for travel, comes with a nice carry bag.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t use them, but for a travel kit, this is ideal.</li>
            <li>Traveling a lot for work, this is great for on-the-go compact and powerful hair-drying products.</li>
            <li>and I liked it, but this one is way better.</li>
            <li>Perfect for My 6 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>Love it nice for travel</li>
            <li>So cute and perfect for 6 year old granddaughter as she starts to care for her own hair</li>
            <li>The cute carrying bag is a nice bonus</li>
            <li>Way too cute and works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>For its size I am amazed at the &amp;#34;horsepower&amp;#34; :) The velocity and heat that comes from this thing is amazing and puts full-sized hair dryers to shame.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, works better than my full size blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Works just as well as a full sized hair dryer even though it is the size of a toy!!</li>
            <li>Works great, light weight and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>This is not as strong as they said BUT it&#x27;s stronger than most hotel and resort dryers so still a good purchase.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t taken it out of the country yet but as of right now it&#x27;s worked great.</li>
            <li>but it is very fine.</li>
            <li>my hair is very fine and gets staticy</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and lots of it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to find a travel dryer with a concentrator, but to find one with both is a winner!  </li>
            <li>have very fine hair that dries in about 5-7 minutes with this dryer, so it does the trick for me.</li>
            <li>and I hope to be able to use it for many more years to come!</li>

            <li>So far I love it, the size and weight are perfect.</li>
            <li>This is a great everyday dryer, as well as perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>However, it is cute and very easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>but I have to say I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>This is a great first hair dryer for my teenager.</li>
            <li>It is a good traveling size, just wish it had a cool setting.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my purposes (travel light) and good enough to use at home.</li>
            <li>but it is usable  Very light and feels flimsy.  </li>
            <li>Very light weight.  </li>
            <li>Awesome small and compact great for traveling.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s really safe, and convenient.</li>
            <li>Love the zebra carrying bag too.</li>
            <li>OK, whatever.</li>
            <li>I bought it to fit in my carry-on luggage, which it does nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying another one, because I can&#x27;t find a better hair dryer that suits my needs.  </li>
            <li>Nice and light</li>
            <li>I have very short hair and travel often, this is the perfect balance for power and size.</li>
            <li>I just love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Love the zebra print zipper pouch it comes with.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Who could ask for more?</li>
            <li>It should have had a better description in the specs.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting much and found a great product.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t have asked for more.</li>
            <li>But I bought this for the weight and it is light weight!</li>
            <li>And I love the color.</li>
            <li>Not terribly noisy either.</li>
            <li>this hair dryer is so cute</li>
            <li>Love.  </li>
            <li>I already have one - love it and use it every day.  </li>
            <li>Folds, and takes up 1/3 the space though, and comes with a cute case, and 2 attachments</li>
            <li>I like it but dont love it</li>
            <li>And the carrying bag just makes it that much better.</li>
            <li>I love the color.  </li>
            <li>It has more than one setting, worked well for me in Ireland, Scotland and England as well as the US.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I tried it in the U. S. to make sure it worked.  </li>
            <li>I have used it several times and am impressed.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more of an inconvenience than a product defect, however.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I have had it for about 6 months now and still love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I love it because it&#x27;s like a package, with a zipping bag.</li>
            <li>couldnt be happier :-)</li>
            <li>Looking for that perfect travel companion hair dryer, then look no further.  </li>
            <li>Today, most hotels have dryers, but if you have this with you, you don&#x27;t have to worry about</li>
            <li>It is also perfect for her hair on low.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was pleased with the price.  </li>
            <li>I took this to Bolivia with me for 3 months, and was able to use it 90% of the time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely cute and Barbie-like.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Be sure to check out the size before you order.</li>
            <li>If traveling internationally be sure to read and follow the instructions or you could fry it.</li>
            <li>Cute travel bag, too.</li>
            <li>Comes with cute bag and diffuser.</li>
            <li>It come in a cute bag tool</li>
            <li>and I was sure it wasn&#x27;t going to work out for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute, convenient and efficient.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer is said to be dual voltage, so HYPOTHETICALLY you should be able to use it in Europe.</li>
            <li>love how my hair comes out after using this.  </li>
            <li>satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall quite satisfied with the dryer.</li>
            <li>that I use it at home every day :)</li>
            <li>This is an okay product.</li>
            <li>I love the size and the results it gives me.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly light and effective for drying my hair.</li>
            <li>It is more pinkish color.</li>
            <li>Yup ppl, size doesn&#x27;t matter :-)</li>
            <li>I feel that it is def worth the price, its light and great for traveling, much better then using those \\&quot;Hotel stuck to the wall hair dryers!\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I love my light weight hair blower !  </li>
            <li>It is, however, without a doubt, the most adorable hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>I love the size and the bag it comes with.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, f you&#x27;re planning on using this thing for more than a weekend, and/or you care about your hair at all, do not get this product.</li>
            <li>I love this drier.</li>
            <li>I am ok with that.</li>
            <li>It works better and faster than any dryer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I really love about this dryer is the diffuser.  </li>
            <li>(so many dryers are much more).  </li>
            <li>It is powerful and the accessories and cute bag are a good way for me to teach her how to organize her beauty regime.</li>
            <li>This is one of my wife&#x27;s favorite presents.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like taking up a lot of precious counter space.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>This is completely adorable and comes in a zebra striped bag.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a satisfied customer :)</li>
            <li>I have used this every day for several months and it is great!</li>
            <li>The package comes with a directional nozzle, a diffuser, and a cute zebra bag.</li>
            <li>Will buy again and recommend it to the ladies :-)</li>
            <li>I am giving it 1 star, since I can&#x27;t seem to be able to choose 0.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace the Babyliss hairdryer I had for many years.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This is now my favorite hair dryer.</li>
            <li>With most hairdryers, my hair frizzes up.</li>
            <li>With this one, it comes out softer and more managable.</li>
            <li>What more could a person want for drying hair?</li>
            <li>Of course, for $15 I guess it should feel cheap!</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer and don&#x27;t mind using it, as it doesn&#x27;t hurt my hand at all.</li>
            <li>I love the travel bag that comes with it.</li>
            <li>Comes in a cute zebra print zippered bag too.</li>
            <li>Love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>excellent total package.</li>
            <li>This thing is tiny, and is a perfect size for travel.</li>
            <li>It is very powerful for its size and comes with a nice bag and accessories.</li>
            <li>Very powerful too!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s SUPER stylish too!</li>
            <li>The super cute tote bag is a plus!  </li>
            <li>Nice compact size, but nothing special about it.  </li>
            <li>This is a good little unit, perfect for travel or light use.  </li>
            <li>I love the bag which is stylish and easily holds all the accessories plus the dryer without problems.  </li>
            <li>My mom tried it and loved it so much that she got one too!</li>
            <li>I always take my full size blow dryer even to nice hotels where I know they will have a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>It has pretty good power to it.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a pretty good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>And, yes, someone said this is not the best dryer for long hair -- that person spoke the truth.</li>
            <li>All in all this is a great little blowdryer and great for travel.</li>
            <li>She is able to handle it easily and even though I still have to watch her and help with the use of a hairbrush, she is well on her way to independence.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying using this for my travel size hair dryer--it is so perfect and takes up absolutely no room at all.  </li>
            <li>Very surprised and happy to have found this for traveling.</li>
            <li>The MiniPro is super tiny and looks like it could be for a doll, but surprisingly works great for me.</li>
            <li>Works fine but at their higher price no longer a good buy</li>
            <li>Quite small but very good quality and good power.</li>
            <li>Love the light weight and ease to hold.  </li>
            <li>As far as the product is concerned, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>It is a really cheap dryer and that is OK too because I didn&#x27;t buy it for drying hair.</li>
            <li>Cute but cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It works great so far for it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li>Good quality, I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I loved this product so much I bought one for a gift.</li>
            <li>It is powerful &amp; effective with defuser &amp; concentrator.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real nice product overall.</li>
            <li>It is powerful &amp; effective for my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>and it is nice and powerful</li>
            <li>I do love how it is so light and easy to use though.</li>
            <li>Good strong blow power and fast drying</li>
            <li>I am very happy with it and the cute little storage bag that it came with.</li>
            <li>Petit, cute, powerful!</li>
            <li>Compact and easy to use</li>
            <li>I like the fact that its so light, but it almost feels cheap its so light!</li>
            <li>needed a dryer lite and easy to use for when we travel and this did the trick.  </li>
            <li>Its compactness makes it easy to pack for travel.</li>
            <li>, it makes it easy to find too.</li>
            <li>easy to transport ....</li>
            <li>I needed something that was easy to pack for traveling AND had a diffuser.</li>
            <li>Compact and easy to pack.</li>
            <li>i wanted a blowdryer that i could easily travel with.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Easy to tote around.  </li>
            <li>Not as powerful as described but better than most mini hair dryers.&lt;br /&gt;Small and lightweight.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s surprisingly strong for it&#x27;s size.  </li>
            <li>this hair dryer is nice and light and easy for me to handle...works good especially since I have arthritis in my hands</li>
            <li>It is the perfect size for her when she gets older to dry her own hair.</li>
            <li>but when there&#x27;s time I let it cool off to be safe).</li>
            <li>This is so lightweight yet is works just as good as my normal size dryer.</li>
            <li>Works even better than my full sized one.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what advertised and nice quality.  </li>
            <li>I bought this dryer for travel, mainly abroad, and I am pleased to see that it has an ungrounded plug, which takes a simpler kind of electrical outlet adapter.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly its pretty powerful for its size.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been totally fine for every day use.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>Works just fine.</li>
            <li>with short/med length fine hair should have no issues.</li>
            <li>It worked fine with the adapter.</li>
            <li>and it was working fine.  </li>
            <li>well - my hair is fine textured but there is a lot of it</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this dryer doesn&#x27;t overpower me or my hair.</li>
            <li>Good grip, pretty powerful, and has attachment I like.  </li>
            <li>It is light and easily packed, comes with a bag to contain the cords and dryer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The dryer itself works fine</li>
            <li>but my hair is really fine</li>
            <li>So light &amp; easy with lots of power.  </li>

            <li>It worked just fine.</li>
            <li>This dryer works fine, it does just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It serves the purpose for me and works fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair but a lot of it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a lightweight, compact hair dryer with accessories like a defuser, but don&#x27;t buy into the line that it&#x27;s as powerful as a full sized hair dryer, as it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair though.</li>
            <li>But it would be easy to fit in a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Power is more than adequate for my usage.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t turn it off and put it on the counter to quickly move my clip to pull out more hair, it falls off from the air pushing against the wall.  </li>
            <li>Super cute an stylish an super durable.</li>
            <li>It is quick!</li>
            <li>It would be more helpful it had a warm and a hot temperature, but for the price it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light weight but powerful.</li>
            <li>Very light weight yet powerful for its size.</li>
            <li>(she&#x27;s full Japanese) and we both loved it!  </li>
            <li>Perfect size for little hands.  </li>
            <li>This little blowdryer is AWESOME!</li>
            <li>So this little guy seemed perfect.</li>
            <li>Best little travel dryer with plenty of power......</li>
            <li>This little baby is awesome!</li>
            <li>The original is still going strong after a couple of years.  </li>
            <li>Unless you have a huge purse.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re huge and over-sized, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Great hairdryer with dual wattage for international travel.  </li>
            <li>It feels so cheap</li>
            <li>very convenient to use and effective.</li>
            <li>And it is extremely light, not tiring on the arms.</li>
            <li>Its light.</li>
            <li>The zebra carrying case just adds to the fun. : )  </li>
            <li>All we needed was a cheap plug adapter- no need for step up/down converters, wattage limits, fuses that could blow the rest of your trip- esp for things like hairdryers.</li>
            <li>Its a simple dryer but its great</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s structurally cheaply made and often feels like it&#x27;s going to fall apart while I&#x27;m using it which makes me nervous</li>
            <li>Considering the unit can fit in the palm of your hand</li>
            <li>The Conair Mighty Mini Styler performs as described.</li>
            <li>so light while blowdrying my hair.  </li>
            <li>Or maybe you can get crafty and block some of the holes in the diffuser...</li>
            <li>Great for travel &amp; home use since I have short hair!</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I bought one for myself as well.</li>
            <li>This dryer is just cheap.  </li>
            <li>Cheap, lightweight, plasticky feeling.  </li>
            <li>No way this will fit in a purse like they say.</li>
            <li>I decided to research smaller hair dryers &amp; this one looked great.</li>
            <li>looks kindda cheap</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also very lightweight which is nice too.</li>
            <li>is important to consider is to touch the hair.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer works well, and it is so light weight that the plug weighs about what the dryer does.</li>
            <li>Looks and feels cheap.  </li>
            <li>This really fit the bill.</li>
            <li>nice size  didn&#x27;t take up much room in my luggage</li>
            <li>The Infiniti by Conair Mighty Mini Tourmaline Ceramic Styler has traveled to many countries with me thanks to the ability to change voltage and is my favorite travel hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>cheap and works well for what it is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for years for a smaller hair dryer and this one is great.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest, if we really &amp;#34;need&amp;#34; to use our diffuser while traveling, we would find a way to schlep our full-sized dryer w/ diffuser attachment with us on our trip.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>This one certainly fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>Cheap.  </li>
            <li>Great for international travel</li>
            <li>Compact and light for the suitcase.  </li>
            <li>The nozzle tip stays on nicely and the fast speed dries my hair quicker than ever before.</li>
            <li>Light weight</li>
            <li>It works great, no problems, but it is TINY!</li>
            <li>Its light..</li>
            <li>All in all, if you&#x27;re using this hairdryer for travel only, it is a great size and does the job.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer seems to be of good quality so far, but the color is deceiving by the picture.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by it&#x27;s size though, very powerful for a low-watt dryer.</li>
            <li>Fits her hands perfect, Mini and Mighty, she uses the low setting, the high setting is very powerful.</li>
            <li>Perfect for travel, small for ease of packing, light weight to handle yet dries efficiently</li>
            <li>It is super lightweight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>makes hair styling very easy and fast.</li>
            <li>SUPER tiny but works great.</li>
            <li>My hair dried quickly and the diffuser worked great with my curly hair!</li>
            <li>A mini dryer that does a powerful job!</li>
            <li>Not disappointed.</li>
            <li>excellent product for being so small.  </li>
            <li>With that in mind, the only thing that would have made this an even better dryer is if it had a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button, however if there were more features on this dryer it may not be able to be as compact and lightweight as it is and would defeat the reason why I purchased it.</li>
            <li>It would also be perfect for traveling because it&#x27;s so small, but POWERFUL!</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it as a Christmas gift for my 9-year-old daughter.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought the bag was just more of the over packaging</li>
            <li>When I originally ordered it, on Amazon it said &amp;#34;color may vary.&amp;#34;  I joked with a friend &amp;#34;watch...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so small and perfect in my purse with my mini straightener (comes with zebra bag and pieces)</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this for use when traveling</li>
            <li>it is so powerful!</li>
            <li>I rather pay more for a higher quality product.</li>
            <li>love it that much!</li>
            <li>It is soooo small and perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>For a small, compact hair dryer its great for traveling!</li>
            <li>Unbelievably lightweight - great for travel!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the purchase so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tad noisy in the high mode, but I love how light and easy to use it is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for traveling and comes with an adorable little pouch.</li>
            <li>so I could control the shaping of my bangs a little better, but all in all this is a great dryer.</li>
            <li>Powerful little dryer was perfect on our overseas trip.  </li>
            <li>Great hair dryer to dry my toddler&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>It is super light weight.</li>
            <li>A good choice for younger girls who are starting to spend more time in the bathroom styling their hair!  :)</li>
            <li>For a little guy, it does a very good job.</li>
            <li>Works well and super small, perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>A great little travel hair dryer, very light yet powerful.</li>
            <li>It is very light weight and small which will work great for traveling.</li>
            <li>I had a great little travel dryer that worked great for years until it recently just died on me.</li>
            <li>Never going back to the heavier kind -- gave that one away to my daughter who still has some hand strength and a very full head of hair</li>
            <li>had good reviews but certainly didn&#x27;t live up to them..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been able to work it on the 250 setting here in Australia, but it seems great so far.</li>
            <li>Bought this so that my 9 year old could begin drying her own hair.  </li>
            <li>I still prefer the beastier full size....its faster.</li>
            <li>My last conair hairdryer lasted a good 15+ years.</li>
            <li>It stays true to it&#x27;s name as it is indeed mini, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy this if I have thicker hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice that on low it has a nice gentle blow speed and temperature.</li>
            <li>She thought it was cool.</li>
            <li>And indeed I am glad I did not spend much on this one.  </li>
            <li>but I have really been thankful for it because it keeps the wires safe in my gym bag</li>
            <li>It fulfills our needs very well and it has a cute color.</li>
            <li>Folding handle was good, but too big for my use.</li>
            <li>Does a good job for such a compact dryer</li>
            <li>loving it so far</li>
            <li>Bought as a travel dryer, but it&#x27;s so light and powerful</li>
            <li>This one is just as good as the big ones.</li>
            <li>I wish it had a cool setting</li>
            <li>I travel for vacation at least once a year and am never that impressed with the blow dryers the hotels provide.  </li>
            <li>It would be really nice for a young girl.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t weigh a thing, takes up no space and works just as well as full size dryers.  </li>
            <li>It does such a good job that I forget that it is travel size.</li>
            <li>it really doesn&#x27;t diffuse anything as most of the air is at full force.</li>
            <li>She enjoys being able to dry her own hair.</li>
            <li>My favorite part, its pink :)!</li>
            <li>This is VERY small - but for me, it was perfect, because I wanted &amp;#34;small</li>
            <li>It quickly dries even a lot of Hair.</li>
            <li>Dries hair fairly quickly for a mini dryer.</li>
            <li>My old travel dryer was a bit heavier, but it folded and fit better in my luggage.</li>
            <li>their are WAY better deals on amazon for the same size with lower prices and better brands.</li>
            <li>Works quickly in drying my sweaty hair from working out.</li>
            <li>Shipper got them to me quickly.</li>
            <li>It puts out a forceful flow of air, dries her shoulder length hair quickly and fits snugly in her gym bag</li>
            <li>It quickly became my go-to hairdryer</li>
            <li>My hair dries quickly with no frizz.</li>
            <li>quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Might be OK if you have very strong tight curls that don&#x27;t get blown out as easily.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t purchase as it is clearly cheaply made, and won&#x27;t even hold up to minimal use for a full three months!!!  </li>
            <li>The cord is nice and long and the attachments stay on easily.</li>
            <li>After using the Mighty Mini for a couple of weeks now, I&#x27;ve been able to maintain healthy-looking ends, which is a huge achievement for my fragile hair.</li>
            <li>it got very hot and stopped working.  </li>
            <li>It works great, even better than my regular, larger hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic and a pretty color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, powerful, but the hot setting is TOO HOT</li>
            <li>I guess it could be a nice gift for a 6 year old or like a kid that&#x27;s just starting to do their own hair.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth it as it takes up about 1/3 of the space my full sized dryer uses.</li>
            <li>High powered and compact, it is the perfect little travel blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>It would be easy to carry in a suitcase or even a large purse, if you have the strength to do so.</li>
            <li>It dries her hair quickly without causing the blow drying damage ususally seen with super powerful dryers.  </li>
            <li>Very lightweight, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Were surprised as to the small size, but yet the output was as good, or better, than most full size hair dryers.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer is really perfect for short hair, and a quick blow dry.</li>
            <li>Since I have a lot of very fine, straight hair, which is shoulder blade length, it doesn&#x27;t take much blowing air to tangle my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got plenty of power in an extremely lightweight package, ideal for older, arthritic hands.</li>
            <li>Its little and so cute! makes adorable gifts    </li>
            <li>Better than my old one and prettier too!</li>
            <li>When I first opened this hair dryer, I was quite dismayed!  </li>
            <li>The first time it sucked some hair up, it lost significant drying force.</li>
            <li>It most definitely is not this color or this size, but it&#x27;s easy to travel with and it work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s more powerful than my regular diffuser!</li>
            <li>It does have strong airflow for such a tiny dryer, which is great for non-curly purposes.  </li>
            <li>The storage pouch is very handy to keep counters less cluttered.  </li>
            <li>Mini and cute even not exactly the same color, still beautiful</li>
            <li>This is a great little dryer.  </li>
            <li>Great little hair dryer for the money.</li>
            <li>However, because the size is so tiny and light weight it makes styling so much easier and therefore our hair looks better than ever!  </li>
            <li>Great little dryer.  </li>
            <li>Great little hair dryer for traveling with.</li>
            <li>This a great little travel hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Great little hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Works great for little hands.</li>
            <li>This is a great little hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Great little blow dryer</li>
            <li>This little dryer is great.</li>
            <li>All around, I&#x27;m really happy with this little guy.</li>
            <li>Great little dryer for travel</li>
            <li>Great, small, light and does exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>What I was expecting was a bright pink hairdryer with a zebra stripe carrying case.  </li>
            <li>just takes up too much room when trying to pack light.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We received the bright pink dryer with the zebra case, as pictured.  </li>
            <li>Between its size and bright pink colour, it reminded me of a Barbie beauty toy</li>
            <li>This is a nice tiny size for traveling, but I returned it because it does not have a &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; button.</li>
            <li>My younger daughter wanted her own dryer</li>
            <li>I thought she&#x27;d get a kick out of having her own dryer and it would be easier for her to use since it was smaller.</li>
            <li>I really liked this but only got to use it 3</li>
            <li>I only rated it one star because the color was nice.</li>
            <li>I did have to laugh at something.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight, but powerful.</li>
            <li>Works well so far but feels cheaply made (light plastic).</li>
            <li>but it is well worth</li>
            <li>but still way too warm for a &#x27;low&#x27; setting.</li>
            <li>Its been a week I received this hair dryer and so far I am satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li>lightweight yet powerful.  </li>
            <li>a naturally wavy/curly, chin length bob and this dryer was able to maintain that well on a 10 day trip to Europe.  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t expecting a powerful machine.</li>
            <li>Love the size, love the color, it even has a slow speed that gives off an appropriate amount of heat.</li>
            <li>and I did&#x27;t want a powerful blowdryer that blows out all of my curls.  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe how powerful it is.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the $15</li>
            <li>I bought this to use on vacation in Europe, because my blow dryer is too powerful.</li>
            <li>Definatly worth it.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as others led me to believe.</li>
            <li>but it worked really well internationally, this brand seems to be good at dual voltage.  </li>
            <li>I use it to do her hair and occasionally she uses it to do her own hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as powerful as a full-size but without the weight and bulk.</li>
            <li>Was quite powerful</li>
            <li>Love the size &amp; power of this mighty mini...especially appreciate the diffuser because I have short hair and most dryers are far too powerful.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a lightweight, easy to use blow dryer with a diffuser at a decent price</li>
            <li>but this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Love that it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space and love that it&#x27;s pink.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a powerful hair dryer considering its size, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li>The diffuser add-on is also useful.</li>
            <li>Powerful but lightweight</li>
            <li>Good,but not as powerful as I hoped.  </li>
            <li>It is very tiny compared to most hairdryers, but still very worth it.</li>
            <li>Very nice little hair dryer for the money.</li>
            <li>Very nice little bag too</li>
            <li>It is small, comes with it&#x27;s own zipper storage bag and is very light weight.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love it and hope it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>It is quick and easy and my hair comes out so soft and not frizzy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Works great, has alot of power for a little thing  pretty color also</li>
            <li>Good for travel but not exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use hot rollers anymore because I can more readily control the direction of air on my hair with each stroke much like my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>just wish t had a flat diffuser without the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; — I used to have that kind and prefer it.</li>
            <li>It is especially great for younger girls because it is small and light.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is just the right size for my motor home.</li>
            <li>, the price is right.</li>
            <li>I plugged it in Turkey and it blew out right away, so I didn&#x27;t have a hair dryer during my stay there.</li>
            <li>This one is just right.  </li>
            <li>is just right for finishing touches.</li>
            <li>Let me just say that this is the most amazing small hair dryer that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that would make this better would be if they could include a &#x27;cool&#x27; setting, but for the price I paid, I&#x27;m not complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great little hair dryer!</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t already have a great hair dryer for home use, I&#x27;d probably use it at home, because it takes up so little room!</li>
            <li>this overheats very easily and actually quit working after 3 uses.  </li>
            <li>This little blow dryer is amazing!</li>
            <li>It has a little carrying case too that is nice for the price!</li>
            <li>Great to start with but broke after 5 months with very little use</li>
            <li>Perfect for travel or for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to take up half their space with storing some of the big hair dryers.</li>
            <li>Very compact, easy for travel packing, and works very well.</li>
            <li>1875 watt dryer I use at home, but adequate and my hair looks better than I&#x27;d expect with a travel dryer, and it&#x27;s certainly a massive improvement over anything you&#x27;d find in a hotel room.  </li>
            <li>great product for how small it is.</li>
            <li>It also has great power for a small machine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very powerful when set to high.</li>
            <li>For as small as this baby is, it does a great job of drying hair.  </li>
            <li>It is quite small but does a great job drying.</li>
            <li>It looks like a toy because it is so small but does a great job.  </li>
            <li>SOMEWHAT better than others its size; though still blows very hot, (almost to Hot on the Low setting); but is useful for Travel</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is not only the perfect size for travel, or little people (just learning how to use one)</li>
            <li>It is also cheap and comes with a little bag to put it in, though my baby has took it as her own along with the dryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is pretty tiny but it works perfectly for my 10 year old daughter who can&#x27;t quite use a regular size hair dryer yet.  </li>
            <li>It is soooo light, it&#x27;s more powerful than expected!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It broke right after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The barrel gets hot right away.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and price was very competetive.  </li>
            <li>I said, it works great, just make sure that the correct voltage is selected before use and hasn&#x27;t switched to the wrong setting.</li>
            <li>This one is PERFECT - not too big and heavy, two temps and a low/hi speed for each.</li>
            <li>Overall great product, especially for curls</li>
            <li>super  fast dry..not that noisy.</li>
            <li>When you first get it, you&#x27;re like naaahh, this cute little toy won&#x27;t be able to do much!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Pros:  Lightweight, takes up very little space and comes with a stylish silver storage bag  Great for travel and sturdy enough for every day</li>
            <li>If you have long hair and want to get up under and near the roots you may be best to stick to a regular hairdryer though.</li>
            <li>This compact hair dryer works very well and gets hot quickly getting the job done.  </li>
            <li>It has a lot of power and dries my hair very fast.</li>
            <li>It dries your hair very fast which is something I wanted.  </li>
            <li>It is very light and compact but it does not have a lot of power even for my short hair!</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used this dryer twice and both times it was fine.</li>
            <li>I love my hot pink mini-pro, so lightweight and Powerful!  </li>
            <li>Love the weight and size - but mainly I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Great little Hair Dryer!!</li>
            <li>Love this little guy - light weight and powerful.</li>
            <li>A hair dryer should last more.</li>
            <li>purchased this when I was in college (at the college store), and it was perfect for the constant back and fourth travel.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I left this at the hotel and used the hotel blow dryers with no diffuser which worked better then</li>
            <li>Works better than larger dryers, easier to hold and store</li>
            <li>It does look like a &amp;#34;Barbie&amp;#34; hair dryer, but it is surprisingly hot.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get too hot and I use it with the difuser</li>
            <li>burned up first time used</li>
            <li>Perfect for weekend trips away from home and small enough to toss in a bag and take to the gym.</li>
            <li>the first time I used it I felt like it was a toy.</li>
            <li>Works like a charm and exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Daughter wants one, too!  </li>
            <li>It really does do the job!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it in the U.K. (after switching the voltage)</li>
            <li>and I actually really like it!</li>
            <li>But I really can&#x27;t complain and I would probably buy it again!</li>
            <li>They have a higher current, so I&#x27;m glad I read the directions.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t put the diffuser close to my scalp as the air was just too hot.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to return it because I&#x27;d passed the deadline by the time I got back from my trip.</li>
            <li>After one use, item got extremely hot, and did not work again.</li>
            <li>Light weight for my 87 yr old mom to hold.  </li>
            <li>But for the occasional use it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>It came with extra attachments in a cute zebra-striped bag.</li>
            <li>I love the tiny zebra print travel bag this product comes with along with the diffusers.</li>
            <li>The air isn&#x27;t too hot but loads of volume.  </li>
            <li>thing is it does get pretty hot, so you just have to get used to getting around that.</li>
            <li>Also , note wattage is only 1200, which is better for my house.  </li>
            <li>Make sure if you&#x27;re Australian</li>
            <li>Although I bought this for travel, I like it more then my regular sized dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>So hot I couldn’t use it except to thaw ice in my freezer.</li>
            <li>This dryer is so light-weight that it feels cheap, but so far seems to be working like a</li>
            <li>The zebra bag was a delight to use for travel and for personal when travel is over :-)</li>
            <li>The product came exactly as shown in picture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a tacky hot pink</li>
            <li>from the first use you know it will die soon.</li>
            <li>:) If you need a smaller dryer that packs a punch for travel!</li>
            <li>Bit  smaller than thought, more of travel size.</li>
            <li>is too hot for my hair.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Good for an everyday hair dryer, not just for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I have long naturally curly hair, and I was able to get it straight and smooth quickly).  </li>
            <li>She is scared of the vacuum but is ok with this dryer.</li>
            <li>But it works as well as a larger hairdryer, certainly far, far better than a hotel wall dryer, and better than some full-sized ones, too.</li>
            <li>In looking for a new dryer I found most were too big and bulky for me, as well as too powerful for my hair.</li>
            <li>Great travel size, though not as quiet as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>I need to use a diffuser and this did the trick for traveling, and it&#x27;s more powerful than expected.</li>
            <li>Its small but perfect for my little girl who is 9 and starting to do her own hair.</li>
            <li>It is quite powerful and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Is plenty powerful enough for my fine, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure my hair would air dry faster.</li>
            <li>and I had to go to the grocery store to buy a new one, more powerful, that worked very well and cost the same.  </li>
            <li>Great,  little, light , however POWERFUL little hairdryer.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m finding that the lower temp setting is in fact much gentler on my hair than what I used to do with the higher setting, and still does the trick.</li>
            <li>Really small, but does a good job of drying.</li>
            <li>Good air flow for a small dryer.  </li>
            <li>Really good - small but dries my hair well.</li>
            <li>I had a little chuckle when I opened the box - it reminded me exactly of a blow dryer that Barbie would own and even comes with</li>
            <li>My MiniPro  is so easy on the hair with only 1200 watts</li>
            <li>Easy to use for international travel since it has dual power settings.</li>
            <li>I have had full sized hair dryers that cost twice as much that didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this does.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small compact lightweight size which is most important for her.</li>
            <li>I like it because it is easy to hold and manipulate in different directions to self- style.</li>
            <li>I love the hot pink color and the fact it is lightweight.</li>
            <li>My daughters aren&#x27;t strong enough to hold my hair dryer with one hand.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the power of such a little and light thing.</li>
            <li>but it has already replaced my large cumbersome home dryer.</li>
            <li>I love how small this is and its very powerful.</li>
            <li>More importantly, though, is that there is only a high and a low setting.</li>
            <li>It may not work well with really thick or very long hair, but it works perfectly for my shoulder-length hair.</li>
            <li>This is cute, lightweight, feels like a toy but is a real hair dryer that will dry your hair.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, packs easily and is much nicer to travel with than my regular size hair dryer/diffuser combo, which I&#x27;ve been lugging around on trips for years.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to get back from a 2 week European trip to review this outstanding mini styler!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care what color it came in, but got it in the white and that was fine.</li>
            <li>What I realized is that it worked fine on the low setting.  </li>
            <li>Dries my hair fine, I do have short hair though.  </li>
            <li>; Well, this dryer is kinda like that: tiny, slightly disconcerting-at-first, but, in the end, pretty remarkable.</li>
            <li>Although most hotels come with one these days, I have SUPER finicky multi-ethnic hair (Japanese and Caucasian), and wanted to have a dryer with me that wasn&#x27;t just your basic tool.  </li>
            <li>This little dryer is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Nice little hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It also comes with attachments and a nice little case.</li>
            <li>Nice little blowdryer.  </li>
            <li>but if you try to use it with the higher temp and high the wind  </li>
            <li>High setting is hot.  </li>
            <li>but honestly if I traveled with it I think it would only frustrate me because the right size doesn&#x27;t help if it doesn&#x27;t dry your hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great little hair dryer, especially for travel because of its size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s little, and it&#x27;s POWERFUL, what more do you want from something called &amp;#34;Mighty</li>
            <li>Not only is it great for trips but for people with little strength in hands and shoulders.  </li>
            <li>Great little dryer, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>It has  good heat, but hardly any air pressure, which I  count on for my hairstyle.</li>
            <li>I have thinner hair, about mid length between chin and shoulder, and I am able to dry it pretty quickly with the Infiniti.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This amazing little dryer delivers close to the power I&#x27;m used to with the T3, and my shoulder length hair is as smooth as ever - in almost the same amount of time.</li>
            <li>Good if you just want to dry it off so you can flat iron it or curl it,</li>
            <li>After using a much heavier professional style hair dryer for awhile, this one is truly a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li>dries my hair fast.</li>
            <li>It worked really well, though, for about 6 months.  </li>
            <li>It really does almost look like a toy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very lightweight and cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t take much space</li>
            <li>As others noted, you don&#x27;t get what&#x27;s pictured - mine was white with a light gray sack.</li>
            <li>But it really packed a punch once I got the hang of it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much easier to handle.</li>
            <li>this is really mini sized.</li>
            <li>is very usefull.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Gets the job done fast.</li>
            <li>And it works very well.  </li>
            <li>Purchased for my wife as a travel unit, and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>but I have a much nicer travel hair dryer that doesn&#x27;t feel like it is just going to snap in two...</li>
            <li>Sure enough...hot pink.  </li>
            <li>Same power, light weight.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Works very well as well.</li>
            <li>It really looked like a toy.  </li>
            <li>It dries my hair faster than my full-size hair dryer, and with just as much heat.</li>
            <li>The pink color is just the cherry on top for her.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really work overseas unless you want to burn your scalp.</li>
            <li>It has held up very well.</li>
            <li>very disapointed...</li>
            <li>Really like having the attachments.  </li>
            <li>and it really works.  </li>
            <li>very utilitarian ...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It really helps at keeping all my hair clips and dryer in one place.  </li>
            <li>Very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>, I really really wish I had brought it instead.</li>
            <li>Light weight and quiet.  </li>
            <li>i really like this hair dryer</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up much suitcase space.</li>
            <li>I really like the two speeds.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pink which is OK</li>
            <li>and you plug it in with the adapter that you don&#x27;t put it on high!</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Tiny but mighty.  </li>
            <li>that much</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had this problem in the US as much as I have in Europe.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have much power.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>how much power it has.</li>
            <li>I got it primarily to take with me when I travel, but now I use it at home instead of my regular hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight too.</li>
            <li>As others have said, there really should be a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting on it to help get that shiny hair at the end of a blowout.</li>
            <li>Dries my hair really fast</li>
            <li>However, it overheats fast.</li>
            <li>It works very well, and has more power for the size than I would have expected.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old is taking on more responsibility with her personal care.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective for being so tiny and definitely convenient for travel.</li>
            <li>so I guess I expected it to be capable of more.</li>
            <li>Pretty much doll size but blows stronger than my normal hair dryer.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t miss the high setting, though, because the low setting on 220 is just as strong.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old loves the color!!!</li>
            <li>It is tiny and lightweight but very powerful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and light and easy for me to carry around.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and light and easy to manipulate.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer is fantastic and quite strong for being so small.  </li>
            <li>not for everyday but very handy for travel and a back up dryer</li>
            <li>This little hair dryer is very light-weight, nice &amp; small for traveling and just as nice for every day use.</li>
            <li>It is very small, cute and light as shown in the picture.  </li>
            <li>The hot is very hot so hold it back from your head.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my little girl (8yr old) to be able to dry hair on her own.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, and straight hair and this has turned out to be my go-to dryer.</li>
            <li>Also, I love that it has dual-voltage settings, one for the U.S. and the other for Europe (and</li>
            <li>I originally intended to only use this dryer for travelling, but I use it exclusively.</li>
            <li>Tiny, lightweight, but packs a powerful punch!</li>
            <li>This compact dryer is more the type of thing I would take when I don&#x27;t know if the hotel I&#x27;ll be staying at has hair dryers (i.e., a non-chain hotel or a foreign hotel).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough to put it in my bag and travel with me, and strong enough to dry my hair perfectly!</li>
            <li>My hair is short but VERY thick and it drys it really quickly and the attachments are great.</li>
            <li>The only draw back is that it seems to get kind of hot towards the nozzle (like if you accidentally knock the concentrator end off and have to put it back on to finish blowdrying your hair, it feels like you&#x27;re playing hot potato).  </li>
            <li>it is small but really dries nicely</li>
            <li>It is nice, the ceramic really leaves hair soft and shiny, less frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I have short hair and discovered I really don&#x27;t need to use a full size dryer.</li>
            <li>If you have limited arm movement or muscles that fatigue easily, this is the dryer for you.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair very well on the high setting.</li>
            <li>The reason why I was getting an extra one was because I was very satisfied with the old model - Light, small, dual-voltage, strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>after most regular runs the parts are hot, but not enough to burn me (seems ok enough to put it back in its bag,</li>
            <li>This dryer is small and light, making it very easy to use on my short hair.  </li>
            <li>If your only requirements for a travel blow drier are that it dries your hair fast, then this is adequate.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t get a good blow dry first my hair is a mess.  </li>
            <li>I have little time and thick, curly hair and it does a great job and very powerful.</li>
            <li>This one is so small, light weight and powerful!</li>
            <li>I bought this dryer for my 7 year old as her first hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It is strong enough to dry hair quickly, but not to the point of burning hair/scalp.</li>
            <li>It actually works as well as my full size salon hair dryer that I use at home.</li>
            <li>Only wish is that it had a cool setting.</li>
            <li>Small, lightweight dryer that doesn&#x27;t take up lots of room in a drawer or cabinet; the bag helps keep the cord contained and accessories handy.</li>
            <li>Not a bad dryer overall, and it comes with 2 attachments.  </li>
            <li>My mom wanted a small and powerful hair dryer and when she opened this on Christmas day she was quite excited!</li>
            <li>It is super small and easy to take around.</li>
            <li>Pretty loud on high.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is small but its engine is powerful!!!</li>
            <li>she loves it and so does my older daughter.</li>
            <li>I was prepared for any color to show up, but was pleased to get a white one with red details.</li>
            <li>I dropped it, so it wasn&#x27;t totally out of the blue, but I think a dryer should be able to withstand being dropped from waist height onto a rug once, which is what happened.</li>
            <li>It gets hot enough but not too hot.</li>
            <li>Was a decent dryer before that.</li>
            <li>This is my first tourmaline ceramic dryer, and it does seem to leave my hair smoother, but not enough that I&#x27;d be willing to toss my flat-iron.  </li>
            <li>When I ordered this styler I thought I was getting the (older) one that folds.</li>
            <li>I also started using this as my main hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This is actually an OK travel dryer given its size, but it doesn&#x27;t let you regulate temp but only pu tit on high or low.</li>
            <li>Got the fuschia dryer with zebra bag, which was handy for keeping the 2 attachments, my other small combs and clips, and an easy stuffing of its loosely-gathered cable (rather than spending time winding the cord around which still twists and wears on it, and unravels in your luggage).</li>
            <li>I use it in a 240v area mainly so it is always on high</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would Absolutely recommend to a friend (and to a complete stranger too)!</li>
            <li>It is super lightweight, super small, about the size of a female&#x27;s hand spread out, dries almost/ as fast as my Babyliss Toniro full sized dryer.  </li>
            <li>it is small and light but blow quickly.</li>
            <li>It takes much longer to dry my hair with this that with a full sized dryer.</li>
            <li>I was truly amazed;  while it didn&#x27;t dry my hair quite as quickly as my large tourmaline dryer, it worked nearly as quickly.  </li>
            <li>It also gives off a burning smell when used on high.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred to have an in between setting but am adjusting to the high speed/low speed.</li>
            <li>high setting is too high in that it gives off a burning smell even though there is no dust</li>
            <li>It was on high and the switch had changed from 250 to 125, it surged, and is no longer operable.</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t use the high setting when you&#x27;re on 220.</li>
            <li>I recommend this dryer highly but acknowledge that it may not work well if you have longer or thicker hair.</li>
            <li>It should not be allowed to operate on High mode in countries with lower voltage.</li>
            <li>I start out with the high one for a couple of minutes and then switch to the low&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>In addition to being one third the size and significantly lighter than my old dryer, it did the job in half the time of my more powerful unit with the same technology.  </li>
            <li>Hunting for a coin to switch between the dual-voltage settings was a bit niggly, but fine for making it harder to accidentally fry your dryer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Low setting is warm but not hot.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you switch the little adjuster to the correct voltage.</li>
            <li>Cute little hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This one not only does it, it doesn&#x27;t even get hot to the touch!</li>
            <li>I love that this comes with a little diffuser.</li>
            <li>love this little guy.</li>
            <li>Love this little dryer....</li>
            <li>It also comes with adorable little attachments, and it stores in an adorable little zebra print bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this little Conair hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken this little guy to Europe twice and on US vacations more times than I can count.</li>
            <li>I love this little dryer.</li>
            <li>I love this little dynamo.  </li>
            <li>Love this little dryer.</li>
            <li>I also love the little attachable defuser and straightener.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this little dryer, it is so manageable to use.  </li>
            <li>I love this little hairdryer.....</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this model to take on a trip to Ireland since my luggage space was limited and the Infiniti was lightweight and compact.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised with how much power and heat</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 5 yea old daughter because she always wants to do things for herself</li>
            <li>I bought it to take it to my kids swimming practice as they swim outside all year long ( california :) ).</li>
            <li>I have short hair and don&#x27;t know how it would work for long hair, but I do love it.</li>
            <li>Purchased to take to Mexico and it is quite powerful for a TINY dryer!  </li>
            <li>I get it, its a travel size so it wont be as powerful as the regular one</li>
            <li>My hairdryer was much too big and heavy for her to manage on her own.  </li>
            <li>Not for like, a really vain American Girl Doll?&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>I love the concentrator - it&#x27;s really narrow and makes drying you hair in sections a breeze.  </li>
            <li>For me, it works better than any heavy, bulky one I have used before.</li>
            <li>Smaller than it looks but a powerful hair dryer for the size.</li>
            <li>It was about as powerful as a 1500 watt dryer I use daily!</li>
            <li>Once its used a few more times, I&#x27;ll either upgrade the rating or comment below.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soooo tiny, and powerful.</li>
            <li>It is powerful enough for me, and has diffuser, too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good dryer for traveling and for my curly and thin hair since it doesn&#x27;t blow all over the place.</li>
            <li>It is small, powerful and came with a carrying case so very useful for traveling.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not hard to avoid that issue.</li>
            <li>if you would like your hair to have volume or look shiny or healthy or any other good adjective, then you, like me, have come to the wrong place.</li>
            <li>I towel dry, then heat-style it with the Conair Mighty Mini when most of my hair is dry (which, as my fellow fine-haired ladies know, does not take long at all).</li>
            <li>Can only be used on low here, but that&#x27;s fine as it&#x27;s for my trip to the US anyways.</li>
            <li>The blow dryer is very light and had good power but failed completely in less than 2 months.</li>
            <li>small- 5.5\\&quot; from intake end to nozzle, and 6\\&quot; from top to handle bottom + the ~1.5\\&quot; cord lead- doesn&#x27;t take up any more room than the few folding travel dryers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>It was even smaller than expected but every bit as powerful as a full sized unit.</li>
            <li>I then switched it on high, and within seconds it became red hot.  </li>
            <li>HIGH and both temperatures were the same: BOILING HOT.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t ever want to be without it, so this new one is my backup.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light weight, small, and</li>
            <li>small and very light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and easier to use than a big bulky one and blows my hair dry just as fast.</li>
            <li>It is slightly bigger than what I expected but generally ok.</li>
            <li>so I need a lot of heat to dry it quickly.</li>
            <li>Came with a cute little travel case too!</li>
            <li>Love this little hair dryer!</li>
            <li>I love this little dryer!</li>
            <li>I love this little thing!</li>
            <li>Love this little guy!</li>
            <li>I end up switching between low and high to build up some more heat, and only stick the diffuser into the roots of my hair so it doesn&#x27;t totally blow out</li>
            <li>The high speed is plenty strong enough to quickly dry my shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li>Powerful enough to get the job done, but because it does not put out as wide of a path of hot air as my big hair dryer it does not do the job quite as quickly and evenly as it.  </li>
            <li>very loud and have burning smell.</li>
            <li>Arrived right on time, performs very well, is quieter than expected and is compact for traveling</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight, small and easy for me to hold.</li>
            <li>I love how small it is, and yet it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I checked for other travel size type hair dryers, but found that many of them were too big and wouldn&#x27;t reach from a floor plug outlet up to the mirror because of the recoiled cord.  </li>
            <li>cheap but not worth the price.</li>
            <li>Not worth it for that use which was my primary reason for purchasing it.</li>
            <li>that is what I love about it small and compact and fits in your suitcase.</li>
            <li>and she cries that it is too hot even when it is on low...</li>
            <li>This was not exactly the same model, but I like it better.</li>
            <li>I am adding to this review, because I wrote the first part when I had only had the dryer for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>My problem with this hair dryer is that even on the low setting the air from the dryer is too hot.</li>
            <li>The first time I plugged it in (with an adapter), I double checked to ensure it was set to 220.  </li>
            <li>If you avidly blow-dry your hair get a bigger one.</li>
            <li>wow!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost cute, it&#x27;s so small,  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted 5 years, but it was only $15.00.</li>
            <li>but even so, the actual dryer, without the diffuser, is probably only about 7 inches from front to back, top to bottom.</li>
            <li>They get really hot on low setting.</li>
            <li>Better than the one I use usually at home</li>
            <li>Love the small size.  </li>
            <li>It works well for me - note that I have very fine hair, so if you have thick hair, it may not work as well.</li>
            <li>I thought perhaps it needed to cool down - some older model hairdryers used to do this but no, 15, 30,</li>
            <li>bonus - the Conair MIghty Mini takes a LOT less space in my drawer too.</li>
            <li>It does not come with a &#x27;cool shot&#x27; setting, which I thought would make achieving curls more difficult.</li>
            <li>It dried just as fast as my full size dryer.</li>
            <li>This little dryer is a little workhorse and is light and easy to use for our tween.  </li>
            <li>, the heat is high and the little motor is strong (just a little louder than a full sized).  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would be as good as my big, clunky, heavy dryer, but this little baby gets HOT, has a lower setting also.  </li>
            <li>It was quite powerful, and dried my hair in an equal amount of time as my full sized dryer at home.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Loud, not as powerful as a larger hair dryer, and my last one fried when someone used it on high while traveling in Peru.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product that will take up much less space and weight on future travels.</li>
            <li>I just followed the instructions and only used it on low (which was more than sufficient to blow dry my hair with)  </li>
            <li>She had previously been starting to want to try drying her own hair with my larger hair dryer, but it was too big/heavy for her to</li>
            <li>I do use this for everyday use and it has held up fine.</li>
            <li>I would even be fine with using it everyday.</li>
            <li>Small and extremely light-weight but packs a good amount of power.</li>
            <li>I was initially concerned that it might not hold up to daily use but 2 1/2 years later, the hair dryer is still going strong.</li>
            <li>Bought it to take on vacation in a travel trailer, but when my large dryer died I started to use this one daily.</li>
            <li>That said, the plastic is a little cheap looking but it works for what it is at its price point.</li>
            <li>This little hair dryer is indeed mighty.</li>
            <li>This little one has mighty power.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t ecstatic that the Infinity Mighty Mini dryer could only be run on Low on the 250V setting, but it turns out this dryer&#x27;s airflow on a 220V outlet blows ALMOST as strong as High on its 125V setting in a US outlet (where Low setting was pretty low, like a desktop heater)... at least in Iceland (220V/50Hz)</li>
            <li>Some reviewers were a little negative regarding the size of this blowdryer, but I thought it was great.  </li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s ridiculously tiny, it does a surprisingly good job of drying my (very) thick hair.  </li>
            <li>This little dryer works great, but a few words of advice if you are traveling outside of the US.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick wavy hair that takes a good 10-15 minutes to blow dry with a decent dryer.  </li>
            <li>Hot air and blows as much as any conventional sized blow dryer.</li>
            <li>It was a huge waste of money.  </li>
            <li>So believe the name, &amp;#34;MiniPRO.&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t purchase it to travel with, just because I dislike huge, heavy hair dryers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So maybe a great buy for travel within the US but am wary of giving it any stars for international travel.</li>
            <li>Turns out that it does the same great job that the expensive hair dryers do.</li>
            <li>so I could dry my Silky Terrier&#x27;s long fine hair after her bath.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 14 yr old daughter for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I have fine textured, prone to dryness hair that has taken me 50+ years &amp; no expense spared to tame it to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Solid so far-</li>
            <li>I bought this one for my 9 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>becuase my old travel one was shot.  </li>
            <li>and I took to Israel in early March.  </li>
            <li>With luggage weight and size restrictions I was trying to pack as lightly as possible and this blowdryer really helped with that.  </li>
            <li>Also purchased to use with Soft Hood Dryer attachment.  </li>
            <li>It also came with a zipper bag for travel, which was an unexpected surprise.  </li>
            <li>Our 5 year old daughter can use it being so lite.</li>
            <li>My 2 year old can handle it as it is lighter than her toy one.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, finally a hair dryer I can pack in my luggage that doesn&#x27;t weigh too much.</li>
            <li>does not have the power of a professional dryer</li>
            <li>It dries my hair as fast and my big one!</li>
            <li>My seven year old loves it.</li>
            <li>and I think it too is going to stop completely.</li>
            <li>I have one that its about 18 yrs old.</li>
            <li>like it belongs on a 30 year old.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the size of the hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>Seems great at first, but it&#x27;s not great for long hair unless your unnaturally careful while using it.</li>
            <li>But I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>My old hair dryer died.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 7 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t read the instructions and nearly blew it up</li>
            <li>Works very well on my short curly hair.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s dryer is about 30 years old and needed replacement.</li>
            <li>Conair wants me to ship it to Arizona at my expense and send them $7.00 to ship it back.  </li>
            <li>and it absolutely beats the standard hairdryers found in hotel rooms.  </li>
            <li>cause you know, natural hair needs to be straightened sometimes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been well over 15 years with my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li>People with much thicker hair may not find this has enough power.</li>
            <li>Without an adopter, you can not plug in this unit directly into the wall receptacle.  </li>
            <li>Seemed to work very well for a small dryer and strong enough for 1200 watts.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give t to a little girl instead of the adult I originally purchased it for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cute and improbable, like a Barbie-doll toy hairdryer in very pink plastic, just like its picture online in its box, complete with miniature pink plastic diffuser &amp; concentrator.</li>
            <li>It is small, lightweight, and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>small size makes it easy to hold and use.  </li>
            <li>It is very light and small, infact smaller than a fold-able hair dryer.</li>
            <li>The low setting does not generate quite enough heat, but the high setting has too much air flow.</li>
            <li>It does dry my hair very quickly for a small dryer, but I do have super short, :pixie: type hair.</li>
            <li>Be warned, the pink isn&#x27;t displayed in the picture, but it is a bright version of dark pink.</li>
            <li>Quite small and light, yet powerful and not very noisy.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is indeed very small - be sure to note the dimensions.</li>
            <li>It is plenty powerful and plenty pink!</li>
            <li>Thanks to this blowdryer, I&#x27;m actually taking care of my fragile hair live</li>
            <li>But the diffuser does not slow down the air flow very much, and on top of that, the diffuser is SO TINY -- no more than 3 inches in diameter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and works just fine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it would be powerful enough for long hair.</li>
            <li>In fact, the small diffuser has actually given me more targeted control when drying my hair.  </li>
            <li>got the older blue Conair travel hairdryer, can&#x27;t remember the name</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seriously never going back to a full-size dryer again.</li>
            <li>My stepdaughter has long medium hair and it dried her pretty quick as well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it will last as long as my other one I had for many years</li>
            <li>I have only used it about 2 weeks, but I hope it lasts as long as my other favorite blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I style my hair with a round brush and a blow dryer and had been using a tiny OLD travel one because the large hair dryers are too strong for my thin, fine hair - literally blew it out of the brush, and I could not use them.</li>
            <li>there are two wind settings high and low and 2 temp settings</li>
            <li>(Even 1875 Watts, which is the standard, is too high.)</li>
            <li>It has a low and high speed.  </li>
            <li>I have a Kill-A-Watt&#x27;s meter to test the house wattage, and this hair dryer reads 981 watts on high and 255 watts on low setting.  </li>
            <li>I do have to say that in some hotels and countries, I cannot use the high setting, I have to use the low setting otherwise the hairdryer will over heat.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not looking for anything fancy, travel quite a bit and want a dryer for basic hair-drying needs, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The high setting gets much too hot to use as well as blowing hard.</li>
            <li>This little hair dryer works better than my regular big dryer.  </li>
            <li>dryer did overheat a few times when using it on 220V with an adapter in Europe, but I think as long as you are conscious about not using it on high setting for too long, it should be OK.</li>
            <li>This is a very decent little hair dryer: very inexpensive, two speeds and heats, but it packs punch for its size.</li>
            <li>It seems well built and is light but not as small as I thought.</li>
            <li>Small and light weight yet does the job.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a blow dryer that was small and light weight to for in my suitcase.</li>
            <li>(I have long, very textured, wavy hair)</li>
            <li>This is so small and light.</li>
            <li>Space saver and just as powerful as an average size hair dryer.</li>
            <li>the full size driers are a bit heavy for her.  </li>
            <li>but I can live without it for he price I paid—although I see it&#x27;s come down in price a little bit which makes it a better value.  </li>
            <li>Drys quickly then slips into its little carrying case.</li>
            <li>It is only 1200 so works more slowly and runs a little hotter than the full size</li>
            <li>I find it easy to use and the low setting is just right for my hair, it hardly takes any time at all for my hair to dry at that setting.</li>
            <li>It does the job even on the low setting, and my hair is very long and fine and takes forever to dry.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic little hair dryer I bought for my trip later this year.</li>
            <li>Though I knew it was a \\&quot;travel\\&quot; hair dryer, I just wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so tiny and feel, well, a little on the cheap side.</li>
            <li>Wow this little dryer is quite powerful.  </li>
            <li>This little unit has much better deying power than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful for a small hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful for a small hair dryer.</li>
            <li>high and 5 ¾&amp;#34; long) and lighter in weight than my old dryer, all reasons why I picked the Infiniti.  </li>
            <li>For such  a small dryer, it packs a lot of power, and barely takes much longer than my full size dryer, to to it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>Especially if you flip your head upside down to dry it, you lose even more control.</li>
            <li>This little hair dryer was exactly what I was looking for, small, easy to travel with, and not too loud.  </li>
            <li>It gets very hot, and there is plenty of power in this teeny little package.</li>
            <li>It works very well,  The weight was fine, but I expected it to be a little smaller since I was looking for something that would easily fit into a small carry on bag.</li>
            <li>Compact, dry hair fast.</li>
            <li>I wanted to dry my hair as I styled it and the 1800 watt dryers blow my hair too much.  </li>
            <li>She has thick, curly hair, and she&#x27;s been able to dry it in a reasonable amount of time-- no longer than it takes with my larger dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The two models look very similar - I would think they are the same unless I look very closely at the picture.</li>
            <li>I have medium length hair and it dried quickly even on the lower setting.</li>
            <li>I wish the low setting had more power behind it because I feel like high</li>
            <li>It is small but powerful enough to dry hair quickly.</li>
            <li>does to keep the hair from being sucked in the back of it (most women know what I mean)</li>
            <li>It gets really hot (but not so hot that it has singed my hair or anything), and it has a lot of power for such a small blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised by how small and light this hair dryer is that when I received it in the mail I considered immediately sending it back.</li>
            <li>That can become a major problem.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s an improvement that holds up all day, even in the dry winter air that usually leads to static.</li>
            <li>I wish it were some other color (not a huge fan of pink), but I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very small and lightweight so she can easily hold it.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised, even a little amazed at the improved body &amp; texture of my hair the first time I used this dryer.</li>
            <li>I have thin fine hair and it is gentle enough on my hair and gives me the volume</li>
            <li>It has as much blowing/heat power as my old one (huge/clunky), but I still think it takes slightly longer to dry my hair just because the size of the dryer itself doesn&#x27;t allow as much air to blow at once.</li>
            <li>Wish it had an intermediate setting (only low and high).</li>
            <li>Personally I only need the 2 settings: high or low.</li>
            <li>It only has a high and a low setting -</li>
            <li>If you only use the low setting OR if you don&#x27;t care about your hair being fried on High, then it might work for you.</li>
            <li>It has two speeds, high and low but only one heat temperature.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a low and high setting and comes with a couple equally tiny attachments.</li>
            <li>The high setting is a bit loud, the heat a bit too intense, but it&#x27;s small size and dual voltage make up for these issues.</li>
            <li>Small and light enough to keep in my gym bag.</li>
            <li>My old one finally died.</li>
            <li>Once again something I couldn&#x27;t find on store shelves when my old one finally burned out, and once again a seller on Amazon came to the rescue, ordered 2</li>
            <li>Because I travel frequently I ordered a second dryer to keep in my traveling bag.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not that big of a deal because the low setting is still EXTREMELY powerful and drys my hair in a matter of minutes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact and sturdy and comes with a nice storage bag, so it works well for my purposes, but it&#x27;s probably on the small side for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I usually have to take my full size $$$$ hair dryer on vacation because the ones at hotels are wimpy.</li>
            <li>the biggest problem I have is that unlike a full size hairdryer, a few hairs can get sucked into the back end and get all burned up</li>
            <li>Even though it is not that powerful, it dries my hair in a few minutes.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and the right size for her little hands.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right size, does the job and comes with a kicky little zebra-striped bag.  </li>
            <li>It dries hair fairly quickly, but I&#x27;ve had other travel dryers dry quicker.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful for such a small blow dryer.</li>
            <li>easy to travel with it.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing wrong, except that I don&#x27;t really know how tu use the accesorizes...&lt;br /&gt;Sure</li>
            <li>The high setting is a little too high and makes my thin hair incredibly frizzy and unmanageable while the low setting is a little too low and takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have a folding handle, but it is still super small.  </li>
            <li>It is super small</li>
            <li>I always use it on low; haven&#x27;t even tried it on high, as it has enough power for my hair on low.  </li>
            <li>Wonderfully small and pretty hot pink color.</li>
            <li>I wanted the blow dryer to double for daily use and travel, so my items can be useful in all ways and save space since I live in a small home.  </li>
            <li>She called it a &amp;#34;Barbie&amp;#34; styling tool, due to it&#x27;s very compact size and vibrant pink color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always a possibility that long hair can get sucked into the back end of a hair dryer, but because of the extremely small size, it happens extremely easily with this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s louder than T3&#x27;s old model travel blow dryer but less high pitched than Babyliss.  </li>
            <li>So, if you are occasionally clumsy like me, perhaps consider a different product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a new one right away</li>
            <li>It takes my full size hairdryer about 8 minutes to pretty thoroughly dry my hair, and I&#x27;d say this little guy only takes slightly longer.  </li>
            <li>I use it nearly every day on fairly long hair.</li>
            <li>Small yet powerful.</li>
            <li>Small, portable, and powerful.  </li>
            <li>Small but quite powerful.</li>
            <li>She loves that it is small, yet powerful.</li>
            <li>Small but powerful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as powerful as ones I&#x27;ve had in the past</li>
            <li>This is a small powerful hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Small but powerful.</li>
            <li>It is small but still compact an powerful.</li>
            <li>I had read the reviews saying this blow dryer was small, yet powerful.  </li>
            <li>Small but powerful.  </li>
            <li>Small but powerful.  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s still a bit too powerful for me, it serves my purpose, as it is small and lightweight.</li>
            <li>It is quite powerful for being so small but drys my hair in no time at all.</li>
            <li>small and compact but powerful</li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t turn it down much.</li>
            <li>I bought this particular dryer due to the size and the dual voltage aspect as we will be traveling to Europe</li>
            <li>It makes styling my hair pretty darn easy (and I have difficult hair!).</li>
            <li>The squeaky clicks of folding travel dryers always makes me wonder if the next snap might means a chewed/caught cord or broken joint, so I&#x27;m stoked about the solid-state handle on this dryer, even if it takes more flat space-</li>
            <li>Just right for small hands</li>
            <li>3/4 finished with a blow dry,  hair soft waves and</li>
            <li>This small hair dryer so far seems to be working very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, but definitely powerful enough.</li>
            <li>really powerful for such a small hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how powerful the hair dryer is for such a small product.  </li>
            <li>This thing definitely packs a powerful punch for being so small.</li>
            <li>I have long thick hair, and while it dried most of my hair in pretty decent time, I don&#x27;t even want to think about how long it would have taken me to actually blow it out with a round brush.</li>
            <li>I truly wish it had held up longer; given the short experience I had with it, it was great, but the lack of durability left me utterly disappointed.</li>
            <li>It does dry my rather thick hair pretty decently and gives a bit of body but don&#x27;t expect salon type effects with this one  </li>
            <li>I just bought this dryer for the lower watts &amp; small size, because the standard sized power-monsters blow the shape right out of my cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This little dryer takes virtually no space in your luggage and is powerful enough to dry your hair in just minutes.  </li>
            <li>This tiny hair dryer has a lot of power behind it; fits well into the vanity drawer; and easily packed for travel.</li>
            <li>Takes longer to dry my hair (which I expected due to less wattage) and it makes my hair more frizzy (which I did not expect).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like a large, heavy hairdryer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that women with thin, fine hair need to use hairdryers with low wattage -- like, 1200 to 1500.</li>
            <li>Needed to get a less powerful blow dryer when I moved to a place with crappy outlets that were killing my other dryers.</li>
            <li>I also forget to switch the switch down instead of up for high.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product for my 8 year old daughter who is really into styling her hair herself lately.</li>

            <li> This hairdryer is amazing for its size.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s amazing for its size</li>
            <li> She liked the bag that it came with</li>
            <li> 2 stars because it had a nice price</li>
            <li> This comes in it&#x27;s own travel bag too.</li>
            <li> It comes with a handy travel case.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made and comes with a handy carrying bag.</li>
            <li> Comes with a storage bag, which is nice too.</li>
            <li> because I like to use my own hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Nice and lightweight.</li>
            <li> Also comes with black/white storage bag which is kinda nice.</li>
            <li> it still dries nicely but does not stress my hair.</li>
            <li> This dryer is keeping my hair so nice people ask me how I make my hair&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives my hair nice &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Hairdryer stopped blowing warm air about a month after the warranty expired.</li>
            <li> Nice for travel.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own zebra bag for storage.  </li>
            <li> The curl-infuser thing is also really handy for getting to my roots, even though I don&#x27;t need it for curls.</li>
            <li> These were loving nicknames, though, as it did all we asked of it.  </li>
            <li> The attachments (though I never use them) are a nice addition as well.  </li>
            <li> It comes with attachments, but they&#x27;re kind of a joke.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice hair dryer, does the job</li>
            <li> Reasonable price, traveling case and attachments, very happy!</li>
            <li> nice heat and airflow.</li>
            <li> Nice compact design.</li>
            <li> great size, lots of power, perfect size, great price, love the extras, but don&#x27;t care for pink!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very powerful for its size and does a great job.</li>
            <li> The first one overheated after 3-5 minutes of use, I was able to exchange it with the vendor, and the replacement unit seems to work perfectly.  </li>
            <li> It is the perfect weight, it is cute, it perfectly in her little hands, she loves it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect the power from a full size dryer but this works great as a mini dryer for traveling.</li>
            <li> I really do think that the combination of letting most of my hair air-dry and then using a low-wattage hairdryer like this awesome Conair one is what is saving my hair.</li>
            <li> Good value and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is compact, so it is very easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> So cute and small, perfect for traveling but with great power!</li>
            <li> I love it for travel, comes with a nice carry bag.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t use them, but for a travel kit, this is ideal.</li>
            <li> Traveling a lot for work, this is great for on-the-go compact and powerful hair-drying products.</li>
            <li> and I liked it, but this one is way better.</li>
            <li> Perfect for My 6 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li> Love it nice for travel</li>
            <li> So cute and perfect for 6 year old granddaughter as she starts to care for her own hair</li>
            <li> The cute carrying bag is a nice bonus</li>
            <li> Way too cute and works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> For its size I am amazed at the &amp;#34;horsepower&amp;#34; :) The velocity and heat that comes from this thing is amazing and puts full-sized hair dryers to shame.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, works better than my full size blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as a full sized hair dryer even though it is the size of a toy!!</li>
            <li> Works great, light weight and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> This is not as strong as they said BUT it&#x27;s stronger than most hotel and resort dryers so still a good purchase.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t taken it out of the country yet but as of right now it&#x27;s worked great.</li>
            <li> but it is very fine.</li>
            <li> my hair is very fine and gets staticy</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and lots of it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to find a travel dryer with a concentrator, but to find one with both is a winner!  </li>
            <li> have very fine hair that dries in about 5-7 minutes with this dryer, so it does the trick for me.</li>
            <li> and I hope to be able to use it for many more years to come!</li>
            <li> This little hair dryer was perfect for my needs and does a great job of drying my hair and not making it frizzy as well.  </li>
            <li> Cute and perfect size for my 7-year old daughter.</li>
            <li> So far I love it, the size and weight are perfect.</li>
            <li> This is a great everyday dryer, as well as perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> However, it is cute and very easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> but I have to say I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great first hair dryer for my teenager.</li>
            <li> It is a good traveling size, just wish it had a cool setting.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my purposes (travel light) and good enough to use at home.</li>
            <li> but it is usable  Very light and feels flimsy.  </li>
            <li> Very light weight.  </li>
            <li> Awesome small and compact great for traveling.</li>
            <li> It comes with it&#x27;s own travel bag and packs easily.  </li>
            <li> works super good.  </li>
            <li> Nice lite and easy to pack</li>
            <li> It has pretty good power and the travel case was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Nice and compact and easy to pack.</li>

            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really safe, and convenient.</li>
            <li> Love the zebra carrying bag too.</li>
            <li> OK, whatever.</li>
            <li> I bought it to fit in my carry-on luggage, which it does nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying another one, because I can&#x27;t find a better hair dryer that suits my needs.  </li>
            <li> Nice and light</li>
            <li> I have very short hair and travel often, this is the perfect balance for power and size.</li>
            <li> I just love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Love the zebra print zipper pouch it comes with.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Who could ask for more?</li>
            <li> It should have had a better description in the specs.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much and found a great product.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t have asked for more.</li>
            <li> But I bought this for the weight and it is light weight!</li>
            <li> And I love the color.</li>
            <li> Not terribly noisy either.</li>
            <li> this hair dryer is so cute</li>
            <li> Love.  </li>
            <li> I already have one - love it and use it every day.  </li>
            <li> Folds, and takes up 1/3 the space though, and comes with a cute case, and 2 attachments</li>
            <li> I like it but dont love it</li>
            <li> And the carrying bag just makes it that much better.</li>
            <li> I love the color.  </li>
            <li> It has more than one setting, worked well for me in Ireland, Scotland and England as well as the US.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I tried it in the U. S. to make sure it worked.  </li>
            <li> I have used it several times and am impressed.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s more of an inconvenience than a product defect, however.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I have had it for about 6 months now and still love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love it because it&#x27;s like a package, with a zipping bag.</li>
            <li> couldnt be happier :-)</li>
            <li> Looking for that perfect travel companion hair dryer, then look no further.  </li>
            <li> Today, most hotels have dryers, but if you have this with you, you don&#x27;t have to worry about</li>
            <li> It is also perfect for her hair on low.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was pleased with the price.  </li>
            <li> I took this to Bolivia with me for 3 months, and was able to use it 90% of the time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely cute and Barbie-like.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Be sure to check out the size before you order.</li>
            <li> If traveling internationally be sure to read and follow the instructions or you could fry it.</li>
            <li> Cute travel bag, too.</li>
            <li> Comes with cute bag and diffuser.</li>
            <li> It come in a cute bag tool</li>
            <li> and I was sure it wasn&#x27;t going to work out for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute, convenient and efficient.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is said to be dual voltage, so HYPOTHETICALLY you should be able to use it in Europe.</li>
            <li> love how my hair comes out after using this.  </li>
            <li> satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall quite satisfied with the dryer.</li>
            <li> that I use it at home every day :)</li>
            <li> This is an okay product.</li>
            <li> I love the size and the results it gives me.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly light and effective for drying my hair.</li>
            <li> It is more pinkish color.</li>
            <li> Yup ppl, size doesn&#x27;t matter :-)</li>
            <li> I feel that it is def worth the price, its light and great for traveling, much better then using those \\&quot;Hotel stuck to the wall hair dryers!\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I love my light weight hair blower !  </li>
            <li> It is, however, without a doubt, the most adorable hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> I love the size and the bag it comes with.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, f you&#x27;re planning on using this thing for more than a weekend, and/or you care about your hair at all, do not get this product.</li>
            <li> I love this drier.</li>
            <li> I am ok with that.</li>
            <li> It works better and faster than any dryer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I really love about this dryer is the diffuser.  </li>
            <li> (so many dryers are much more).  </li>
            <li> It is powerful and the accessories and cute bag are a good way for me to teach her how to organize her beauty regime.</li>
            <li> This is one of my wife&#x27;s favorite presents.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like taking up a lot of precious counter space.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> This is completely adorable and comes in a zebra striped bag.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a satisfied customer :)</li>
            <li> I have used this every day for several months and it is great!</li>
            <li> The package comes with a directional nozzle, a diffuser, and a cute zebra bag.</li>
            <li> Will buy again and recommend it to the ladies :-)</li>
            <li> I am giving it 1 star, since I can&#x27;t seem to be able to choose 0.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the Babyliss hairdryer I had for many years.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> This is now my favorite hair dryer.</li>
            <li> With most hairdryers, my hair frizzes up.</li>
            <li> With this one, it comes out softer and more managable.</li>
            <li> What more could a person want for drying hair?</li>
            <li> Of course, for $15 I guess it should feel cheap!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer and don&#x27;t mind using it, as it doesn&#x27;t hurt my hand at all.</li>
            <li> I love the travel bag that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Comes in a cute zebra print zippered bag too.</li>
            <li> Love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Love the color.</li>
            <li> excellent total package.</li>
            <li> This thing is tiny, and is a perfect size for travel.</li>
            <li> It is very powerful for its size and comes with a nice bag and accessories.</li>
            <li> Very powerful too!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s SUPER stylish too!</li>
            <li> The super cute tote bag is a plus!  </li>
            <li> Nice compact size, but nothing special about it.  </li>
            <li> This is a good little unit, perfect for travel or light use.  </li>
            <li> I love the bag which is stylish and easily holds all the accessories plus the dryer without problems.  </li>
            <li> My mom tried it and loved it so much that she got one too!</li>
            <li> I always take my full size blow dryer even to nice hotels where I know they will have a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> It has pretty good power to it.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a pretty good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> And, yes, someone said this is not the best dryer for long hair -- that person spoke the truth.</li>
            <li> All in all this is a great little blowdryer and great for travel.</li>
            <li> She is able to handle it easily and even though I still have to watch her and help with the use of a hairbrush, she is well on her way to independence.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying using this for my travel size hair dryer--it is so perfect and takes up absolutely no room at all.  </li>
            <li> Very surprised and happy to have found this for traveling.</li>
            <li> The MiniPro is super tiny and looks like it could be for a doll, but surprisingly works great for me.</li>
            <li> Works fine but at their higher price no longer a good buy</li>
            <li> Quite small but very good quality and good power.</li>
            <li> Love the light weight and ease to hold.  </li>
            <li> As far as the product is concerned, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> It is a really cheap dryer and that is OK too because I didn&#x27;t buy it for drying hair.</li>
            <li> Cute but cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It works great so far for it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Good quality, I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I loved this product so much I bought one for a gift.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a real nice product overall.</li>
            <li> It is powerful &amp; effective for my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> and it is nice and powerful</li>
            <li> I do love how it is so light and easy to use though.</li>
            <li> Good strong blow power and fast drying</li>
            <li> I am very happy with it and the cute little storage bag that it came with.</li>
            <li> Petit, cute, powerful!</li>
            <li> Compact and easy to use</li>
            <li> I like the fact that its so light, but it almost feels cheap its so light!</li>
            <li> needed a dryer lite and easy to use for when we travel and this did the trick.  </li>
            <li> Its compactness makes it easy to pack for travel.</li>

            <li> this hair dryer is nice and light and easy for me to handle...works good especially since I have arthritis in my hands</li>
            <li> It is the perfect size for her when she gets older to dry her own hair.</li>
            <li> but when there&#x27;s time I let it cool off to be safe).</li>
            <li> This is so lightweight yet is works just as good as my normal size dryer.</li>
            <li> Works even better than my full sized one.</li>

            <li> I have fine hair but a lot of it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a lightweight, compact hair dryer with accessories like a defuser, but don&#x27;t buy into the line that it&#x27;s as powerful as a full sized hair dryer, as it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair though.</li>
            <li> But it would be easy to fit in a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Power is more than adequate for my usage.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t turn it off and put it on the counter to quickly move my clip to pull out more hair, it falls off from the air pushing against the wall.  </li>
            <li> Super cute an stylish an super durable.</li>
            <li> It is quick!</li>
            <li> It would be more helpful it had a warm and a hot temperature, but for the price it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light weight but powerful.</li>
            <li> Very light weight yet powerful for its size.</li>
            <li> (she&#x27;s full Japanese) and we both loved it!  </li>
            <li> Perfect size for little hands.  </li>
            <li> This little blowdryer is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> So this little guy seemed perfect.</li>
            <li> Best little travel dryer with plenty of power......</li>
            <li> This little baby is awesome!</li>
            <li> The original is still going strong after a couple of years.  </li>
            <li> Unless you have a huge purse.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re huge and over-sized, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer with dual wattage for international travel.  </li>
            <li> It feels so cheap</li>
            <li> very convenient to use and effective.</li>
            <li> And it is extremely light, not tiring on the arms.</li>
            <li> Its light.</li>
            <li> The zebra carrying case just adds to the fun. : )  </li>
            <li> All we needed was a cheap plug adapter- no need for step up/down converters, wattage limits, fuses that could blow the rest of your trip- esp for things like hairdryers.</li>
            <li> Its a simple dryer but its great</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s structurally cheaply made and often feels like it&#x27;s going to fall apart while I&#x27;m using it which makes me nervous</li>
            <li> Considering the unit can fit in the palm of your hand</li>
            <li> The Conair Mighty Mini Styler performs as described.</li>
            <li> so light while blowdrying my hair.  </li>
            <li> Or maybe you can get crafty and block some of the holes in the diffuser...</li>
            <li> Great for travel &amp; home use since I have short hair!</li>
            <li> I liked it so much I bought one for myself as well.</li>
            <li> This dryer is just cheap.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, lightweight, plasticky feeling.  </li>
            <li> No way this will fit in a purse like they say.</li>
            <li> I decided to research smaller hair dryers &amp; this one looked great.</li>
            <li> looks kindda cheap</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also very lightweight which is nice too.</li>
            <li> is important to consider is to touch the hair.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer works well, and it is so light weight that the plug weighs about what the dryer does.</li>
            <li> Looks and feels cheap.  </li>
            <li> This really fit the bill.</li>
            <li> nice size  didn&#x27;t take up much room in my luggage</li>
            <li> The Infiniti by Conair Mighty Mini Tourmaline Ceramic Styler has traveled to many countries with me thanks to the ability to change voltage and is my favorite travel hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> cheap and works well for what it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for years for a smaller hair dryer and this one is great.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest, if we really &amp;#34;need&amp;#34; to use our diffuser while traveling, we would find a way to schlep our full-sized dryer w/ diffuser attachment with us on our trip.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li> This one certainly fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> Cheap.  </li>
            <li> Great for international travel</li>
            <li> Compact and light for the suitcase.  </li>
            <li> The nozzle tip stays on nicely and the fast speed dries my hair quicker than ever before.</li>
            <li> Light weight</li>
            <li> It works great, no problems, but it is TINY!</li>
            <li> Its light..</li>
            <li> All in all, if you&#x27;re using this hairdryer for travel only, it is a great size and does the job.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer seems to be of good quality so far, but the color is deceiving by the picture.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by it&#x27;s size though, very powerful for a low-watt dryer.</li>
            <li> Fits her hands perfect, Mini and Mighty, she uses the low setting, the high setting is very powerful.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel, small for ease of packing, light weight to handle yet dries efficiently</li>
            <li> It is super lightweight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> makes hair styling very easy and fast.</li>
            <li> SUPER tiny but works great.</li>
            <li> My hair dried quickly and the diffuser worked great with my curly hair!</li>
            <li> A mini dryer that does a powerful job!</li>
            <li> Not disappointed.</li>
            <li> excellent product for being so small.  </li>
            <li> With that in mind, the only thing that would have made this an even better dryer is if it had a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button, however if there were more features on this dryer it may not be able to be as compact and lightweight as it is and would defeat the reason why I purchased it.</li>
            <li> It would also be perfect for traveling because it&#x27;s so small, but POWERFUL!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased it as a Christmas gift for my 9-year-old daughter.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought the bag was just more of the over packaging</li>
            <li> When I originally ordered it, on Amazon it said &amp;#34;color may vary.&amp;#34;  I joked with a friend &amp;#34;watch...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so small and perfect in my purse with my mini straightener (comes with zebra bag and pieces)</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for use when traveling</li>
            <li> it is so powerful!</li>
            <li> I rather pay more for a higher quality product.</li>
            <li> love it that much!</li>
            <li> It is soooo small and perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> For a small, compact hair dryer its great for traveling!</li>
            <li> Unbelievably lightweight - great for travel!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the purchase so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad noisy in the high mode, but I love how light and easy to use it is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for traveling and comes with an adorable little pouch.</li>
            <li> so I could control the shaping of my bangs a little better, but all in all this is a great dryer.</li>
            <li> Powerful little dryer was perfect on our overseas trip.  </li>
            <li> Great hair dryer to dry my toddler&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> It is super light weight.</li>
            <li> A good choice for younger girls who are starting to spend more time in the bathroom styling their hair!  :)</li>
            <li> For a little guy, it does a very good job.</li>
            <li> Works well and super small, perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> A great little travel hair dryer, very light yet powerful.</li>
            <li> It is very light weight and small which will work great for traveling.</li>
            <li> I had a great little travel dryer that worked great for years until it recently just died on me.</li>
            <li> Never going back to the heavier kind -- gave that one away to my daughter who still has some hand strength and a very full head of hair</li>
            <li> had good reviews but certainly didn&#x27;t live up to them..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been able to work it on the 250 setting here in Australia, but it seems great so far.</li>
            <li> Bought this so that my 9 year old could begin drying her own hair.  </li>
            <li> I still prefer the beastier full size....its faster.</li>
            <li> My last conair hairdryer lasted a good 15+ years.</li>
            <li> It stays true to it&#x27;s name as it is indeed mini, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy this if I have thicker hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice that on low it has a nice gentle blow speed and temperature.</li>
            <li> She thought it was cool.</li>
            <li> And indeed I am glad I did not spend much on this one.  </li>
            <li> but I have really been thankful for it because it keeps the wires safe in my gym bag</li>
            <li> It fulfills our needs very well and it has a cute color.</li>
            <li> Folding handle was good, but too big for my use.</li>
            <li> Does a good job for such a compact dryer</li>
            <li> loving it so far</li>
            <li> Bought as a travel dryer, but it&#x27;s so light and powerful</li>
            <li> This one is just as good as the big ones.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a cool setting</li>
            <li> I travel for vacation at least once a year and am never that impressed with the blow dryers the hotels provide.  </li>
            <li> It would be really nice for a young girl.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh a thing, takes up no space and works just as well as full size dryers.  </li>
            <li> It does such a good job that I forget that it is travel size.</li>
            <li> it really doesn&#x27;t diffuse anything as most of the air is at full force.</li>
            <li> She enjoys being able to dry her own hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite part, its pink :)!</li>
            <li> This is VERY small - but for me, it was perfect, because I wanted &amp;#34;small</li>
            <li> It quickly dries even a lot of Hair.</li>
            <li> Dries hair fairly quickly for a mini dryer.</li>
            <li> My old travel dryer was a bit heavier, but it folded and fit better in my luggage.</li>
            <li> their are WAY better deals on amazon for the same size with lower prices and better brands.</li>
            <li> Works quickly in drying my sweaty hair from working out.</li>
            <li> Shipper got them to me quickly.</li>
            <li> It puts out a forceful flow of air, dries her shoulder length hair quickly and fits snugly in her gym bag</li>
            <li> It quickly became my go-to hairdryer</li>
            <li> My hair dries quickly with no frizz.</li>
            <li> quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Might be OK if you have very strong tight curls that don&#x27;t get blown out as easily.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t purchase as it is clearly cheaply made, and won&#x27;t even hold up to minimal use for a full three months!!!  </li>
            <li> The cord is nice and long and the attachments stay on easily.</li>
            <li> After using the Mighty Mini for a couple of weeks now, I&#x27;ve been able to maintain healthy-looking ends, which is a huge achievement for my fragile hair.</li>
            <li> it got very hot and stopped working.  </li>
            <li> It works great, even better than my regular, larger hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic and a pretty color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, powerful, but the hot setting is TOO HOT</li>
            <li> I guess it could be a nice gift for a 6 year old or like a kid that&#x27;s just starting to do their own hair.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s well worth it as it takes up about 1/3 of the space my full sized dryer uses.</li>
            <li> High powered and compact, it is the perfect little travel blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> It would be easy to carry in a suitcase or even a large purse, if you have the strength to do so.</li>
            <li> It dries her hair quickly without causing the blow drying damage ususally seen with super powerful dryers.  </li>
            <li> Very lightweight, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Were surprised as to the small size, but yet the output was as good, or better, than most full size hair dryers.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is really perfect for short hair, and a quick blow dry.</li>
            <li> Since I have a lot of very fine, straight hair, which is shoulder blade length, it doesn&#x27;t take much blowing air to tangle my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got plenty of power in an extremely lightweight package, ideal for older, arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> Its little and so cute! makes adorable gifts    </li>
            <li> Better than my old one and prettier too!</li>
            <li> When I first opened this hair dryer, I was quite dismayed!  </li>
            <li> The first time it sucked some hair up, it lost significant drying force.</li>
            <li> It most definitely is not this color or this size, but it&#x27;s easy to travel with and it work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s more powerful than my regular diffuser!</li>
            <li> It does have strong airflow for such a tiny dryer, which is great for non-curly purposes.  </li>
            <li> The storage pouch is very handy to keep counters less cluttered.  </li>
            <li> Mini and cute even not exactly the same color, still beautiful</li>
            <li> This is a great little dryer.  </li>
            <li> Great little hair dryer for the money.</li>
            <li> However, because the size is so tiny and light weight it makes styling so much easier and therefore our hair looks better than ever!  </li>
            <li> Great little dryer.  </li>
            <li> Great little hair dryer for traveling with.</li>
            <li> This a great little travel hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Great little hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Works great for little hands.</li>
            <li> This is a great little hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Great little blow dryer</li>
            <li> This little dryer is great.</li>
            <li> All around, I&#x27;m really happy with this little guy.</li>
            <li> Great little dryer for travel</li>
            <li> Great, small, light and does exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> What I was expecting was a bright pink hairdryer with a zebra stripe carrying case.  </li>
            <li> just takes up too much room when trying to pack light.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We received the bright pink dryer with the zebra case, as pictured.  </li>
            <li> Between its size and bright pink colour, it reminded me of a Barbie beauty toy</li>
            <li> This is a nice tiny size for traveling, but I returned it because it does not have a &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; button.</li>
            <li> My younger daughter wanted her own dryer</li>
            <li> I thought she&#x27;d get a kick out of having her own dryer and it would be easier for her to use since it was smaller.</li>
            <li> I really liked this but only got to use it 3</li>
            <li> I only rated it one star because the color was nice.</li>
            <li> I did have to laugh at something.  </li>
            <li> It is lightweight, but powerful.</li>
            <li> Works well so far but feels cheaply made (light plastic).</li>
            <li> but it is well worth</li>
            <li> but still way too warm for a &#x27;low&#x27; setting.</li>
            <li> Its been a week I received this hair dryer and so far I am satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> lightweight yet powerful.  </li>
            <li> a naturally wavy/curly, chin length bob and this dryer was able to maintain that well on a 10 day trip to Europe.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t expecting a powerful machine.</li>
            <li> Love the size, love the color, it even has a slow speed that gives off an appropriate amount of heat.</li>
            <li> and I did&#x27;t want a powerful blowdryer that blows out all of my curls.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe how powerful it is.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the $15</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on vacation in Europe, because my blow dryer is too powerful.</li>
            <li> Definatly worth it.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as others led me to believe.</li>
            <li> but it worked really well internationally, this brand seems to be good at dual voltage.  </li>
            <li> I use it to do her hair and occasionally she uses it to do her own hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as powerful as a full-size but without the weight and bulk.</li>
            <li> Was quite powerful</li>
            <li> Love the size &amp; power of this mighty mini...especially appreciate the diffuser because I have short hair and most dryers are far too powerful.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a lightweight, easy to use blow dryer with a diffuser at a decent price</li>
            <li> but this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Love that it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space and love that it&#x27;s pink.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a powerful hair dryer considering its size, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> The diffuser add-on is also useful.</li>
            <li> Powerful but lightweight</li>
            <li> Good,but not as powerful as I hoped.  </li>
            <li> It is very tiny compared to most hairdryers, but still very worth it.</li>
            <li> Very nice little hair dryer for the money.</li>
            <li> Very nice little bag too</li>
            <li> It is small, comes with it&#x27;s own zipper storage bag and is very light weight.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love it and hope it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It is quick and easy and my hair comes out so soft and not frizzy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Works great, has alot of power for a little thing  pretty color also</li>
            <li> Good for travel but not exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use hot rollers anymore because I can more readily control the direction of air on my hair with each stroke much like my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> just wish t had a flat diffuser without the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; — I used to have that kind and prefer it.</li>
            <li> It is especially great for younger girls because it is small and light.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is just the right size for my motor home.</li>
            <li> , the price is right.</li>
            <li> I plugged it in Turkey and it blew out right away, so I didn&#x27;t have a hair dryer during my stay there.</li>
            <li> This one is just right.  </li>
            <li> is just right for finishing touches.</li>
            <li> Let me just say that this is the most amazing small hair dryer that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that would make this better would be if they could include a &#x27;cool&#x27; setting, but for the price I paid, I&#x27;m not complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great little hair dryer!</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t already have a great hair dryer for home use, I&#x27;d probably use it at home, because it takes up so little room!</li>
            <li> this overheats very easily and actually quit working after 3 uses.  </li>
            <li> This little blow dryer is amazing!</li>
            <li> It has a little carrying case too that is nice for the price!</li>
            <li> Great to start with but broke after 5 months with very little use</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel or for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to take up half their space with storing some of the big hair dryers.</li>
            <li> Very compact, easy for travel packing, and works very well.</li>
            <li> 1875 watt dryer I use at home, but adequate and my hair looks better than I&#x27;d expect with a travel dryer, and it&#x27;s certainly a massive improvement over anything you&#x27;d find in a hotel room.  </li>
            <li> great product for how small it is.</li>
            <li> It also has great power for a small machine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very powerful when set to high.</li>
            <li> For as small as this baby is, it does a great job of drying hair.  </li>
            <li> It is quite small but does a great job drying.</li>
            <li> It looks like a toy because it is so small but does a great job.  </li>
            <li> SOMEWHAT better than others its size; though still blows very hot, (almost to Hot on the Low setting); but is useful for Travel</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is not only the perfect size for travel, or little people (just learning how to use one)</li>
            <li> It is also cheap and comes with a little bag to put it in, though my baby has took it as her own along with the dryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is pretty tiny but it works perfectly for my 10 year old daughter who can&#x27;t quite use a regular size hair dryer yet.  </li>
            <li> It is soooo light, it&#x27;s more powerful than expected!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It broke right after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The barrel gets hot right away.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and price was very competetive.  </li>
            <li> I said, it works great, just make sure that the correct voltage is selected before use and hasn&#x27;t switched to the wrong setting.</li>
            <li> This one is PERFECT - not too big and heavy, two temps and a low/hi speed for each.</li>
            <li> Overall great product, especially for curls</li>
            <li> super  fast dry..not that noisy.</li>
            <li> When you first get it, you&#x27;re like naaahh, this cute little toy won&#x27;t be able to do much!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Pros:  Lightweight, takes up very little space and comes with a stylish silver storage bag  Great for travel and sturdy enough for every day</li>
            <li> If you have long hair and want to get up under and near the roots you may be best to stick to a regular hairdryer though.</li>
            <li> This compact hair dryer works very well and gets hot quickly getting the job done.  </li>
            <li> It has a lot of power and dries my hair very fast.</li>
            <li> It dries your hair very fast which is something I wanted.  </li>
            <li> It is very light and compact but it does not have a lot of power even for my short hair!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used this dryer twice and both times it was fine.</li>
            <li> I love my hot pink mini-pro, so lightweight and Powerful!  </li>
            <li> Love the weight and size - but mainly I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Great little Hair Dryer!!</li>
            <li> Love this little guy - light weight and powerful.</li>
            <li> A hair dryer should last more.</li>
            <li> purchased this when I was in college (at the college store), and it was perfect for the constant back and fourth travel.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> I left this at the hotel and used the hotel blow dryers with no diffuser which worked better then</li>
            <li> Works better than larger dryers, easier to hold and store</li>
            <li> It does look like a &amp;#34;Barbie&amp;#34; hair dryer, but it is surprisingly hot.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get too hot and I use it with the difuser</li>
            <li> burned up first time used</li>
            <li> Perfect for weekend trips away from home and small enough to toss in a bag and take to the gym.</li>
            <li> the first time I used it I felt like it was a toy.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Daughter wants one, too!  </li>
            <li> It really does do the job!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it in the U.K. (after switching the voltage)</li>
            <li> and I actually really like it!</li>
            <li> But I really can&#x27;t complain and I would probably buy it again!</li>
            <li> They have a higher current, so I&#x27;m glad I read the directions.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t put the diffuser close to my scalp as the air was just too hot.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to return it because I&#x27;d passed the deadline by the time I got back from my trip.</li>
            <li> After one use, item got extremely hot, and did not work again.</li>
            <li> Light weight for my 87 yr old mom to hold.  </li>
            <li> But for the occasional use it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> It came with extra attachments in a cute zebra-striped bag.</li>
            <li> I love the tiny zebra print travel bag this product comes with along with the diffusers.</li>
            <li> The air isn&#x27;t too hot but loads of volume.  </li>
            <li> thing is it does get pretty hot, so you just have to get used to getting around that.</li>
            <li> Also , note wattage is only 1200, which is better for my house.  </li>
            <li> Make sure if you&#x27;re Australian</li>
            <li> Although I bought this for travel, I like it more then my regular sized dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> So hot I couldn’t use it except to thaw ice in my freezer.</li>
            <li> This dryer is so light-weight that it feels cheap, but so far seems to be working like a</li>
            <li> The zebra bag was a delight to use for travel and for personal when travel is over :-)</li>
            <li> The product came exactly as shown in picture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of a tacky hot pink</li>
            <li> from the first use you know it will die soon.</li>
            <li> :) If you need a smaller dryer that packs a punch for travel!</li>
            <li> Bit  smaller than thought, more of travel size.</li>
            <li> is too hot for my hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Good for an everyday hair dryer, not just for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I have long naturally curly hair, and I was able to get it straight and smooth quickly).  </li>
            <li> She is scared of the vacuum but is ok with this dryer.</li>
            <li> But it works as well as a larger hairdryer, certainly far, far better than a hotel wall dryer, and better than some full-sized ones, too.</li>
            <li> In looking for a new dryer I found most were too big and bulky for me, as well as too powerful for my hair.</li>
            <li> Great travel size, though not as quiet as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I need to use a diffuser and this did the trick for traveling, and it&#x27;s more powerful than expected.</li>
            <li> Its small but perfect for my little girl who is 9 and starting to do her own hair.</li>
            <li> It is quite powerful and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Is plenty powerful enough for my fine, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure my hair would air dry faster.</li>
            <li> and I had to go to the grocery store to buy a new one, more powerful, that worked very well and cost the same.  </li>
            <li> Great,  little, light , however POWERFUL little hairdryer.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m finding that the lower temp setting is in fact much gentler on my hair than what I used to do with the higher setting, and still does the trick.</li>
            <li> Really small, but does a good job of drying.</li>
            <li> Good air flow for a small dryer.  </li>
            <li> Really good - small but dries my hair well.</li>
            <li> I had a little chuckle when I opened the box - it reminded me exactly of a blow dryer that Barbie would own and even comes with</li>
            <li> My MiniPro  is so easy on the hair with only 1200 watts</li>
            <li> Easy to use for international travel since it has dual power settings.</li>
            <li> I have had full sized hair dryers that cost twice as much that didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this does.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small compact lightweight size which is most important for her.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is easy to hold and manipulate in different directions to self- style.</li>
            <li> I love the hot pink color and the fact it is lightweight.</li>
            <li> My daughters aren&#x27;t strong enough to hold my hair dryer with one hand.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the power of such a little and light thing.</li>
            <li> but it has already replaced my large cumbersome home dryer.</li>
            <li> I love how small this is and its very powerful.</li>
            <li> More importantly, though, is that there is only a high and a low setting.</li>
            <li> It may not work well with really thick or very long hair, but it works perfectly for my shoulder-length hair.</li>
            <li> This is cute, lightweight, feels like a toy but is a real hair dryer that will dry your hair.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight, packs easily and is much nicer to travel with than my regular size hair dryer/diffuser combo, which I&#x27;ve been lugging around on trips for years.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get back from a 2 week European trip to review this outstanding mini styler!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care what color it came in, but got it in the white and that was fine.</li>
            <li> What I realized is that it worked fine on the low setting.  </li>
            <li> Dries my hair fine, I do have short hair though.  </li>
            <li> ; Well, this dryer is kinda like that: tiny, slightly disconcerting-at-first, but, in the end, pretty remarkable.</li>
            <li> Although most hotels come with one these days, I have SUPER finicky multi-ethnic hair (Japanese and Caucasian), and wanted to have a dryer with me that wasn&#x27;t just your basic tool.  </li>
            <li> This little dryer is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Nice little hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It also comes with attachments and a nice little case.</li>
            <li> Nice little blowdryer.  </li>
            <li> but if you try to use it with the higher temp and high the wind  </li>
            <li> High setting is hot.  </li>
            <li> but honestly if I traveled with it I think it would only frustrate me because the right size doesn&#x27;t help if it doesn&#x27;t dry your hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great little hair dryer, especially for travel because of its size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s little, and it&#x27;s POWERFUL, what more do you want from something called &amp;#34;Mighty</li>
            <li> Not only is it great for trips but for people with little strength in hands and shoulders.  </li>
            <li> Great little dryer, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> It has  good heat, but hardly any air pressure, which I  count on for my hairstyle.</li>
            <li> I have thinner hair, about mid length between chin and shoulder, and I am able to dry it pretty quickly with the Infiniti.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This amazing little dryer delivers close to the power I&#x27;m used to with the T3, and my shoulder length hair is as smooth as ever - in almost the same amount of time.</li>
            <li> Good if you just want to dry it off so you can flat iron it or curl it,</li>
            <li> After using a much heavier professional style hair dryer for awhile, this one is truly a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li> dries my hair fast.</li>
            <li> It worked really well, though, for about 6 months.  </li>
            <li> It really does almost look like a toy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very lightweight and cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t take much space</li>
            <li> As others noted, you don&#x27;t get what&#x27;s pictured - mine was white with a light gray sack.</li>
            <li> But it really packed a punch once I got the hang of it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much easier to handle.</li>
            <li> this is really mini sized.</li>
            <li> is very usefull.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Gets the job done fast.</li>
            <li> And it works very well.  </li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife as a travel unit, and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> but I have a much nicer travel hair dryer that doesn&#x27;t feel like it is just going to snap in two...</li>
            <li> Sure enough...hot pink.  </li>
            <li> Same power, light weight.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Works very well as well.</li>
            <li> It really looked like a toy.  </li>
            <li> It dries my hair faster than my full-size hair dryer, and with just as much heat.</li>
            <li> The pink color is just the cherry on top for her.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really work overseas unless you want to burn your scalp.</li>
            <li> It has held up very well.</li>
            <li> very disapointed...</li>
            <li> Really like having the attachments.  </li>
            <li> and it really works.  </li>
            <li> very utilitarian ...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It really helps at keeping all my hair clips and dryer in one place.  </li>
            <li> Very lightweight.  </li>
            <li> , I really really wish I had brought it instead.</li>
            <li> Light weight and quiet.  </li>
            <li> i really like this hair dryer</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take up much suitcase space.</li>
            <li> I really like the two speeds.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pink which is OK</li>
            <li> and you plug it in with the adapter that you don&#x27;t put it on high!</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Tiny but mighty.  </li>
            <li> that much</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this problem in the US as much as I have in Europe.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have much power.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> how much power it has.</li>
            <li> I got it primarily to take with me when I travel, but now I use it at home instead of my regular hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight too.</li>
            <li> As others have said, there really should be a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting on it to help get that shiny hair at the end of a blowout.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair really fast</li>
            <li> However, it overheats fast.</li>
            <li> It works very well, and has more power for the size than I would have expected.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old is taking on more responsibility with her personal care.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective for being so tiny and definitely convenient for travel.</li>
            <li> so I guess I expected it to be capable of more.</li>
            <li> Pretty much doll size but blows stronger than my normal hair dryer.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t miss the high setting, though, because the low setting on 220 is just as strong.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old loves the color!!!</li>
            <li> It is tiny and lightweight but very powerful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and light and easy for me to carry around.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and light and easy to manipulate.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer is fantastic and quite strong for being so small.  </li>
            <li> not for everyday but very handy for travel and a back up dryer</li>
            <li> This little hair dryer is very light-weight, nice &amp; small for traveling and just as nice for every day use.</li>
            <li> It is very small, cute and light as shown in the picture.  </li>
            <li> The hot is very hot so hold it back from your head.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my little girl (8yr old) to be able to dry hair on her own.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, and straight hair and this has turned out to be my go-to dryer.</li>
            <li> Also, I love that it has dual-voltage settings, one for the U.S. and the other for Europe (and</li>
            <li> I originally intended to only use this dryer for travelling, but I use it exclusively.</li>
            <li> Tiny, lightweight, but packs a powerful punch!</li>
            <li> This compact dryer is more the type of thing I would take when I don&#x27;t know if the hotel I&#x27;ll be staying at has hair dryers (i.e., a non-chain hotel or a foreign hotel).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to put it in my bag and travel with me, and strong enough to dry my hair perfectly!</li>
            <li> My hair is short but VERY thick and it drys it really quickly and the attachments are great.</li>
            <li> The only draw back is that it seems to get kind of hot towards the nozzle (like if you accidentally knock the concentrator end off and have to put it back on to finish blowdrying your hair, it feels like you&#x27;re playing hot potato).  </li>
            <li> it is small but really dries nicely</li>
            <li> It is nice, the ceramic really leaves hair soft and shiny, less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have short hair and discovered I really don&#x27;t need to use a full size dryer.</li>
            <li> If you have limited arm movement or muscles that fatigue easily, this is the dryer for you.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair very well on the high setting.</li>
            <li> The reason why I was getting an extra one was because I was very satisfied with the old model - Light, small, dual-voltage, strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> after most regular runs the parts are hot, but not enough to burn me (seems ok enough to put it back in its bag,</li>
            <li> This dryer is small and light, making it very easy to use on my short hair.  </li>
            <li> If your only requirements for a travel blow drier are that it dries your hair fast, then this is adequate.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t get a good blow dry first my hair is a mess.  </li>
            <li> I have little time and thick, curly hair and it does a great job and very powerful.</li>
            <li> This one is so small, light weight and powerful!</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer for my 7 year old as her first hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It is strong enough to dry hair quickly, but not to the point of burning hair/scalp.</li>
            <li> It actually works as well as my full size salon hair dryer that I use at home.</li>
            <li> Only wish is that it had a cool setting.</li>
            <li> Small, lightweight dryer that doesn&#x27;t take up lots of room in a drawer or cabinet; the bag helps keep the cord contained and accessories handy.</li>
            <li> Not a bad dryer overall, and it comes with 2 attachments.  </li>
            <li> My mom wanted a small and powerful hair dryer and when she opened this on Christmas day she was quite excited!</li>
            <li> It is super small and easy to take around.</li>
            <li> Pretty loud on high.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is small but its engine is powerful!!!</li>
            <li> she loves it and so does my older daughter.</li>
            <li> I was prepared for any color to show up, but was pleased to get a white one with red details.</li>
            <li> I dropped it, so it wasn&#x27;t totally out of the blue, but I think a dryer should be able to withstand being dropped from waist height onto a rug once, which is what happened.</li>
            <li> It gets hot enough but not too hot.</li>
            <li> Was a decent dryer before that.</li>
            <li> This is my first tourmaline ceramic dryer, and it does seem to leave my hair smoother, but not enough that I&#x27;d be willing to toss my flat-iron.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered this styler I thought I was getting the (older) one that folds.</li>
            <li> I also started using this as my main hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This is actually an OK travel dryer given its size, but it doesn&#x27;t let you regulate temp but only pu tit on high or low.</li>
            <li> Got the fuschia dryer with zebra bag, which was handy for keeping the 2 attachments, my other small combs and clips, and an easy stuffing of its loosely-gathered cable (rather than spending time winding the cord around which still twists and wears on it, and unravels in your luggage).</li>
            <li> I use it in a 240v area mainly so it is always on high</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would Absolutely recommend to a friend (and to a complete stranger too)!</li>
            <li> It is super lightweight, super small, about the size of a female&#x27;s hand spread out, dries almost/ as fast as my Babyliss Toniro full sized dryer.  </li>
            <li> it is small and light but blow quickly.</li>
            <li> It takes much longer to dry my hair with this that with a full sized dryer.</li>
            <li> I was truly amazed;  while it didn&#x27;t dry my hair quite as quickly as my large tourmaline dryer, it worked nearly as quickly.  </li>
            <li> It also gives off a burning smell when used on high.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred to have an in between setting but am adjusting to the high speed/low speed.</li>
            <li> high setting is too high in that it gives off a burning smell even though there is no dust</li>
            <li> It was on high and the switch had changed from 250 to 125, it surged, and is no longer operable.</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t use the high setting when you&#x27;re on 220.</li>
            <li> I recommend this dryer highly but acknowledge that it may not work well if you have longer or thicker hair.</li>
            <li> It should not be allowed to operate on High mode in countries with lower voltage.</li>
            <li> I start out with the high one for a couple of minutes and then switch to the low&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> In addition to being one third the size and significantly lighter than my old dryer, it did the job in half the time of my more powerful unit with the same technology.  </li>
            <li> Hunting for a coin to switch between the dual-voltage settings was a bit niggly, but fine for making it harder to accidentally fry your dryer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Low setting is warm but not hot.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you switch the little adjuster to the correct voltage.</li>
            <li> Cute little hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This one not only does it, it doesn&#x27;t even get hot to the touch!</li>
            <li> I love that this comes with a little diffuser.</li>
            <li> love this little guy.</li>
            <li> Love this little dryer....</li>
            <li> It also comes with adorable little attachments, and it stores in an adorable little zebra print bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this little Conair hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken this little guy to Europe twice and on US vacations more times than I can count.</li>
            <li> I love this little dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this little dynamo.  </li>
            <li> Love this little dryer.</li>
            <li> I also love the little attachable defuser and straightener.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this little dryer, it is so manageable to use.  </li>
            <li> I love this little hairdryer.....</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this model to take on a trip to Ireland since my luggage space was limited and the Infiniti was lightweight and compact.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised with how much power and heat</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5 yea old daughter because she always wants to do things for herself</li>
            <li> I bought it to take it to my kids swimming practice as they swim outside all year long ( california :) ).</li>
            <li> I have short hair and don&#x27;t know how it would work for long hair, but I do love it.</li>
            <li> Purchased to take to Mexico and it is quite powerful for a TINY dryer!  </li>
            <li> I get it, its a travel size so it wont be as powerful as the regular one</li>
            <li> My hairdryer was much too big and heavy for her to manage on her own.  </li>
            <li> Not for like, a really vain American Girl Doll?&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> I love the concentrator - it&#x27;s really narrow and makes drying you hair in sections a breeze.  </li>
            <li> For me, it works better than any heavy, bulky one I have used before.</li>
            <li> Smaller than it looks but a powerful hair dryer for the size.</li>
            <li> It was about as powerful as a 1500 watt dryer I use daily!</li>
            <li> Once its used a few more times, I&#x27;ll either upgrade the rating or comment below.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soooo tiny, and powerful.</li>
            <li> It is powerful enough for me, and has diffuser, too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good dryer for traveling and for my curly and thin hair since it doesn&#x27;t blow all over the place.</li>
            <li> It is small, powerful and came with a carrying case so very useful for traveling.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not hard to avoid that issue.</li>
            <li> if you would like your hair to have volume or look shiny or healthy or any other good adjective, then you, like me, have come to the wrong place.</li>
            <li> I towel dry, then heat-style it with the Conair Mighty Mini when most of my hair is dry (which, as my fellow fine-haired ladies know, does not take long at all).</li>
            <li> Can only be used on low here, but that&#x27;s fine as it&#x27;s for my trip to the US anyways.</li>
            <li> The blow dryer is very light and had good power but failed completely in less than 2 months.</li>
            <li> small- 5.5\\&quot; from intake end to nozzle, and 6\\&quot; from top to handle bottom + the ~1.5\\&quot; cord lead- doesn&#x27;t take up any more room than the few folding travel dryers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> It was even smaller than expected but every bit as powerful as a full sized unit.</li>
            <li> I then switched it on high, and within seconds it became red hot.  </li>
            <li> HIGH and both temperatures were the same: BOILING HOT.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever want to be without it, so this new one is my backup.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light weight, small, and</li>
            <li> small and very light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and easier to use than a big bulky one and blows my hair dry just as fast.</li>
            <li> It is slightly bigger than what I expected but generally ok.</li>
            <li> so I need a lot of heat to dry it quickly.</li>
            <li> Came with a cute little travel case too!</li>
            <li> Love this little hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I love this little dryer!</li>
            <li> I love this little thing!</li>
            <li> Love this little guy!</li>
            <li> I end up switching between low and high to build up some more heat, and only stick the diffuser into the roots of my hair so it doesn&#x27;t totally blow out</li>
            <li> The high speed is plenty strong enough to quickly dry my shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> Powerful enough to get the job done, but because it does not put out as wide of a path of hot air as my big hair dryer it does not do the job quite as quickly and evenly as it.  </li>
            <li> very loud and have burning smell.</li>
            <li> Arrived right on time, performs very well, is quieter than expected and is compact for traveling</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight, small and easy for me to hold.</li>
            <li> I love how small it is, and yet it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I checked for other travel size type hair dryers, but found that many of them were too big and wouldn&#x27;t reach from a floor plug outlet up to the mirror because of the recoiled cord.  </li>
            <li> cheap but not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not worth it for that use which was my primary reason for purchasing it.</li>
            <li> that is what I love about it small and compact and fits in your suitcase.</li>
            <li> and she cries that it is too hot even when it is on low...</li>
            <li> This was not exactly the same model, but I like it better.</li>
            <li> I am adding to this review, because I wrote the first part when I had only had the dryer for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> My problem with this hair dryer is that even on the low setting the air from the dryer is too hot.</li>
            <li> The first time I plugged it in (with an adapter), I double checked to ensure it was set to 220.  </li>
            <li> If you avidly blow-dry your hair get a bigger one.</li>
            <li> wow!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost cute, it&#x27;s so small,  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted 5 years, but it was only $15.00.</li>
            <li> but even so, the actual dryer, without the diffuser, is probably only about 7 inches from front to back, top to bottom.</li>
            <li> They get really hot on low setting.</li>
            <li> Better than the one I use usually at home</li>
            <li> Love the small size.  </li>
            <li> It works well for me - note that I have very fine hair, so if you have thick hair, it may not work as well.</li>
            <li> I thought perhaps it needed to cool down - some older model hairdryers used to do this but no, 15, 30,</li>
            <li> bonus - the Conair MIghty Mini takes a LOT less space in my drawer too.</li>
            <li> It does not come with a &#x27;cool shot&#x27; setting, which I thought would make achieving curls more difficult.</li>
            <li> It dried just as fast as my full size dryer.</li>
            <li> This little dryer is a little workhorse and is light and easy to use for our tween.  </li>
            <li> , the heat is high and the little motor is strong (just a little louder than a full sized).  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would be as good as my big, clunky, heavy dryer, but this little baby gets HOT, has a lower setting also.  </li>
            <li> It was quite powerful, and dried my hair in an equal amount of time as my full sized dryer at home.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Loud, not as powerful as a larger hair dryer, and my last one fried when someone used it on high while traveling in Peru.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product that will take up much less space and weight on future travels.</li>
            <li> I just followed the instructions and only used it on low (which was more than sufficient to blow dry my hair with)  </li>
            <li> She had previously been starting to want to try drying her own hair with my larger hair dryer, but it was too big/heavy for her to</li>
            <li> I do use this for everyday use and it has held up fine.</li>
            <li> I would even be fine with using it everyday.</li>
            <li> Small and extremely light-weight but packs a good amount of power.</li>
            <li> I was initially concerned that it might not hold up to daily use but 2 1/2 years later, the hair dryer is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Bought it to take on vacation in a travel trailer, but when my large dryer died I started to use this one daily.</li>
            <li> That said, the plastic is a little cheap looking but it works for what it is at its price point.</li>
            <li> This little hair dryer is indeed mighty.</li>
            <li> This little one has mighty power.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t ecstatic that the Infinity Mighty Mini dryer could only be run on Low on the 250V setting, but it turns out this dryer&#x27;s airflow on a 220V outlet blows ALMOST as strong as High on its 125V setting in a US outlet (where Low setting was pretty low, like a desktop heater)... at least in Iceland (220V/50Hz)</li>
            <li> Some reviewers were a little negative regarding the size of this blowdryer, but I thought it was great.  </li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s ridiculously tiny, it does a surprisingly good job of drying my (very) thick hair.  </li>
            <li> This little dryer works great, but a few words of advice if you are traveling outside of the US.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair that takes a good 10-15 minutes to blow dry with a decent dryer.  </li>
            <li> Hot air and blows as much as any conventional sized blow dryer.</li>
            <li> It was a huge waste of money.  </li>
            <li> So believe the name, &amp;#34;MiniPRO.&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t purchase it to travel with, just because I dislike huge, heavy hair dryers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So maybe a great buy for travel within the US but am wary of giving it any stars for international travel.</li>
            <li> Turns out that it does the same great job that the expensive hair dryers do.</li>
            <li> so I could dry my Silky Terrier&#x27;s long fine hair after her bath.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 yr old daughter for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have fine textured, prone to dryness hair that has taken me 50+ years &amp; no expense spared to tame it to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Solid so far-</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my 9 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> becuase my old travel one was shot.  </li>
            <li> and I took to Israel in early March.  </li>
            <li> With luggage weight and size restrictions I was trying to pack as lightly as possible and this blowdryer really helped with that.  </li>
            <li> Also purchased to use with Soft Hood Dryer attachment.  </li>
            <li> It also came with a zipper bag for travel, which was an unexpected surprise.  </li>
            <li> Our 5 year old daughter can use it being so lite.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old can handle it as it is lighter than her toy one.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, finally a hair dryer I can pack in my luggage that doesn&#x27;t weigh too much.</li>
            <li> does not have the power of a professional dryer</li>
            <li> It dries my hair as fast and my big one!</li>
            <li> My seven year old loves it.</li>
            <li> and I think it too is going to stop completely.</li>
            <li> I have one that its about 18 yrs old.</li>
            <li> like it belongs on a 30 year old.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the size of the hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> Seems great at first, but it&#x27;s not great for long hair unless your unnaturally careful while using it.</li>
            <li> But I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> My old hair dryer died.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 7 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the instructions and nearly blew it up</li>
            <li> Works very well on my short curly hair.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s dryer is about 30 years old and needed replacement.</li>
            <li> Conair wants me to ship it to Arizona at my expense and send them $7.00 to ship it back.  </li>
            <li> and it absolutely beats the standard hairdryers found in hotel rooms.  </li>
            <li> cause you know, natural hair needs to be straightened sometimes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been well over 15 years with my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> People with much thicker hair may not find this has enough power.</li>
            <li> Without an adopter, you can not plug in this unit directly into the wall receptacle.  </li>
            <li> Seemed to work very well for a small dryer and strong enough for 1200 watts.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give t to a little girl instead of the adult I originally purchased it for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cute and improbable, like a Barbie-doll toy hairdryer in very pink plastic, just like its picture online in its box, complete with miniature pink plastic diffuser &amp; concentrator.</li>
            <li> It is small, lightweight, and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> small size makes it easy to hold and use.  </li>
            <li> It is very light and small, infact smaller than a fold-able hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The low setting does not generate quite enough heat, but the high setting has too much air flow.</li>
            <li> It does dry my hair very quickly for a small dryer, but I do have super short, :pixie: type hair.</li>
            <li> Be warned, the pink isn&#x27;t displayed in the picture, but it is a bright version of dark pink.</li>
            <li> Quite small and light, yet powerful and not very noisy.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is indeed very small - be sure to note the dimensions.</li>
            <li> It is plenty powerful and plenty pink!</li>
            <li> Thanks to this blowdryer, I&#x27;m actually taking care of my fragile hair live</li>
            <li> But the diffuser does not slow down the air flow very much, and on top of that, the diffuser is SO TINY -- no more than 3 inches in diameter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and works just fine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would be powerful enough for long hair.</li>
            <li> In fact, the small diffuser has actually given me more targeted control when drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> got the older blue Conair travel hairdryer, can&#x27;t remember the name</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously never going back to a full-size dryer again.</li>
            <li> My stepdaughter has long medium hair and it dried her pretty quick as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it will last as long as my other one I had for many years</li>
            <li> I have only used it about 2 weeks, but I hope it lasts as long as my other favorite blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I style my hair with a round brush and a blow dryer and had been using a tiny OLD travel one because the large hair dryers are too strong for my thin, fine hair - literally blew it out of the brush, and I could not use them.</li>
            <li> there are two wind settings high and low and 2 temp settings</li>
            <li> (Even 1875 Watts, which is the standard, is too high.)</li>
            <li> It has a low and high speed.  </li>
            <li> I have a Kill-A-Watt&#x27;s meter to test the house wattage, and this hair dryer reads 981 watts on high and 255 watts on low setting.  </li>
            <li> I do have to say that in some hotels and countries, I cannot use the high setting, I have to use the low setting otherwise the hairdryer will over heat.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not looking for anything fancy, travel quite a bit and want a dryer for basic hair-drying needs, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The high setting gets much too hot to use as well as blowing hard.</li>
            <li> This little hair dryer works better than my regular big dryer.  </li>
            <li> dryer did overheat a few times when using it on 220V with an adapter in Europe, but I think as long as you are conscious about not using it on high setting for too long, it should be OK.</li>
            <li> This is a very decent little hair dryer: very inexpensive, two speeds and heats, but it packs punch for its size.</li>
            <li> It seems well built and is light but not as small as I thought.</li>
            <li> Small and light weight yet does the job.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a blow dryer that was small and light weight to for in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> (I have long, very textured, wavy hair)</li>
            <li> This is so small and light.</li>
            <li> Space saver and just as powerful as an average size hair dryer.</li>
            <li> the full size driers are a bit heavy for her.  </li>
            <li> but I can live without it for he price I paid—although I see it&#x27;s come down in price a little bit which makes it a better value.  </li>
            <li> Drys quickly then slips into its little carrying case.</li>
            <li> It is only 1200 so works more slowly and runs a little hotter than the full size</li>
            <li> I find it easy to use and the low setting is just right for my hair, it hardly takes any time at all for my hair to dry at that setting.</li>
            <li> It does the job even on the low setting, and my hair is very long and fine and takes forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic little hair dryer I bought for my trip later this year.</li>
            <li> Though I knew it was a \\&quot;travel\\&quot; hair dryer, I just wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so tiny and feel, well, a little on the cheap side.</li>
            <li> Wow this little dryer is quite powerful.  </li>
            <li> This little unit has much better deying power than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful for a small hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful for a small hair dryer.</li>
            <li> high and 5 ¾&amp;#34; long) and lighter in weight than my old dryer, all reasons why I picked the Infiniti.  </li>
            <li> For such  a small dryer, it packs a lot of power, and barely takes much longer than my full size dryer, to to it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Especially if you flip your head upside down to dry it, you lose even more control.</li>
            <li> This little hair dryer was exactly what I was looking for, small, easy to travel with, and not too loud.  </li>
            <li> It gets very hot, and there is plenty of power in this teeny little package.</li>
            <li> It works very well,  The weight was fine, but I expected it to be a little smaller since I was looking for something that would easily fit into a small carry on bag.</li>
            <li> Compact, dry hair fast.</li>
            <li> I wanted to dry my hair as I styled it and the 1800 watt dryers blow my hair too much.  </li>
            <li> She has thick, curly hair, and she&#x27;s been able to dry it in a reasonable amount of time-- no longer than it takes with my larger dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The two models look very similar - I would think they are the same unless I look very closely at the picture.</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair and it dried quickly even on the lower setting.</li>
            <li> I wish the low setting had more power behind it because I feel like high</li>
            <li> It is small but powerful enough to dry hair quickly.</li>
            <li> does to keep the hair from being sucked in the back of it (most women know what I mean)</li>
            <li> It gets really hot (but not so hot that it has singed my hair or anything), and it has a lot of power for such a small blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised by how small and light this hair dryer is that when I received it in the mail I considered immediately sending it back.</li>
            <li> That can become a major problem.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s an improvement that holds up all day, even in the dry winter air that usually leads to static.</li>
            <li> I wish it were some other color (not a huge fan of pink), but I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small and lightweight so she can easily hold it.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised, even a little amazed at the improved body &amp; texture of my hair the first time I used this dryer.</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair and it is gentle enough on my hair and gives me the volume</li>
            <li> It has as much blowing/heat power as my old one (huge/clunky), but I still think it takes slightly longer to dry my hair just because the size of the dryer itself doesn&#x27;t allow as much air to blow at once.</li>
            <li> Wish it had an intermediate setting (only low and high).</li>
            <li> Personally I only need the 2 settings: high or low.</li>
            <li> It only has a high and a low setting -</li>
            <li> If you only use the low setting OR if you don&#x27;t care about your hair being fried on High, then it might work for you.</li>
            <li> It has two speeds, high and low but only one heat temperature.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a low and high setting and comes with a couple equally tiny attachments.</li>
            <li> The high setting is a bit loud, the heat a bit too intense, but it&#x27;s small size and dual voltage make up for these issues.</li>
            <li> Small and light enough to keep in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> My old one finally died.</li>
            <li> Once again something I couldn&#x27;t find on store shelves when my old one finally burned out, and once again a seller on Amazon came to the rescue, ordered 2</li>
            <li> Because I travel frequently I ordered a second dryer to keep in my traveling bag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not that big of a deal because the low setting is still EXTREMELY powerful and drys my hair in a matter of minutes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact and sturdy and comes with a nice storage bag, so it works well for my purposes, but it&#x27;s probably on the small side for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I usually have to take my full size $$$$ hair dryer on vacation because the ones at hotels are wimpy.</li>
            <li> the biggest problem I have is that unlike a full size hairdryer, a few hairs can get sucked into the back end and get all burned up</li>
            <li> Even though it is not that powerful, it dries my hair in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and the right size for her little hands.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right size, does the job and comes with a kicky little zebra-striped bag.  </li>
            <li> It dries hair fairly quickly, but I&#x27;ve had other travel dryers dry quicker.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful for such a small blow dryer.</li>
            <li> easy to travel with it.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing wrong, except that I don&#x27;t really know how tu use the accesorizes...&lt;br /&gt;Sure</li>
            <li> The high setting is a little too high and makes my thin hair incredibly frizzy and unmanageable while the low setting is a little too low and takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have a folding handle, but it is still super small.  </li>
            <li> It is super small</li>
            <li> I always use it on low; haven&#x27;t even tried it on high, as it has enough power for my hair on low.  </li>
            <li> Wonderfully small and pretty hot pink color.</li>
            <li> I wanted the blow dryer to double for daily use and travel, so my items can be useful in all ways and save space since I live in a small home.  </li>
            <li> She called it a &amp;#34;Barbie&amp;#34; styling tool, due to it&#x27;s very compact size and vibrant pink color.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a possibility that long hair can get sucked into the back end of a hair dryer, but because of the extremely small size, it happens extremely easily with this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s louder than T3&#x27;s old model travel blow dryer but less high pitched than Babyliss.  </li>
            <li> So, if you are occasionally clumsy like me, perhaps consider a different product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a new one right away</li>
            <li> It takes my full size hairdryer about 8 minutes to pretty thoroughly dry my hair, and I&#x27;d say this little guy only takes slightly longer.  </li>
            <li> I use it nearly every day on fairly long hair.</li>
            <li> Small yet powerful.</li>
            <li> Small, portable, and powerful.  </li>
            <li> Small but quite powerful.</li>
            <li> She loves that it is small, yet powerful.</li>
            <li> Small but powerful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as powerful as ones I&#x27;ve had in the past</li>
            <li> This is a small powerful hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Small but powerful.</li>
            <li> It is small but still compact an powerful.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews saying this blow dryer was small, yet powerful.  </li>
            <li> Small but powerful.  </li>
            <li> Small but powerful.  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s still a bit too powerful for me, it serves my purpose, as it is small and lightweight.</li>
            <li> It is quite powerful for being so small but drys my hair in no time at all.</li>
            <li> small and compact but powerful</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t turn it down much.</li>
            <li> I bought this particular dryer due to the size and the dual voltage aspect as we will be traveling to Europe</li>
            <li> It makes styling my hair pretty darn easy (and I have difficult hair!).</li>
            <li> The squeaky clicks of folding travel dryers always makes me wonder if the next snap might means a chewed/caught cord or broken joint, so I&#x27;m stoked about the solid-state handle on this dryer, even if it takes more flat space-</li>
            <li> Just right for small hands</li>
            <li> 3/4 finished with a blow dry,  hair soft waves and</li>
            <li> This small hair dryer so far seems to be working very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, but definitely powerful enough.</li>
            <li> really powerful for such a small hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how powerful the hair dryer is for such a small product.  </li>
            <li> This thing definitely packs a powerful punch for being so small.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair, and while it dried most of my hair in pretty decent time, I don&#x27;t even want to think about how long it would have taken me to actually blow it out with a round brush.</li>
            <li> I truly wish it had held up longer; given the short experience I had with it, it was great, but the lack of durability left me utterly disappointed.</li>
            <li> It does dry my rather thick hair pretty decently and gives a bit of body but don&#x27;t expect salon type effects with this one  </li>
            <li> I just bought this dryer for the lower watts &amp; small size, because the standard sized power-monsters blow the shape right out of my cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This little dryer takes virtually no space in your luggage and is powerful enough to dry your hair in just minutes.  </li>
            <li> This tiny hair dryer has a lot of power behind it; fits well into the vanity drawer; and easily packed for travel.</li>
            <li> Takes longer to dry my hair (which I expected due to less wattage) and it makes my hair more frizzy (which I did not expect).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like a large, heavy hairdryer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that women with thin, fine hair need to use hairdryers with low wattage -- like, 1200 to 1500.</li>
            <li> Needed to get a less powerful blow dryer when I moved to a place with crappy outlets that were killing my other dryers.</li>
            <li> I also forget to switch the switch down instead of up for high.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my 8 year old daughter who is really into styling her hair herself lately.</li>
            <li> The low setting isn&#x27;t worth using for my hair..too thick.</li>
            <li> so powerful for such a small hair dryer!</li>
            <li> Small enough to travel, but works like a large hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This is a small and mighty little hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually blow-dry my hair, so I bought this product only to keep around for those occasional times when I really need a hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Has 2 heat settings and is not as loud as other hairdryers of this size.</li>
            <li> Very small yet powerful.</li>
            <li> Dries my thick hair quickly and fits easily in my limited space in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> It is powerful enough to dry my thick hair, and lightweight enough that my arm  doesn&#x27;t tire when I style for volume.</li>
            <li> , it was also very high powered for such a small dryer.</li>
            <li> My only caveat is that it&#x27;s small and lightweight, but  I really wish it was foldable.</li>
            <li> It does not skimp on power and gets my hair dry in the same amount of time as a regular sized one I use at home on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts as long as my last one, which I used for about 15 years - same brand.</li>
            <li> I have a short pixie cut but my hair is pretty thick</li>
            <li> The bag will hold more than just the dryer, I threw in combs and a few other small items.</li>
            <li> the switch was a little stiff to turn on at first and if feels a little cheap but Torumaliine ceramic, little power house.  </li>
            <li> Low was enough to dry my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> The diffuser is too small and air is too hot - made my hair dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> So... I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much when I ordered this hairdryer, just a small hairdryer that I could travel with, but with some attachments.  </li>
            <li> It goes to reason that, since the air is not moving as fast, it will heat as well, if not better, than a dryer that blows you through a wall.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer is small and very powerfull.</li>
            <li> The diffuser was too tiny fro my long hair.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone with long hair, I would say just above the shoulder&#x27;s would be the \\&quot;cut off\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I do question how long it would last while any lengthy usage though.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this hair dryer for normal everyday use.</li>
            <li> Good reviews are what sold me, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The low setting is so low that it takes me twice as long to dry my hair</li>
            <li> This little dryer is comparable with my full size blow dryer, if not better.  </li>
            <li> When used foreign current it only uses the low setting.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described - so small!  </li>
            <li> What a powerful little thing !!!</li>
            <li> but I can only partially dry my hair which is not why I bought it.</li>
            <li> It may take me 1 or 2 extra minutes to dry my hair</li>
            <li> I have short hair and find the lower setting is sufficient to dry my hair without over drying it.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it is that when you reduce the blower volume, you also reduce the heat, so it takes longer to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin fine hair and only use a hair dryer for spot drying on occasion.</li>
            <li> I did buy it because of an injury to my arm, only allowing me a limited range of motion.  </li>
            <li> I have ever used, and that became immediately apparent whenever the place I was staying had any other blow drier</li>
            <li> It goes on some business trips with me too because while most hotels include hair dryers, they tend to have some of the worst ones - low wattage, full of lint, etc.</li>
            <li> High blows plenty hard to dry short hair and low</li>
            <li> One minor complaint is that the high setting is loud and quite shrill; a much higher pitch than my blow dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small but high powered.</li>
            <li> It arrived so fast that my wife hardly missed a day without a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> What I did think was particularly disappointing was that attaching and removing the concentrator/diffuser was very difficult indeed and required a certain amount of brute force - so, overall, not that happy</li>
            <li> It may sound silly, but this gadget has improved my life.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not powerful enough in the low setting, which it locks in when in the 240 voltage mode.</li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair</li>
            <li> Long cord too.</li>
            <li> I just wish that this Barbie pink would not be the only color.</li>
            <li> I have long curly tresses and it drys my hair</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what happened to me and my daughter who both have long hair.</li>
            <li> Small did not think was gonna be so small but overall really powerful for size</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it on the highest setting or for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> Oh, and my hair is long.</li>
            <li> If only it wasn&#x27;t Jem and the Holograms pink...</li>
            <li> Be careful to keep the back end away from your hair as it may suck your hair in.</li>
            <li> No cool setting and low speed is really low, but I still like it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> so it can take a long time to air dry, which is why I like using a dryer.  </li>
            <li> I have quite a bit of hair and it has always taken me a long time to dry it with a dryer.  </li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer thinking it would be a &#x27;smaller&#x27; size than normal but was pretty shocked to see it was TINY!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d assume likewise for the UK and other European countries with that spec.</li>
            <li> An ionic (tourmaline-ceramic) dryer was a must esp on the road since it cuts my drying time from 40 mins to about 15-20, and this one left my hair smoother than other ionic dryers I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is very small and doesn&#x27;t feel very well made, but I have been using it for 6 months</li>
            <li> It was much smaller then I expected, but it does the job!</li>
            <li> unfortunately my other one doesn&#x27;t have a diffuser which is the sole reason I got this one.  </li>
            <li> One other reviewer said that it burnt out after 2 weeks, but if it lasts I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> (Other reviews and the product description note that you may receive a different color combination.)  </li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers, I use it not only for travel, but at home, too.  </li>
            <li> As long as they sell them I will buy them!</li>
            <li> I have had several other mini dryers (both by Connair and by Revlon)</li>
            <li> and then just dry it</li>
            <li> If I dry her hair</li>
            <li> I could curl my hair or just dry it.</li>
            <li> After 5 minutes of frustration my daughter gave up trying to dry her hair saying that &amp;</li>
            <li> and it now takes longer to dry my hair</li>
            <li> and I can dry my hair in no time with this.</li>
            <li> I dry my hair in sections</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe it can even dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to blow dry my baby&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> we even used it to help dry clothes</li>
            <li> It will take forever to dry my hair!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I got it to take with me to the gym to dry my hair after a sweaty workout</li>
            <li> You couldn&#x27;t even dry a baby&#x27;s curls with this.</li>
            <li> Blows my shoulder length hair dry in minutes.</li>
            <li> I easily dry my hair in five minutes.</li>
            <li> This does dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> We boondock in our motorhome all the time and don&#x27;t always want to turn on the generator ti dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> My dry time seems to be shorter.</li>
            <li> Big ones have similar power, but are heavy &amp; make my shoulder sore.</li>
            <li> It makes it flat, brittle, excessively dry, frizzy (even if your hair normally has no propensity to be frizzy), and just overall look unhealthy, despite any products you may use pre-blow dry to do just the opposite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this little barbie looking thing but the power is amazing on this little device.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to be let down by this little hair dryer, but I was pleasantly surprised with it!</li>
            <li> The two tiny attachments are like toys and not worth using because of the size of everything.</li>
            <li> I bought it specifically because it looked purple since that is my granddaughter&#x27;s favorite color, but when it arrived, it was very pink, which was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder/ hand issues and now they don&#x27;t hurt when I blow dry my hair!  </li>
            <li> If you are going to dry sopping wet hair, you might want something stronger.</li>
            <li> instantly strips away any trace of moisture your hair previously had, as if you had used no conditioner.</li>
            <li> Going on a big trip and definitely needed a small travel size dryer.</li>
            <li> so it does take a little bit longer to dry than larger travel blow driers</li>
            <li> Also, there are two settings on this, high and low, and low is basically useless.</li>
            <li> What I actually got was a white hairdryer with a dull grey carrying case.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let its small size and weight fool you -- this dryer has got some major oomph!</li>
            <li> There are only two heat settings (and no cool setting)</li>
            <li> But I usually try to dry and style with a round brush simultaneously causing me to stick with high.  </li>
            <li> If you just want to give your curly hair a head start on air-drying because you will be somewhere cold, it&#x27;s probably fine for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> I have to go back and forth between the two to get the same look I had with my previous (now dead) dryer.  </li>
            <li> just as the website says this little dryer does all the work of the big bulky ones.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than what I thought, but works well!</li>
            <li> It comes with a little carry case, and several min-attachments.</li>
            <li> I have the little, red one from Babyliss.  </li>
            <li> It is tiny little thing.</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t forget to change the switch to 240v or it will allow to you have high speed and supersonic jet speed, which is probably not good for it or your hair).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that bad, but it takes more getting used to than I would have thought.</li>
            <li> works as expected.  </li>
            <li> Also, it arrived at my house way before it was expected.  </li>
            <li> Big dryers are too heavy for me.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too bothered with this aspect of the order as I wasn&#x27;t overly keen on the idea of a pink hairdryer anyway, and the carrying case was just a throwaway in any event -</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want a big heavy hair dryer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a John Freida 1875 watt dryer, which is heavy and tiring to use, because of my physical limitations.  </li>
            <li> I got this hair dryer for mom because her carpel tunnel syndrome had been acting up and her hair dryer had become too heavy for her.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;ll send me a pink one or something.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I notice the photo now shows pink...</li>
            <li> The color is a metallic purpley pink.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve never really needed to use it, so it&#x27;s not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> but even if it&#x27;s not even a year that I have bought it, it seems like I was covered only for few weeks after the purchase.</li>
            <li> Received the pink model as pictured.  </li>
            <li> so there is no real temp control.</li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> pink but appears purple in the picture</li>
            <li> Got it for the diffuser and that works as expected.</li>
            <li> I have it since May 2014 and it stops working after a few minutes and will not turn back on.  </li>
            <li> I actually use this everyday.</li>
            <li> I used it with the diffuser attachment for my curly hair, and my hair dried faster than it does with my regular dryer at home.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that takes forever to dry with a normal size dryer.</li>
            <li> Despite it&#x27;s smaller size, it works as well as a regular sized dryer if not better!</li>
            <li> My daily morning ritual is easier &amp; quicker due to this little machine.</li>
            <li> When I first received the product and removed it from the box, I was skeptical about its ability to dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how small this was when I got it, almost like a toy!  </li>
            <li> My only complaint and the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars would be that the handle is not hinged like other brands offer</li>
            <li> The heat is not strong enough and when used for longer than 2 mins it will just turn off, until it cools off.</li>
            <li> We played with the switch a bit and discover it is pretty loose and accidentally went to the wrong voltage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One looks purple and the other pink.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long natural curly hair</li>
            <li> If you have very thick, curly hair, you would probably need to use the high setting.</li>
            <li> After half an hour of trying to dry my hair</li>
            <li> It was much smaller than I expected - so small in fact that I doubted that it would work at all.  </li>
            <li> This blow drier has been the bane of my poor hair&#x27;s existence throughout the month I&#x27;ve spent traveling with it, and although my normal hair drier is about 4x as bulky</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s a professional grade dryer, but I have trouble working with the heavier ones</li>
            <li> This is small and pink, but it is definitely not wimpy.</li>
            <li> Having very short hair, all I need is a small, not very powerful dryer.</li>
            <li> In fact, it is lighter than any other dryer I&#x27;ve had, and I hope that doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> It takes up very little space and weighs next to nothing!</li>
            <li> Like a previous reviewer, I was really surprised at the very small size of this dryer as I hadn&#x27;t looked carefully at its dimensions before buying.</li>
            <li> use  Can be used in other countries with prong type adapter  </li>
            <li> I wish it had a medium heat setting but other than that, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Have a small bathroom and use it a lot outside of my house.</li>
            <li> it really is extremely small...mini...</li>
            <li> I pushed the reset, I plugged into other outlets....  </li>
            <li> As other customers have also stated, I bought it for travel and now use it every day.  </li>
            <li> other Conair one kinda fits</li>
            <li> Wish it came in other colors.</li>
            <li> However, it has two speeds which are comparable to other blow dryers.  </li>
            <li> the price esp will all the other attachments included.</li>
            <li> I used all my other plug ins (cell phone, curling iron, camera charger) with the adapters and had no issues except with the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> The other I&#x27;ve had for years</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever use the diffuser and the other doohickey.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it is a dryer for travelling, too small for regular every day use.</li>
            <li> I wish it came with plug adopter that are compatible with the pin arrangements in foreign countries.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little longer to dry my hair than with a full-size dryer, but I can&#x27;t complain for the size and the cost.</li>
            <li> alas, back to a big dryer.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair everyday nor do I have a lot of storage</li>
            <li> Especially the pink color and small little zebra print carrying case.</li>
            <li> So I was skeptical of the claims for &#x27;ceramic positive ions blah</li>
            <li> My hair is long, thick and layered, and it has to be mostly dry for this to work.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s only 1200 watts, the dryer doesn&#x27;t blow as hard.  </li>
            <li> so I was having a hard time wanting to invest in a big hair dryer.</li>
            <li> However, it has one big problem which is that it overheats and completely stops working after a few minutes which makes it useless....</li>
            <li> I figured, why drop much $ on this if they all are mediocre?  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> It sucks your hair through the back and it gets stuck.  </li>
            <li> I  have average hair thickness.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the diffuser...</li>
            <li> it is not worth it to replace it when I can buy another brand.</li>
            <li> Not amazing, but it is tiny</li>
            <li> and it was not powerful enough for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> In my opinion the only thing is lacks is a cold setting, but I can live without that.</li>
            <li> Mine is pink, but would have preferred black chick was not available.</li>
            <li> PLUS, this dryer won&#x27;t weigh down or take up room in your suitcase at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one problem I had was that it shut down for 5-10mins when it overheated...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not necessary feature since it&#x27;s so small!</li>
            <li> and I  usually let it air dry about 90%</li>
            <li> With the 1200watts instead of the usual 1500watts, plus the diffuser I can dry my hair without blowing away my hair style.  </li>
            <li> I was getting tired of holding the bigger ones above my shoulders &amp; looking for something small.</li>
            <li> I got two and both burned out in less than two months.  </li>
            <li> The tourmaline technology which is supposed to be less damaging for your hair  </li>
            <li> I understood that it would be small when I read the measurements, but seeing it for yourself is something entirely different -- it is really small.</li>
            <li> It performs well beyond what you would expect from such a small dryer with a small price.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it because my hands and arms can&#x27;t handle holding typical dryers.</li>
            <li> Then it would take up less space.  </li>
            <li> Just can&#x27;t seem to use a normal-size blow dryer to style my hair without blowing all the previously styled hair to smithereens.</li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair-almost to my waist-and I have never had a small blower dryer that could handle the length of time that it takes to dry my hair until now.</li>
            <li> (Eventually I taped the little switch to the voltage I wanted so that it wouldn&#x27;t slip over to the other, which it did a few times.)  </li>
            <li> My hair is thin, and does not take long to dry at all.</li>
            <li> Tooooooo small than that I expected.</li>
            <li> It is not true.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no cool shot and</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> and I could hardly get a section dry before my scalp would start to burn.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair</li>
            <li> have since purchased the Revlon Compact Styler which is a bit heavier but not too heavy for me and has cut my drying time in half.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone with really thick hair though as it might take a lot longer to dry.</li>
            <li> For the price, I figured I could slow dry my hair when I travel abroad.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard for me to hold a heavy hair dryer for very long.</li>
            <li> plugged this in while in Europe and first of all, the diffuser was USELESS!</li>
            <li> I received this little blow dryer for Christmas.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package, I was a bit skeptical as to whether the hair dryer would work as described because the dryer and diffuser are so small and lightweight that they resembled something my daughter would use for her dolls!</li>
            <li> just under 1.5\\&quot; diameter, but the diffuser attachment spreads the air a little (haven&#x27;t tried the concentrator).</li>
            <li> it comes with holds a small brush or other items too.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Literally just a couple of days after writing this review, my little dryer broke.</li>
            <li> RIP little dryer friend.</li>
            <li> It was a little tricky getting used to holding something</li>
            <li> , it comes with a little diffuser that works well.</li>
            <li> This is a little powerhouse of a dryer.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little dial you turn with a coin or screwdriver that makes it</li>
            <li> so a lot of hairdryers seem a little bit of overkill for me.</li>
            <li> little dryer has lots of power.</li>
            <li> I bought it for travel and when my home dryer broke I used this little wonder.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so little.</li>
            <li> For a travel dryer, this little dryer fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> Also has a lot of power for a little dryer</li>
            <li> Previously I&#x27;d been hauling it several times a year overseas because hotel dryers are so bad that even my thick, straight hair comes out frizzy.</li>
            <li> nothing worse than your old hair dryer going on the fritz half way thru the job and no back back up, talk about bad hair day.</li>
            <li> Remember that weird TV Show with the robot little girl and the old man, &amp;#34;Small Wonder?&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Dead in November.</li>
            <li> That said, it still does a sufficient job on my heavy waist-length hair.</li>
            <li> As to performance, well I haven&#x27;t actually dried my hair with this hairdryer yet, but have tested it to see if it worked.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now with no quality complaints.</li>
            <li> I thought it was broken, but couldn&#x27;t sent it back.</li>
            <li> hair looked shiner last night than after using the Freida, which I attribute to the decreased wattage of the dryer.</li>
            <li> I wanted something for traveling but too heavy.</li>
            <li> In a few places, even with the voltage adjustment, it would overheat and shut off.</li>
            <li> My hair dryer was just too heavy.</li>
            <li> So now I use this for my everyday hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I was needing a blow dryer that wasn&#x27;t so heavy</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It will work well for few months</li>
            <li> I use it as both my everyday dryer and my travel dryer.</li>
            <li> and I now use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday with the neat attachments.</li>
            <li> but I use mine everyday.  </li>
            <li> Been using this dryer a few weeks now and no complaints.</li>
            <li> For example, I travelled to Dubai and India, there they have three round pin plugs.  </li>
            <li> As an everyday hairdryer, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have medium length, thick, curly hair that takes forever to dry, and was looking for a small blow dryer with a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and this dryer did its job!</li>
            <li> The color is quite pink, and it&#x27;s very small, almost like a toy.</li>
            <li> , I think changing the voltage is not easy.</li>
            <li> so it is not easy to</li>
            <li> This little dryer is a dynamo packed in a small package.  </li>
            <li> Lots of heat &amp; power in a small little dryer.</li>
            <li> #34;it just doesn&#x27;t get hard or blow hardly any air.&amp;#34;  We&#x27;re keeping it to blow dry our dog, a small pekingese.</li>
            <li> Plus, is it just me, or have regular-sized hair dryers doubled in size over the past few years?</li>
            <li> You might think, oh, this little thing isn&#x27;t going to do anything, but it DOES!</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I thought it looked like a toy, but this little dryer works!  </li>
            <li> This little hair dryer packs a punch!</li>
            <li> It might be too weak for someone with thick long hair.  </li>
            <li> Takes up very little space and has attachments.  </li>
            <li> I needed something small and lightweight and that Is what this is.</li>
            <li> Small &amp; lightweight</li>
            <li> Keeping it in my suitcase for travelling as it is small.  </li>
            <li> but it is so small - it works quite well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculously small and looks like a child&#x27;s toy</li>
            <li> bought this dual voltage small dryer specifically for a trip to Spain and Portugal</li>
            <li> I have a studio apartment that is quite small, so I prefer small versions of things.</li>
            <li> Small dual voltage unit.</li>
            <li> Really small</li>
            <li> It is small and travels well.  </li>
            <li> It is small and compact with 2 attachments, but there is no way to adjust the heat setting...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Purchased for travel because of it&#x27;s small size.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer because it was small and lightweight.  </li>
            <li> so I wanted a small one that I could also use for travel.  </li>
            <li> I was replacing a small one that I gave to a friend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so small and lightweight</li>
            <li> That being said, it&#x27;s still small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Edited: It does include a concentrator and a diffuser, though that diffuser is so small.  </li>
            <li> (Once I thought I killed it!</li>
            <li> This little dryer has a lot of power for being so small!</li>
            <li> This was the biggest waste of money!</li>
            <li> I like a small hairdryer.</li>
            <li> The diffuser is small but handles my hair</li>
            <li> I like the small size of the dryer.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend this to anyone not wanting to spend a lot and needs a small dryer to travel with.</li>
            <li> I am a hairdresser and usually don&#x27;t see a travel size diffuser except for the socks which I do not like</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s burning dirt or my hair.  </li>
            <li> It fits perfectly by my small sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Small.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box for this dryer and saw how small it was, I thought \\&quot;What, is this battery-operated??</li>
            <li> I purchased this mini hairdryer because I travel a lot, and because I have a small bathroom</li>
            <li> Small and lightweight and gets the job done</li>
            <li> The button on it didn&#x27;t work properly and I was unable to change amps from 250 to 125 when needed.  </li>
            <li> My daughter just loves this small hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted a small hair dryer for traveling.  </li>
            <li> travels well, small, and lightweight.  </li>
            <li> I wish there was a medium speed and heat, but that&#x27;s hard to get in something this small.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how it would work out on someone with thick hair.</li>
            <li> so I was disappointed when this did not work well at all too much airflow through the diffuser.</li>
            <li> As I usually have to, when I&#x27;m running late to work from the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT if you actually DID want a pink hairdryer/zebra case, well, then you would be severely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Because of the decreased speed of the dryer, I had no problems with tangles, yet the time it took to blow my hair dry decreased by 1/3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using this horrible little thing for a month straight, I can confidently say that it is the worst blow drier</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much performance-wise, so I was pleasantly shocked that it performed as well as my TIGI Rock Star Blow Dryer that I am addicted to.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I replaced it is because I was looking for a dryer with a cold shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blow dryer sucks the hair in thru the fan and can burn it and cause damage.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that there isn&#x27;t a cold air button.</li>
            <li> I do wish it had a \\&quot;cold shot\\&quot; button, but that is the only drawback.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s useless.  </li>
            <li> For being so small, it delivers!</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It dried my hair faster than my $60 dryer!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually even started using it on an every day basis and for the price you cannot go wrong!</li>
            <li> Very small hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> The diffuser is very small and the hair blows all over .</li>
            <li> I wanted something small and lightweight so my arm wouldn&#x27;t get tired.  </li>
            <li> The attachments don&#x27;t have any purpose than to clutter up the little, useless bag.</li>
            <li> so not much good for diffusing curly hair.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife - but she tells me that it is no good.</li>
            <li> , this dryer is not good for curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and now my arms don&#x27;t get tired.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, and this small, lightweight hair dryer does the job!  </li>
            <li> Because this stupid little pink monster hates your hair.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ll use it as I can&#x27;t be bothered to send it back, but I wouldn&#x27;t order another one :(</li>
            <li> This one has plenty of power for my needs - it doesn&#x27;t feel like I am using a weak version of a dryer.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> I have been a blowdry failure all my life!</li>
            <li> But the places that do provide a hair dryer, the quality is poor.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> still packs thin at ~2.25\\&quot;</li>
            <li> but it was a bit frustrating.</li>
            <li> i hate the big ones the are so bulky</li>
            <li> I can move it around and hold it up in the air, behind my head, whatever.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> Hotel/cruise ship hair dryers are not great for that</li>
            <li> my wrist doesn&#x27;t get tired.</li>
            <li> That was a FALSE statement.  </li>
            <li> I chose this one because I have chronic tendonitis and heavy hair dryers give me a bad flare-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate that it is pink and the case is zebra striped.</li>
            <li> This is a teeny little thing.. worthless for a women.. might work for a bald man...??</li>
            <li> no sparks, overheating or anything scary...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it because the return shipping is too expensive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the adapter is up to the job, the description is wrong.</li>
            <li> I find hair dryers in hotels/cruise ships to be quite useless.  </li>
            <li> but still, it was useless for me.</li>

            <li> Received as a gift and took it with me to the UK - voltage is different there but it is specifically designed to be dual voltage and has a simple switch to convert from 110 (US) to 220 (UK). I switched it to the correct voltage - plugged it in and it worked for 5 minutes and stopped. I thought perhaps it needed to cool down - some older model hairdryers used to do this but no, 15, 30, 60 minutes later it refused to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So maybe a great buy for travel within the US but am wary of giving it any stars for international travel.</li>
            <li> I needed something small and lightweight and that Is what this is. Is it the world&#x27;s best hair dryer? no but I have to say I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. I have long wavy hair and I  usually let it air dry about 90% and then just dry it the rest of the way and this works well. If you are going to dry sopping wet hair, you might want something stronger.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for little hands.  Great dryer.</li>
            <li> A mini dryer that does a powerful job! I love it!</li>
            <li> Not disappointed. Works well and super small, perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> Bought this so that my 9 year old could begin drying her own hair.  She liked the bag that it came with and she has no problem holding it...the full size driers are a bit heavy for her.  If I dry her hair I still prefer the beastier full size....its faster.</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer with dual wattage for international travel.  Small yet powerful.</li>
            <li> Perfect Dryer ! This has replaced my larger Conair. My MiniPro  is so easy on the hair with only 1200 watts so compact and lite makes hair styling very easy and fast. Going to buy another one for spare. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Compact and easy to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really safe, and convenient. I could curl my hair or just dry it.</li>
            <li> Great little Hair Dryer!! It quickly dries even a lot of Hair.</li>
            <li> This is a nice tiny size for traveling, but I returned it because it does not have a &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; button.</li>
            <li> Love this lil thing!! It feels so cheap, it looks like a toy for a barbie or something but IT WORKS! My hair is short but VERY thick and it drys it really quickly and the attachments are great.</li>
            <li> great product for how small it is. adorable bright color. very convenient to use and effective. dries my hair fast.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on the reviews I read. It&#x27;s a good dryer for traveling and for my curly and thin hair since it doesn&#x27;t blow all over the place.</li>
            <li> Went to Belarus for 2 weeks with this product (country by Poland and Ukraine) and it worked excellent. Just make sure you switch the little adjuster to the correct voltage. All you need is an adapter for the plug and you&#x27;re good to go! Dries hair fairly quickly for a mini dryer. Came with a cute little travel case too!</li>
            <li> Very powerful for a small hair dryer.  Bought this solely to use when I travel, because not all places provide a hair dryer.  But the places that do provide a hair dryer, the quality is poor.  So...bought one for myself and love it!  Especially the pink color and small little zebra print carrying case.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is compact, so it is very easy to travel with. It has a lot of power and dries my hair very fast. It is also very cute!</li>
            <li> I needed a lower wattage blow dryer that wouldn&#x27;t trip the fuse. Surprisingly its pretty powerful for its size.  Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I bought this for my 14 yr old daughter for Christmas. She was very disappointed &amp; so was I ! It has only been used or attempted to use just once. After 5 minutes of frustration my daughter gave up trying to dry her hair saying that &amp;#34;it just doesn&#x27;t get hard or blow hardly any air.&amp;#34;  We&#x27;re keeping it to blow dry our dog, a small pekingese. Other than that, it&#x27;s useless.  Again, save your money &amp; skip this product</li>
            <li> Cute little hair dryer. My younger daughter wanted her own dryer so I got this one. she loves it and so does my older daughter. Works great, has alot of power for a little thing  pretty color also</li>
            <li> I got two and both burned out in less than two months.  I used it possibly 1-2 times a week.  A hair dryer should last more.</li>
            <li> Ordered in September. Dead in November. Don&#x27;t purchase as it is clearly cheaply made, and won&#x27;t even hold up to minimal use for a full three months!!!  I wish I could return.</li>
            <li> So cute and small, perfect for traveling but with great power! Easy to use for international travel since it has dual power settings. Love the zebra carrying bag too. Very happy with this purchase!!!</li>
            <li> comes with a case and ultra compact.</li>
            <li> Perfect size. Does just what I want!!! No complaints!</li>
            <li> LOVES:&lt;br /&gt;+ Great for travel&lt;br /&gt;+ Includes a storage bag&lt;br /&gt;+ And includes two additional pieces to attach (concentrator &amp; diffuser)&lt;br /&gt;+ Small &amp; lightweight&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BADS:&lt;br /&gt;- Does not have cold air setting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this when I was in college (at the college store), and it was perfect for the constant back and fourth travel. And I still use it to this day when traveling. I love how small it is, and yet it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Mini and cute even not exactly the same color, still beautiful</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer for my 7 year old as her first hair dryer.  It&#x27;s very small and lightweight so she can easily hold it.  She enjoys being able to dry her own hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine textured, prone to dryness hair that has taken me 50+ years &amp; no expense spared to tame it to my satisfaction. I thought I had the perfect hair care routine and best products to use down.  So I was skeptical of the claims for &#x27;ceramic positive ions blah blah&#x27;...OK, whatever. I just bought this dryer for the lower watts &amp; small size, because the standard sized power-monsters blow the shape right out of my cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I was pleasantly surprised, even a little amazed at the improved body &amp; texture of my hair the first time I used this dryer. And it&#x27;s an improvement that holds up all day, even in the dry winter air that usually leads to static.</li>
            <li> Just received it; yesterday; delivered on time, no problem.  It&#x27;s so cute and improbable, like a Barbie-doll toy hairdryer in very pink plastic, just like its picture online in its box, complete with miniature pink plastic diffuser &amp; concentrator. But it works as well as a larger hairdryer, certainly far, far better than a hotel wall dryer, and better than some full-sized ones, too. And it is extremely light, not tiring on the arms. The diffuser successfully brought out waves in my hair; the concentrator straightened my bangs.  I bought it to fit in my carry-on luggage, which it does nicely. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually blow-dry my hair, so I bought this product only to keep around for those occasional times when I really need a hairdryer. It&#x27;s compact and sturdy and comes with a nice storage bag, so it works well for my purposes, but it&#x27;s probably on the small side for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The best option for a travel hair dryer.  Pros:  Small, portable, and powerful.  Cons:  Loud, not as powerful as a larger hair dryer, and my last one fried when someone used it on high while traveling in Peru.  I&#x27;m buying another one, because I can&#x27;t find a better hair dryer that suits my needs.  Tip:  use it on low while traveling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this hair dryer for international travel.  It is very small, cute and light as shown in the picture.  However, it has one big problem which is that it overheats and completely stops working after a few minutes which makes it useless.... I guess it overheats but I can only partially dry my hair which is not why I bought it.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight, easy to use.  Exactly what I needed.  The attachments and travel case were an added plus.  Perfect for people who need power plus a lightweight design.</li>
            <li> Nice and light I have thin hair so it drys in a couple of minutes with this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was going to Europe for a couple weeks and 1. I have curly hair and I needed something with a diffuser and 2. Something dual voltage.&lt;br /&gt;I plugged this in while in Europe and first of all, the diffuser was USELESS! It didn&#x27;t buffer the air whatsoever, the blow dryer also has one heat setting which is &amp;#34;fry your hair&amp;#34;. I left this at the hotel and used the hotel blow dryers with no diffuser which worked better then the one that came with this one. 2 stars because it had a nice price but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Perfect size with right amount of power.  I have very short hair and travel often, this is the perfect balance for power and size.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Lightweight, takes up very little space and comes with a stylish silver storage bag  Great for travel and sturdy enough for every day use  Can be used in other countries with prong type adapter  The tourmaline technology which is supposed to be less damaging for your hair  Its little and so cute! makes adorable gifts    Cons:  It does dry my rather thick hair pretty decently and gives a bit of body but don&#x27;t expect salon type effects with this one  It doesn&#x27;t have the cold air setting</li>
            <li> excellent product for being so small.  Works better than larger dryers, easier to hold and store</li>
            <li> It takes a little longer to dry my hair than with a full-size dryer, but I can&#x27;t complain for the size and the cost. It does look like a &amp;#34;Barbie&amp;#34; hair dryer, but it is surprisingly hot. It may not work well with really thick or very long hair, but it works perfectly for my shoulder-length hair.</li>
            <li> I just love this hairdryer. I&#x27;ve been a fan of Conair forever. My last conair hairdryer lasted a good 15+ years. This comes in it&#x27;s own travel bag too. Has 2 heat settings and is not as loud as other hairdryers of this size. You will love it!</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer to dry my toddler&#x27;s hair. She is scared of the vacuum but is ok with this dryer. It doesn&#x27;t get too hot and I use it with the difuser</li>
            <li> just as the website says this little dryer does all the work of the big bulky ones. great features easy to use attachments. i would purchase this item for a friend.</li>
            <li> good one and does the job</li>
            <li> works as expected.  Love the zebra print zipper pouch it comes with.  Arrived quickly and price was very competetive.  Keeping it in my suitcase for travelling as it is small.  Small but quite powerful.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer for my mother. She loves that it is small, yet powerful. The carrying case is awesome. Also, it arrived at my house way before it was expected.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this little hair dryer! It&#x27;s small, but definitely powerful enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer for travel, mainly abroad, and I am pleased to see that it has an ungrounded plug, which takes a simpler kind of electrical outlet adapter. The high setting is a bit loud, the heat a bit too intense, but it&#x27;s small size and dual voltage make up for these issues. Be warned, the pink isn&#x27;t displayed in the picture, but it is a bright version of dark pink.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift because I travel weekly.  Let me just say that this is the most amazing small hair dryer that I have ever used.  I have very long and thick hair-almost to my waist-and I have never had a small blower dryer that could handle the length of time that it takes to dry my hair until now. This one not only does it, it doesn&#x27;t even get hot to the touch! The size is what is so impressive as well! It truly is an amazing tool! You will not regret this one.  I am considering ordering a spare and I&#x27;ve only had mine a week and one traveling trip!</li>
            <li> I bought the miniPRO to keep  in my gym bag because the dryers at the  gym suck. It has  good heat, but hardly any air pressure, which I  count on for my hairstyle. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how small this was when I got it, almost like a toy!  It worked really well, though, for about 6 months.  It started having problems with the motor not working as well and it began getting overheated.</li>
            <li> I received this little blow dryer for Christmas. My hair is long, thick and layered, and it has to be mostly dry for this to work. The attachments don&#x27;t have any purpose than to clutter up the little, useless bag. When I was blow-drying my two sisters hair, it over heated and stopped working. It also gives off a burning smell when used on high.</li>
            <li> I love that this comes with a little diffuser. For a little guy, it does a very good job.</li>
            <li> This little hair dryer was exactly what I was looking for, small, easy to travel with, and not too loud.  I checked for other travel size type hair dryers, but found that many of them were too big and wouldn&#x27;t reach from a floor plug outlet up to the mirror because of the recoiled cord.  This little hair dryer was perfect for my needs and does a great job of drying my hair and not making it frizzy as well.  I was prepared for any color to show up, but was pleased to get a white one with red details.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and comes with great accessories and a carry bag!</li>
            <li> Love it. Perfect for travelling! I used this when I went to Norway last spring. Not only did it work well with the converter, it was also very high powered for such a small dryer.</li>
            <li> Great, small, light and does exactly what I need. Who could ask for more?</li>
            <li> The hair dryer seems to be of good quality so far, but the color is deceiving by the picture.  I bought it specifically because it looked purple since that is my granddaughter&#x27;s favorite color, but when it arrived, it was very pink, which was disappointing.  It should have had a better description in the specs.</li>
            <li> I used this blow dryer while in Spain.  It worked wonderful!</li>
            <li> Worked great until it broke 8.5 months in.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much and found a great product. Quite small and light, yet powerful and not very noisy. I will repurchase it for a gift.</li>
            <li> This little dryer is a little workhorse and is light and easy to use for our tween.  It dries her hair quickly without causing the blow drying damage ususally seen with super powerful dryers.  She can pack it for sleepovers and camp without it taking up gobs of room.  A good choice for younger girls who are starting to spend more time in the bathroom styling their hair!  :)</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer! I travel a lot - I wish it folded but it is so small - it works quite well. I use the diffuser all of the time.</li>
            <li> burned up first time used</li>
            <li> It packs a punch! I bought it because I&#x27;ve been traveling a lot for work and the hotel hair dryers just don&#x27;t cut it. Then 2 weeks ago, I dropped my regular &amp;#34;home&amp;#34; dryer and have been using this one. It&#x27;s been totally fine for every day use. My only caveat is that it&#x27;s small and lightweight, but  I really wish it was foldable. My old travel dryer was a bit heavier, but it folded and fit better in my luggage.</li>
            <li> Love the light weight and ease to hold.  Big dryers are too heavy for me.  Good strong blow power and fast drying</li>
            <li> My mom wanted a small and powerful hair dryer and when she opened this on Christmas day she was quite excited!</li>
            <li> Works great, light weight and easy to travel with. Couldn&#x27;t have asked for more.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that its so light, but it almost feels cheap its so light! I know that&#x27;s contradictory, but that&#x27;s the truth. Its light. It dries my hair very well on the high setting. The low setting isn&#x27;t worth using for my hair..too thick. The two tiny attachments are like toys and not worth using because of the size of everything. I miss having a retractable cord. But I bought this for the weight and it is light weight! I just hope it doesn&#x27;t burn out in a couple of months.</li>
            <li> This dryer is just the right size for my motor home. It works great, I use the defuser a lot. And I love the color.</li>
            <li> SUPER tiny but works great. Perfect for weekend trips away from home and small enough to toss in a bag and take to the gym. Not terribly noisy either. I wish it had a medium heat setting but other than that, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package, I was a bit skeptical as to whether the hair dryer would work as described because the dryer and diffuser are so small and lightweight that they resembled something my daughter would use for her dolls! I decided I would test it out this morning. I am so impressed! My hair dried quickly and the diffuser worked great with my curly hair! I bought this particular dryer due to the size and the dual voltage aspect as we will be traveling to Europe and I did not want to lug my regular dryer and enormous diffuser around. With that in mind, the only thing that would have made this an even better dryer is if it had a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button, however if there were more features on this dryer it may not be able to be as compact and lightweight as it is and would defeat the reason why I purchased it. It comes with a handy travel case.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is not only the perfect size for travel, or little people (just learning how to use one), it&#x27;s SUPER stylish too! My 6 year old loves the color!!! The zebra carrying case just adds to the fun. : )  It also has great power for a small machine. Good quality, I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t ecstatic that the Infinity Mighty Mini dryer could only be run on Low on the 250V setting, but it turns out this dryer&#x27;s airflow on a 220V outlet blows ALMOST as strong as High on its 125V setting in a US outlet (where Low setting was pretty low, like a desktop heater)... at least in Iceland (220V/50Hz) and I&#x27;d assume likewise for the UK and other European countries with that spec. All we needed was a cheap plug adapter- no need for step up/down converters, wattage limits, fuses that could blow the rest of your trip- esp for things like hairdryers. Hunting for a coin to switch between the dual-voltage settings was a bit niggly, but fine for making it harder to accidentally fry your dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small- 5.5\\&quot; from intake end to nozzle, and 6\\&quot; from top to handle bottom + the ~1.5\\&quot; cord lead- doesn&#x27;t take up any more room than the few folding travel dryers I&#x27;ve had. The squeaky clicks of folding travel dryers always makes me wonder if the next snap might means a chewed/caught cord or broken joint, so I&#x27;m stoked about the solid-state handle on this dryer, even if it takes more flat space- still packs thin at ~2.25\\&quot; at thickest in its 6X8\\&quot; bag (which can expand up to 4.5\\&quot; at the bottom). Got the fuschia dryer with zebra bag, which was handy for keeping the 2 attachments, my other small combs and clips, and an easy stuffing of its loosely-gathered cable (rather than spending time winding the cord around which still twists and wears on it, and unravels in your luggage). Finding no retractable-cord dual-voltage mini dryer of satisfactory durability at the time, this was the one I decided on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the airstream is as skinny as the nozzle- just under 1.5\\&quot; diameter, but the diffuser attachment spreads the air a little (haven&#x27;t tried the concentrator). That said, it still does a sufficient job on my heavy waist-length hair. An ionic (tourmaline-ceramic) dryer was a must esp on the road since it cuts my drying time from 40 mins to about 15-20, and this one left my hair smoother than other ionic dryers I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid so far- no sparks, overheating or anything scary... after most regular runs the parts are hot, but not enough to burn me (seems ok enough to put it back in its bag, but when there&#x27;s time I let it cool off to be safe). Great travel dryer and one of the lower price points too.</li>
            <li> Have a small bathroom and use it a lot outside of my house. Great for travel. Wish it had an intermediate setting (only low and high).</li>
            <li> So disappointing! this hair dryer is so cute but that&#x27;s about it. bought it when my Revlon finally stopped working after like forever.. (5 or 7 years) the first time I used it I felt like it was a toy. there are two wind settings high and low and 2 temp settings but if you try to use it with the higher temp and high the wind  it resets back to low temp. After half an hour of trying to dry my hair I gave up and barrowed my moms hair dryer. I understand that people like it for travel but honestly if I traveled with it I think it would only frustrate me because the right size doesn&#x27;t help if it doesn&#x27;t dry your hair. I guess it could be a nice gift for a 6 year old or like a kid that&#x27;s just starting to do their own hair. I just want to warn people not to be fooled. their are WAY better deals on amazon for the same size with lower prices and better brands.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and exactly what I wanted.  It dries your hair very fast which is something I wanted.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> great size, lots of power, perfect size, great price, love the extras, but don&#x27;t care for pink! Had no choice.</li>
            <li> Nice little hair dryer. I love how small this is and its very powerful. Personally I only need the 2 settings: high or low. Its a simple dryer but its great if thats all you need</li>
            <li> Cute and perfect size for my 7-year old daughter. Pretty loud on high.</li>
            <li> Very small hair dryer.  It really does almost look like a toy.  Is plenty powerful enough for my fine, straight hair.  Low setting is warm but not hot.  High setting is hot.  Daughter wants one, too!  Great size for travel.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred to have an in between setting but am adjusting to the high speed/low speed. It is very light weight and small which will work great for traveling.</li>
            <li> So... I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much when I ordered this hairdryer, just a small hairdryer that I could travel with, but with some attachments.  What I was expecting was a bright pink hairdryer with a zebra stripe carrying case.  What I actually got was a white hairdryer with a dull grey carrying case.  I wasn&#x27;t too bothered with this aspect of the order as I wasn&#x27;t overly keen on the idea of a pink hairdryer anyway, and the carrying case was just a throwaway in any event - BUT if you actually DID want a pink hairdryer/zebra case, well, then you would be severely disappointed.  As to performance, well I haven&#x27;t actually dried my hair with this hairdryer yet, but have tested it to see if it worked.  Seemed to work very well for a small dryer and strong enough for 1200 watts.  What I did think was particularly disappointing was that attaching and removing the concentrator/diffuser was very difficult indeed and required a certain amount of brute force - so, overall, not that happy - I&#x27;ll use it as I can&#x27;t be bothered to send it back, but I wouldn&#x27;t order another one :(</li>
            <li> I purchased this at my local Walgreen&#x27;s last year. I chose this one because I have chronic tendonitis and heavy hair dryers give me a bad flare-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very lightweight and cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The low setting is so low that it takes me twice as long to dry my hair which is a source of pain for those of us with tendonitis or arthritis.&lt;br /&gt;The high setting is too high in that it gives off a burning smell even though there is no dust inside.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s structurally cheaply made and often feels like it&#x27;s going to fall apart while I&#x27;m using it which makes me nervous given that it&#x27;s an electrical device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since purchased the Revlon Compact Styler which is a bit heavier but not too heavy for me and has cut my drying time in half.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife to take on a vacation in Europe. She loved it, and said it worked really great. On the last day in Europe, it burned out. It was on high and the switch had changed from 250 to 125, it surged, and is no longer operable. We played with the switch a bit and discover it is pretty loose and accidentally went to the wrong voltage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, it works great, just make sure that the correct voltage is selected before use and hasn&#x27;t switched to the wrong setting.</li>
            <li> I style my hair with a round brush and a blow dryer and had been using a tiny OLD travel one because the large hair dryers are too strong for my thin, fine hair - literally blew it out of the brush, and I could not use them. My old one finally died. This one is PERFECT - not too big and heavy, two temps and a low/hi speed for each. I use the lowest temp and the lowest speed, and can style with ease. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get back from a 2 week European trip to review this outstanding mini styler! I use a big, pricey T3 at home, bought at cost thru my stylist. Previously I&#x27;d been hauling it several times a year overseas because hotel dryers are so bad that even my thick, straight hair comes out frizzy. This amazing little dryer delivers close to the power I&#x27;m used to with the T3, and my shoulder length hair is as smooth as ever - in almost the same amount of time. I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product that will take up much less space and weight on future travels. The price - you will feel like you stole it. It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> Love.  Fits in my gym bag and case it comes with holds a small brush or other items too.  Works quickly in drying my sweaty hair from working out.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my 9 year old daughter. Very powerful for a small hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It arrived so fast that my wife hardly missed a day without a hair dryer. She stells me that it is perfect in every way..</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer as a spare.  I already have one - love it and use it every day.  Don&#x27;t ever want to be without it, so this new one is my backup.  The original is still going strong after a couple of years.  It would also be perfect for traveling because it&#x27;s so small, but POWERFUL! I didn&#x27;t care what color it came in, but got it in the white and that was fine.</li>
            <li> needed a dryer lite and easy to use for when we travel and this did the trick.  not for everyday but very handy for travel and a back up dryer</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and this dryer did its job! Comes with a cute traveling bag too!</li>
            <li> I have had full sized hair dryers that cost twice as much that didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this does.  I bought this because I travel a lot and I usually hate hotel hair dryers and mine just takes up too much room when trying to pack light.  It&#x27;s ridiculously small and looks like a child&#x27;s toy but it works great, the heat is high and the little motor is strong (just a little louder than a full sized).  It may take me 1 or 2 extra minutes to dry my hair but it&#x27;s well worth it as it takes up about 1/3 of the space my full sized dryer uses.</li>
            <li> This is a teeny little thing.. worthless for a women.. might work for a bald man...??</li>
            <li> It stays true to it&#x27;s name as it is indeed mini, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy this if I have thicker hair.</li>
            <li> bought this dual voltage small dryer specifically for a trip to Spain and Portugal becuase my old travel one was shot.  this overheats very easily and actually quit working after 3 uses.  cheap but not worth the price.</li>
            <li> It really does do the job! I didn&#x27;t want a big heavy hair dryer so I got this one and not only does it work it doesn&#x27;t take much space&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is indeed very small - be sure to note the dimensions. As others noted, you don&#x27;t get what&#x27;s pictured - mine was white with a light gray sack. However, the product description notes this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this little guy. I have a studio apartment that is quite small, so I prefer small versions of things. This one has plenty of power for my needs - it doesn&#x27;t feel like I am using a weak version of a dryer. The cord is nice and long and the attachments stay on easily. The sack helps keep things organized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now with no quality complaints. Good product, good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally just a couple of days after writing this review, my little dryer broke. I dropped it, so it wasn&#x27;t totally out of the blue, but I think a dryer should be able to withstand being dropped from waist height onto a rug once, which is what happened. So, if you are occasionally clumsy like me, perhaps consider a different product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a new one right away so I went to Target; all the options there were twice the weight and size. RIP little dryer friend.</li>
            <li> This is a great little dryer.  I have fine hair and it&#x27;s nice that on low it has a nice gentle blow speed and temperature.</li>
            <li> Small dual voltage unit. When used foreign current it only uses the low setting. Considering the unit can fit in the palm of your hand it&#x27;s not powerful enough in the low setting, which it locks in when in the 240 voltage mode. Not worth it for that use which was my primary reason for purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Tooooooo small than that I expected. Can grab in one hand. Really small</li>
            <li> Perfect! Small but powerful.</li>
            <li> Very compact, easy for travel packing, and works very well. For such  a small dryer, it packs a lot of power, and barely takes much longer than my full size dryer, to to it&#x27;s job. Folds, and takes up 1/3 the space though, and comes with a cute case, and 2 attachments</li>
            <li> Nice compact size, but nothing special about it.  It stopped working after several months and I&#x27;ve since invested in a salon quality dryer.</li>
            <li> I like it but dont love it , I guess I used mine a lot and it now takes longer to dry my hair but I have no complaints. Still works and is great when traveling! that is what I love about it small and compact and fits in your suitcase.</li>
            <li> The Conair Mighty Mini Styler performs as described. Its compactness makes it easy to pack for travel. Mine is pink, but would have preferred black chick was not available.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this blowdryer after already having bought one at Target for a trip my husband and I took to Israel in early March.  I had resigned myself to the $12 Target travel blowdryer when I decided to check Amazon one last time.  I took some time the week before we left and read reviews and decided on this one.  Some reviewers were a little negative regarding the size of this blowdryer, but I thought it was great.  With luggage weight and size restrictions I was trying to pack as lightly as possible and this blowdryer really helped with that.  It also worked well with my power adapter/converter.  I just followed the instructions and only used it on low (which was more than sufficient to blow dry my hair with)  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much performance-wise, so I was pleasantly shocked that it performed as well as my TIGI Rock Star Blow Dryer that I am addicted to.  It was a little tricky getting used to holding something so light while blowdrying my hair.  But it really packed a punch once I got the hang of it (I have long naturally curly hair, and I was able to get it straight and smooth quickly).  The only draw back is that it seems to get kind of hot towards the nozzle (like if you accidentally knock the concentrator end off and have to put it back on to finish blowdrying your hair, it feels like you&#x27;re playing hot potato).  All in all this is a great little blowdryer and great for travel.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer for travel to England &amp; Ireland, along with an adapter.  The dryer was advertised as dual voltage for worldwide travel.  That was a FALSE statement.  The FIRST time we plugged it in, it Fried!!!!  It was a huge waste of money.  I will NEVER by a Conair dryer again.</li>
            <li> Very nice dryer.  It&#x27;s not as powerful as ones I&#x27;ve had in the past but I have short hair. I don&#x27;t think it would be powerful enough for long hair. It was my mistake not to realize the power level that was posted in the ad.</li>
            <li> I love this little dryer! I originally purchased it as a Christmas gift for my 9-year-old daughter. I thought she&#x27;d get a kick out of having her own dryer and it would be easier for her to use since it was smaller. She thought it was cool. I however recently started using it myself and I LOVE IT! Despite it&#x27;s smaller size, it works as well as a regular sized dryer if not better! I was so surprised with how much power and heat it puts out. Plus, with it being so lightweight it&#x27;s much easier to handle. I use it every day and my hair comes out great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, works better than my full size blow dryer. And the carrying bag just makes it that much better.</li>
            <li> Great little hair dryer for the money. No cool setting and low speed is really low, but I still like it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used this dryer twice and both times it was fine. It&#x27;s perfect for traveling and even at home use. I will continue to take it with me on trips and update my review.</li>
            <li> warning...this is really mini sized. Good for travel but not exactly what I was expecting. The diffuser is itty bitty so not much good for diffusing curly hair. I&#x27;ll keep it because the return shipping is too expensive. Just pay attention to the measurements provided, which I did not...it really is extremely small...mini...they aren&#x27;t kidding.</li>
            <li> This is a great hairdryer.  It is small and travels well.  I love the color.  It is quite powerful and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This compact hair dryer works very well and gets hot quickly getting the job done.  The diffuser was too tiny fro my long hair. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a great travel dryer. I had zero issues with it. It has more than one setting, worked well for me in Ireland, Scotland and England as well as the US. I didn&#x27;t need to use a converter for it, it has a built in switch for that. It did a great job drying my hair. I have medium length hair but it is very fine. Not sure how it would work out on someone with thick hair. My favorite part, its pink :)!</li>
            <li> Great for travel with lots of power and heat.</li>
            <li> I got this for an overseas trip after searching through dozens and dozens of reviews of travel hairdryers **that come with diffusers** for my curly hair. I figured, why drop much $ on this if they all are mediocre?  And indeed I am glad I did not spend much on this one.  It does have strong airflow for such a tiny dryer, which is great for non-curly purposes.  But the diffuser does not slow down the air flow very much, and on top of that, the diffuser is SO TINY -- no more than 3 inches in diameter.  The low setting does not generate quite enough heat, but the high setting has too much air flow. I end up switching between low and high to build up some more heat, and only stick the diffuser into the roots of my hair so it doesn&#x27;t totally blow out all the curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are picky about drying your curly hair with a diffuser, this probably isn&#x27;t the travel dryer for you.  If you just want to give your curly hair a head start on air-drying because you will be somewhere cold, it&#x27;s probably fine for that purpose.  Might be OK if you have very strong tight curls that don&#x27;t get blown out as easily.  Or maybe you can get crafty and block some of the holes in the diffuser...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer did overheat a few times when using it on 220V with an adapter in Europe, but I think as long as you are conscious about not using it on high setting for too long, it should be OK.</li>
            <li> It is a perfect size for traveling and storing, the problem is that it reheats in seconds and turns off automatically. You have to wait for several minutes in order to get it to work again. When I got it I didnt knew this, so I thought it was broken, but couldn&#x27;t sent it back. When it got back to life, I learned that It cannot be too close to the hair, leave like 3 or 4 inches space in between and now it works really good.</li>
            <li> I bought this blow dryer because it has a diffuser on it - a rarity for travel blow dryers. I needed something for a trip to London and this definitely did the trick. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s more powerful than my regular diffuser! Great product</li>
            <li> It is small and compact with 2 attachments, but there is no way to adjust the heat setting...I bought it for my daughter and she cries that it is too hot even when it is on low...</li>
            <li> Update:  :(  3rd time using it on travel.  Love this little dryer.... fits great in my hand, easy control.... 3/4 finished with a blow dry,  hair soft waves and then......... oh no!!!!  it died.  Not circuit tripped. I pushed the reset, I plugged into other outlets....  I was in denial.  i just shook it and then, headed out to Walmart with my 3/4 blown out hair, with the one section not done in a french braid.  :)  LOL....  alas, back to a big dryer.  I really liked this but only got to use it 3 times.&lt;br /&gt;_____&lt;br /&gt;Purchased for travel because of it&#x27;s small size. Also purchased to use with Soft Hood Dryer attachment.  Wow this little dryer is quite powerful.  the switch was a little stiff to turn on at first and if feels a little cheap but Torumaliine ceramic, little power house.  love it.</li>
            <li> This tiny hair drier does the job. I have very thick, curly hair and I can dry my hair in no time with this. I of course use the included diffuser which is great.</li>
            <li> This is a great little hair dryer, especially for travel because of its size. However, it has the drying power of a regular hair dryer. It&#x27;s well made and comes with a handy carrying bag. At first, I thought the bag was just more of the over packaging but I have really been thankful for it because it keeps the wires safe in my gym bag, it makes it easy to find too.</li>
            <li> Great for travel &amp; home use since I have short hair! I still keep it in the carry case that it came in!</li>
            <li> This little blowdryer is AWESOME! I understood that it would be small when I read the measurements, but seeing it for yourself is something entirely different -- it is really small. I feel like I&#x27;m using a Barbie blowdryer. BUT! Don&#x27;t let its small size and weight fool you -- this dryer has got some major oomph! I&#x27;ve read that women with thin, fine hair need to use hairdryers with low wattage -- like, 1200 to 1500. (Even 1875 Watts, which is the standard, is too high.) So this little guy seemed perfect. Thanks to this blowdryer, I&#x27;m actually taking care of my fragile hair live I&#x27;ve been told countless times by stylists: I towel dry, then heat-style it with the Conair Mighty Mini when most of my hair is dry (which, as my fellow fine-haired ladies know, does not take long at all). It comes with a diffuser and a concentrator nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for those with normal/thicker hair, this is a perfect travel-sized dryer -- set the heat to \\&quot;HIGH\\&quot; and be amazed at the power that this wee dryer packs. Also, I love that it has dual-voltage settings, one for the U.S. and the other for Europe (and wherever else they use 250V) -- just pack along your outlet adapter and you&#x27;re set! PLUS, this dryer won&#x27;t weigh down or take up room in your suitcase at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***EDIT: A week before buying this blowdryer, I&#x27;d gotten the ends of my hair trimmed. After using the Mighty Mini for a couple of weeks now, I&#x27;ve been able to maintain healthy-looking ends, which is a huge achievement for my fragile hair. I really do think that the combination of letting most of my hair air-dry and then using a low-wattage hairdryer like this awesome Conair one is what is saving my hair. Could not recommend it ENOUGH.</li>
            <li> I bought it to use in Italy. It worked for a day, then the motor burned out. I don&#x27;t think the adapter is up to the job, the description is wrong.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer because it was small and lightweight.  It also was touted as saying it worked on dual voltage for traveling.  I tried it in the U. S. to make sure it worked.  The first time I used it in the U.K. (after switching the voltage) it got very hot and stopped working.  So disappointing. I only rated it one star because the color was nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a John Freida 1875 watt dryer, which is heavy and tiring to use, because of my physical limitations.  I ran across this hair dryer, which I stored after buying the Freida.  The only reason I replaced it is because I was looking for a dryer with a cold shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the dryer last night and it dries faster than the Freida 1825 watt dryer!  Since it&#x27;s only 1200 watts, the dryer doesn&#x27;t blow as hard.  It goes to reason that, since the air is not moving as fast, it will heat as well, if not better, than a dryer that blows you through a wall.  Since I have a lot of very fine, straight hair, which is shoulder blade length, it doesn&#x27;t take much blowing air to tangle my hair.  Because of the decreased speed of the dryer, I had no problems with tangles, yet the time it took to blow my hair dry decreased by 1/3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looked shiner last night than after using the Freida, which I attribute to the decreased wattage of the dryer. Also, the dryer is quieter than the Freida dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer to keep in my swim bag.  Even though it&#x27;s ridiculously tiny, it does a surprisingly good job of drying my (very) thick hair.  It takes my full size hairdryer about 8 minutes to pretty thoroughly dry my hair, and I&#x27;d say this little guy only takes slightly longer.  It also comes with adorable little attachments, and it stores in an adorable little zebra print bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is small and very powerfull. I like the color and the bag purchased with it is very usefull.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to travel with it.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing wrong, except that I don&#x27;t really know how tu use the accesorizes...&lt;br /&gt;Sure I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I thought I purchased a child&#x27;s toy hair dryer. This is very small and doesn&#x27;t feel very well made, but I have been using it for 6 months and I actually really like it! It works well for me - note that I have very fine hair, so if you have thick hair, it may not work as well. But I really can&#x27;t complain and I would probably buy it again!</li>
            <li> Better than my old one and prettier too! Gets the job done fast.</li>
            <li> I got this hair dryer for mom because her carpel tunnel syndrome had been acting up and her hair dryer had become too heavy for her. This hair dryer is TINY! Don&#x27;t be fooled by it&#x27;s size though, very powerful for a low-watt dryer. It&#x27;s actually kept her hair healthier from the low watts, though her drying time has remained the same. It&#x27;s also the perfect travel size hair dryer. Heck, it fits in her purse! I liked it so much I bought one for myself as well. It does not come with a &#x27;cool shot&#x27; setting, which I thought would make achieving curls more difficult. The attachments are tiny as well, so the air does not diffuse much as a regular size hair dryer does. However, because the size is so tiny and light weight it makes styling so much easier and therefore our hair looks better than ever!  I don&#x27;t have to use hot rollers anymore because I can more readily control the direction of air on my hair with each stroke much like my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> I wanted a hair dryer that would work both in the US and when traveling abroad. This dryer functioned well in Europe and everyone borrowed it. It is small, comes with it&#x27;s own zipper storage bag and is very light weight.</li>
            <li> This mini dryer is perfect for travel.  I have used it several times and am impressed.  It also came with a zipper bag for travel, which was an unexpected surprise.  It has a lot of force and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Well, I cannot say enough about this product.  As other customers have also stated, I bought it for travel and now use it every day.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so teensy tiny!  And it works very well.  It&#x27;s great for traveling and comes with an adorable little pouch. It was much smaller then I expected, but it does the job!</li>
            <li> Works fine but at their higher price no longer a good buy</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife as a travel unit, and she really likes it. Were surprised as to the small size, but yet the output was as good, or better, than most full size hair dryers. Long cord too. Comes with a storage bag, which is nice too. Also has a diffuser which attaches to the end, but my wife never uses those, but looks like all the others. Packaging however is a pain to get it out of.</li>
            <li> Great,  little, light , however POWERFUL little hairdryer. I bought it to take it to my kids swimming practice as they swim outside all year long ( california :) ). I am very pleased with the power of such a little and light thing. It comes with a 1 year warranty if I remember well. As a travel hairdryer, there are 2 setttings for electrical outlets with 100  or 220 V. It is great if you plan to take it oversea. The price is great.I just wish that this Barbie pink would not be the only color.</li>
            <li> This dryer is just cheap.  Cheap, lightweight, plasticky feeling.  Granted, it IS all of those things but I have a much nicer travel hair dryer that doesn&#x27;t feel like it is just going to snap in two...unfortunately my other one doesn&#x27;t have a diffuser which is the sole reason I got this one.  But hey, it&#x27;s only for travel...</li>
            <li> In addition to being one third the size and significantly lighter than my old dryer, it did the job in half the time of my more powerful unit with the same technology.  One other reviewer said that it burnt out after 2 weeks, but if it lasts I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great item-- quick service--thanks!</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel, small for ease of packing, light weight to handle yet dries efficiently</li>
            <li> I hate that it is pink and the case is zebra striped. Come on folks, it&#x27;s 2015! That said, the plastic is a little cheap looking but it works for what it is at its price point.</li>
            <li> Great little dryer.  Does the job perfectly and adequately.  My only complaint and the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars would be that the handle is not hinged like other brands offer so you can&#x27;t &amp;#34;fold it up&amp;#34; to save space when packing it for travel.  That&#x27;s more of an inconvenience than a product defect, however.  As far as the product is concerned, it&#x27;s great.  I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.  Oh...I did have to laugh at something.  When I originally ordered it, on Amazon it said &amp;#34;color may vary.&amp;#34;  I joked with a friend &amp;#34;watch...they&#x27;ll send me a pink one or something.&amp;#34;  Sure enough...hot pink.  I notice the photo now shows pink...it didn&#x27;t back then.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like a large, heavy hairdryer so I wanted a small one that I could also use for travel.  Works just fine.</li>
            <li> My daughters aren&#x27;t strong enough to hold my hair dryer with one hand. This is cute, lightweight, feels like a toy but is a real hair dryer that will dry your hair. Wonderful!</li>
            <li> Not the best dryer I have ever had but it is usable  Very light and feels flimsy.  I don&#x27;t think it will last as long as my other one I had for many years</li>
            <li> I dont know  how good it is .. my dog chew it up ..it was a Christmas gift so I can to go by them one from the store :(</li>
            <li> I love this little Conair hair dryer. I was replacing a small one that I gave to a friend. This was not exactly the same model, but I like it better. I give our Maltese a bath weekly between trips to the groomer, and this works well for her, too. I have only used it about 2 weeks, but I hope it lasts as long as my other favorite blow dryer. It is a Conair, and I have had it for 30 years. I am adding to this review, because I wrote the first part when I had only had the dryer for a couple of weeks. I have had it for about 6 months now and still love this hair dryer. I originally intended to only use this dryer for travelling, but I use it exclusively. It is lightweight, but powerful. I have short hair and don&#x27;t know how it would work for long hair, but I do love it. Am thinking about ordering another one in case they discontinue this one.</li>
            <li> Works just like the big boys. Same power, light weight. I love it for travel, comes with a nice carry bag.</li>
            <li> It is tiny and lightweight but very powerful. It is perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer delivered all that it promises. The one problem I had was that it shut down for 5-10mins when it overheated...I have long, thick hair so I was patient but it was a bit frustrating. It shut off 3 times during the hair drying process.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with short/med length fine hair should have no issues. Remember to change the voltage on dryer to whatever the requirements are in the country you&#x27;re visiting.</li>
            <li> Love the weight and size - but mainly I have naturally curly hair so was very happy w the diffuser.</li>
            <li> Once again something I couldn&#x27;t find on store shelves when my old one finally burned out, and once again a seller on Amazon came to the rescue, ordered 2 so I have a back up, nothing worse than your old hair dryer going on the fritz half way thru the job and no back back up, talk about bad hair day. Shipper got them to me quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a small and mighty little hair dryer. It would be easy to carry in a suitcase or even a large purse, if you have the strength to do so.</li>
            <li> I love it because it&#x27;s like a package, with a zipping bag. It&#x27;s small and light and easy for me to carry around.</li>
            <li> Really small, but does a good job of drying. I just wish there was a diffuser -my other Conair one kinda fits so I use it, but it falls on the floor sometimes.</li>
            <li> perfect for the gym, traveling, or on the go. always get compliments on this. couldnt be happier :-)</li>
            <li> Great little hair dryer for traveling with. Power is more than adequate for my usage. Wish it came in other colors.</li>
            <li> Infinity by Conair Mighty Mini Blow Dryer is awesome! It&#x27;s so small and lightweight I forget I&#x27;m holding a blow dryer!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by the small appearence, you&#x27;ll definitely get much bang for your buck with this one! I have long curly tresses and it drys my hair lickidy split.&lt;br /&gt;Would Absolutely recommend to a friend (and to a complete stranger too)!</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  Just what I wanted.  I have medium length, thick, curly hair that takes forever to dry, and was looking for a small blow dryer with a diffuser.  I wanted the blow dryer to double for daily use and travel, so my items can be useful in all ways and save space since I live in a small home.  When I first received the product and removed it from the box, I was skeptical about its ability to dry hair.  It looks like a toy.  However, it has two speeds which are comparable to other blow dryers.  It works great.  I use it every day.  I love the bag which is stylish and easily holds all the accessories plus the dryer without problems.  Finally someone who makes a storage bag where the product actually fits once the consumer uses it. (Unlike tents that you can never stuff back into the bag once you unpack them.) I loved this product so much I bought one for a gift.</li>
            <li> I used this dryer in Italy. They have a higher current, so I&#x27;m glad I read the directions. I set the dial to the correct current, and only used low setting. It was quite powerful, and dried my hair in an equal amount of time as my full sized dryer at home.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it comes with a little diffuser that works well. How cute!</li>
            <li> Looking for that perfect travel companion hair dryer, then look no further.  This little dryer takes virtually no space in your luggage and is powerful enough to dry your hair in just minutes.  Today, most hotels have dryers, but if you have this with you, you don&#x27;t have to worry about will there or won&#x27;t there be a hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone that travels.</li>
            <li> This a great little travel hair dryer. I find hair dryers in hotels/cruise ships to be quite useless.  Finally, I found this one and I love it!  It performs well beyond what you would expect from such a small dryer with a small price.  It comes with it&#x27;s own travel bag and packs easily.  I won&#x27;t travel without it.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Used this hair dryer in England last month. It worked fine with the adapter. My problem with this hair dryer is that even on the low setting the air from the dryer is too hot. I dry my hair in sections and I could hardly get a section dry before my scalp would start to burn.</li>
            <li> This is a small powerful hair dryer. It fulfills our needs very well and it has a cute color. Our 5 year old daughter can use it being so lite.</li>
            <li> No way this will fit in a purse like they say. Unless you have a huge purse. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Works well so far but feels cheaply made (light plastic). It is a good traveling size, just wish it had a cool setting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as my daily hairdryer for a couple months now. It works very well, and has more power for the size than I would have expected. That being said, it&#x27;s still small. It has as much blowing/heat power as my old one (huge/clunky), but I still think it takes slightly longer to dry my hair just because the size of the dryer itself doesn&#x27;t allow as much air to blow at once. I do love how it is so light and easy to use though.</li>
            <li> Worked well until it burned out. Worked well with both voltage settings. It trash now. Would not recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> It is powerful &amp; effective with defuser &amp; concentrator. I wanted something for traveling but too heavy. Folding handle was good, but too big for my use.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, and straight hair and this has turned out to be my go-to dryer. It gets hot enough but not too hot. It is perfect for styling. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Compact, dry hair fast. Great buy for the price! It fits in any size suitcases or bags, used it in Europe with no problem.</li>
            <li> I usually have to take my full size $$$$ hair dryer on vacation because the ones at hotels are wimpy. I decided to research smaller hair dryers &amp; this one looked great. I just tried it today &amp; to my surprise, I liked it!  It dried just as fast as my full size dryer.</li>
            <li> This is a little powerhouse of a dryer. I use it all the time instead of just for traveling. It&#x27;s light and easier to use than a big bulky one and blows my hair dry just as fast. The hot is very hot so hold it back from your head.</li>
            <li> I bought this for an upcoming trip.  It is super lightweight and easy to use.  It doesn&#x27;t have a cold shot but I don&#x27;t need one.  It also doesn&#x27;t have a folding handle, but it is still super small.  My 2 year old can handle it as it is lighter than her toy one.  It is also perfect for her hair on low.  I do recommend this to anyone especially those with mobility and dexterity issues.  It is super lightweight, super small, about the size of a female&#x27;s hand spread out, dries almost/ as fast as my Babyliss Toniro full sized dryer.  It is also cheap and comes with a little bag to put it in, though my baby has took it as her own along with the dryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited: It does include a concentrator and a diffuser, though that diffuser is so small.  I don&#x27;t have curly hair, so I don&#x27;t&#x27; use it.</li>
            <li> This little dryer works great, but a few words of advice if you are traveling outside of the US.  I went to Italy so I set the switch for 220v before I left so I wouldn&#x27;t forget.  The first time I plugged it in (with an adapter), I double checked to ensure it was set to 220.  I switched it on low and it was working fine.  I then switched it on high, and within seconds it became red hot.  I looked at it and immediately pulled the plug as it was just about to shoot flames.  When I looked at the voltage, it had changed back to 110.  With the dryer unplugged, I set it back to 220 and toggled the hi/lo switch.  What I realized is that it worked fine on the low setting.  The moment the setting was changed to hi, it also changed the voltage back to 110.  Once I got this figured out, I used it on low for the entire trip with no issues.  Low was enough to dry my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> Great gift for sister in law.  Light weight and perfect for traveling. All the attachments make this product the perfect traveling companion.</li>
            <li> This little hair dryer is indeed mighty. It is small, lightweight, and easy to handle. Perfect for travel or for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to take up half their space with storing some of the big hair dryers. Works very well as well.</li>
            <li> It was much smaller than I thought it would be.  It really looked like a toy.  I didn&#x27;t read the details close enough, I guess so I didn&#x27;t realize it was only 1200 amps instead of 1875.  I decided to give t to a little girl instead of the adult I originally purchased it for.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my 9 year-old for Christmas.  She had previously been starting to want to try drying her own hair with my larger hair dryer, but it was too big/heavy for her to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is a great size for her to use.  She has thick, curly hair, and she&#x27;s been able to dry it in a reasonable amount of time-- no longer than it takes with my larger dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased with the price.  I looked at several of similar sizes in stores that were twice as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We received the bright pink dryer with the zebra case, as pictured.  (Other reviews and the product description note that you may receive a different color combination.)  Having the bag with it is great for keeping the attachments and storing it, and the fun colors make it perfect for a girl her age.</li>
            <li> Dryer is tiny and comes with a travel bag including 2 attachments; the handle does not fold. It&#x27;s a real nice product overall.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing! For being so small, it delivers! It dries my hair faster than my full-size hair dryer, and with just as much heat. I took this to Bolivia with me for 3 months, and was able to use it 90% of the time. In a few places, even with the voltage adjustment, it would overheat and shut off. (Once I thought I killed it! But it revived...) However, the majority of the time there were no problems. (Eventually I taped the little switch to the voltage I wanted so that it wouldn&#x27;t slip over to the other, which it did a few times.)  I only wish it came in a different color. This will be my go-to hair dryer from now on - travel or not!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my 8 year old daughter who is really into styling her hair herself lately. It&#x27;s a small compact lightweight size which is most important for her. My hair dryer was just too heavy. The pink color is just the cherry on top for her.</li>
            <li> Best travel hairdryer ever! I&#x27;ve taken this little guy to Europe twice and on US vacations more times than I can count. It&#x27;s very powerful for its size and does a great job. For those who said they burned out the motor in Europe - did you switch the setting from 110 to 220? There&#x27;s a little dial you turn with a coin or screwdriver that makes it so you can&#x27;t use the high setting when you&#x27;re on 220. You won&#x27;t miss the high setting, though, because the low setting on 220 is just as strong.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my little girl (8yr old) to be able to dry hair on her own. It is the perfect weight, it is cute, it perfectly in her little hands, she loves it. It doesn&#x27;t have a guard like my Conair does to keep the hair from being sucked in the back of it (most women know what I mean) but it is well worth the price esp will all the other attachments included.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely cute and Barbie-like. It does have an option for 250v or 110v... problem is, when in Europe even tho&#x27; it was on the 250v setting, both speeds were the same: HIGH and both temperatures were the same: BOILING HOT. I couldn&#x27;t put the diffuser close to my scalp as the air was just too hot. When I got back to the states I tried it on 110v and it had two speeds and two temps but still way too warm for a &#x27;low&#x27; setting. I wasn&#x27;t able to return it because I&#x27;d passed the deadline by the time I got back from my trip. I will probably donate this... it doesn&#x27;t really work overseas unless you want to burn your scalp.</li>
            <li> looks kindda cheap but it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> This is perfect for travel.  It is the smallest dryer I have seen, but it&#x27;s power is not diminished.</li>
            <li> This is VERY small - but for me, it was perfect, because I wanted &amp;#34;small but powerful&amp;#34; for my gym bag. It does look almost like a toy - but it&#x27;s also very lightweight which is nice too. It goes on some business trips with me too because while most hotels include hair dryers, they tend to have some of the worst ones - low wattage, full of lint, etc. The attachments are itty bitty and I really don&#x27;t use them, but for a travel kit, this is ideal. At home, I use my full-size.</li>
            <li> This is not as strong as they said BUT it&#x27;s stronger than most hotel and resort dryers so still a good purchase.  It is super small so it&#x27;s great for a carry on.</li>
            <li> Love this little guy! Be sure to check out the size before you order. If the size is alright with you- get it!  It has a low and high speed.  The high speed is plenty strong enough to quickly dry my shoulder length hair.  Bought it to take on vacation in a travel trailer, but when my large dryer died I started to use this one daily. It has held up very well. If it were to die I&#x27;d get another one.</li>
            <li> Its been a week I received this hair dryer and so far I am satisfied with its performance. It is very light and small, infact smaller than a fold-able hair dryer. Perfect for traveling. It heats up instantly and dries hair faster. I intend to use it outside the country and hoping it will keep up in its performance.&lt;br /&gt;However, I think changing the voltage is not easy. have to figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;One of the reason I am giving it 5 star is for Amazon&#x27;s service. The price of this item reduced by $5 since the time I purchased it. I happened to notice it and called Amazon. they swiftly refunded my money. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and in good condition. It&#x27;s so small and perfect in my purse with my mini straightener (comes with zebra bag and pieces)</li>
            <li> This thing is seriously tiny! So tiny but boy does it pack a punch. Hot air and blows as much as any conventional sized blow dryer. I am so happy with this hairdryer I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy, product stopped working after using it only 2 times...waste of time and money...very disapointed...had good reviews but certainly didn&#x27;t live up to them..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair everyday nor do I have a lot of storage so I was having a hard time wanting to invest in a big hair dryer. This little dryer has a lot of power for being so small! I am very happy with it and the cute little storage bag that it came with.</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer thinking it would be a &#x27;smaller&#x27; size than normal but was pretty shocked to see it was TINY! Literally fits in your hand almost. It is great for traveling though and even comes with a cute travel sized pouch. Very powerful too! Just don&#x27;t buy this thinking it&#x27;s going to replace your regular hairdryer because it won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It is great for a travel blow dryer.  Powerful enough to get the job done, but because it does not put out as wide of a path of hot air as my big hair dryer it does not do the job quite as quickly and evenly as it.  The color is a metallic purpley pink.  I did receive the zebra bag and attachments with it too.  If traveling internationally be sure to read and follow the instructions or you could fry it.</li>
            <li> Does not work with longer hair. The blow dryer sucks the hair in thru the fan and can burn it and cause damage. That&#x27;s what happened to me and my daughter who both have long hair.</li>
            <li> Great little hair dryer. It&#x27;s a tad noisy in the high mode, but I love how light and easy to use it is. Cute travel bag, too.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, and this small, lightweight hair dryer does the job!  Love it!  It will be a breeze to pack it for my next trip.</li>
            <li> It is slightly bigger than what I expected but generally ok. It&#x27;s very powerful when set to high. But I can&#x27;t seems to set to the low level.</li>
            <li> I took this on my vacation and it worked wonderfully, so I purchased another. The bag will hold more than just the dryer, I threw in combs and a few other small items. I will be buying a third as a gift.</li>
            <li> Traveling a lot for work, this is great for on-the-go compact and powerful hair-drying products. Comes with cute bag and diffuser. Love it!</li>
            <li> I like the compact size.  This dryer works well and fits the space I have for it.  I hope it lasts as long as my last one, which I used for about 15 years - same brand.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for use when traveling because I like to use my own hair dryer. Turns out that it does the same great job that the expensive hair dryers do. So now I use this for my everyday hairdryer. My mom tried it and loved it so much that she got one too! The only negative is that there isn&#x27;t a cold air button. But I&#x27;ve never really needed to use it, so it&#x27;s not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> Worked great when 1st used. small size makes it easy to hold and use.  Quit working after 1 months use.</li>
            <li> This is so lightweight yet is works just as good as my normal size dryer. I ordered it because my hands and arms can&#x27;t handle holding typical dryers. It come in a cute bag tool</li>
            <li> Best little travel dryer with plenty of power......love it, love it !!!!! Conair rules !!!</li>
            <li> Actually pretty good and nice and small only bad thing is it doe not have the cold shot</li>
            <li> I would give this ZERO stars if I could! This was the biggest waste of money! I bought it to use overseas in Europe since it is dual voltage. I plugged it in to test it out and it blew up. I even had a converter and adapter that it was plugged in to. I used all my other plug ins (cell phone, curling iron, camera charger) with the adapters and had no issues except with the blow dryer. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!! It is junk!</li>
            <li> This little blow dryer is amazing! It&#x27;s very light weight but powerful. I was needing a blow dryer that wasn&#x27;t so heavy and this dryer is the one for the job. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a lightweight dryer that does a great job as well!</li>
            <li> Did not quite have the power I was looking for but it serves the purpose. Compact, relatively quiet and lightweight.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than what I thought, but works well!</li>
            <li> Yeah, finally a hair dryer I can pack in my luggage that doesn&#x27;t weigh too much. It works great and fits your hand well too.</li>
            <li> This works for me. I like a small hairdryer. It is plenty powerful and plenty pink!</li>
            <li> lightweight yet powerful.  works super good.  hair is shiny after using.</li>
            <li> This tiny hair dryer has a lot of power behind it; fits well into the vanity drawer; and easily packed for travel.</li>
            <li> excellent for travel, practical and comfortable. I use it for trips to the beach and it worked well. is important to consider is to touch the hair. does not have the power of a professional dryer</li>
            <li> This is freaking brilliant! The hair dryer works well, and it is so light weight that the plug weighs about what the dryer does. It lacks a heat setting, but I always use the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting anyway, so I shan&#x27;t miss it. Bravo!</li>
            <li> Does a good job for such a compact dryer</li>
            <li> Took to Germany. After one use, item got extremely hot, and did not work again. My hair is thin, and does not take long to dry at all. I&#x27;m going to contact Conair to see if this item has been recalled. Very disappointed. Could be a hazard,</li>
            <li> When I first opened this hair dryer, I was quite dismayed!  It was much smaller than I expected - so small in fact that I doubted that it would work at all.  Last night I washed my hair and decided to try out this &amp;#34;mini toy&amp;#34;.  I was truly amazed;  while it didn&#x27;t dry my hair quite as quickly as my large tourmaline dryer, it worked nearly as quickly.  For travel, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this dryer!</li>
            <li> Packs power for its size but the plastic gets very warm and seems like it could be a hazard after prolonged use.</li>
            <li> Great travel size, though not as quiet as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> really powerful for such a small hair dryer. loving it so far</li>
            <li> This dryer is just perfect for me.  Like some other reviewers, I use it not only for travel, but at home, too.  Really like having the attachments.  I always use it on low; haven&#x27;t even tried it on high, as it has enough power for my hair on low.  If you have very thick, curly hair, you would probably need to use the high setting.</li>
            <li> Like a previous reviewer, I was really surprised at the very small size of this dryer as I hadn&#x27;t looked carefully at its dimensions before buying. Between its size and bright pink colour, it reminded me of a Barbie beauty toy and I was sure it wasn&#x27;t going to work out for me.  However, it has been great!  It is lightweight, packs easily and is much nicer to travel with than my regular size hair dryer/diffuser combo, which I&#x27;ve been lugging around on trips for years. The diffuser is small but handles my hair well - my hair is fine textured but there is a lot of it so it can take a long time to air dry, which is why I like using a dryer.  My style is a naturally wavy/curly, chin length bob and this dryer was able to maintain that well on a 10 day trip to Europe.  In fact, the small diffuser has actually given me more targeted control when drying my hair.  I recommend this dryer highly but acknowledge that it may not work well if you have longer or thicker hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s little, and it&#x27;s POWERFUL, what more do you want from something called &amp;#34;Mighty Mini&amp;#34;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all the reviewers that complain about the size and how &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; if feels, realize that you are buying something made for travel, and that it cost a whopping $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great hair dryer and suits my needs perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a bigger, more expensive one, then go find one elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by its tiny size...it is so powerful! It dries my hair as fast and my big one! It&#x27;s cute, convenient and efficient. I love it!</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is said to be dual voltage, so HYPOTHETICALLY you should be able to use it in Europe. It is not true. I have changed the voltage as indicated and it stopped working after 23 seconds. The item had been used only twice before then. Do not but it. I would like to return it but even if it&#x27;s not even a year that I have bought it, it seems like I was covered only for few weeks after the purchase.</li>
            <li> Small did not think was gonna be so small but overall really powerful for size</li>
            <li> I always take my full size blow dryer even to nice hotels where I know they will have a blow dryer.  I decided to try this dryer and it really works.  It is so lightweight and I can&#x27;t believe it can even dry my hair.  I only take it with me now.</li>
            <li> love how my hair comes out after using this.  my hair is very fine and gets staticy but this made it look great.  ive never used a ceramic hairdryer before</li>
            <li> Arrived right on time, performs very well, is quieter than expected and is compact for traveling</li>
            <li> Works great! It&#x27;s so cute! Wonderfully small and pretty hot pink color. It does the job! I have fine hair and this dryer doesn&#x27;t overpower me or my hair. Nice and lightweight. You might think, oh, this little thing isn&#x27;t going to do anything, but it DOES! Highly recommended for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I like the small size of the dryer.  It&#x27;s size will be great for packing when traveling but is also just good for home use too!&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Light weight for my 87 yr old mom to hold.  Just hope it holds up.</li>
            <li> wonderful hair dryer .... very utilitarian ... easy to transport .... a great idea</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a trip to Italy in February.  Indeed, I am a woman who plans ahead.  I used it Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, but on Wednesday it blew out and I had to go to the grocery store to buy a new one, more powerful, that worked very well and cost the same.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Great dryer for someone with arthritis. Very light weight yet powerful for its size. You will love this dryer!!</li>
            <li> Conair Hair products are the worst. It will work well for few months and then it will stop working. When i asked couple of friends they had the same experience. Recently I bought a hair dryer and after 8 months it stopped working. When i called conair for warranty they asked me to send it to AZ with $7 in the pack (it will cost me 20$). Please dont trust Conair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and works just fine.</li>
            <li> The fan tore my hair out.  Terrible.  It sucks your hair through the back and it gets stuck.  Buy this if you want to literally rip your hair out.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with quality of product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This small hair dryer so far seems to be working very well.  Compact so travels well.  Good grip, pretty powerful, and has attachment I like.  Would recommend this to anyone not wanting to spend a lot and needs a small dryer to travel with.</li>
            <li> Great little hair dryer! I needed something that was easy to pack for traveling AND had a diffuser. I love this little dryer.</li>
            <li> Works great for traveling.</li>
            <li> so powerful for such a small hair dryer! Works great!</li>
            <li> Good air flow for a small dryer.  It is light and easily packed, comes with a bag to contain the cords and dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Overall quite satisfied with the dryer.</li>
            <li> Bought as a travel dryer, but it&#x27;s so light and powerful that I use it at home every day :)</li>
            <li> It works very well,  The weight was fine, but I expected it to be a little smaller since I was looking for something that would easily fit into a small carry on bag.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Works so well I never want another dryer again.</li>
            <li> Love it! Small and extremely light-weight but packs a good amount of power.</li>
            <li> This is an okay product. If you avidly blow-dry your hair get a bigger one. But for the occasional use it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> It is soooo light, it&#x27;s more powerful than expected! I have medium length hair and it dried quickly even on the lower setting. This is my 1st tourmaline ceramic hair dryer and I&#x27;m very impressed. I plan to replace my daily dryer with this one or maybe another tourmaline ceramic one because it has definitely improved the smoothness of my hair. Also comes with black/white storage bag which is kinda nice. It does not fold, which I knew when I purchased it but it&#x27;s not necessary feature since it&#x27;s so small! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife - but she tells me that it is no good. The heat is not strong enough and when used for longer than 2 mins it will just turn off, until it cools off.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use at the gym, and it does the job. Not amazing, but it is tiny so I wasn&#x27;t expecting a powerful machine. The great thing is that it comes with a difuser and a concentrator.</li>
            <li> I love the size and the results it gives me. My hair never frizzes with this dryer.  I also have a folding travel dryer similar to this one and I think they are both tops!</li>
            <li> The diffuser is very small and the hair blows all over . The dryer itself works fine I am a hairdresser and usually don&#x27;t see a travel size diffuser except for the socks which I do not like so I was disappointed when this did not work well at all too much airflow through the diffuser.</li>
            <li> Very nice little hair dryer for the money. Good reviews are what sold me, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this little barbie looking thing but the power is amazing on this little device. I have very thick hair that takes forever to dry with a normal size dryer. This one is just as good as the big ones. Very surprised and happy to have found this for traveling.</li>
            <li> Works great for little hands. My seven year old loves it. No issues to report .</li>
            <li> Surprisingly light and effective for drying my hair. It came with extra attachments in a cute zebra-striped bag. I wouldn&#x27;t use it on the highest setting or for long periods of time. It is super small and easy to take around.</li>
            <li> I think I should give this hairdryer a five star cuz for the price and the size, it&#x27;s definitely a satisfactory for me. Would be perfect if it could bent but what the heck.&lt;br /&gt;It does the job really good with 1200W. The nozzle of course helps a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I got the older blue Conair travel hairdryer, can&#x27;t remember the name and I liked it, but this one is way better.</li>
            <li> I like this hair dryer a lot. It&#x27;s small enough to put it in my bag and travel with me, and strong enough to dry my hair perfectly! Although the color of the product is unlike the picture that showing on here. It is more pinkish color.</li>
            <li> I bought this to blow dry my baby&#x27;s hair. It is the perfect size for her when she gets older to dry her own hair. It is strong enough to dry hair quickly, but not to the point of burning hair/scalp.</li>
            <li> Really good - small but dries my hair well.</li>
            <li> Very good hair dryer. Compact and easy to pack.</li>
            <li> Love the size, love the color, it even has a slow speed that gives off an appropriate amount of heat.</li>
            <li> It most definitely is not this color or this size, but it&#x27;s easy to travel with and it work.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for traveling, and like that it has both diffuser and concentrator attachments.  I wish it had a cool setting but I can live without it for he price I paid—although I see it&#x27;s come down in price a little bit which makes it a better value.  The storage pouch is very handy to keep counters less cluttered.  I checked out some mini hairdryers that cost up to 5 times as much—no way for something I may use 3 times in a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish t had a flat diffuser without the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; — I used to have that kind and prefer it.</li>
            <li> It has pretty good power to it. I use it when I go on travel and it fits perfectly into the bag it comes with. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement of the same blow dryer that I had purchased based on a recommendation from a magazine. The blow dryer is very light and had good power but failed completely in less than 2 months. I have had the replacement for 3 wks now and there are times the motor slows and I think it too is going to stop completely.</li>
            <li> What a powerful little thing !!! When you first get it, you&#x27;re like naaahh, this cute little toy won&#x27;t be able to do much!&lt;br /&gt;But boy, would you be wrong !&lt;br /&gt;It dried my hair faster than my $60 dryer!! It&#x27;s a power house packed in a tiny package! Yup ppl, size doesn&#x27;t matter :-)</li>
            <li> Great size for travel.  Received the pink model as pictured.  I have curly hair and I did&#x27;t want a powerful blowdryer that blows out all of my curls.  Took off 1 star for noise; not too quiet.</li>
            <li> i like it. It is conair. I have one that its about 18 yrs old. Its conair.  Conair is good quality.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a monthly back-packing trip to South America. It broke after a week.  It should not be allowed to operate on High mode in countries with lower voltage.</li>
            <li> I use this as my home hairdryer, not just when I&#x27;m traveling although the bag it comes with makes it perfect for that too. It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power but my hair is really fine so a lot of hairdryers seem a little bit of overkill for me. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone with really thick hair though as it might take a lot longer to dry.</li>
            <li> I just got it and used it yesterday..wow!  I cannot believe how powerful it is. I love, love, love it and hope it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is really perfect for short hair, and a quick blow dry. I would not recommend this product to anyone with long hair, I would say just above the shoulder&#x27;s would be the \\&quot;cut off\\&quot;. It does dry my hair very quickly for a small dryer, but I do have super short, :pixie: type hair. I love the tiny zebra print travel bag this product comes with along with the diffusers. I feel that it is def worth the price, its light and great for traveling, much better then using those \\&quot;Hotel stuck to the wall hair dryers!\\&quot;. I do use this for everyday use and it has held up fine. Totally worth the $15</li>
            <li> It is a good travel blow dryer.  It&#x27;s almost cute, it&#x27;s so small,  I have very long, thick hair so it does take a little bit longer to dry than larger travel blow driers but it gets the job done.  If you have shorter or thinner hair, this will work perfectly for you.</li>
            <li> I love my light weight hair blower !  It is quick and easy and my hair comes out so soft and not frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;It has two heat settings. I start out with the high one for a couple of minutes and then switch to the low&lt;br /&gt;and it still dries nicely but does not stress my hair. I have very fine hair and lots of it so it is not easy to&lt;br /&gt;dry. Oh, and my hair is long. This dryer is keeping my hair so nice people ask me how I make my hair&lt;br /&gt;look like it belongs on a 30 year old. I&#x27;m 65. This wonderful blower has a lot to do with it !</li>
            <li> Perfect for My 6 yr old daughter. Fits her hands perfect, Mini and Mighty, she uses the low setting, the high setting is very powerful.</li>
            <li> Tiny, almost toy like. Decided to stick it in the cabinet for an emergency backup.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the size of the hairdryer.  It works great, even better than my regular, larger hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This is a great little hair dryer.  I  have chin length hair and it was perfect.  There is a lot of air coming out!! It comes with a little carry case, and several min-attachments. Very light weight.  It only has a high and a low setting - so there is no real temp control.</li>
            <li> Seems great at first, but it&#x27;s not great for long hair unless your unnaturally careful while using it. It&#x27;s always a possibility that long hair can get sucked into the back end of a hair dryer, but because of the extremely small size, it happens extremely easily with this one. Especially if you flip your head upside down to dry it, you lose even more control. The first time it sucked some hair up, it lost significant drying force. The second time, it stopped working altogether. Not to mention the hair loss. It is, however, without a doubt, the most adorable hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> I love the size and the bag it comes with.  It really helps at keeping all my hair clips and dryer in one place.  It dries hair fairly quickly, but I&#x27;ve had other travel dryers dry quicker.  BUT, you don&#x27;t get that burning smell you do from others.  I have the little, red one from Babyliss.  That&#x27;s smaller and lighter, but I would get a burning smell when using it.  It scares me when I smell that.  Not sure if it&#x27;s burning dirt or my hair.  So, I switched to this one.  The air isn&#x27;t too hot but loads of volume.  If I don&#x27;t turn it off and put it on the counter to quickly move my clip to pull out more hair, it falls off from the air pushing against the wall.  I also forget to switch the switch down instead of up for high.  When I&#x27;m just styling, I&#x27;ll stick to low.  But I usually try to dry and style with a round brush simultaneously causing me to stick with high.  It&#x27;s louder than T3&#x27;s old model travel blow dryer but less high pitched than Babyliss.  Very lightweight.  Wish it would fold.  Then it would take up less space.  But, the space between the dryer in the bag fits the cord.  I like the length of the cord.</li>
            <li> If your only requirements for a travel blow drier are that it dries your hair fast, then this is adequate. It dries your hair. It dries it fast.&lt;br /&gt;BUT if you would like your hair to have volume or look shiny or healthy or any other good adjective, then you, like me, have come to the wrong place. This blow drier has been the bane of my poor hair&#x27;s existence throughout the month I&#x27;ve spent traveling with it, and although my normal hair drier is about 4x as bulky, I really really wish I had brought it instead. Because this stupid little pink monster hates your hair.&lt;br /&gt;It instantly strips away any trace of moisture your hair previously had, as if you had used no conditioner. It makes it flat, brittle, excessively dry, frizzy (even if your hair normally has no propensity to be frizzy), and just overall look unhealthy, despite any products you may use pre-blow dry to do just the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m finding myself wondering how this could have four stars overall, and I think it&#x27;s because reviews either (a) wrote a review after only using it a couple of times, as maybe they just had a weekend trip and only had to use it once or twice, or (b) the only requirement they had of the product is for it to work. After using this horrible little thing for a month straight, I can confidently say that it is the worst blow drier I have ever used, and that became immediately apparent whenever the place I was staying had any other blow drier I could use.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, f you&#x27;re planning on using this thing for more than a weekend, and/or you care about your hair at all, do not get this product.</li>
            <li> This is actually an OK travel dryer given its size, but it doesn&#x27;t let you regulate temp but only pu tit on high or low. The high setting gets much too hot to use as well as blowing hard. If you only use the low setting OR if you don&#x27;t care about your hair being fried on High, then it might work for you.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS!  I  have average hair thickness. I love this drier. It&#x27;s small and light and easy to manipulate.  It has a good blow strength.  Its my second one.  The first one lasted 5 years, but it was only $15.00. I am ok with that. I like it because it is easy to hold and manipulate in different directions to self- style.</li>
            <li> My granddaughters each needed a hair dryer.  I ordered this for one of them  She loved It.  Small but powerful.</li>
            <li> This is great for the price.  Light weight and quiet.  It works great for my fine hair.  It gives my hair nice &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34;.  It might be too weak for someone with thick long hair.  It is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> i wanted a blowdryer that i could easily travel with.&lt;br /&gt;This little dryer has lots of power. and very happy that is comes with the concentrator (which many of the others dont).&lt;br /&gt;only thing is it does get pretty hot, so you just have to get used to getting around that.</li>
            <li> Love it nice for travel</li>
            <li> This little dryer is amazing.  Not only is it great for trips but for people with little strength in hands and shoulders.  My cousin just loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this little dynamo.  I bought it for travel and when my home dryer broke I used this little wonder.  It works better and faster than any dryer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on vacation in Europe, because my blow dryer is too powerful. I have long thick hair, and while it dried most of my hair in pretty decent time, I don&#x27;t even want to think about how long it would have taken me to actually blow it out with a round brush. Good if you just want to dry it off so you can flat iron it or curl it, but I don&#x27;t recommend if you actually want to style it using the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> It broke on me on the second use...Looks and feels cheap.  I rather pay more for a higher quality product.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer. It is small but still compact an powerful. I recommend to all who need a good hair dryer at a afordable price. Super cute an stylish an super durable. Definatly worth it.</li>
            <li> Use it at home as your &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; hairdryer or bring it with you on trips.  So light &amp; easy with lots of power.  Love the color too!</li>
            <li> It seems well built and is light but not as small as I thought. I use it in a 240v area mainly so it is always on high (don&#x27;t forget to change the switch to 240v or it will allow to you have high speed and supersonic jet speed, which is probably not good for it or your hair).</li>
            <li> Space saver and just as powerful as an average size hair dryer. This is my favorite! As long as they sell them I will buy them!</li>
            <li> i really like this hair dryer it is small but really dries nicely i hate the big ones the are so bulky but this one is just right love it !!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying my second mini to keep at my family&#x27;s house when I visit and a third for a friend who travels.  The other I&#x27;ve had for years and I use every day.  It fits perfectly by my small sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really love about this dryer is the diffuser.  It&#x27;s easy to find a travel dryer with a concentrator, but to find one with both is a winner!  I have thick curly hair and now my arms don&#x27;t get tired.  And I like the 2 heat settings.  Who cares about the color?!</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair and it is gentle enough on my hair and gives me the volume I need.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Small. No negatives.</li>
            <li> This dryer is small and light, making it very easy to use on my short hair.  Also , note wattage is only 1200, which is better for my house.  (so many dryers are much more).  It has plenty of power.</li>
            <li> Great little blow dryer</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is a great size for travel, very light, and packs quite a bit of power. I actually wish there was a lower setting so I could control the shaping of my bangs a little better, but all in all this is a great dryer. Perfect for my purposes (travel light) and good enough to use at home.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is fantastic and quite strong for being so small.  The best part is the dual voltage feature--it works wherever you travel.</li>
            <li> Easy to tote around.  Small and light enough to keep in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> great! it is small and light but blow quickly.</li>
            <li> Just got it.&lt;br /&gt;It broke right after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I tried putting it in different sockets, still didn&#x27;t work. &amp;#62;.&amp;#62; Horrible defective product.</li>
            <li> This little dryer is great. I bought it because it converts to 240 volt because we were going to be traveling. Worked great on the trip and now I carry it all the time. It is super light weight. It actually works as well as my full size salon hair dryer that I use at home.</li>
            <li> GREAT!! this worked like a champ during our 2 week Europe trip. we even used it to help dry clothes and it didn&#x27;t blow any fuses even when plugged into the European adapters.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as others led me to believe. However, it is cute and very easy to travel with. It will be a staple in my suitcase from now on.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I am going back to Conair for a travel dryer .. as my last was a Revlon one that overheated and blew out after 2 minutes on 220V.  I had a Conair one before that I lost but it worked really well internationally, this brand seems to be good at dual voltage.  I tried this dryer out at home.  It is nice, the ceramic really leaves hair soft and shiny, less frizzy.  It is only 1200 so works more slowly and runs a little hotter than the full size 1875 watt dryer I use at home, but adequate and my hair looks better than I&#x27;d expect with a travel dryer, and it&#x27;s certainly a massive improvement over anything you&#x27;d find in a hotel room.  Will have to report back on performance on 220V.</li>
            <li> I have been a blowdry failure all my life! Just can&#x27;t seem to use a normal-size blow dryer to style my hair without blowing all the previously styled hair to smithereens. When I opened the box for this dryer and saw how small it was, I thought \\&quot;What, is this battery-operated?? It will take forever to dry my hair!\\&quot; But I have been pleasantly surprised. It is powerful enough to dry my thick hair, and lightweight enough that my arm  doesn&#x27;t tire when I style for volume. I can move it around and hold it up in the air, behind my head, whatever. If you have limited arm movement or muscles that fatigue easily, this is the dryer for you. I do wish it had a \\&quot;cold shot\\&quot; button, but that is the only drawback.</li>
            <li> Hairdryer stopped blowing warm air about a month after the warranty expired. Was a decent dryer before that.</li>
            <li> Its small but perfect for my little girl who is 9 and starting to do her own hair. It is powerful and the accessories and cute bag are a good way for me to teach her how to organize her beauty regime.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a bulkier travel-size hair dryer. Dries my thick hair quickly and fits easily in my limited space in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> This is one of my wife&#x27;s favorite presents.  It puts out a forceful flow of air, dries her shoulder length hair quickly and fits snugly in her gym bag</li>
            <li> I purchased this mini hairdryer because I travel a lot, and because I have a small bathroom and I don&#x27;t like taking up a lot of precious counter space. Plus, is it just me, or have regular-sized hair dryers doubled in size over the past few years? They&#x27;re huge and over-sized, in my opinion. I saw that this came with a travel bag (zebra-striped) as well as a diffuser and concentrator attachment. For the price (around $15), I thought this was a great deal. I was expecting to be let down by this little hair dryer, but I was pleasantly surprised with it! It works great, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. The only thing that would make this better would be if they could include a &#x27;cool&#x27; setting, but for the price I paid, I&#x27;m not complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you travel a lot or if you just don&#x27;t want a huge hairdryer, this is a great hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Heat stops working sometimes. Still blows air.</li>
            <li> ordered purple, got red/pink. plus my hair get caught in the intake</li>
            <li> Nice lite and easy to pack</li>
            <li> Purchased to take to Mexico and it is quite powerful for a TINY dryer!  Doesn&#x27;t take up much suitcase space.</li>
            <li> My old hair dryer died.  I wanted something small and lightweight so my arm wouldn&#x27;t get tired.  This works great.  Dries my hair fine, I do have short hair though.  I don&#x27;t think I will ever use the diffuser and the other doohickey.  Very satisfied.  I also like the pouch.  Nice for travel.</li>
            <li> Small and lightweight and gets the job done</li>
            <li> My favorite hair dryer. I was getting tired of holding the bigger ones above my shoulders &amp; looking for something small. It is powerful &amp; effective for my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> It is a good travel size hair dryer. It makes my damaged hair shiny and silky.</li>
            <li> So cute and perfect for 6 year old granddaughter as she starts to care for her own hair ( her choice)</li>
            <li> This little dryer is a dynamo packed in a small package.  I really like the two speeds.  The size is perfect, and it works great.</li>
            <li> Love this little dryer. I want one for my bathroom. Using in my daughters bathroom but do plan to travel with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not metallic coloring as I thought it would be it&#x27;s pink which is OK I guess. It is a really cheap dryer and that is OK too because I didn&#x27;t buy it for drying hair. I do question how long it would last while any lengthy usage though. I bought it for it&#x27;s size because I will be using it for my craft work, fills my needs just fine.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed in this hair dryer.  The button on it didn&#x27;t work properly and I was unable to change amps from 250 to 125 when needed.  It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Awesome dryer. Quite small but very good quality and good power. In my opinion the only thing is lacks is a cold setting, but I can live without that. Good for an everyday hair dryer, not just for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;-Small size&lt;br /&gt;-Quality of construction&lt;br /&gt;-Power&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;-No cold setting</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 7 year old daughter.  I use it to do her hair and occasionally she uses it to do her own hair.  It works great for both of us.  It is especially great for younger girls because it is small and light.  It will also be good for travel.  It is good for adults too.</li>
            <li> Used it once...and it doesn&#x27;t work now.  I had to go the rest of my trip in Brazil without having a hair dryer.  Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I want a refund, but no invoice with dryer, so canmnot contact anyone to do so. Didn&#x27;t realize it is a dryer for travelling, too small for regular every day use. so cannot reccommend. Have not used it. Not happy.</li>
            <li> I returned mine. I got it to take with me to the gym to dry my hair after a sweaty workout and it was not powerful enough for my thick hair. I get it, its a travel size so it wont be as powerful as the regular one but still, it was useless for me.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. I use it as both my everyday dryer and my travel dryer. It&#x27;s just as powerful as a full-size but without the weight and bulk. I&#x27;m seriously never going back to a full-size dryer again.</li>
            <li> this hair dryer is nice and light and easy for me to handle...works good especially since I have arthritis in my hands</li>
            <li> Fantastic little hair dryer I bought for my trip later this year. I&#x27;ve only been able to work it on the 250 setting here in Australia, but it seems great so far. Make sure if you&#x27;re Australian and you plug it in with the adapter that you don&#x27;t put it on high! I didn&#x27;t read the instructions and nearly blew it up haha. Can only be used on low here, but that&#x27;s fine as it&#x27;s for my trip to the US anyways. Was quite powerful and I think it&#x27;ll be perfect.</li>
            <li> Love the size &amp; power of this mighty mini...especially appreciate the diffuser because I have short hair and most dryers are far too powerful.  With the 1200watts instead of the usual 1500watts, plus the diffuser I can dry my hair without blowing away my hair style.  I went back and purchased a second one...... love it that much!</li>
            <li> Although I loved the idea of this product (the bag is a great idea and is super cute!), this dryer is not good for curly hair.  The diffuser is too small and air is too hot - made my hair dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> My daughter just loves this small hair dryer.  However, it is advertised on Amazon having 1200 watts.  I have a Kill-A-Watt&#x27;s meter to test the house wattage, and this hair dryer reads 981 watts on high and 255 watts on low setting.  However, it works great and saves some energy.</li>
            <li> Small and light weight yet does the job. Handle does not fold, so it is not compact for traveling. Noisy.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews saying this blow dryer was small, yet powerful.  I had a little chuckle when I opened the box - it reminded me exactly of a blow dryer that Barbie would own and even comes with it&#x27;s own zebra bag for storage.  I am very impressed at how well it works.  I travel for vacation at least once a year and am never that impressed with the blow dryers the hotels provide.  I have very thick wavy hair that takes a good 10-15 minutes to blow dry with a decent dryer.  This little dryer is comparable with my full size blow dryer, if not better.  I would definitely recommend it for travel.  I have not yet used the attachments so I cannot comment on them, however I did use the bag for added storage of my hair brush and hair accessories.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a blow dryer that was small and light weight to for in my suitcase. This really fit the bill. It was even smaller than expected but every bit as powerful as a full sized unit.</li>
            <li> Works well. Lite weight for travel or home.</li>
            <li> Cute but cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s a professional grade dryer, but I have trouble working with the heavier ones so this is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the price is right.</li>
            <li> I ordered this travel dryer because we were going to Europe for a month. I used it twice and it quit working.</li>
            <li> nice size  didn&#x27;t take up much room in my luggage</li>
            <li> Sucked my hair into it! It feels cheep and smelled like burning plastic.  I threw it away.</li>
            <li> Tiny, lightweight, but packs a powerful punch!</li>
            <li> Just right for small hands</li>
            <li> Although I bought this for travel, I like it more then my regular sized dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Its pink but appears purple in the picture, thats the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.</li>
            <li> Tiny but mighty.  It does the job even on the low setting, and my hair is very long and fine and takes forever to dry.  I used this in Europe with the switch to the proper voltage setting for a non-US current.  It worked just fine. Love this little guy - light weight and powerful.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and weight for taking to the gym.</li>
            <li> So hot I couldn’t use it except to thaw ice in my freezer.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this model to take on a trip to Ireland since my luggage space was limited and the Infiniti was lightweight and compact. It quickly became my go-to hairdryer and I now use it everyday. I have short hair and find the lower setting is sufficient to dry my hair without over drying it. Because it is so lightweight I was initially concerned that it might not hold up to daily use but 2 1/2 years later, the hair dryer is still going strong. Because I travel frequently I ordered a second dryer to keep in my traveling bag.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old is taking on more responsibility with her personal care.  My hairdryer was much too big and heavy for her to manage on her own.  I found this dryer and it is absolutely perfect!  It is lightweight and the right size for her little hands.  She loves the color and the zebra storage pouch it comes with.  One minor complaint is that the high setting is loud and quite shrill; a much higher pitch than my blow dryer.</li>
            <li> This dryer works fine, it does just what I wanted. The color is quite pink, and it&#x27;s very small, almost like a toy. Smaller than I thought it would be. It would be really nice for a young girl. It will be great for traveling too. It serves the purpose for me and works fine.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying using this for my travel size hair dryer--it is so perfect and takes up absolutely no room at all.  My granddaughter loved it!  It is 1200 watts of power and dries your hair in good timing.  It also doesn&#x27;t overheat your scalp in the process.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is a joke. You couldn&#x27;t even dry a baby&#x27;s curls with this. It looks like a toy.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel. Blows my shoulder length hair dry in minutes. I&#x27;ve only used it in the US. If I go international, I read I should set it on a low setting to work. For the price, I figured I could slow dry my hair when I travel abroad.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as described but better than most mini hair dryers.&lt;br /&gt;Small and lightweight.</li>
            <li> Remember that weird TV Show with the robot little girl and the old man, &amp;#34;Small Wonder?&amp;#34; Well, this dryer is kinda like that: tiny, slightly disconcerting-at-first, but, in the end, pretty remarkable. This thing is tiny (when I took it out of the box, I was like, &amp;#34;Is this actually for people? Not for like, a really vain American Girl Doll?&amp;#34;). I have really big man-hands but even so, the actual dryer, without the diffuser, is probably only about 7 inches from front to back, top to bottom. So, it was perfect for my gym bag. But I had suspicions that it would actually work. I have a short pixie cut but my hair is pretty thick so I need a lot of heat to dry it quickly. As I usually have to, when I&#x27;m running late to work from the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, this thing BURNS. Like, almost literally. It gets very hot, and there is plenty of power in this teeny little package. The cute carrying bag is a nice bonus (it&#x27;s smaller than a brown lunch bag). I easily dry my hair in five minutes. The curl-infuser thing is also really handy for getting to my roots, even though I don&#x27;t need it for curls. All around, I&#x27;m really happy with this little guy. If only it wasn&#x27;t Jem and the Holograms pink...</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t get a good blow dry first my hair is a mess.  Hotel/cruise ship hair dryers are not great for that but I don&#x27;t want to add a big blow dryer to my luggage.  This hair dryer saved the day.  Small but powerful.  Also came with a cute bag for it!!</li>
            <li> Small but powerful.  Takes up very little space and has attachments.  I bought it for travel but it has already replaced my large cumbersome home dryer.</li>
            <li> I wanted a lightweight, easy to use blow dryer with a diffuser at a decent price and this is it!  Works very well on my short curly hair.</li>
            <li> I recently went on an 8 day trip to Hawaii, and knew I&#x27;d need a dryer.  Although most hotels come with one these days, I have SUPER finicky multi-ethnic hair (Japanese and Caucasian), and wanted to have a dryer with me that wasn&#x27;t just your basic tool.  My mother and I both used the MiniPRO (she&#x27;s full Japanese) and we both loved it!  She called it a &amp;#34;Barbie&amp;#34; styling tool, due to it&#x27;s very compact size and vibrant pink color.  These were loving nicknames, though, as it did all we asked of it.  It comes with 2 attachments, which are a concentration nozzle, and a diffuser.  I used the diffuser twice, and it was excellent both times.  It also comes with a handy carry bag to keep everything organized!  It also made identifying it that much quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, we got a lot of use out of it on our trip, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it for travel.  If I didn&#x27;t already have a great hair dryer for home use, I&#x27;d probably use it at home, because it takes up so little room!</li>
            <li> This is completely adorable and comes in a zebra striped bag.  What&#x27;s not to love?  Oh yeah, great job at drying my hair as well!</li>
            <li> My wife was looking for a small hair dryer that would not to hot. This product was just perfect. It is small but powerful enough to dry hair quickly. It may not be good for someone with alot of hair. It has two speeds, high and low but only one heat temperature. It would be more helpful it had a warm and a hot temperature, but for the price it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> The Infiniti by Conair Mighty Mini Tourmaline Ceramic Styler has traveled to many countries with me thanks to the ability to change voltage and is my favorite travel hair dryer.  I&#x27;m amazed at how powerful the hair dryer is for such a small product.  It&#x27;s very light weight, small, and the carrying case easily slips into a carry on or packed luggage.  The attachments (though I never use them) are a nice addition as well.  I do have to say that in some hotels and countries, I cannot use the high setting, I have to use the low setting otherwise the hairdryer will over heat.  I haven&#x27;t had this problem in the US as much as I have in Europe.  It&#x27;s really not that big of a deal because the low setting is still EXTREMELY powerful and drys my hair in a matter of minutes.  I have had several other mini dryers (both by Connair and by Revlon) but this is by far my favorite.  I&#x27;ve had it for four years and I hope to be able to use it for many more years to come! I always recommend it to my students on study abroad programs and to friends who do a lot of traveling!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dryer 3-4 times a week for about 3 months now.  The Infiniti is quieter, smaller (about 6&amp;#34; high and 5 ¾&amp;#34; long) and lighter in weight than my old dryer, all reasons why I picked the Infiniti.  This dryer is so light-weight that it feels cheap, but so far seems to be working like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;  This is my first tourmaline ceramic dryer, and it does seem to leave my hair smoother, but not enough that I&#x27;d be willing to toss my flat-iron.  I have thinner hair, about mid length between chin and shoulder, and I am able to dry it pretty quickly with the Infiniti.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m a satisfied customer :)</li>
            <li> Awesome small and compact great for traveling. Works fantastic and a pretty color. Use it everyday with the neat attachments.</li>
            <li> LOVE this hair dryer! I have short hair and discovered I really don&#x27;t need to use a full size dryer. This little one has mighty power. Big ones have similar power, but are heavy &amp; make my shoulder sore. I have used this every day for several months and it is great! I am considering buying another one, just to have as backup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added bonus - the Conair MIghty Mini takes a LOT less space in my drawer too. It makes styling my hair pretty darn easy (and I have difficult hair!). The package comes with a directional nozzle, a diffuser, and a cute zebra bag. I think it&#x27;s a pretty good deal for the price. It may sound silly, but this gadget has improved my life. My daily morning ritual is easier &amp; quicker due to this little machine.</li>
            <li> The barrel gets hot right away. Doesn&#x27;t have much power. Got it for the diffuser and that works as expected.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for traveling. I need to use a diffuser and this did the trick for traveling, and it&#x27;s more powerful than expected.</li>
            <li> bought it as a christmas gift for my lil sister and she absolutley loved it ! it has laste us a while now</li>
            <li> Small. cheap and works well for what it is. Don&#x27;t expect the power from a full size dryer but this works great as a mini dryer for traveling.</li>
            <li> So far I love it, the size and weight are perfect. I haven&#x27;t taken it out of the country yet but as of right now it&#x27;s worked great.</li>
            <li> Works as promised! I also looked at it and thought I had received a toy hairdryer- but it works works works! I took it with me on my trip to WA and all three family members used it daily. It is quick! It does not cause fizz or flyaways. The attachments are plastic-but for the price it works wonderfully. Will buy again and recommend it to the ladies :-) PS: The zebra bag was a delight to use for travel and for personal when travel is over :-)</li>
            <li> High powered and compact, it is the perfect little travel blow dryer.  I also love the little attachable defuser and straightener.  Way too cute and works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> I plugged it in Turkey and it blew out right away, so I didn&#x27;t have a hair dryer during my stay there. I am giving it 1 star, since I can&#x27;t seem to be able to choose 0. The only purpose I bought this dryer for, was to use it in Europe.</li>
            <li> This is a great first hair dryer for my teenager.</li>
            <li> Got this for travel purposes. Used it 2-3 weeks ago. Takes longer to dry my hair (which I expected due to less wattage) and it makes my hair more frizzy (which I did not expect). This is in comparison to the Revlon Rv544blu Tourmaline Ionic 1875 Watt Dryer, which I also got from Amazon. The product came exactly as shown in picture.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the Babyliss hairdryer I had for many years. It&#x27;s effective for being so tiny and definitely convenient for travel. It seems to work as well as the Babyliss which is much more expensive.  It&#x27;s kind of a tacky hot pink but I didn&#x27;t really care. There&#x27;s a low and high setting and comes with a couple equally tiny attachments. There&#x27;s no cool shot and the biggest problem I have is that unlike a full size hairdryer, a few hairs can get sucked into the back end and get all burned up but it&#x27;s not hard to avoid that issue. If you have long hair and want to get up under and near the roots you may be best to stick to a regular hairdryer though.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Great for traveling.  Easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for years for a smaller hair dryer and this one is great.  I have very thick, long natural curly hair and this dries it in record time.  It&#x27;s so great and convenient to pack to travel.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Compact size is great for traveling.  It comes with attachments, but they&#x27;re kind of a joke.  Let&#x27;s be honest, if we really &amp;#34;need&amp;#34; to use our diffuser while traveling, we would find a way to schlep our full-sized dryer w/ diffuser attachment with us on our trip.  This compact dryer is more the type of thing I would take when I don&#x27;t know if the hotel I&#x27;ll be staying at has hair dryers (i.e., a non-chain hotel or a foreign hotel).  I would not recommend this hair dryer for normal everyday use.</li>
            <li> very loud and have burning smell. from the first use you know it will die soon.</li>
            <li> This thing is TINY! I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so little. Kinda flimsy too.</li>
            <li> This is a very decent little hair dryer: very inexpensive, two speeds and heats, but it packs punch for its size. I wish it were some other color (not a huge fan of pink), but I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> For a travel dryer, this little dryer fits the bill.  Featherweight.  I wish there was a medium speed and heat, but that&#x27;s hard to get in something this small.  I love the concentrator - it&#x27;s really narrow and makes drying you hair in sections a breeze.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I have very thin fine hair and only use a hair dryer for spot drying on occasion. I had a great little travel dryer that worked great for years until it recently just died on me. In looking for a new dryer I found most were too big and bulky for me, as well as too powerful for my hair. This dryer had the lowest wattage I could find. While it&#x27;s still a bit too powerful for me, it serves my purpose, as it is small and lightweight. The only improvement I would have made would have been to have a foldable handle.</li>
            <li> This does dry my hair.  It is very light and compact but it does not have a lot of power even for my short hair!</li>
            <li> Great to start with but broke after 5 months with very little use</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this hair dryer and decided to give it a try. Going on a big trip and definitely needed a small travel size dryer. This hairdryer is amazing for its size.  I have fine hair but a lot of it and this thing works great great, it&#x27;s amazing for its size how much power it has. I have a very expensive Ionic ceramic dryer and this thing dries my hair just as well. I&#x27;ve actually even started using it on an every day basis and for the price you cannot go wrong!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s dryer is about 30 years old and needed replacement. She loves this lightweight model, and the attachments, and the storage bag.</li>
            <li> This is now my favorite hair dryer. I use it every day. It&#x27;s so light my wrist doesn&#x27;t get tired.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as a full sized hair dryer even though it is the size of a toy!!</li>
            <li> A great little travel hair dryer, very light yet powerful. Works even better than my full sized one. I use it at home too.</li>
            <li> With most hairdryers, my hair frizzes up. With this one, it comes out softer and more managable. It is very tiny compared to most hairdryers, but still very worth it.</li>
            <li> I have quite a bit of hair and it has always taken me a long time to dry it with a dryer.  For as small as this baby is, it does a great job of drying hair.  It is probably not for someone who styles and brushes out their hair while drying, but I am a simple person and it suits my needs.  Love that it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space and love that it&#x27;s pink.  If you&#x27;re not looking for anything fancy, travel quite a bit and want a dryer for basic hair-drying needs, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This little baby is awesome! I got it primarily to take with me when I travel, but now I use it at home instead of my regular hair dryer. It gets really hot (but not so hot that it has singed my hair or anything), and it has a lot of power for such a small blow dryer. Very lightweight too. Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this little dryer, it is so manageable to use.  I did buy it because of an injury to my arm, only allowing me a limited range of motion.  I was concerned as to how I could possibly use a hair dryer.  This one certainly fit the bill.  It is lightweight, and dries my hair in such a short time.  It also comes with attachments and a nice little case. For me, it works better than any heavy, bulky one I have used before.</li>
            <li> I love my hot pink mini-pro, so lightweight and Powerful!  The super cute tote bag is a plus!  Perfect for travel but I use mine everyday.  I didn&#x27;t think it would be as good as my big, clunky, heavy dryer, but this little baby gets HOT, has a lower setting also.  I have shoulder/ hand issues and now they don&#x27;t hurt when I blow dry my hair!  Love it!!</li>
            <li> For its size I am amazed at the &amp;#34;horsepower&amp;#34; :) The velocity and heat that comes from this thing is amazing and puts full-sized hair dryers to shame.</li>
            <li> Nice little blowdryer.  We bought two, one for each bathroom.  They get really hot on low setting.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is great and does the job just fine.  It is lightweight and travels well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, powerful, but the hot setting is TOO HOT and you can&#x27;t turn it down much.</li>
            <li> Cheap.  Good Quality.  Low energy use.  What more could a person want for drying hair?</li>
            <li> Great size fir travel. It is quite small but does a great job drying. Love the carrying case too!</li>
            <li> This tiny drier did the job.  I need a diffuser and this one comes with one.  It looks like a toy because it is so small but does a great job.  Absolutely perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> Very small yet powerful. Great for international travel</li>
            <li> It is soooo small and perfect for travel. It has pretty good power and the travel case was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Great little dryer, especially for the price.  We boondock in our motorhome all the time and don&#x27;t always want to turn on the generator ti dry my hair.  This little unit has much better deying power than I expected.  Very happy camper!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is small but its engine is powerful!!! I take it to gym, travel and daily hair routine.</li>
            <li> Love!  This little hair dryer works better than my regular big dryer.  My hair dries quickly with no frizz.</li>
            <li> Having very short hair, all I need is a small, not very powerful dryer. This one is just right.  Even though it is not that powerful, it dries my hair in a few minutes. In fact, it is lighter than any other dryer I&#x27;ve had, and I hope that doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this hair dryer!  It&#x27;s just the right size, does the job and comes with a kicky little zebra-striped bag.  She couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!</li>
            <li> I was so surprised by how small and light this hair dryer is that when I received it in the mail I considered immediately sending it back. Though I knew it was a \\&quot;travel\\&quot; hair dryer, I just wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so tiny and feel, well, a little on the cheap side. Of course, for $15 I guess it should feel cheap! It&#x27;s a powerful hair dryer considering its size, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again. As others have said, there really should be a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting on it to help get that shiny hair at the end of a blowout. More importantly, though, is that there is only a high and a low setting. The high setting is a little too high and makes my thin hair incredibly frizzy and unmanageable while the low setting is a little too low and takes forever to dry. I have to go back and forth between the two to get the same look I had with my previous (now dead) dryer.  And, yes, someone said this is not the best dryer for long hair -- that person spoke the truth. It&#x27;s not that bad, but it takes more getting used to than I would have thought.</li>
            <li> This would have been perfect for a trip I made to London, but I plugged it in to the adapter, turned it on and... it shorted out. I tried it at home before I left and it is nice and powerful so maybe if I&#x27;d have stayed in the US, it would have continued working, but it does say it&#x27;s a TRAVEL hair dryer so I guess I expected it to be capable of more.</li>
            <li> I already have one of thise, but because I travel a lot, I have one at home and one for my travel trailer. Lots of heat &amp; power in a small little dryer.</li>
            <li> I had to have a hair dryer so I could dry my Silky Terrier&#x27;s long fine hair after her bath. I needed a dryer that was lightweight because several years ago I hurt my hand and it&#x27;s hard for me to hold a heavy hair dryer for very long. This is perfect. It&#x27;s very lightweight, small and easy for me to hold. I love this hair dryer and don&#x27;t mind using it, as it doesn&#x27;t hurt my hand at all.</li>
            <li> Smaller than it looks but a powerful hair dryer for the size. It was about as powerful as a 1500 watt dryer I use daily! Great for traveling and putting in a suitcase because it is about 1/3 the size! It has a little carrying case too that is nice for the price! :) If you need a smaller dryer that packs a punch for travel!</li>
            <li> This dryer worked perfect in England.  Others that were in our group just used a converter on their existing hair dryers and all of them blew out the dryer motors.  This one performed well.  My only complaint is the diffuser...it really doesn&#x27;t diffuse anything as most of the air is at full force.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair really fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a lightweight, compact hair dryer with accessories like a defuser, but don&#x27;t buy into the line that it&#x27;s as powerful as a full sized hair dryer, as it&#x27;s not. It takes much longer to dry my hair with this that with a full sized dryer. (I have long, very textured, wavy hair)</li>
            <li> Do not buy this Hair Dryer.  I have it since May 2014 and it stops working after a few minutes and will not turn back on.  Conair wants me to ship it to Arizona at my expense and send them $7.00 to ship it back.  Since I paid about $20.00 for the hair dryer it is not worth it to replace it when I can buy another brand.</li>
            <li> Powerful little dryer was perfect on our overseas trip.  Compact and light for the suitcase.  I also use the dryer on our RV.  I am impressed!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this styler I thought I was getting the (older) one that folds. The two models look very similar - I would think they are the same unless I look very closely at the picture. The reason why I was getting an extra one was because I was very satisfied with the old model - Light, small, dual-voltage, strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This newer model works the same and looks the same. It just doesn&#x27;t fold. The folding one is actually, IMHO, easier to bring when traveling.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described - so small!  When it arrived, I thought it looked like a toy, but this little dryer works!  Just used it traveling and it absolutely beats the standard hairdryers found in hotel rooms.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh a thing, takes up no space and works just as well as full size dryers.  Great decision!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to go in my duffle bag for the gym. I use it nearly every day on fairly long hair. Drys quickly then slips into its little carrying case.</li>
            <li> I love the hot pink color and the fact it is lightweight. I find it easy to use and the low setting is just right for my hair, it hardly takes any time at all for my hair to dry at that setting. So for me this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Four stars....might upgrade this to 5 in the next month or so.  This is a good little unit, perfect for travel or light use.  The first one overheated after 3-5 minutes of use, I was able to exchange it with the vendor, and the replacement unit seems to work perfectly.  Once its used a few more times, I&#x27;ll either upgrade the rating or comment below.  Not a bad dryer overall, and it comes with 2 attachments.  A pokey thing, and a duck bill thing.</li>
            <li> SOMEWHAT better than others its size; though still blows very hot, (almost to Hot on the Low setting); but is useful for Travel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted a small hair dryer for traveling.  I actually use this everyday. Great buy and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soooo tiny, and powerful. It works great so far for it&#x27;s purpose. The only thing I&#x27;d want is a comb attachment...cause you know, natural hair needs to be straightened sometimes. Overall great product, especially for curls</li>
            <li> After using a much heavier professional style hair dryer for awhile, this one is truly a breath of fresh air. It&#x27;s got plenty of power in an extremely lightweight package, ideal for older, arthritic hands. There are only two heat settings (and no cool setting) but I&#x27;m finding that the lower temp setting is in fact much gentler on my hair than what I used to do with the higher setting, and still does the trick. The diffuser add-on is also useful. This is a great everyday dryer, as well as perfect for travel. Never going back to the heavier kind -- gave that one away to my daughter who still has some hand strength and a very full head of hair</li>
            <li> Bit  smaller than thought, more of travel size.</li>
            <li> Nice and compact and easy to pack. Does a good job drying hair for a mini dryer.</li>
            <li> This little hair dryer is very light-weight, nice &amp; small for traveling and just as nice for every day use. It is quite powerful for being so small but drys my hair in no time at all. I love the travel bag that comes with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been well over 15 years with my old hair dryer. This one is so small, light weight and powerful! The nozzle tip stays on nicely and the fast speed dries my hair quicker than ever before. Definitely would recommend this!</li>
            <li> perfect size and weight for every day use</li>
            <li> I love this little hairdryer.....travels well, small, and lightweight.  It is powerful enough for me, and has diffuser, too.  Has 2 settings for temp.  Good value and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Great little dryer for travel, it&#x27;s lightweight and does the job.  It was easy to use and the diffuser is great.  Very nice little bag too</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is pretty tiny but it works perfectly for my 10 year old daughter who can&#x27;t quite use a regular size hair dryer yet.  It is a perfect size for traveling as well.  Comes in a cute zebra print zippered bag too.</li>
            <li> I also started using this as my main hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It is tiny little thing. Pretty much doll size but blows stronger than my normal hair dryer. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling. It takes up very little space and weighs next to nothing!</li>
            <li> Love this hairdryer. small and compact but powerful</li>
            <li> Perfect for the gym bag.  Also has a lot of power for a little dryer</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  Thank you.  Joy</li>
            <li> Very powerful for such a small blow dryer.</li>
            <li> This thing definitely packs a powerful punch for being so small. Definitely happy with what I got!</li>
            <li> While the size, color, and style of this dryer were perfect, it stopped working after three uses. I truly wish it had held up longer; given the short experience I had with it, it was great, but the lack of durability left me utterly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Needed to get a less powerful blow dryer when I moved to a place with crappy outlets that were killing my other dryers. The MiniPro is super tiny and looks like it could be for a doll, but surprisingly works great for me. Made well and feels sturdy. My dry time seems to be shorter. I have fine hair though. My stepdaughter has long medium hair and it dried her pretty quick as well. Love the color. Very light weight and will be perfect for travel. Especially love the travel bag it comes with, so cute! Been using this dryer a few weeks now and no complaints. Only wish is that it had a cool setting.</li>
            <li> This is a nice hair dryer, does the job</li>
            <li> For a small, compact hair dryer its great for traveling! I have little time and thick, curly hair and it does a great job and very powerful. Reasonable price, traveling case and attachments, very happy!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it had 1200 watts instead of 1800.  I wanted to dry my hair as I styled it and the 1800 watt dryers blow my hair too much.  The only problem I have with it is that when you reduce the blower volume, you also reduce the heat, so it takes longer to dry my hair.  I still like it and use it regularly.  Mine did not include a concentrator, but I did not ask about it because I don&#x27;t use it anyway.</li>
            <li> love it bought for my daughter who is 10 learning how to blow dry her own hair and it was perfect! Light weight so she could hold on to it.</li>
            <li> Works great! Powerful but lightweight</li>
            <li> Excellent, strong, light weight hair dryer for travel and every day. I love it!!</li>
            <li> This little hair dryer packs a punch! It&#x27;s surprisingly strong for it&#x27;s size.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> It works great, no problems, but it is TINY! I burst out laughing when I opened the box, because it looks like a child&#x27;s toy. So believe the name, &amp;#34;MiniPRO.&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t purchase it to travel with, just because I dislike huge, heavy hair dryers. But it would be easy to fit in a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair that dries in about 5-7 minutes with this dryer, so it does the trick for me. People with much thicker hair may not find this has enough power.</li>
            <li> quick delivery. seems well made. nice heat and airflow. small and very light. excellent total package.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what advertised and nice quality.  Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> It is small, powerful and came with a carrying case so very useful for traveling.  It is dual voltage rated so easy to use in USA or abroad.  I wish it came with plug adopter that are compatible with the pin arrangements in foreign countries.  For example, I travelled to Dubai and India, there they have three round pin plugs.  Without an adopter, you can not plug in this unit directly into the wall receptacle.  That can become a major problem.</li>
            <li> Petit, cute, powerful! Better than the one I use usually at home</li>
            <li> Unbelievably lightweight - great for travel!</li>
            <li> Small enough to travel, but works like a large hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Good,but not as powerful as I hoped.  The size is great.</li>
            <li> Its light..i can easily put it in my hand bag when I travel. super  fast dry..not that noisy. I like it.</li>
            <li> Everytime i take it of by bag at the gym, girls start laughing, but when they see me using it and the results, they ask me where i got it...I very proud of my purchase! :D</li>
            <li> Great value for money. Dual voltage helps during international travel. Nice compact design. Very pleased with the purchase so far.</li>
            <li> This thing is tiny, and is a perfect size for travel. However, it overheats fast. Also, there are two settings on this, high and low, and low is basically useless. I&#x27;m pretty sure my hair would air dry faster. I wish the low setting had more power behind it because I feel like high is too hot for my hair. All in all, if you&#x27;re using this hairdryer for travel only, it is a great size and does the job. As an everyday hairdryer, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is small and pink, but it is definitely not wimpy. It has lots of power and is so easy to travel with. I would even be fine with using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a small, compact hair dryer to take with me to the gym and such, and this was exactly that. It does not skimp on power and gets my hair dry in the same amount of time as a regular sized one I use at home on a regular basis. Be careful to keep the back end away from your hair as it may suck your hair in. I have this experience with similar smaller hair dryers, so I was expecting it. The price and what I was looking for, it was perfect.</li>
            <li> What color is it? One looks purple and the other pink.</li>
            <li> Love the small size.  Dries my hair very quickly and comes with a great travel bag.  It does such a good job that I forget that it is travel size.</li>
            <li> Small, lightweight dryer that doesn&#x27;t take up lots of room in a drawer or cabinet; the bag helps keep the cord contained and accessories handy. High blows plenty hard to dry short hair and low is just right for finishing touches. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5 yea old daughter because she always wants to do things for herself and I wanted to encourage her independence. This is so small and light. She is able to handle it easily and even though I still have to watch her and help with the use of a hairbrush, she is well on her way to independence. It is very powerful for its size and comes with a nice bag and accessories.</li>
            <li> This mini blow dryer is perfect for traveling. I used it with the diffuser attachment for my curly hair, and my hair dried faster than it does with my regular dryer at home. Don&#x27;t let the size fool you. It&#x27;s small but high powered. I will never travel without this again!</li>
