            <li>I started using vivite in my mid-thirties and am very happy with the results: barely visible pores &amp; flawless complexion.</li>

            <li>I love how it absorbs non greasy and does my skin a favor by giving it a beautiful glow along with the protection.  </li>

            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>I love my VIVITE!  </li>
            <li>I love the Vivite line!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it  and would recommend it to all that want clearer, more beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>would like to mention that the seller (abzoo) was amazing</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>I love the moisturizer and think it works better than anything I have ever tried (and thats a lot)!</li>
            <li>So glad you provide this product love it!</li>
            <li>love the vivite products, so nice</li>
            <li>I use very light lotion</li>
            <li>I love this product and will order again.</li>
            <li>I like this product, it seems to be doing lovely things to my skin.</li>
            <li>Love it, I have used this product for almost 2 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to a drugstore brand that works better and is a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>I have been using VIVITE during winter time for more than 2 years.</li>
            <li>Excellent product with visible results in short period of time.  </li>
            <li>Refreshing..</li>
            <li>I love this product however the pump was defective and the serum spills out.  </li>
            <li>Love using this product.  </li>
            <li>i love the product but will not purchase from Tuccini.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I use this product all the time and love it</li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite product in their line.</li>
            <li>I love Vivite products.</li>
            <li>and when I use the pump, the lotion seeps out around the top.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, have used it for years</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>but I was still able to use the pump.</li>
            <li>Also lactic acid is better for your skin than cheap glycolic that companies love selling at inflated prices.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have noticed a positive difference in my skin and using an antioxidant on your face is a wise thing to do.  </li>
            <li>For the best results I highly recommend using the whole system.</li>
            <li>When I put it on in the mornings, my skin immediately feels smoother and more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product works great.</li>
            <li>It gives my skin that boost of light and better texture that I need.</li>
            <li>Amazing product first introduced by dermatology service.</li>
            <li>Awesome antioxidant facial serum, first recommended by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>My favorite and it arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>This product makes skin look great...smooths fine lines, gives a more even skin tone, smells good and lasts for several months.</li>
            <li>Use daily for seriously great results</li>
            <li>never truly liked something so much...</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li>It goes on light and doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for use prior to make up.</li>
            <li>I, too, really like the product but like many of these reviews I see, there was some space at the top of the bottle and evidence of leaking.</li>
            <li>so I tried Amazon and my purchases have been good so far.</li>
            <li>It just keeps your skin smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>And it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m quite familiar with the product.</li>
            <li>Originally bought it from my dermatologist but now buy exclusively from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is super light, not a greasy serum at all.  </li>
            <li>It looked like someone stepped on it and broke the pump so it doesn&#x27;t even work right plus 25% of the product had leaked out!</li>
            <li>I am back to a better performing product, no, not a miracle, but it does way better job at lightening discolorations, keeping pores clean, diminishing fine lines, etc.</li>
            <li>I used the product once and turned bright red!</li>
            <li>I got it on sale, and I can not justify sale price after all, not mentioning paying full price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to switch products from time to time, and this product had such raving reviews, I wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>True product, not problems.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, the Amazon price is much more reasonable.</li>
            <li>This product is the real deal and nothing makes your face look better.  </li>
            <li>Bottle wasn&#x27;t completely full when received.  </li>
            <li>I love the whole line.</li>
            <li>i love how quickly this absorbs into your skin and makes it feel silky and soft.</li>
            <li>very* important that you use a good quality SPF of at least 30 while using this product as you skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>The first bottle purchased was full and not leaking.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin glowing and fresh.</li>
            <li>It keeps your skin renewed and fresh.</li>
            <li>I like the way it is absorbed and do see results.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it doesn&#x27;t clear up acne right away, but if I have a lot of zips coming on</li>
            <li>Originally, I purchased it from my Doctor&#x27;s office, but it was very pricey</li>
            <li>but they went right away.</li>
            <li>general look better.  </li>
            <li>Recently had a complete spa facial and the tech told me I had wonderful skin.</li>
            <li>This product did not allow Bare Minerals face powder to sit on top without falling into expression lines on the face.</li>
            <li>I love love this product and use it everyday.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>for the product itself, it&#x27;s a great daily glycolic acid for any skin type with the caveat that you are used to using a lesser strength/potency glycolic acid already.</li>
            <li>Serum works for all skin types except sensitive or roscea, too strong for those skin types.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very very fast and you don&#x27;t even realize you put it on.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a much better value to buy online than at your local retailer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!  </li>
            <li>Obviously the cream does more work than this serum at getting rid of acne.</li>
            <li>Love this product and especially at this price.  </li>
            <li>The first bottle I opened</li>
            <li>, product was shipped promptly and arrived in no time, fresh, new, full, very well packed.</li>
            <li>I love VIVITE Daily Antioxidant it makes my skin glow and feel very soft</li>
            <li>The serum works well to moisturize my skin especially during the winter and diminish fine lines.</li>
            <li>Well, this is doing absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>Recommend Vivite for all age groups and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>This product really works for me .</li>
            <li>Very watery solution- does not add much moisture to my face.  </li>
            <li>It show&#x27;s results much quicker and doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily.</li>
            <li>This serum is very watery.</li>
            <li>but it has really reduced after using this product and the vivite night cream.  </li>
            <li>so i really dont mind it.  </li>
            <li>I looked like I had just come from an intense workout at the gym or had been in a sauna.</li>
            <li>I really like it and will not pay salon or clinic prices for it.</li>
            <li>and I like the whole line.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used one without the other and found that I do better with both.</li>
            <li>I love all the other products.</li>
            <li>Highly doubt this is real.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s chock full of antioxidants and makes my skin look younger and radiant.  </li>
            <li>Been using this for years and find it to be a real positive in my facial care</li>
            <li>Love it and amazon is the only place with a low price tag.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended it to me because now that I am older</li>
            <li>But now the acne are not there anymore, the scars are fading faster and occasional zits disappear quickly with the help of this serum and the cream.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t ever take this product on a plane or drive to high altitude with it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it....</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The serum feels good on your face and helps keep the pores small as well as putting elasticity back into your face.</li>
            <li>Overall, I find this silky and easy to use -- do not over apply as you will only be wasting it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years..&amp; couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>This serum, combined with my using the Vivite daily wash, is the only way I can keep my old-but-oily skin acne free.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really too soon to see any major results.  </li>
            <li>and I must say it gives me a very natural glow.  </li>
            <li>When I first bought the products from my doctor--for three times the price--she instructed me to ease into using them, but my skin is so oily that I immediately used the products twice daily, with no drying or reddening.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased other facial serum which were better quality.</li>
            <li>and this was the first time I purchased it outside of my doctor&#x27;s office</li>
            <li>The package I received from &#x27;Brand Names For Less&#x27; is genuine &amp; showed no signs of having been &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; or tampered with as some reviewers state.</li>
            <li>It comes in a kit, however this facial serum runs out twice as quickly as the rest of the kit, so be prepared to buy an extra tube.     </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it in a couple of years, so I was excited when I found it online for less than what I paid at my med spa.</li>
            <li>It actually leaves it with a little glow :)</li>
            <li>This clearly was a used product, was not sealed,  was leaking and already about 1/6th gone.  </li>
            <li>and I am over 50 yrs old.  </li>
            <li>I really like Vivte&#x27;s serum because it is simply dispensed and does not leave skin feeling as though you have put anything on it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this serum for a couple of months and my skin feels and looks soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>I tend to have sensitive skin and the Vivite products do not affect my skin.</li>
            <li>This serum is probably my least favorite of the vivite products.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 years old.</li>
            <li>This product was first introducted to me by my dermotologist several years back.</li>
            <li>obviously this company is shipping testers(?) or otherwise used product and calling them new.  </li>
            <li>The skin turnover is relatively quick (should notice a difference within a week) &amp; the &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; should be immediate &amp; will dissipate after a few moments</li>
            <li>There is barely any product left in this bottle even though it&#x27;s supposed to be new.</li>
            <li>This price is 1/2 of what my dermatologist charges for the exact same product ... and worth every cent, if you purchase the kit you can expect it to last at least six months.</li>
            <li>It has been a life saver for my mature facial skin.  </li>
            <li>and I got moderate adult acne on the face after getting laser hair removal done.</li>
            <li>will be more vulnerable to new sun damage or increased sun damage while you are using this serum.</li>
            <li>I seen that on someone else&#x27;s review also, but I think thats pretty typical when switching skin care.</li>
            <li>I love the product but this is the second time purchasing from this distributor and the seal has been broken and leaked all over.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no excuse for this --</li>
            <li>I have not gotten a single new white bump since using this product so on that note</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love Vivite products.</li>
            <li> and when I use the pump, the lotion seeps out around the top.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, have used it for years</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> but I was still able to use the pump.</li>
            <li> Also lactic acid is better for your skin than cheap glycolic that companies love selling at inflated prices.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have noticed a positive difference in my skin and using an antioxidant on your face is a wise thing to do.  </li>
            <li> For the best results I highly recommend using the whole system.</li>
            <li> When I put it on in the mornings, my skin immediately feels smoother and more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product works great.</li>
            <li> It gives my skin that boost of light and better texture that I need.</li>
            <li> Amazing product first introduced by dermatology service.</li>
            <li> Awesome antioxidant facial serum, first recommended by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> My favorite and it arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> This product makes skin look great...smooths fine lines, gives a more even skin tone, smells good and lasts for several months.</li>
            <li> Use daily for seriously great results</li>
            <li> never truly liked something so much...</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li> It goes on light and doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for use prior to make up.</li>
            <li> I, too, really like the product but like many of these reviews I see, there was some space at the top of the bottle and evidence of leaking.</li>
            <li> so I tried Amazon and my purchases have been good so far.</li>
            <li> It just keeps your skin smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> And it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m quite familiar with the product.</li>
            <li> Originally bought it from my dermatologist but now buy exclusively from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is super light, not a greasy serum at all.  </li>
            <li> It looked like someone stepped on it and broke the pump so it doesn&#x27;t even work right plus 25% of the product had leaked out!</li>
            <li> I am back to a better performing product, no, not a miracle, but it does way better job at lightening discolorations, keeping pores clean, diminishing fine lines, etc.</li>
            <li> I used the product once and turned bright red!</li>
            <li> I got it on sale, and I can not justify sale price after all, not mentioning paying full price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to switch products from time to time, and this product had such raving reviews, I wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> True product, not problems.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, the Amazon price is much more reasonable.</li>
            <li> This product is the real deal and nothing makes your face look better.  </li>
            <li> Bottle wasn&#x27;t completely full when received.  </li>
            <li> I love the whole line.</li>
            <li> i love how quickly this absorbs into your skin and makes it feel silky and soft.</li>
            <li> very* important that you use a good quality SPF of at least 30 while using this product as you skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> The first bottle purchased was full and not leaking.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin glowing and fresh.</li>
            <li> It keeps your skin renewed and fresh.</li>
            <li> I like the way it is absorbed and do see results.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it doesn&#x27;t clear up acne right away, but if I have a lot of zips coming on</li>
            <li> Originally, I purchased it from my Doctor&#x27;s office, but it was very pricey</li>
            <li> but they went right away.</li>
            <li> general look better.  </li>
            <li> Recently had a complete spa facial and the tech told me I had wonderful skin.</li>
            <li> This product did not allow Bare Minerals face powder to sit on top without falling into expression lines on the face.</li>
            <li> I love love this product and use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> for the product itself, it&#x27;s a great daily glycolic acid for any skin type with the caveat that you are used to using a lesser strength/potency glycolic acid already.</li>
            <li> Serum works for all skin types except sensitive or roscea, too strong for those skin types.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very very fast and you don&#x27;t even realize you put it on.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a much better value to buy online than at your local retailer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!  </li>
            <li> Obviously the cream does more work than this serum at getting rid of acne.</li>
            <li> Love this product and especially at this price.  </li>
            <li> The first bottle I opened</li>
            <li> , product was shipped promptly and arrived in no time, fresh, new, full, very well packed.</li>
            <li> I love VIVITE Daily Antioxidant it makes my skin glow and feel very soft</li>
            <li> The serum works well to moisturize my skin especially during the winter and diminish fine lines.</li>
            <li> Well, this is doing absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> Recommend Vivite for all age groups and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> This product really works for me .</li>
            <li> Very watery solution- does not add much moisture to my face.  </li>
            <li> It show&#x27;s results much quicker and doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily.</li>
            <li> This serum is very watery.</li>
            <li> but it has really reduced after using this product and the vivite night cream.  </li>
            <li> so i really dont mind it.  </li>
            <li> I looked like I had just come from an intense workout at the gym or had been in a sauna.</li>
            <li> I really like it and will not pay salon or clinic prices for it.</li>
            <li> and I like the whole line.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one without the other and found that I do better with both.</li>
            <li> I love all the other products.</li>
            <li> Highly doubt this is real.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s chock full of antioxidants and makes my skin look younger and radiant.  </li>
            <li> Been using this for years and find it to be a real positive in my facial care</li>
            <li> Love it and amazon is the only place with a low price tag.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it to me because now that I am older</li>
            <li> But now the acne are not there anymore, the scars are fading faster and occasional zits disappear quickly with the help of this serum and the cream.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever take this product on a plane or drive to high altitude with it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it....</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The serum feels good on your face and helps keep the pores small as well as putting elasticity back into your face.</li>
            <li> Overall, I find this silky and easy to use -- do not over apply as you will only be wasting it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years..&amp; couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> This serum, combined with my using the Vivite daily wash, is the only way I can keep my old-but-oily skin acne free.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really too soon to see any major results.  </li>
            <li> and I must say it gives me a very natural glow.  </li>
            <li> When I first bought the products from my doctor--for three times the price--she instructed me to ease into using them, but my skin is so oily that I immediately used the products twice daily, with no drying or reddening.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased other facial serum which were better quality.</li>
            <li> and this was the first time I purchased it outside of my doctor&#x27;s office</li>
            <li> The package I received from &#x27;Brand Names For Less&#x27; is genuine &amp; showed no signs of having been &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; or tampered with as some reviewers state.</li>
            <li> It comes in a kit, however this facial serum runs out twice as quickly as the rest of the kit, so be prepared to buy an extra tube.     </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it in a couple of years, so I was excited when I found it online for less than what I paid at my med spa.</li>
            <li> It actually leaves it with a little glow :)</li>
            <li> This clearly was a used product, was not sealed,  was leaking and already about 1/6th gone.  </li>
            <li> and I am over 50 yrs old.  </li>
            <li> I really like Vivte&#x27;s serum because it is simply dispensed and does not leave skin feeling as though you have put anything on it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a couple of months and my skin feels and looks soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> I tend to have sensitive skin and the Vivite products do not affect my skin.</li>
            <li> This serum is probably my least favorite of the vivite products.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 years old.</li>
            <li> This product was first introducted to me by my dermotologist several years back.</li>
            <li> obviously this company is shipping testers(?) or otherwise used product and calling them new.  </li>
            <li> The skin turnover is relatively quick (should notice a difference within a week) &amp; the &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; should be immediate &amp; will dissipate after a few moments</li>
            <li> There is barely any product left in this bottle even though it&#x27;s supposed to be new.</li>
            <li> This price is 1/2 of what my dermatologist charges for the exact same product ... and worth every cent, if you purchase the kit you can expect it to last at least six months.</li>
            <li> It has been a life saver for my mature facial skin.  </li>
            <li> and I got moderate adult acne on the face after getting laser hair removal done.</li>
            <li> will be more vulnerable to new sun damage or increased sun damage while you are using this serum.</li>
            <li> I seen that on someone else&#x27;s review also, but I think thats pretty typical when switching skin care.</li>
            <li> I love the product but this is the second time purchasing from this distributor and the seal has been broken and leaked all over.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no excuse for this --</li>
            <li> I have not gotten a single new white bump since using this product so on that note</li>
            <li> i lost about half half of the first one on a trip in a suit case.  </li>
            <li> The serum goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The acne scars would stay on my face for long time.</li>
            <li> I received my Vivite Daily Antioxidant Facial Serum today and was saddened to see the bottle was not full.  </li>
            <li> A tiny amount goes a long way!!&lt;br /&gt;Would never change products!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used serums in the past and they are not usually this watery.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not as expensive as I originally thought.</li>
            <li> READ THE OTHER SIMILAR REVIEWS.</li>
            <li> I did notice that the first few weeks I did get small break outs</li>
            <li> But this antioxidant facial serum is not worth the price to me.</li>
            <li> However it left my skin extremely oily and shiny!</li>
            <li> I wish I would have checked both bottles when I received them because it&#x27;s too late to exchange for a new bottle.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t cleared some of the little ones I still have but prevention is key!</li>
            <li> I was looking to even out my skin tone since I have a few dark spots but have no other skin issues.</li>
            <li> (if you find that the sensation lingers or is uncomfortable, then this strength might be too much for your skin-type to be used on a daily basis, if at all).</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected and in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> If anyone decides to purchase from Tuccini, be careful.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the only few things that has helped my acne.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a few months with daily use</li>
            <li> Once I stopped using it for a few months as I thought I would try another product - Big disaster!!  </li>
            <li> One fourth was missing from the bottle</li>
            <li> The price is less than half of getting them through detmatogist and the same.</li>
            <li> and I see no positive results whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I am also having lots of dark spots creep up lately, skin is oilier, not necessary glowing, it&#x27;s just oilier than it was before and pores look larger, no firming at all, not a pretty picture.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy again, only the results will tell.</li>
            <li> I use it once in the morning with some other serums.  </li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve heeded other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this serum before in the past as part of my daily skin regimen</li>
            <li> but the other one leaks also.  </li>
            <li> I have used other products from this line and have had no problem.</li>
            <li> Just received this product the other day.</li>
            <li> BOTTLE HALF EMPTY.  </li>
            <li> No more blackheads (tiny ones) on sides of nose, and no more dry areas either.</li>
            <li> When the pump was activated, the product leaked out and dripped down the bottle.</li>
            <li> I found it here for less than half of what they were going to charge me at the doctor&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> but when I bought it - it was half price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It is a small bottle, but only a small amount is needed each day so it lasts awhile.</li>
            <li> I do use less of my moisturizer now since these products seem to help with that.</li>
            <li> my wrinkles are less thank you</li>
            <li> That is why they can sell it for so much less because they don&#x27;t accept refunds on used products because they can&#x27;t resell them.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s when your lotion or some product is to heavy or just a blocked pore.</li>
            <li> However, the product leaked during the shipment and the package was quite messy upon arrival.</li>
            <li> Received my order within a few days ahead of schedule.  </li>
            <li> It cleared up a few acne spots I got after I changed birth control.</li>
            <li> I still get a few pimples</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer in glycolic acids to help with cellular turnover.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.  </li>
            <li> I have quit using it a few times thinking it&#x27;s not making a difference, but always see a steep decline in my complexion when I do.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any tampering with the packages, and this purchase came without any sign that the serum was used prior to purchase, or that the quantity was in any way diminished.</li>
            <li> I just opened the second bottle and it was worse.</li>
            <li> Although expensive a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a bad bottle or if this is normal for this product, but I am not loving it.</li>
            <li> She said you need to look for a lotion with at least 8% glycolic acid and recommended this one.  </li>
            <li> even Ebay is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I take two oral prescriptions which have kept my skin broken out.  </li>
            <li> Also to those ladies appoarching that age as well and would like to stay ahead of the game.</li>
            <li> I do like the way it feels going on.....clean and thin film.</li>
            <li> A lot of the product has leaked from the bottle and the pump is broken.</li>
            <li> We spend a lot of money on other products that we use, but the base product needs to be protection.</li>
            <li> It is expensive</li>
            <li> This is an expensive product and should not do that.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it works.</li>
            <li> One would think the company would stand behind the product and so would the seller!</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t seen any crazy results</li>
            <li> Making my face look really bad.</li>
            <li> The bottles I received from this distributor were in bad condition.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed in the quality of this product from the Vivite line.  </li>
            <li> You might not get all the product.  :-(</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, the pump leaks terribly.</li>
            <li> Also, it had a horrible smell.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome antioxidant facial serum, first recommended by my dermatologist.  Use daily for seriously great results</li>
            <li> This serum is the best for replenishing my skin.  It hydrates my face and my poors feel and look smaller.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for several years.  Like the results and it&#x27;s a much better value to buy online than at your local retailer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years.  When I put it on in the mornings, my skin immediately feels smoother and more comfortable.  It is very effective at smoothing lines and evening out skin color.</li>
            <li> This used to be one of my must have facial products. I haven&#x27;t used it in a couple of years, so I was excited when I found it online for less than what I paid at my med spa. I don&#x27;t remember it being so watery, the consistency did not feel the same. Not sure if I would buy again, only the results will tell. Giving it three weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this facial serum for over a year and I must say it gives me a very natural glow.  I love it!  Sometimes I wear it at night and wake up looking so refresh.  You immediately see the difference.  It was recommended by a dermatologist.  I have sensitive skin and this product works great.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected and in a timely manner. I like the product a lot. This is my second time ordering it.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist and esthetician recommended this product as the best for my skin and I am over 50 yrs old.  I found it here for less than half of what they were going to charge me at the doctor&#x27;s office.  And it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked and felt better! I recommend this and the hydrating night cream! Love!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this and it is great.  It is super light, not a greasy serum at all.  I use it once in the morning with some other serums.  It absorbs very very fast and you don&#x27;t even realize you put it on.  It&#x27;s chock full of antioxidants and makes my skin look younger and radiant.  Love it and amazon is the only place with a low price tag.  It&#x27;s kinda pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> This serum, combined with my using the Vivite daily wash, is the only way I can keep my old-but-oily skin acne free.  I take two oral prescriptions which have kept my skin broken out.  When I first bought the products from my doctor--for three times the price--she instructed me to ease into using them, but my skin is so oily that I immediately used the products twice daily, with no drying or reddening.  I&#x27;ve used one without the other and found that I do better with both.</li>
            <li> Like the product. However, the pump leaks terribly. When the product arrived, about 1/3 of it had leaked into the package. When the pump was activated, the product leaked out and dripped down the bottle. I missed the return date by one day. Sadness.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews..and i have always been one to use various products..never truly liked something so much...the Vivite product line is so incredibly amazing...by the makers of Botox...my skin has been rejuvenated.  FANTASTIC.  Wish someone would have told me abou this line 20 years ago. [ ... ]</li>
            <li> Great product great service</li>
            <li> I am a skin care junkie and have used several different facial serums. I really like Vivte&#x27;s serum because it is simply dispensed and does not leave skin feeling as though you have put anything on it. No greasy residue. A+ product.</li>
            <li> The serum goes a long way. Two pumps will do your entire face. The silky nature of the serum allows for even distribution. I have noticed a positive difference in my skin and using an antioxidant on your face is a wise thing to do.  We spend a lot of money on other products that we use, but the base product needs to be protection.</li>
            <li> Well, this is doing absolutely nothing for me.  I have been using it (runny watery &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;, I&#x27;d call it a toner) for a month and I see no positive results whatsoever. I did get a couple of whiteheads when I started using it, but they were gone in a week, it&#x27;s not a problem. I am getting blackheads. I am also having lots of dark spots creep up lately, skin is oilier, not necessary glowing, it&#x27;s just oilier than it was before and pores look larger, no firming at all, not a pretty picture. I don&#x27;t need this kind of collagen production, thank you!! I got it on sale, and I can not justify sale price after all, not mentioning paying full price. I am back to Lacsal serum (lactic acid). I have been using it for over 4 years, and like it. It&#x27;s good to switch products from time to time, and this product had such raving reviews, I wanted to try it. I don&#x27;t see what everyone is raving about. I am back to a better performing product, no, not a miracle, but it does way better job at lightening discolorations, keeping pores clean, diminishing fine lines, etc. Also lactic acid is better for your skin than cheap glycolic that companies love selling at inflated prices.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to mention that the seller (abzoo) was amazing, product was shipped promptly and arrived in no time, fresh, new, full, very well packed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 10 years!!!  It is NOT greasy &amp; soaks into your face &amp; neck.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it for around my eyes which hides any wrinkle that you may have. A tiny amount goes a long way!!&lt;br /&gt;Would never change products!!!! Outstanding!!!  Donna</li>
            <li> I am still only about a 1/4 of the way through this bottle so I haven&#x27;t seen any crazy results but I do feel like my sun spots and just face in general look better.  My dermatologist recommended it to me because now that I am older I get these white bumps on my face.  They don&#x27;t pop and they aren&#x27;t acne- as explained to me it&#x27;s when your lotion or some product is to heavy or just a blocked pore. I use very light lotion so I have no idea why I get them all of sudden.  The only way to get rid of one is to get a facial and have them lance it so I was looking for something to prevent them.  She said you need to look for a lotion with at least 8% glycolic acid and recommended this one.  It is expensive but when I bought it - it was half price on Amazon.  I searched everywhere and that was the best price.  I have not gotten a single new white bump since using this product so on that note I highly recommend it!!  It hasn&#x27;t cleared some of the little ones I still have but prevention is key!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some time. It is a small bottle, but only a small amount is needed each day so it lasts awhile. The price I found on Amazon was the best around. I love this product and will order again.</li>
            <li> I love love this product and use it everyday.  I discovered it thru a skin clinic and started ordering it myself b/c it&#x27; s cheaper.  this is a wonderful product</li>
            <li> This product contains something that burnt my skin and caused redness to appear.  Also, it had a horrible smell.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it seems to be doing lovely things to my skin. It goes on light and doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable smell. It&#x27;s a great product for use prior to make up.</li>
            <li> Vivite is the best product I have used.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product upon recommendation from dermatologist.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for several weeks so it&#x27;s really too soon to see any major results.  Quick delivery and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Love it, I have used this product for almost 2 years.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other facial serum which were better quality. The texture is liquidity. A serum should be heavier. I will not buy&lt;br /&gt;it again.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product.  I&#x27;ve been using MD Forte (then Vivite when they bought MD Forte) for years.  I&#x27;m still looking for a replacement for the Facial Cream II and III that was discontinued, so thought I&#x27;d try this. It hasn&#x27;t done anything after using 3/4 of the bottle.  I&#x27;ll stick to a drugstore brand that works better and is a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever take this product on a plane or drive to high altitude with it.  Every time I have, it leaks. I leave it home now.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it....works wonders....great price here at amazon....had stopped using and noticed a great difference on my face...bought some more and will not stop using it again</li>
            <li> Dedicated user. My skin looks ten years younger!! Just turned 70!!! Recommend Vivite for all age groups and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Amazing product first introduced by dermatology service. Great difference on my skin with use of Vivite products. You will feel the immediate results and see soon of the anti-oxidant effects. The price is less than half of getting them through detmatogist and the same. Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> The product is excellent and exceeds my expectations.  I have been using the serum for almost a month and have visible improvement in the overall texture and tone of my face.  However, the product leaked during the shipment and the package was quite messy upon arrival.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a couple of months and my skin feels and looks soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> This product really works for me . It gives my skin that boost of light and better texture that I need. I have been using VIVITE during winter time for more than 2 years.</li>
            <li> Very watery solution- does not add much moisture to my face.  Disappointed in the quality of this product from the Vivite line.  I love all the other products.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve heeded other reviews.  This clearly was a used product, was not sealed,  was leaking and already about 1/6th gone.  There&#x27;s no excuse for this -- obviously this company is shipping testers(?) or otherwise used product and calling them new.  Shame on them.</li>
            <li> Excellent products for smoothing the skin. I tend to have sensitive skin and the Vivite products do not affect my skin.</li>
            <li> Use this every day and night after purchasing it from the dermatologist.  Brightens my face and I use it with the night time regime of moisturizers from Allergan.</li>
            <li> I love the product but this is the second time purchasing from this distributor and the seal has been broken and leaked all over.  At this price, you can&#x27;t afford to lose any of the serum!</li>
            <li> Excellent product with visible results in short period of time.  Excellent price.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!!! Refreshing.. Use under all your skin care.. Keeps skin youthful</li>
            <li> Vivite Daily Antioxidant Facial Serum is a must in my skin care regime. Immediately on applying it my skin feels refreshed.  There is a&lt;br /&gt;visible difference in the appearance of my skin - fewer wrinkles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this serum before in the past as part of my daily skin regimen so I&#x27;m quite familiar with the product. The package I received from &#x27;Brand Names For Less&#x27; is genuine &amp; showed no signs of having been &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; or tampered with as some reviewers state. I&#x27;m posting this because none of those reviewers have stated who they purchased their product from :(.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, it&#x27;s a great daily glycolic acid for any skin type with the caveat that you are used to using a lesser strength/potency glycolic acid already. The skin turnover is relatively quick (should notice a difference within a week) &amp; the &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; should be immediate &amp; will dissipate after a few moments (if you find that the sensation lingers or is uncomfortable, then this strength might be too much for your skin-type to be used on a daily basis, if at all). It&#x27;s *very* important that you use a good quality SPF of at least 30 while using this product as you skin will be more vulnerable to new sun damage or increased sun damage while you are using this serum. Overall, I find this silky and easy to use -- do not over apply as you will only be wasting it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Your skin feels like silk.</li>
            <li> I love this product however the pump was defective and the serum spills out.  This is an expensive product and should not do that.</li>
            <li> Received my order within a few days ahead of schedule.  Love using this product.  Recently had a complete spa facial and the tech told me I had wonderful skin. I told her what I used. She couldn&#x27;t argue the results. It&#x27;s not a serum for younger, wrinkle-free skin. It just keeps your skin smooth and clean.  No more blackheads (tiny ones) on sides of nose, and no more dry areas either. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Vivite is the best skin care product I have ever used. It comes in a kit, however this facial serum runs out twice as quickly as the rest of the kit, so be prepared to buy an extra tube.     This price is 1/2 of what my dermatologist charges for the exact same product ... and worth every cent, if you purchase the kit you can expect it to last at least six months.</li>
            <li> Vivite is the Cadillac of skin care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now and this was the first time I purchased it outside of my doctor&#x27;s office and it&#x27;s great! True product, not problems.</li>
            <li> I started using Vivite products after my plastic surgeon&#x27;s office recommended it. I love the moisturizer and think it works better than anything I have ever tried (and thats a lot)! But this antioxidant facial serum is not worth the price to me. I have been using it for a month now and have seen no changes in my skin. I also bought the Vivite vibrance therapy to go with it and have seen no results as of yet. I was looking to even out my skin tone since I have a few dark spots but have no other skin issues. I did notice that the first few weeks I did get small break outs but they went right away. I seen that on someone else&#x27;s review also, but I think thats pretty typical when switching skin care. I do use less of my moisturizer now since these products seem to help with that.</li>
            <li> This serum is probably my least favorite of the vivite products. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it works. It cleared up a few acne spots I got after I changed birth control. However it left my skin extremely oily and shiny! I prefer the vibrance therapy pump. It show&#x27;s results much quicker and doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily. It actually leaves it with a little glow :)</li>
            <li> I received my Vivite Daily Antioxidant Facial Serum today and was saddened to see the bottle was not full.  Also the I could tell bottle had been tampered with.  i love the product but will not purchase from Tuccini.  If anyone decides to purchase from Tuccini, be careful.  You might not get all the product.  :-(</li>
            <li> I love VIVITE Daily Antioxidant it makes my skin glow and feel very soft my wrinkles are less thank you</li>
            <li> the product is great.  the problem is the pumps leak.  i lost about half half of the first one on a trip in a suit case.  i thought it was just banged around but the other one leaks also.  please tell me what to do. thank you john feller</li>
            <li> I was talking to some cosmetologist about my acne problems and they recommended this to me. I love this stuff, it doesn&#x27;t clear up acne right away, but if I have a lot of zips coming on I put this stuff on every night and they are either gone the next morning or not as red. This is one of the only few things that has helped my acne.</li>
            <li> Improves  my skin appearance within  24 hours.  I love it  and would recommend it to all that want clearer, more beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> This serum is very watery. I have used serums in the past and they are not usually this watery. Not sure if I got a bad bottle or if this is normal for this product, but I am not loving it. I have not noticed any improvement in my skin either.</li>
            <li> It was for me.  Donna Johnson.  Love it</li>
            <li> This product makes skin look great...smooths fine lines, gives a more even skin tone, smells good and lasts for several months.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchased this item. The first bottle purchased was full and not leaking. The next time I ordered the bottle it was leaking and 1/3 of the liquid was not in the bottle. As a result, I would not order this again.</li>
            <li> I used this product for my acne and glycolic acid seems to be the best for my hormonal acne.  I still get a few pimples but it has really reduced after using this product and the vivite night cream.  It does tingle BUT any product with glycolic acid is going to tinkle so i really dont mind it.  Also my face has never been smoother.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to facial serum that I have used for years.  Although expensive a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This product was first introducted to me by my dermotologist several years back. It has been a life saver for my mature facial skin.  The serum feels good on your face and helps keep the pores small as well as putting elasticity back into your face. I would recommend this product to anyone have to deal with senior skin.  Also to those ladies appoarching that age as well and would like to stay ahead of the game.</li>
            <li> I have the vivite cleanser soap, the scrub, this antioxidant serum and the night renewal cream. All with Glycolic acid, they have helped we fight my acne. I am asian indian and I got moderate adult acne on the face after getting laser hair removal done. The acne scars would stay on my face for long time. Making my face look really bad. But now the acne are not there anymore, the scars are fading faster and occasional zits disappear quickly with the help of this serum and the cream. This serum is 15% glycolic acid and the night cream is 20%. Obviously the cream does more work than this serum at getting rid of acne. I would buy this again but if I were to choose only one vivte product, then I would go for the cream.</li>
            <li> So thrilled to find this product at a great price! I started using vivite in my mid-thirties and am very happy with the results: barely visible pores &amp; flawless complexion. I also incorporate the daily exfoliating wash several times a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vivite for years. It keeps my skin glowing and fresh.For the best results I highly recommend using the whole system.</li>
            <li> Very pleased, and price good too</li>
            <li> So glad you provide this product love it!</li>
            <li> The serum is excellent.  I recommend using it with the exfoliator, eye cream and night cream.  I saw great results !</li>
            <li> I wear this daily under my sunblock. It was recommended by my dermatologist (who charged me $109) for this same bottle! Thankfully, the Amazon price is much more reasonable. I do like the way it feels going on.....clean and thin film. The bottle lasts a few months with daily use so it&#x27;s not as expensive as I originally thought.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time and love it and this is the best price I have found anywhere.</li>
            <li> I love my VIVITE!  It is an awesome product... I have been using it a short time and I have been VERY pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Product as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years..&amp; couldn&#x27;t live without it. It keeps your skin renewed and fresh. I&#x27;m a firm believer in glycolic acids to help with cellular turnover. Vivité is a good company. This is probably my favorite product in their line.</li>
            <li> When I received this item the box and packaging wasn&#x27;t damaged but the product was! It looked like someone stepped on it and broke the pump so it doesn&#x27;t even work right plus 25% of the product had leaked out! So disappointed. The only reason there is one star is cause I have to put one..</li>
            <li> Love this product and especially at this price.  This product is the real deal and nothing makes your face look better.  It is easy to use and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff twice a day religiously.  It works for my combination skin and helps to control breakouts.  Once I stopped using it for a few months as I thought I would try another product - Big disaster!!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I love the Vivite line!  Serum works for all skin types except sensitive or roscea, too strong for those skin types.</li>
            <li> Bottle wasn&#x27;t completely full when received.  I like the way it is absorbed and do see results.  I&#x27;ll continue using it.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years and find it to be a real positive in my facial care</li>
            <li> My favorite and it arrived quickly.  I have purchased this before and I will purchase it again.  I love Vivite products.</li>
            <li> The product came with a leak.  One fourth was missing from the bottle and when I use the pump, the lotion seeps out around the top.  Defective packagaing.</li>
            <li> I, too, really like the product but like many of these reviews I see, there was some space at the top of the bottle and evidence of leaking.</li>
            <li> I used the product once and turned bright red! Everyone asked me what happened and if I was very warm. I looked like I had just come from an intense workout at the gym or had been in a sauna. I just spoke with the company and the woman on the phone said No Refunds on opened products. That is why they can sell it for so much less because they don&#x27;t accept refunds on used products because they can&#x27;t resell them. Well, I hope not! I have used other products from this line and have had no problem. One would think the company would stand behind the product and so would the seller! That was a $50 lesson to never buy a product like that from an online company when I have not used it before.</li>
            <li> PACKAGE WAS DAMAGED, PRODUCT LEAKING ALL OVER.  BOTTLE HALF EMPTY.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. READ THE OTHER SIMILAR REVIEWS.</li>
            <li> You cannot beat internet pricing for this product.  I really like it and will not pay salon or clinic prices for it.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.  I love how it absorbs non greasy and does my skin a favor by giving it a beautiful glow along with the protection.  I buy from Amazon as the price elsewhere even Ebay is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this line of products for a couple of years and I like the whole line.</li>
            <li> love the vivite products, so nice</li>
            <li> Love this product! I&#x27;m 50 years old. Keeps my skin in good shape.I have quit using it a few times thinking it&#x27;s not making a difference, but always see a steep decline in my complexion when I do. I won&#x27;t quit using it again. I also use their exfoliating scrub and Vibrance therapy. Originally bought it from my dermatologist but now buy exclusively from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this product, have used it for years</li>
            <li> Just received this product the other day. It is a liquid - NOT a serum. Just drips from the pump. Awful!&lt;br /&gt;Will be returning this immediately.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s the best for my skin which is out in the sun alot. I bought one for my friend. I love the whole line. I&#x27;m a former model and try alot of products! This is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for three years. Originally, I purchased it from my Doctor&#x27;s office, but it was very pricey so I tried Amazon and my purchases have been good so far. I also buy the facial wash and eye cream. I have not experienced any tampering with the packages, and this purchase came without any sign that the serum was used prior to purchase, or that the quantity was in any way diminished. The serum works well to moisturize my skin especially during the winter and diminish fine lines.</li>
            <li> i love how quickly this absorbs into your skin and makes it feel silky and soft. I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Highly doubt this is real. Smells like vinegar</li>
            <li> The bottles I received from this distributor were in bad condition. The first bottle I opened I noticed some of the product had leaked out but I was still able to use the pump. I just opened the second bottle and it was worse. A lot of the product has leaked from the bottle and the pump is broken. There is barely any product left in this bottle even though it&#x27;s supposed to be new. I wish I would have checked both bottles when I received them because it&#x27;s too late to exchange for a new bottle. I would recommend you purchase this product from a different distributor since these bottles appear to have been tampered with.</li>
            <li> This product did not allow Bare Minerals face powder to sit on top without falling into expression lines on the face.</li>
