    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>haven&#x27;t seen any tanning, it protects from sun perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect sunscreen for people that have skin allergies.  </li>
            <li>If in the ocean for longer than an hour then the best protection is Vaseline.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an excellent choice if you have concerns about:&lt;br /&gt;-Nano</li>
            <li>Sunscreen works great!</li>
            <li>( I have used about 8 of their products and have always been highly impressed with every product.)</li>
            <li>Then curiosity got the best of me</li>
            <li>This sunscreen scored 1 out  8 (1 being the best) at this website, http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/about-the-sunscreens/617105/The_Honest_Company_Honest_Sunscreen_Lotion%2C_SPF_30/</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful.</li>
            <li>but clearly it isn&#x27;t safe against the sun!!!!</li>
            <li>This product rates 1 on the EWG site, which is the best score a product can receive in regards to the safety of ingredients.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is awesome!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably best if you don&#x27;t wear any, this things is a sun magnet.</li>
            <li>Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li>However I support this company and what they stand for, and the majority of their products are perfect.</li>
            <li>but it works perfectly for my family!</li>
            <li>Best sunscreen I have ever tried!</li>
            <li>This is the best sunscreen we have tried!</li>
            <li>I have to say I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
            <li>It did a perfect job of protecting my skin</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>It protected me perfectly, and I had no problem with it being too greasy.  </li>
            <li>one of the best on the market.</li>
            <li>Your better off going without sunscreen!!!  </li>
            <li>We trusted Honest Sunscreen for our baby and was burned (pun intended)!!</li>
            <li>but I know my very fair skinned (Caucasian) mother used this with me and didn&#x27;t burn ?</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly greasy too, which isn&#x27;t great when you&#x27;re trying to hold a wiggly baby.</li>
            <li>One of the top best sunscreens for the best protection.</li>
            <li>Thought this would be a great solution....</li>
            <li>this is my daughter and thought since it was made of zinc it would be great.</li>
            <li>It is a bit greasy but to me it feels great.  </li>
            <li>The sun protection seems to be effective and it is given an Excellent rating for UVA protection by the EWG reviewing report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.ewg.org/2014sunscreen/about-the-sunscreens/566127</li>
            <li>I will keep using them and have to add, that while one sunscreen works great for me, it may not work great for you.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it felt like I&#x27;d been out in the middle-of-day overhead sun, not the end-of-day sun that I&#x27;d actually experienced.</li>
            <li>and this sunscreen has done a great job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to see these reviews, I thought it was just us</li>
            <li>Great deal.</li>
            <li>I think the happy medium for me is Mexitan spf 30.  </li>
            <li>California Baby is a great organic sunscreen option.</li>
            <li>I greatly dislike the texture and consistency.</li>
            <li>Way too greasy to use on my face but great everywhere else.</li>
            <li>I was under the impression that The Honest Company was a wonderful company to go to for baby products.  </li>
            <li>I saw a headline on yahoo regarding how this sunscreen isn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li>Great price at Costco ($13 for two)</li>
            <li>Not feeling too happy tonight.</li>
            <li>Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans&#x27; salty water without any shade, then Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is, but for a surfer like me, usually higher organic ingredients are the best since I am in and out of sun which washes away the mix in the oceans’ salty water.</li>
            <li>More like SPF 2 (at best) than SPF 30.</li>
            <li>Honest, I think not!</li>
            <li>I was going to make my own sunscreen, but after looking into the ingredients I decided to buy this!</li>
            <li>but that was not the case with Honest Company!</li>
            <li>Please follow the directions on the bottle and re-apply more often than the directions say and use plenty for best protection!!!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/</li>
            <li>I got fried using Honest Company sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Honest sunscreen can help you achieve these complexion goals!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, smells great and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Although it smells nice and is easy to apply, it did not protect my family at all!!!</li>
            <li>I did not experience this burning my kids skin like many experienced, but I experienced this staining all of my kids swim wear.</li>
            <li>but his forearms are bright</li>
            <li>I purchased this at our warehouse club thinking it would be a good choice (based on the ingredients) for my three boys ages 1, 3 and 5.  </li>
            <li>IF YOU HAVE FAIR SKIN REAPPLY EVERY HOUR.</li>
            <li>But no amount of sunscreen is going to save a fair person from burning, this isn&#x27;t a miracle lotion.</li>
            <li>The bottle says you have to reapply every x hours, how can you expect a good result if you never reapply?</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t put it on before you leave, drive to the pool and then think your good all day.</li>
            <li>I loved this.</li>
            <li>I thought the sunscreen went on well and felt good on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Our children are 7 and 11 and fair skinned</li>
            <li>Works good for us.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely fair skin</li>
            <li>I bought this at a warehouse in a two pack because it seemed like a good buy.  </li>
            <li>If you want a good organic sun screen try the Coola brand.  </li>
            <li>It did a good job of protecting me.</li>
            <li>Do you wish you could attain the gorgeous, lustrous skin tone of a lobster?</li>
            <li>I see that people have written the company and haven&#x27;t received good responses.  </li>
            <li>It felt good going on, moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I got a good batch???</li>
            <li>The Honest Company is being very honest about this product...</li>
            <li>I wish I would have paid more attention to the reviews, but I got distracted by the good reviews it had after the article broke that this was a great product.</li>
            <li>Easiest to apply and works great on the grand daughters, and me as well.</li>
            <li>Check the very reputable EWG site for their top-rating for this product:  http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/about-the-sunscreens/617105/The_Honest_Company_Honest_Sunscreen_Lotion%2C_SPF_30/</li>
            <li>Like real easily.</li>
            <li>I thought I liked this product, and felt good knowing</li>
            <li>Thought I was doing good by buying a mineral based sunscreen by &amp;#34;The Honest Company&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an honest customer for years and have loved the products.  </li>
            <li>We would have been better off wearing nothing as the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; just attracted the sun!</li>
            <li>I love knowing I&#x27;m not slathering a bunch of chemicals on my children or myself!</li>
            <li>I love the sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s 100% safe!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Shea butter is amazing for your skin, I have no breakouts.</li>
            <li>I bought a 2 pack of honest sunscreen at Costco.  </li>
            <li>This is as effective as olive oil.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s  website and the Honest Company</li>
            <li>HONEST COMPANY SPF 30 SUNSCREEN...</li>
            <li>Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was as effective as rubbing olive oil on the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since using Honest, I have not had any sunburns nor has my son.  </li>
            <li>He has olive skin and tans nicely, but his cheeks got burnt the day he wore the Honest sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Honest company should be ashamed of itself for even putting this on the market.</li>
            <li>My husband is more fair and it also protects him.</li>
            <li>As I said, I&#x27;ve bought Honest products before and liked them.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used The Honest Company&#x27;s sunscreen since my oldest daughter was born, and she is almost three.</li>
            <li>I informed Honest Company of what happened</li>
            <li>Shame on you Honest Company.</li>
            <li>Do a Goggle Search of the Honest Company Sunscreen and read the news articles about the product problems.</li>
            <li>Thankfully I put Badger on my kids, but my husband used Honest because it runs in so well.</li>
            <li>year, we used the the Honest Company sunscreen for a trip to Hawaii and came home without any burns.</li>
            <li>I feel like filing a lawsuit against Honest.</li>
            <li>He never had a problem with CA baby sunblock but after using honest brand he comes home sunburned.</li>
            <li>but I will definitely do more research before buying just anything, even if it&#x27;s a great deal at Costco and from what I thought was a reputable company.</li>
            <li>Told the wife to never bring another Honest Company product into our house</li>
            <li>I honestly believe this sunscreen accelerated my sunburn instead of prohibiting it.  </li>
            <li>They are a great company, and I really do love most of their products.</li>
            <li>I have always used ThinkBaby, but decided to give Honest a try.</li>
            <li>A one star rating is too kind in my book, but zero isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li>Though would would have thought that a company that names itself &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; might not be that honest after all?  </li>
            <li>Save your money - honestly.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to have received notice that the zinc was being reduced so drastically.  </li>
            <li>Be HONEST, your sunscreen has issues.</li>
            <li>This is what the honest writes on their website about the ingredients in the product.    </li>
            <li>Like others, we experienced significant sunburns after using it.</li>
            <li>I have bought many Honest products and always have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>perfect ingredient list, decent results,</li>
            <li>its very important to also be safe about sun exposure!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not on my top 10 list for sure!</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and always very cautious in the sun.</li>
            <li>Mineral sunscreens are always the best and any product with the high of a quality is a better bet.  </li>
            <li>We use the honest company&#x27;s body wash and love that.</li>
            <li>If you use a lot of sunscreen, then you may consider mixing your own since you can get protection by adding  more zinc with fewer ingredients.</li>
            <li>My wife and I love all of Honest products except for this one.</li>
            <li>The Honest sunscreen seemed to make my daughter burn even more than if she had no sunscreen at all.</li>
            <li>I liked that it does not contain the toxic chemicals that so many sunscreens do.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE Honest Co suncare products.</li>
            <li>Enjoy family togetherness as your loved ones gather around and gleefully tug at your decaying skin as you molt like a majestic, ruby-colored Python.</li>
            <li>I love this brand but they need to own up to their sunscreen being ineffective.</li>
            <li>SPF mineral sunscreen - everything you need, nothing you don&#x27;t   Easy to apply, non-greasy, non-whitening (non-nano!)</li>
            <li>is very important.</li>
            <li>I quickly ordered the Honest stick and the Honest spray.  </li>
            <li>HUGE MISTAKE!</li>
            <li>so I figured it would be a safe buy.</li>
            <li>so many others have had burns with this product.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this lotion.</li>
            <li>It is an alternative to more mainstream</li>
            <li>top priority may be non greasy lotion.</li>
            <li>and I love everything they make</li>
            <li>Bought at Costco because I am allergic to most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m FURIOUS that I jeopardized my health and my skin, when I was trying to stay safe and protect myself from the sun.</li>
            <li>I used this on my kids faces thinking it would be better then the spray I used on the rest of their bodies.</li>
            <li>Each morning I&#x27;d think the burn was getting better</li>
            <li>My daughter is in the sun most of the day at camp this summer and with application in the morning before camp and with repeated applications by her counselors she has not gotten a sunburn.</li>
            <li>I hope they fix this and make it better.</li>
            <li>Got sunburn even though I made sure to lather up with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I recently bought this at Costco thinking that it was the best buy ever...</li>
            <li>and I slathered this all over my body, feeling very proud of myself for actually using sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I have to agree with most of these reviews.</li>
            <li>I was covered heat to toe with probably protected me more than this sunscreen did.</li>
            <li>Consider using something safer, and be ok with maybe having to reapply a couple times vs.</li>
            <li>Thinkbaby sunscreen is way better imo.</li>
            <li>My husband, toddler, and I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>but I can go longer in the sun than most people.</li>
            <li>I also used this to do some yard work, but I was mostly covered up doing so</li>
            <li>Love this stuff for myself and my kiddos and wont use anything else.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad I used it on myself before putting it on my children.</li>
            <li>and I like them a lot better.</li>
            <li>I would have been better off without putting on this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Hmmmm, interesting.</li>
            <li>My daughter is allergic to he chemicals used in most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>She breaks out in blistering rashes from most sunscreens and others</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen for my family.  </li>
            <li>They are a billion dollar company and had better start doing damage control unless they want a class-action lawsuit brought against them.</li>
            <li>I wear sunblock on my face every day and thought something organic would be better.</li>
            <li>Was previously a huge Honest Company fan but now I&#x27;m having my doubts.</li>
            <li>We used as directed &amp; made sure to reapply... and still burned.</li>
            <li>We subscribe to Honest Co&#x27;s bundles and we&#x27;ve had a great experience with nearly every product we&#x27;ve tried and have been able to return a couple of products that didn&#x27;t work for us with no problem.</li>
            <li>I am redheaded and fair skinned, my wife is blond and fair skinned, and obviously are children are light haired and fair skinned.  </li>
            <li>Put a damper on our vacation for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this sunblock.</li>
            <li>Yes, a bit greasy, yes, apply a bit more often.</li>
            <li>Found like many others that this seemed to increase burn rate.  </li>
            <li>I so wanted to love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>The best bet is having the kids wear swim shirts and using regular sunscreen for arms, faces, and necks.</li>
            <li>Ok-</li>
            <li>My husband is Irish and fair skinned!!</li>
            <li>I thinks it&#x27;s one of the more affordable products on the market .</li>
            <li>most of us grew up with.</li>
            <li>The sunblock sits on top of your skin and does not absorb into your bloodstream the way sunscreen does.</li>
            <li>of it like this, this product is the Carrot Top of sunscreen</li>
            <li>All sunscreens have to be applied more often if your&#x27;re in the sun.  </li>
            <li>Instead of considering that maybe something compromised the effectiveness of their product, they spit out some nonsense about how it&#x27;s safe according to tests.</li>
            <li>We love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I applied sunscreen before leaving the house and two more times over a 6-hour period.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth with NO residue!</li>
            <li>the uvb light is whats giving you the burn!  </li>
            <li>If we hadn&#x27;t, I dread to think what she would have looked like after 30 minutes or more.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine wearing it for more than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I will be returning it and make sure never to leave home without my trusty brand.</li>
            <li>We are both super fair skinned and urn easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would have to say that I was excited to use it because it&#x27;s from The Honest Company</li>
            <li>make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not, I need as close as formula to clean ingredients in the mix as my organic sunscreen formula mix.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and this product is great!</li>
            <li>I have been using the Honest brand sunscreen for almost two years and it has worked excellent &amp; when I say that, I mean excellent for any sunscreen not just natural sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Honest Co!</li>
            <li>I have been using this consistently, and always had good results.</li>
            <li>but I thought I would try Honest as the two pack was such a great deal.  </li>
            <li>Tried the product on three separate occasions not thinking that the product could be the issue, but each time experienced far more sun damage than should have occurred considering the time of exposure.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen works great from me and my 10 month old!</li>
            <li>I thought it applied nicely and almost seemed to warm to body temperature very quickly, which the kids appreciated since it wasn&#x27;t  &amp;#34;cold.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin (over 50% Irish) and</li>
            <li>It is best to stay out of direct sunlight as much as possible and use a good sunblock on all exposed skin.</li>
            <li>Simply covering my daughters neck, forehead and ears with the sunscreen resulted in incredibly greasy hair.  </li>
            <li>It is the best closest all natural sunscreen I&#x27;ve found that works really well for all day play and water time!</li>
            <li>I bought this from a local warehouse club because it was a good price and people seem to love the Honest Company products.</li>
            <li>Listen to the reviews on here because they are true!</li>
            <li>Because it definitely does not work--my very fair family all got lightly burned within 1 hour using this sunscreen at a non-water non-sweaty activity.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty oily so washes off easily and needs to be reapplied often but it worked great on all my fair skinned kids and hubby and didn&#x27;t cause any rashes on my two with super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t burn easy.  </li>
            <li>so maybe I&#x27;m biased because I don&#x27;t burn easily</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that we are all olive skinned and don&#x27;t burn easy.</li>
            <li>the one week I tried using this product, I did not get burned, but I&#x27;ve never burned easily in my life.</li>
            <li>Liked it so much I bought two more tubes.</li>
            <li>My sister is severely allergic to most every kind of sunscreen- all mainstream and even most all natural and organic and baby formulations can close up her airways so she can&#x27;t breathe and swell up her face</li>
            <li>I am a avid user of all Honest Products since having my son 9 months ago.  </li>
            <li>The sunscreen goes on easily and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>And we were fine.</li>
            <li>It did not seem to come off in the water, and my skin was fine after.</li>
            <li>I will need a lot for a 7 day trip, but it works just fine for our all day beach trips in CT.</li>
            <li>but he said it&#x27;s fine for the pool.</li>
            <li>it goes on smooth and easy.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, I love that it is super moist on her skin as I feel like it gives her a bit of a protective layer from the effects of the pool chemicals on her skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and was super bummed when I couldn&#x27;t find it at costco today.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best natural sunscreen I have found!</li>
            <li>my whole family is burnt to a crisp after using this product!!!!</li>
            <li>I can pay twenty bucks for a huge 8 ounce bottle that lasts all summer if I know it will protect my family.</li>
            <li>Huge mistake.</li>
            <li>What a HUGE mistake.  </li>
            <li>so I use a light coating with ZERO sunburns.  </li>
            <li>PABA free; It must spell out on the face of the container.&lt;br</li>
            <li>PABA free; It must spell out on the face of the container.</li>
            <li>Virtually scent free.  </li>
            <li>, so I was stoked to find this available at a bargain price.</li>
            <li>Well, the rumors were confirmed.</li>
            <li>Last, and most importantly, the sun protection from this product is about as good as no sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It went on smooth</li>
            <li>I got the two pack cheap at costco, but if I hadn&#x27;t sent one bottle to daycare and still had both I&#x27;d return it.</li>
            <li>this important.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d rather get some chemicals in my systems by applying a cheap sunscreen, than dying of skin cancer.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen has been a great solution for us (especially for the kids) because it works well and lets us avoid worrisome chemicals.</li>
            <li>Using sunscreen that works is important.</li>
            <li>Do not use Honest really needs to take it off the market.</li>
            <li>As with any sunscreen, whether it says water resistant or not, it is important to apply before you get in the water and after.</li>
            <li>UVA is the longer wave light (ultraviolet light) that penetrates deeper into the skin.</li>
            <li>What about the UVB light?  </li>
            <li>I wanted something free of harmful chemicals, but if I have to greece myself up like a pig</li>
            <li>But it seemed to keep my fair skinned 3 year old from getting burned.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, I would not recommend this product, there are far superior ones on the market.</li>
            <li>I have used natural sunscreens with great success</li>
            <li>Honestly, I would have been far better off using nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>I had also heard good things about the company and had enjoyed a different product they manufactured.  </li>
            <li>I feel that the thickness is actually a good thing as far as water and sweat proofing goes.</li>
            <li>I thought I was being good by using a natural lotion</li>
            <li>I bought this in a two pack thinking it was good for my sensitive skinned face.</li>
            <li>We use the spray and stick frequently and have never had any burning, and we are all extremely fair skinned.</li>
            <li>Well now you can pay considerably more for comparable sun &#x27;protection,&#x27; and walk away from every beach outing with the gratification that you have inflicted upon yourself and your loved ones the pain that only seered skin can provide.</li>
            <li>I have used many other Honest products and have liked them all, but this was a bust.</li>
            <li>I do make sure to kneed the tube before we use it, especially if it&#x27;s new otherwise</li>
            <li>and that feels really clammy and gross when the air is already syrup, but it works perfectly as a sunscreen and is super moisturizing to the skin</li>
            <li>We have always used natural sunscreen with great results, but my kids and I are all burned to a crisp after applying and reapplying this product.</li>
            <li>Back to the drawing board, Honest!</li>
            <li>can have significant impact on lung health.</li>
            <li>I was so excited for this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>At first glance this seemed like a better deal, but both bottles are going in the trash.  </li>
            <li>Pretty sure that in every case of using this sunscreen you will burn.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad it was me who used it first and not my kids.</li>
            <li>And once this stage passes, you&#x27;ll delight in the shedding of layers of damaged skin in sheets of crusty fun!</li>
            <li>and I love so many of The Honest Company&#x27;s other products</li>
            <li>I try to use as many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products as possibly, so I was thrilled when I saw this at Costco.</li>
            <li>, even though it is zinc based, it doesn&#x27;t leave the white trail that so many sunscreen use, and it soaks in quite nicely, so I can use it on my bike commute to work, and not arrive looking like a ghost.</li>
            <li>zinc oxide sunscreen provides safe, effective sun protection for the entire family   Zinc oxide</li>
            <li>Makes me wonder about other honest products, and the lowering of effective ingredients in those products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zero</li>
            <li>Large companies have specially formulated lotions with many ingredients that are non-greasy.</li>
            <li>This honest sunscreen is very greasy at first, but feels like it absorbs well.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good mineral-based sunscreen, try ThinkBaby or Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li>I have used this product on my kids (both 4 year old) ever since Honest Company started making it.  </li>
            <li>I have always ordered it direct from The Honest Company</li>
            <li>The product is so greasy that what one reviewer said about it being a sunburn accelerant is true.</li>
            <li>Today I liberally applied it a good 15 to 20 min before going outside.</li>
            <li>I use honest sunblock for my 7 month old.</li>
            <li>and I think people forget it&#x27;s so low when putting it on fair skinned children.</li>
            <li>I purchased this two pack of sunscreen from a local warehouse because I thought it was a good deal</li>
            <li>Returning it for a full refund.</li>
            <li>What a full blown scam.</li>
            <li>so I made sure to pay attention to how it worked, how much we applied etc.</li>
            <li>I Bought honest sunscreen at Costco for my 9 month old baby.</li>
            <li>My fair skinned 2 and 4 year old are sunburned for the first time in their lives.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is super greasy and does not protect you from the sun at all.</li>
            <li>Not happy what so ever with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most HONEST products we have bought have been great, hence us buying this.</li>
            <li>Also, it is SUPER greasy/oily;</li>
            <li>I am super diligent about applying sunscreen every 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I am super ticked that this lotion can be sold as a sunblock or sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It does offer a mild degree of sun protection.</li>
            <li>It is super greasy and everything stuck to the kids.  </li>
            <li>I expected way better from the Honest Company.</li>
            <li>super greasy.</li>
            <li>Luckily we found this out in Iowa and before we took our Florida Vacation.  </li>
            <li>so this might not be the most appealing but it works and unless your setting a timer on your watch and am having someone put it on your shoulders and back every 80min</li>
            <li>Super greasy.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as I like many other Honest Company products.  </li>
            <li>As with any other sun protection product, it works best combined with UV protective swimwear/hats, and sunglasses, as well as avoiding being directly in the sun during the strongest times of the day.</li>
            <li>It has a great consistency and goes on smooth and rubs in easily unlike a lot of the other natural sunscreens we have tried.</li>
            <li>I bought this in Costco for half the price and it has worked great.  </li>
            <li>At first I loved this sunscreen, I used it on my face and arms and was outside a couple hours.</li>
            <li>It is very oily, but that did make it easy to spread.  </li>
            <li>I am super white and have a - can&#x27;t tan to save my life - kind of complexion.</li>
            <li>We find that it works best if you pat dry, sit in the shade for snack time after reapplying, and then go back in the water.</li>
            <li>I put so much of this on my pregnant body before going out to the beach today and got severely burned!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll experience the scorching fun of skin tender and hot to the touch!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so hard to find a good, safe sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cost a zillion dollars.</li>
            <li>His generic store brand sunscreen worked amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>My shoulders burned lightly, and the rest of my body tanned as if I was wearing no sunscreen at all.&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen is VERY GREASY, and it DOESN&amp;#34;T WORK</li>
            <li>If you have had a similar experience, share it with The Honest Company.  </li>
            <li>Instead of protection we were essentially basting ourselves with oil for a nice, crispy finish.  </li>
            <li>EWG rates this on their top 1-7 rating, an excellent score especially when only 20 made the list from over 1,000 different sunscreen mix.</li>
            <li>I keep it refrigerated till I use and always go for a fresh sunscreen all the time</li>
            <li>I keep it refrigerated till I use and always go for a fresh sunscreen all the time</li>
            <li>Give me traditional sunscreens any day over The Honest Company &amp;#34;Sunscreen&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and most sunscreens make me break out in a rash, so I thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li>I love the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>and I rarely ever burn.</li>
            <li>Being health conscious, I purchased this sunscreen from Costco because it boasts that it is healthy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;My wife has been purchasing Honest Co diapers, wipes, hand sanitizer, and body wash/shampoo for the last couple years.</li>
            <li>We have been nothing but pleased with those products and stopped buying competing natural products because of our satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but so worth it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thankful that we did a trial run at a short activity, because a day at the beach could have ended us up at the doctor if Honest Company was all we had to rely</li>
            <li>Just use a mixture of Crisco and duck fat it will provide far better protection.</li>
            <li>Claiming to operate a safe natural company and poisoning oneself with tobacco is a joke.</li>
            <li>Yes, it no longer turns your skin white when you put it on, but the product is no longer effective.</li>
            <li>On a side note, I just checked the Honest website and the sunscreen is currently listed as &amp;#34;Out of Stock&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I have an olive complexion and thus, have rarely ever burned.  </li>
            <li>This is not the Honest Sunscreen from years prior.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Honest Company products, but this sunscreen just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Upon further research, honest reduced the amount of zinc from 20% to 9% which appears to explain why it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>My husband purchased this in a 2 tube pack from Costco because he knows I prefer to use products with more natural ingredients</li>
            <li>You are better off going old school and slathering yourself with baby oil.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re are essentially applying an assortment of oils to you skin with the Honest product</li>
            <li>just reading the Ingredients on the Honest product raises red flags period!</li>
            <li>Like so many other reviewers, I purchased this from Costco, pleased to be purchasing a safer more natural product.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to see this product in a two pack for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The Honest Company apparently changed their formula so that it only contains 9% zinc oxide while most sunscreens contain 18-25%.</li>
            <li>, I see that I was right.  </li>
            <li>It smelled so badly right after I opened it.</li>
            <li>I did everything right, and this did not work at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly greasy and leaves skin feeling really gross for a long time.</li>
            <li>I usually buy California baby products but wanted to try honest company sunblocks as it came in a two pack for a better price.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s super pale, so we have tried and vetted out 100&#x27;s of different sunscreens over the years to try to find the perfect brand.</li>
            <li>This is the second product of theirs that I have been less than impressed with.</li>
            <li>I chose this product because it is free of the harmful cancer causing chemicals that normal name brand sunscreens use</li>
            <li>My entire family who does not burn easily all burned after a day in the sun even after applying this sunscreen three times!</li>
            <li>They cover better and are a little more fool-proof.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this sunscreen, as it was more affordable than some of the other non-nano zinc sunscreens I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Be sun smart people!</li>
            <li>I used it as directed and applied it liberally, because I&#x27;m a little on the fair side.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try the new formula sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Or are there some kind of hard feelings toward the Honest company that I&#x27;m completely oblivious to?</li>
            <li>Recently she&#x27;s been spending a lot more time on the sun at school</li>
            <li>I always use chemical free natural sunscreen for my two kids (age 2 &amp; 5) and myself</li>
            <li>I really, really hope my skin recovers from this assault!</li>
            <li>Still not my favorite zinc based product, but it makes a big difference if you follow the directions!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite sunscreen, my entire family uses it and have never been burned.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen because it&#x27;s the only mineral-based sunscreen that is easier to put on.</li>
            <li>Later I looked more closely at the ingredients</li>
            <li>First, the product applies like a layer of grease -- imagine putting melted butter on your skin.</li>
            <li>(it wasn&#x27;t even that hot</li>
            <li>but my daughter and I  got burned after using this sunscreen for the first time and I will not be using it again.</li>
            <li>First off, its like rubbing oil on your skin.</li>
            <li>We used exactly as directed and they weren&#x27;t in the water at any point.</li>
            <li>Just like so many others...got this at the local store at the begining of summer.</li>
            <li>I am not even sure how its possible for sunscreen not to work AT ALL....</li>
            <li>GREASE literally comes out first when you squeeze this.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re prone to burning than I suggest a product with a higher SPF.</li>
            <li>and I got really sunburnt!</li>
            <li>Firstly, I did not buy this product from Amazon; I bought it from Costco.  </li>
            <li>It also has no questionable or problem ingredients.</li>
            <li>I applied it liberally and exactly according to the directions to myself and my three children, and we all ended up burned.  </li>
            <li>It lasts really well after a liberal application!</li>
            <li>I try to be aware of and avoid &amp;</li>
            <li>This is the first review I have ever written</li>
            <li>Most importantly, not effective at preventing sunburn, which both my daughter and I experienced after just a short time in the sun.  </li>
            <li>I will stick to CA baby sunblock even with the higher cost.</li>
            <li>We applied sunscreen before we left the house, and then TWO more times.</li>
            <li>Sure there are time&#x27;s people get sunburns because they don&#x27;t apply enough, or don&#x27;t reapply, but if this many people are saying that it&#x27;s not working with proper use, maybe there&#x27;s something to it?</li>
            <li>Same as many, bought this at Costco, to my regret.</li>
            <li>Shame on The &amp;#34;Honest&amp;#34; Company for not doing better research on their products, especially those designed for children!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what these people are doing wrong, but this is some of the BEST sunscreen I have EVER used.  </li>
            <li>I have used many different brands and types of sunscreen over the years and not gotten burned (so this is not user error).  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it on my kids, both were burned.</li>
            <li>Both of our backs were burnt to a crisp.</li>
            <li>I know this brand is generally pretty reputable, but this product does more bad then good.  </li>
            <li>The rash did go away for the most part the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We we at a water park for 4 hours in the Midwest when it was 97 degrees and the water even felt like a hot tub.</li>
            <li>The directions say to SHAKE the bottle first.</li>
            <li>You are typically more likely to get cancer from products with toxic chemicals rather than the sun itself.  </li>
            <li>Wish I had read reviews first.</li>
            <li>The EWG ratings were stellar.  </li>
            <li>It feels so hot and sticky and gets all over everything.</li>
            <li>I have used both the old formula &amp; recently have been using the new formula purchased at Costco with the same excellent results.  </li>
            <li>Will never buy this product again, and this experience will make me think twice about buying any other products from Honest as well.</li>
            <li>Natural sunscreens are all kind of gross.</li>
            <li>Back to Babyganics, it may not have the best chemicals but at least we won&#x27;t get sunburned.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe they call themselves the Honest Company and sell a sunblock that so clearly does the opposite of what they say.  </li>
            <li>Dear Honest, please bring back your old formula.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give this product a fair trial, so I really layered it on super thick.</li>
            <li>First off it feels like pure grease,  </li>
            <li>mineral sunscreens have downsides, the most effective ones being very thick and leaving your whole skin with a whitish cast.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m almost positive all the oils probably are causing the accelerated burning.</li>
            <li>It went straight into the trash after the first use.</li>
            <li>BE RESPONSIBLE NOT CARELESS IN THE SUN.</li>
            <li>There are other sun products we&#x27;ve used that have never allowed us to burn, with even longer exposure (i.e. Blue Lizard, Happy Baby.)  </li>
            <li>I skin was unbearably itchy for 2 straight days, could not sleep the first night even after taking a Benadryl.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s true of all natural sunscreen brands, as a matter of fact.</li>
            <li>I follow EWG&#x27;s guidelines for application (a shot glass full to cover an adult&#x27;s arms, chest and face), and I reapply every 2 hours and reapply after water play.  </li>
            <li>We made the mistake of using this on our daughter and luckily noticed her burning within 15 minutes of being outside so managed to get her out of the sun quickly.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t look stark white once we rubbed it in, and it left my arms so incredibly and wonderfully smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I checked out EWG skin deep website on sunscreen and SOOO many have high risk chemicals in them-</li>
            <li>I will say I am very very particular with my sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read that &amp;#34;Honest CO&amp;#34; is pretty much passing the buck on this, and it really pisses me off.</li>
            <li>I actually prefer the texture since its easy to spread on a not so cooperative baby who&#x27;s always on the move.  </li>
            <li>I even like the previously formulation of the honest sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>The new sunscreen this year is a little more oily than previous years but still gave our family great protection.</li>
            <li>It feels like I&#x27;ve put pure grease/oil on my face.</li>
            <li>It almost seems like pure oil.  </li>
            <li>and it still came out as pure grease.</li>
            <li>We wore it for almost an hour on a very hot day, direct sunlight at noon time, at the pool.</li>
            <li>After the first application, I reapplied with spray of a different brand on his back and used the honest on neck, face, and ears.  </li>
            <li>I bought a two-pack at Costco (before reading reviews) and was excited to be able to use this in the pool due to its non-toxic, all natural formulation.</li>
            <li>I have applied this to myself and my kids on several sunny days and have come to the conclusion that I actually get more burned wearing this than when wearing nothing!  </li>
            <li>We are so careful to keep our kids protected from the sun, now they&#x27;ve experienced their first burns due to this product.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it would be nice if it had a little bit of a scent.</li>
            <li>now compare the product to the others with the chemicals in it that protect you from all and are a true broad spectrum sunscreen protecting you from UVB and UVA.</li>
            <li>My favorite part and why I bought is that I like that it is more natural and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, like putting a nice lotion on.</li>
            <li>and I all turned bright pink after only 1 hour</li>
            <li>before spending 1.5 hours outdoors and am very burnt today.</li>
            <li>This is seriously very concerning and a health hazard.</li>
            <li>It is very greasy to apply and DOES NOT provide sun protection.  </li>
            <li>IT STRAIGHT FROM</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sunscreen needs to protect and needs to protect for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My family of 5 used this sunscreen yesterday and all 5 of us are very burnt.</li>
            <li>It is very greasy</li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>My whole family used it and we were all severely burnt.</li>
            <li>I grabbed this whole at Costco as I thought it would be &amp;#34;organic&amp; safe&amp;#34; against cancer causing chemicals</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning &amp; very upset.</li>
            <li>Jessica Alba, would you really put this junk on you or your kids?</li>
            <li>and I reapplied so much in that one day that I went through a whole bottle.</li>
            <li>It does not rub into the skin very well and is not at all moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It really has to be coated on and it takes some effort to rub into your skin.</li>
            <li>On another note, the product is indeed very greasy.  </li>
            <li>We re-apply after every 60-90 mins depending on how much she is in and out of the water.</li>
            <li>Neither of us has ever had a sunburn like this after using as much sunscreen as we did.</li>
            <li>I much rather use this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen works very well for us.</li>
            <li>she ended up burning very bad.---I  </li>
            <li>I really wish I had read the reviews before buying this at Costco.</li>
            <li>We used almost a whole tube of this just the 3 of us when we went and we are all slim people.</li>
            <li>It also felt really greasy going on and since we were on a beach it practically attracted sand.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The sunscreen came off fast once we sweated.</li>
            <li>I was ready to purchase some for myself until we noticed that my niece&#x27;s arms were getting darker and darker.  </li>
            <li>All my kids still got very burned.  </li>
            <li>You have to be ok with looking white at the beginning because it is a NATURAL sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I used this all summer for the first time and for the first time I never had to worry about my boys (10 ad 13 yrs old) getting burned.</li>
            <li>and he said works good just greasy which sucks when you looked like you oiled up before</li>
            <li>If your idea of a good time is wearing a thick, greasy coat of Vaseline all over your body, you&#x27;ll like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I was willing to overlook the greasiness for a good quality, natural product but not if it just plain doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>I live in hot and humid Florida, I am 39 and have a combination skin.</li>
            <li>I used the new formula this week and for the first time ever my son got a sunburn.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida and go to water aerobics three times a week in the hot sun.</li>
            <li>On the other hand Honest Sunscreen leaves no whiteness and is perfectly clear.  </li>
            <li>In other good news, we left a bottle in the car on a day when the asphalt was melting while we went to the amusement park (another was in the pack</li>
            <li>So these extreme sunburns have plenty of variables like how many times did you get in and out of the water  , or did you really if you did get in and out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only part of my leg that isn&#x27;t bright red, which is the exact opposite of what should happen when you miss a spot applying sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I wonder if the people who are rating it poorly due to sunburns are using it more sparingly to counter-act the greasy feeling?</li>
            <li>I wanted to chime in on these reviews due to the latest headlines regarding this product.  </li>
            <li>As other reviews are stating, this &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; seems to act more like a tanning oil and accelerate the burn.</li>
            <li>Believe me, this sunscreen protected my skin better than any other I have used.</li>
            <li>Having watched parents not properly apply sunscreen over &amp; over again, it is my guess that that there is a very good chance that it was “user error” , not applying enough or not applying it soon enough (30 min before sun exposure) are the two most common errors I have witnessed.  </li>
            <li>look for clean formulas all the time with following pointers;&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>I look for clean formulas all the time with following pointers;</li>
            <li>in the end, if you want a natural alternative without oxybenzones and other potentially harmful chemicals, look for other varieties of Zinc Oxide sunblocks--the best zinc oxide sunblocks come in 20% or higher concentrations.</li>
            <li>Works great (little goes a long way); highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I usually like the Honest Co.</li>
            <li>Ironically just today I was going to apply this sunscreen lotion  on my my 5 yr old son and the first thing he told me was &amp;#34; mom I don&#x27;t like that one it feels like my skin gets hotter with this one &amp;#34; and I was thrown off</li>
            <li>Not sure why Honest would change the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I brought Honest Company Sunscreen for myself while he stuck to his usual store brand.  </li>
            <li>I use it, my husband uses it, and we use it on our 1.5 year old ;)</li>
            <li>Just want to ditto what most reviews have already said, and give this product a thumbs down, will no buy again.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>This is very greasy, but I could live with that.</li>
            <li>Zinc is the solution, more zinc for less money with organic ingredients that are not carcinogen or harmful to my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>More ZO cost more, less ZO cost less</li>
            <li>I wanted a sunscreen that was better for the environment and had less chemicals</li>
            <li>I along with many bough this at Costco at half the price on amazon.</li>
            <li>just wasn&#x27;t put on think enough and tried it again the next day and her skin got burnt even more.  </li>
            <li>she luckily had a rash guard on and only had the sun screen on her face and legs.</li>
            <li>but it is good to know that when I choose one, it offers the least amount of chemicals in the mix.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d started to hear horror stories about the sunscreen not working, so I made sure to only use it on myself at our next beach outing.</li>
            <li>I suppose that&#x27;s because the main ingredient (after zinc oxide) is beeswax.</li>
            <li>I bought a two pack of this sunscreen from a warehouse store based on the one main ingredient, Zinc Oxide.</li>
            <li>The scent is decent.</li>
            <li>We have tried all of the main stream sunscreens and nothing has worked.</li>
            <li>Several more outings at home in Denver and the same results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there is something to do with personal &#x27;chemistry&#x27; pH or similar things that can have an effect on how well sunscreens can work.</li>
            <li>So, yes, it&#x27;s greasy, but to me that&#x27;s a positive because it makes it a lot easier to spread over the skin of my 6 year old twins.</li>
            <li>This mix has 9.3% ZO, it is not as high as 18% ZO</li>
            <li>Texture, smell, and effectiveness of the product are all highly graded in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I thought I was splurging on a high quality, safer sunscreen, and it ended up ruining the rest of our vacation.</li>
            <li>From now on I am using Coppertone Waterbabies, highly recommended by Consumer Reports and affordable.</li>
            <li>I bought a 2-pack from a local warehouse store and was excited to have found a natural solution.</li>
            <li>So I will still use what&#x27;s left in an - I can&#x27;t find any other sunscreen - kind of emergency.</li>
            <li>only plus side is that it doesn&#x27;t create the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; effect other mineral based sunscreens do; although, I think that shows it isn&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li>The product kept my family from burns unlike many of these other reviewers, but we had to apply frequently.</li>
            <li>The lessons I&#x27;ve learned from these reviews are don&#x27;t try out a new sunscreen on a beach day and even if EWG gave it amazing reviews, cross check it with the general public reviews.</li>
            <li>Our favorite sunscreen to date is little twigs.</li>
            <li>I would rather pay a little more and have a product that works for my family.</li>
            <li>Since you can&#x27;t spray the kids in the face, or shouldn&#x27;t anyway, the stick works a little better than trying to spray your hands and rub their faces.</li>
            <li>This product does not appear to have enough active ingredient to be effective,</li>
            <li>is the ONLY active sunscreen ingredient - NO synthetic chemical sunscreens   Water resistant - tested effective for up to 80 minutes   </li>
            <li>so probably better to apply outdoor (not right before getting in vehicles or near furniture)</li>
            <li>Instead of storming to the Internet to bring bad press to an otherwise great company that literally functions to make safe and affordable products for people, maybe some of you should simply take your business elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I really feel like doing a class action lawsuit.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would work because it contains all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Love the idea of the Honest Company, and bought the product based on name brand alone, but product really failed to meet my basic expectations of what a sunscreen should do.</li>
            <li>but more importantly, it is NO NANO</li>
            <li>What I put on my skin is the same as consuming it through my skin since it is absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li>I insure to check the expiration date and purchase anything that I consume especially anything that it goes on my skin which is absorbed by the skin and processed by the liver.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li>I insure to check the expiration date and purchase anything that I consume especially anything that it goes on my skin which is absorbed by the skin and processed by the liver.</li>
            <li>We would have been better off going with no sunscreen than this garbage - at least we would not have had the false sense of being safe from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays, and would have worn protective clothing and found more frequent shade.  </li>
            <li>I do shake and squeeze the bottle a few times to make sure that the zinc oxide is dispersed before using.  </li>
            <li>Why no negative star options?</li>
            <li>First, this product goes on very heavy--consistency and smell is similar to melted wax.  </li>
            <li>We were outside in the mid day sun for about 4 hours with0ut any kind of color at all definitely no burns</li>
            <li>This product does not use harsh chemicals and will be more beneficial.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t find the sunscreen I normally use.</li>
            <li>I applied a good amount before leaving the house and then sat and watched my son&#x27;s baseball game for 3 hours while reapplying this sunscreen every 45 min&#x27;s to an hour</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t that, because we live in a humid area and it sometimes makes sweat form little droplets on top of my skin instead of letting it evaporate well</li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite sunscreen for both my 21 month old daughter and myself.  </li>
            <li>My review below is the letter I sent directly to Honest Co regarding the failure of this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Second, and most important for my pale family, you have to actually follow directions.</li>
            <li>I purchased this thinking that it would be a great alternative to the more expensive brand I usually purchase.</li>
            <li>I just want people to know that they are buying and would live to see this sunscreen off the market.</li>
            <li>I use the lotion and face stick, live in Florida and have never burnt while wearing it.</li>
            <li>We live in a seaside town in New England and spend loads of time outdoors and at the beach.</li>
            <li>We live in FL and have used it for months out at the pool and at the beach.</li>
            <li>The cream itself is very oily, the oil and white substance is separated no matter how much you try to shake it.</li>
            <li>Trust me, I&#x27;m not someone who is looking to place blame unnecessarily, I gave this product a fair chance, used it as direct and suffered for it.</li>
            <li>By that evening it was very clear that your sunscreen did virtually nothing to protect me and my family from the sun, and each one of us has varying degrees of severe sunburns.</li>
            <li>We usually only think of shaking the spray cans of sunscreen, but if you read the instructions on this product, it very clearly states to shake to tube first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many many mineral-based sunscreens and I think this is the worst.</li>
            <li>Absolutely offers no protection yet costs a fortune!</li>
            <li>got so sunburned except for my mother in law and 2 yr old which were the ones that didn&#x27;t use this  product !</li>
            <li>The ingredients are all natural and the zinc is non-nano!</li>
            <li>Put this on my 9 year old son and he BURNED!  </li>
            <li>Then I came here and discovered that everybody else had the exact same experience.  </li>
            <li>I applied it once before going outside for the first time</li>
            <li>Use as directed and reapply, and always, no matter what sun protection you use, limit time in direct sun!</li>
            <li>We usually reapply before the listed time just to be safe</li>
            <li>The ONLY sunscreen that protected me from photosensitivity reaction after trying MANY others, much more expensive.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it on my daughter, we went for a short walk before her doctor&#x27;s appointment.  </li>
            <li>My mom bought this at Costco for my 1 year old niece because you couldn&#x27;t beat the price!  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this junk!</li>
            <li>Now having to lather up in aloe &amp; wet clothes to keep cool.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;ve never even been pink after a full day in the sun.</li>
            <li>Majority have many different ingredients than zinc and titanium as ACTIVE INGREDIENTS.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Majority have many different ingredients than zinc and titanium as ACTIVE INGREDIENTS.</li>
            <li>We live near the beach</li>
            <li>It has now been a month and my skin is still not back to normal!!</li>
            <li>Now when I open the tube I get this clear greasy liquid that comes out first before the lotion.</li>
            <li>As far as wear throughout the day, this product seemed to cause me to sweat a lot more than usual.  </li>
            <li>and he spent the first week of our much anticipated summer vacation with it</li>
            <li>My 6-year old daughter has very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Why do I need fragrance on my skin which is alcohol regardless, and this is from an athlete where I consume fresh garlic napping in vinegar every single day.</li>
            <li>Why do I need fragrance on my skin which is alcohol regardless, and this is from an athlete where I consume fresh garlic napping in vinegar every single day.</li>
            <li>Use some common sense and test it before you trust your whole family with it during a full day in the sun!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be going back to our tried and true Banana Boat Natural Reflect.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this sunscreen sucks!</li>
            <li>My first comment is that it is very oily in comparison to other sunscreen on the market.</li>
            <li>This natural ingredient sunscreen allowed the natural sun to naturally burn our skin - so natural!  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that this has a little extra oil in it to make it easier to spread.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a little greasy, but in my opinion better than chemical laden products or aerosol sunscreen sprays which studies are starting to show</li>
            <li>If this product can protect a 45 year old bald surfer with pale skin, then it should be fine for everyone, just remember to read the directions when applying.</li>
            <li>I will try to return it to the whole sale store where I purchased it, and a huge complaint will go with it.</li>
            <li>My least favorite natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I used it under direct sun for only 30 minutes and my skin got very itchy.  </li>
            <li>Whenever I see the signs for a &amp;#34;going out of business sale&amp;#34; and all the hype that goes with it, I also steer clear.  </li>
            <li>One of my kids has excema and nearly every sunscreen caused her to cry out this</li>
            <li>I was putting something natural on my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>My 2 year old is so burnt</li>
            <li>I wrote to the company in the feedback section of their website out of genuine concern a few weeks ago &amp; heard nothing in response.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old granddaughter was at the water park today for about 3 hours with her mother</li>
            <li>yes the zinc offers sun protection, but the oil does not.  </li>
            <li>In addition, the oil will cause breakouts on sensitive skin (this is what happened to me).  </li>
            <li>so if you are purchasing this, you are getting an old mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACTIVE INGREDIENT:</li>
            <li>Producers like to spin the facts and challenge our knowledge and intelligence by claiming it as WITHOUT any harsh chemical or chemical FREE or without chemical ABSORBERS.</li>
            <li>Producers like to spin the facts and challenge our knowledge and intelligence by claiming it as WITHOUT any harsh chemical or chemical FREE or without chemical ABSORBERS.</li>
            <li>I feel like I was completely duped with this product.</li>
            <li>Took my family to the waterpark for the day and applied this non-harmful, non-chemical, completely non-functional paste pretending to be sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>The whole family was burned after only 2 hours at the pool.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Thankfully my daughter only really tans in the sun</li>
            <li>My kids got burned despite frequent application, but I told myself that it must be my fault b/c</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t reapplying enough or they were in the water too much, etc.  </li>
            <li>My husband, 2 year old daughter</li>
            <li>We used this on our 18 month old baby</li>
            <li>I will be surprised if there isn&#x27;t a class action lawsuit.</li>
            <li>so I am definitely keeping it for trips to drier climates, like when I visit Colorado or California or really anywhere besides the South.</li>
            <li>My 1 year old was SEVERLY burned using this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s complete garbage.</li>
            <li>Interesting to read all the negative reviews.</li>
            <li>If you are an attorney, file a class action lawsuit and we will all sign up.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my kiddos with sensitive skin but never again.</li>
            <li>For all of these young moms out there, I would be upset as well.  </li>
            <li>It offers zero protection against the sun</li>
            <li>I used Water Babies on my 20 month old son before leaving the house.</li>
            <li>I bought this two pack at Costco before heading to an all day event in nearly 100 degree weather.</li>
            <li>It is completely ineffective as a sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really that simple</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>Have tried the product on myself and my three year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this on my 2 year old all summer.</li>
            <li>Really greasy and gross feeling</li>
            <li>This product does not work at all, it offers no protection.  </li>
            <li>I applied this well and reapplied to my three young children</li>
            <li>which was unexpected by me</li>
            <li>I use it on myself and my daughter who is 10 months old.</li>
            <li>I am near tears...</li>
            <li>Used on 8, 10, and 42 year old.  </li>
            <li>My son is 14 months old</li>
            <li>Who cares if it is all natural if it doesn&#x27;t work?  </li>
            <li>I took my boys (3 years old and 18 months old) to the beach today and used this sunscreen on them as well as myself.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old didn&#x27;t even go in the water</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s an all natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using these products since my now 2.5yr old was born.</li>
            <li>I know that the majority of people don&#x27;t use enough sunscreen to begin with or reapply within appropriate time frames, but even if you take a lack of common sense into account, these reviews are still very telling.  </li>
            <li>We also frequent the pool and again we&#x27;ve never had any problems.</li>
            <li>This product is completely ineffective.</li>
            <li>Naturally derived, unscented, broad-spectrum (UVA and UVB)</li>
            <li>It took a long time to wash off with soap, hot water, a wash cloth, and a lot of scrubbing.</li>
            <li>I too am surprised by so many negative reviews.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen protected my pale family (so pale my sister mixes the lightest color of foundations with a good amount of goth targeted pure white costume foundation to make it actually match her real skin color) at the beach, the pool, and the amusement park.</li>
            <li>Unlike other mineral-based sunscreens, this one applies smoothly and without a white residue.</li>
            <li>Not only did we have to cut a special outing with old friends short, but my son&#x27;s face looked like he had 3rd degree burns</li>
            <li>First of all, this is a physical sunscreen, not the scary chemical kind.</li>
            <li>Sat at the beach for 2 hours, applied it twice and got what I&#x27;m pretty sure is a second degree, maybe worse, sunburn on my chest and the sides of my breasts.</li>
            <li>The honest company should do some major work on their brand before putting a name like &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; behind a sunscreen that promotes skin cancer.</li>
            <li>I usually wear a 15 and am fine for 4 hours.  </li>
            <li>but anyways Honest sunscreen doesn&#x27;t get gross in the bottle, it also doesn&#x27;t feel super cold when you put it on like</li>
            <li>I may have left it outside and it was hot out, but helllloooo people -</li>
            <li>Not sure why it hasn&#x27;t worked for others, but it most definitely works for us!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t complain at all with other brands, but I thought if it worked well, they could deal with it, since it&#x27;s better for them than other brands.</li>
            <li>my husband and I ever used, so we only applied it once - the first and only time.  </li>
            <li>We have tried very hard to protect our children outdoors as we are aware of scientific research indicating the significant increase in cancer risk for each severe sunburn received as a child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>I saw this at Costco the other and grabbed it the price was right so why not try I.</li>
            <li>However, I highly suggest to purchase a different brand unless you want a sunburn.  </li>
            <li>I rarely leave a review but being a very fair skinned person who got a terrible burn on vacation from this</li>
            <li>We bought ours from Costco, like many other reviewers (the two pack was less than $15 there,) and fully plan to return this product.  </li>
            <li>They have never had a sunburn and we live in Southern Arizona with a pool.  </li>
            <li>She has NEVER had a sunburn, and we live in Southern California where temps reach 100</li>
            <li>ACTIVE INGREDIENTS of more zinc less titanium, the best-rated mineral sun blocks.</li>
            <li>ACTIVE INGREDIENTS of more zinc less titanium, the best-rated mineral sun blocks.</li>
            <li>My husband and daughter used this product (I stuck to the old faithful Banana Boat Natural and was unburned the entire time)</li>
            <li>/&gt;7. BROAD SPECTRUM</li>
            <li>BROAD SPECTRUM</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m furious that, like the other reviewers, we were basically basting ourselves to be burned to a crisp.</li>
            <li>First, the product is extremely greasy and oily coming out of the package.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this product ruined the first part of our vacation due to his pain and having to find places in Colorado to stay inside to avoid the sun to let him heal.  </li>
            <li>applied on her first then applied Neutrogena beach defense on my other kids ( who did not burn at all).</li>
            <li>Producers of sunscreens sells their products for what they think they can get for each ounce of sunscreen based on their formula and ingredients that they put in that particular sunscreen, especially the percentage of the ZO varies by different production.</li>
            <li>In reviewing your company values, itis clear to me that you are not acting on your principles regarding honesty, service, outperform, and sustaining (not harming) life.</li>
            <li>If  you want a natural sunscreen check out think baby, that stuff actually works.</li>
            <li>The 2 year old had it applied to her face only</li>
            <li>I stopped for some aloe with lidocaine and even after applying that I could barely move without pain.  </li>
            <li>This was a sunburn SO dark it was almost purple with blisters everywhere, my skin was swollen and hot to the touch for days.  </li>
            <li>I can buy Alba or Kiss My Face for a similar price and natural quality</li>
            <li>I used this last week on my 6 month old.</li>
            <li>She was completely burn (very red) and broke out in a rash.</li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t get burned from using it, but my family is pretty dark skinned.</li>
            <li>normally stay out twice as long with Paula&#x27;s Choice spf 50 with no problem.</li>
            <li>I am so angry with the Honest Company because of this product.  </li>
            <li>The more you apply, the worse the burn.</li>
            <li>There are some five star reviews defending the Honest Company, saying that all of us who got burned must have been doing something wrong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Sun reflective chemicals such as AVOBENZONE that may be absorbed or broken down into more harmful substances</li>
            <li>So I am super surprised to see the amount of negative reviews-</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t have to reapply multiple times as some reviewers said they have to, but we&#x27;ve learned long ago how not to get fried in the sun, and that includes not relying on any brand of sunscreen to provide full protection after one application if you&#x27;re swimming, sweating or active outdoors.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t even have to reapply much even when they spent hours in the sun!</li>
            <li>&amp; so I need a product that works &amp; has much safer ingredients than then other chemical based sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>Six June days in Florida at the theme parks including 3 days on the beach and not a single burn on the 4 of us.</li>
            <li>I love Honest products, but this one is terrible.</li>
            <li>We used a different brand natural product on our faces with the same application frequency.</li>
            <li>As a 21-year old, I used to slather on baby oil (prior to being diagnosed with melanoma at 23) to get as tan as possible.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like the lotion because it is difficult to rub in, especially on squirmy kids, and you can&#x27;t be sure that you&#x27;ve shaken it up well enough, but I&#x27;ve heard that they&#x27;ve improved that product.</li>
            <li>Then after reading reviews on Amazon about this exact product, I got a little frightened to use it, thinking that it might not work.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a more natural product for my little one&#x27;s delicate skin</li>
            <li>Just wanted to chime in that I also purchased this two-pack from Costco, and my two children who have never had a sunburn before were pretty red after less than one hour in the sun.</li>
            <li>which hardly any other sunscreen producer uses, it is the better ZO</li>
            <li>I avoid OXYBENZONE which apparently disrupts human hormonal</li>
            <li>I avoid OXYBENZONE which apparently disrupts human hormonal system.</li>
            <li>I rarely burn and when I do, it&#x27;s just in a small spot I missed while applying sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I wish I could post pictures of my poor 6-year-old who fell asleep crying tonight from the hideous sunburn she acquired after 90 minutes in the sun today, completely slathered in Honest Company Sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Banana Boat, Coppertone, and the like get gross and melty in the sun, which is ridiculous considering it is made to be used in the Summer when it gets hot, and also because it&#x27;s chemically so the whole world of nonmelting ingredients is open to them-</li>
            <li>I am generally not a noticeable sweater, but this product brought forth the sweat beads like no other.</li>
            <li>I was in the sun for less than an hour and my whole family was burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used this liberally instead of my normal spray on protection and spent the same time in the sun and got burned when I never had before.  </li>
            <li>and my skin would get red when I put this sunscreen on in the hotel room before heading down to the water (where we sat in the shade the whole time).</li>
            <li>I was so excited to buy this product, and having a big star (i.e. Jessica Alba) helps promote this company, but the product is not good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really upset as I feel this company is outright misleading the public and putting helpless little ones at risk.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen any tanning, it protects from sun perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect sunscreen for people that have skin allergies.  </li>
            <li> If in the ocean for longer than an hour then the best protection is Vaseline.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an excellent choice if you have concerns about:&lt;br /&gt;-Nano</li>
            <li> Sunscreen works great!</li>
            <li> ( I have used about 8 of their products and have always been highly impressed with every product.)</li>
            <li> Then curiosity got the best of me</li>
            <li> This sunscreen scored 1 out  8 (1 being the best) at this website, http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/about-the-sunscreens/617105/The_Honest_Company_Honest_Sunscreen_Lotion%2C_SPF_30/</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> but clearly it isn&#x27;t safe against the sun!!!!</li>
            <li> This product rates 1 on the EWG site, which is the best score a product can receive in regards to the safety of ingredients.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is awesome!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably best if you don&#x27;t wear any, this things is a sun magnet.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> However I support this company and what they stand for, and the majority of their products are perfect.</li>
            <li> but it works perfectly for my family!</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen we have tried!</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
            <li> It did a perfect job of protecting my skin</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> It protected me perfectly, and I had no problem with it being too greasy.  </li>
            <li> one of the best on the market.</li>
            <li> Your better off going without sunscreen!!!  </li>
            <li> We trusted Honest Sunscreen for our baby and was burned (pun intended)!!</li>
            <li> but I know my very fair skinned (Caucasian) mother used this with me and didn&#x27;t burn ?</li>
            <li> Good luck!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly greasy too, which isn&#x27;t great when you&#x27;re trying to hold a wiggly baby.</li>
            <li> One of the top best sunscreens for the best protection.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be a great solution....</li>
            <li> this is my daughter and thought since it was made of zinc it would be great.</li>
            <li> It is a bit greasy but to me it feels great.  </li>
            <li> The sun protection seems to be effective and it is given an Excellent rating for UVA protection by the EWG reviewing report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.ewg.org/2014sunscreen/about-the-sunscreens/566127</li>
            <li> I will keep using them and have to add, that while one sunscreen works great for me, it may not work great for you.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it felt like I&#x27;d been out in the middle-of-day overhead sun, not the end-of-day sun that I&#x27;d actually experienced.</li>
            <li> and this sunscreen has done a great job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to see these reviews, I thought it was just us</li>
            <li> Great deal.</li>
            <li> I think the happy medium for me is Mexitan spf 30.  </li>
            <li> California Baby is a great organic sunscreen option.</li>
            <li> I greatly dislike the texture and consistency.</li>
            <li> Way too greasy to use on my face but great everywhere else.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that The Honest Company was a wonderful company to go to for baby products.  </li>
            <li> I saw a headline on yahoo regarding how this sunscreen isn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li> Great price at Costco ($13 for two)</li>
            <li> Not feeling too happy tonight.</li>
            <li> Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans&#x27; salty water without any shade, then Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is, but for a surfer like me, usually higher organic ingredients are the best since I am in and out of sun which washes away the mix in the oceans’ salty water.</li>
            <li> More like SPF 2 (at best) than SPF 30.</li>
            <li> Honest, I think not!</li>
            <li> I was going to make my own sunscreen, but after looking into the ingredients I decided to buy this!</li>
            <li> but that was not the case with Honest Company!</li>
            <li> Please follow the directions on the bottle and re-apply more often than the directions say and use plenty for best protection!!!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/</li>
            <li> I got fried using Honest Company sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Honest sunscreen can help you achieve these complexion goals!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, smells great and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Although it smells nice and is easy to apply, it did not protect my family at all!!!</li>
            <li> I did not experience this burning my kids skin like many experienced, but I experienced this staining all of my kids swim wear.</li>
            <li> but his forearms are bright</li>
            <li> I purchased this at our warehouse club thinking it would be a good choice (based on the ingredients) for my three boys ages 1, 3 and 5.  </li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE FAIR SKIN REAPPLY EVERY HOUR.</li>
            <li> But no amount of sunscreen is going to save a fair person from burning, this isn&#x27;t a miracle lotion.</li>
            <li> The bottle says you have to reapply every x hours, how can you expect a good result if you never reapply?</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t put it on before you leave, drive to the pool and then think your good all day.</li>
            <li> I loved this.</li>
            <li> I thought the sunscreen went on well and felt good on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Our children are 7 and 11 and fair skinned</li>
            <li> Works good for us.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely fair skin</li>
            <li> I bought this at a warehouse in a two pack because it seemed like a good buy.  </li>
            <li> If you want a good organic sun screen try the Coola brand.  </li>
            <li> It did a good job of protecting me.</li>
            <li> Do you wish you could attain the gorgeous, lustrous skin tone of a lobster?</li>
            <li> I see that people have written the company and haven&#x27;t received good responses.  </li>
            <li> It felt good going on, moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I got a good batch???</li>
            <li> The Honest Company is being very honest about this product...</li>
            <li> I wish I would have paid more attention to the reviews, but I got distracted by the good reviews it had after the article broke that this was a great product.</li>
            <li> Easiest to apply and works great on the grand daughters, and me as well.</li>
            <li> Check the very reputable EWG site for their top-rating for this product:  http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/about-the-sunscreens/617105/The_Honest_Company_Honest_Sunscreen_Lotion%2C_SPF_30/</li>
            <li> Like real easily.</li>
            <li> I thought I liked this product, and felt good knowing</li>
            <li> Thought I was doing good by buying a mineral based sunscreen by &amp;#34;The Honest Company&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an honest customer for years and have loved the products.  </li>
            <li> We would have been better off wearing nothing as the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; just attracted the sun!</li>
            <li> I love knowing I&#x27;m not slathering a bunch of chemicals on my children or myself!</li>
            <li> I love the sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s 100% safe!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Shea butter is amazing for your skin, I have no breakouts.</li>
            <li> I bought a 2 pack of honest sunscreen at Costco.  </li>
            <li> This is as effective as olive oil.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s  website and the Honest Company</li>
            <li> HONEST COMPANY SPF 30 SUNSCREEN...</li>
            <li> Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was as effective as rubbing olive oil on the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since using Honest, I have not had any sunburns nor has my son.  </li>
            <li> He has olive skin and tans nicely, but his cheeks got burnt the day he wore the Honest sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Honest company should be ashamed of itself for even putting this on the market.</li>
            <li> My husband is more fair and it also protects him.</li>
            <li> As I said, I&#x27;ve bought Honest products before and liked them.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used The Honest Company&#x27;s sunscreen since my oldest daughter was born, and she is almost three.</li>
            <li> I informed Honest Company of what happened</li>
            <li> Shame on you Honest Company.</li>
            <li> Do a Goggle Search of the Honest Company Sunscreen and read the news articles about the product problems.</li>
            <li> Thankfully I put Badger on my kids, but my husband used Honest because it runs in so well.</li>
            <li> year, we used the the Honest Company sunscreen for a trip to Hawaii and came home without any burns.</li>
            <li> I feel like filing a lawsuit against Honest.</li>
            <li> He never had a problem with CA baby sunblock but after using honest brand he comes home sunburned.</li>
            <li> but I will definitely do more research before buying just anything, even if it&#x27;s a great deal at Costco and from what I thought was a reputable company.</li>
            <li> Told the wife to never bring another Honest Company product into our house</li>
            <li> I honestly believe this sunscreen accelerated my sunburn instead of prohibiting it.  </li>
            <li> They are a great company, and I really do love most of their products.</li>
            <li> I have always used ThinkBaby, but decided to give Honest a try.</li>
            <li> A one star rating is too kind in my book, but zero isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li> Though would would have thought that a company that names itself &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; might not be that honest after all?  </li>
            <li> Save your money - honestly.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice to have received notice that the zinc was being reduced so drastically.  </li>
            <li> Be HONEST, your sunscreen has issues.</li>
            <li> This is what the honest writes on their website about the ingredients in the product.    </li>
            <li> Like others, we experienced significant sunburns after using it.</li>
            <li> I have bought many Honest products and always have been very pleased.</li>
            <li> perfect ingredient list, decent results,</li>
            <li> its very important to also be safe about sun exposure!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not on my top 10 list for sure!</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and always very cautious in the sun.</li>
            <li> Mineral sunscreens are always the best and any product with the high of a quality is a better bet.  </li>
            <li> We use the honest company&#x27;s body wash and love that.</li>
            <li> If you use a lot of sunscreen, then you may consider mixing your own since you can get protection by adding  more zinc with fewer ingredients.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love all of Honest products except for this one.</li>
            <li> The Honest sunscreen seemed to make my daughter burn even more than if she had no sunscreen at all.</li>
            <li> I liked that it does not contain the toxic chemicals that so many sunscreens do.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Honest Co suncare products.</li>
            <li> Enjoy family togetherness as your loved ones gather around and gleefully tug at your decaying skin as you molt like a majestic, ruby-colored Python.</li>
            <li> I love this brand but they need to own up to their sunscreen being ineffective.</li>
            <li> SPF mineral sunscreen - everything you need, nothing you don&#x27;t   Easy to apply, non-greasy, non-whitening (non-nano!)</li>
            <li> is very important.</li>
            <li> I quickly ordered the Honest stick and the Honest spray.  </li>
            <li> HUGE MISTAKE!</li>
            <li> so I figured it would be a safe buy.</li>
            <li> so many others have had burns with this product.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this lotion.</li>
            <li> It is an alternative to more mainstream</li>
            <li> top priority may be non greasy lotion.</li>
            <li> and I love everything they make</li>
            <li> Bought at Costco because I am allergic to most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m FURIOUS that I jeopardized my health and my skin, when I was trying to stay safe and protect myself from the sun.</li>
            <li> I used this on my kids faces thinking it would be better then the spray I used on the rest of their bodies.</li>
            <li> Each morning I&#x27;d think the burn was getting better</li>
            <li> My daughter is in the sun most of the day at camp this summer and with application in the morning before camp and with repeated applications by her counselors she has not gotten a sunburn.</li>
            <li> I hope they fix this and make it better.</li>
            <li> Got sunburn even though I made sure to lather up with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this at Costco thinking that it was the best buy ever...</li>
            <li> and I slathered this all over my body, feeling very proud of myself for actually using sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I have to agree with most of these reviews.</li>
            <li> I was covered heat to toe with probably protected me more than this sunscreen did.</li>
            <li> Consider using something safer, and be ok with maybe having to reapply a couple times vs.</li>
            <li> Thinkbaby sunscreen is way better imo.</li>
            <li> My husband, toddler, and I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> but I can go longer in the sun than most people.</li>
            <li> I also used this to do some yard work, but I was mostly covered up doing so</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for myself and my kiddos and wont use anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad I used it on myself before putting it on my children.</li>
            <li> and I like them a lot better.</li>
            <li> I would have been better off without putting on this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Hmmmm, interesting.</li>
            <li> My daughter is allergic to he chemicals used in most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> She breaks out in blistering rashes from most sunscreens and others</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen for my family.  </li>
            <li> They are a billion dollar company and had better start doing damage control unless they want a class-action lawsuit brought against them.</li>
            <li> I wear sunblock on my face every day and thought something organic would be better.</li>
            <li> Was previously a huge Honest Company fan but now I&#x27;m having my doubts.</li>
            <li> We used as directed &amp; made sure to reapply... and still burned.</li>
            <li> We subscribe to Honest Co&#x27;s bundles and we&#x27;ve had a great experience with nearly every product we&#x27;ve tried and have been able to return a couple of products that didn&#x27;t work for us with no problem.</li>
            <li> I am redheaded and fair skinned, my wife is blond and fair skinned, and obviously are children are light haired and fair skinned.  </li>
            <li> Put a damper on our vacation for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this sunblock.</li>
            <li> Yes, a bit greasy, yes, apply a bit more often.</li>
            <li> Found like many others that this seemed to increase burn rate.  </li>
            <li> I so wanted to love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> The best bet is having the kids wear swim shirts and using regular sunscreen for arms, faces, and necks.</li>
            <li> Ok-</li>
            <li> My husband is Irish and fair skinned!!</li>
            <li> I thinks it&#x27;s one of the more affordable products on the market .</li>
            <li> most of us grew up with.</li>
            <li> The sunblock sits on top of your skin and does not absorb into your bloodstream the way sunscreen does.</li>
            <li> of it like this, this product is the Carrot Top of sunscreen</li>
            <li> All sunscreens have to be applied more often if your&#x27;re in the sun.  </li>
            <li> Instead of considering that maybe something compromised the effectiveness of their product, they spit out some nonsense about how it&#x27;s safe according to tests.</li>
            <li> We love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I applied sunscreen before leaving the house and two more times over a 6-hour period.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth with NO residue!</li>
            <li> the uvb light is whats giving you the burn!  </li>
            <li> If we hadn&#x27;t, I dread to think what she would have looked like after 30 minutes or more.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine wearing it for more than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I will be returning it and make sure never to leave home without my trusty brand.</li>
            <li> We are both super fair skinned and urn easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would have to say that I was excited to use it because it&#x27;s from The Honest Company</li>
            <li> make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not, I need as close as formula to clean ingredients in the mix as my organic sunscreen formula mix.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and this product is great!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Honest brand sunscreen for almost two years and it has worked excellent &amp; when I say that, I mean excellent for any sunscreen not just natural sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Honest Co!</li>
            <li> I have been using this consistently, and always had good results.</li>
            <li> but I thought I would try Honest as the two pack was such a great deal.  </li>
            <li> Tried the product on three separate occasions not thinking that the product could be the issue, but each time experienced far more sun damage than should have occurred considering the time of exposure.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen works great from me and my 10 month old!</li>
            <li> I thought it applied nicely and almost seemed to warm to body temperature very quickly, which the kids appreciated since it wasn&#x27;t  &amp;#34;cold.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I have very fair skin (over 50% Irish) and</li>
            <li> It is best to stay out of direct sunlight as much as possible and use a good sunblock on all exposed skin.</li>
            <li> Simply covering my daughters neck, forehead and ears with the sunscreen resulted in incredibly greasy hair.  </li>
            <li> It is the best closest all natural sunscreen I&#x27;ve found that works really well for all day play and water time!</li>
            <li> I bought this from a local warehouse club because it was a good price and people seem to love the Honest Company products.</li>
            <li> Listen to the reviews on here because they are true!</li>
            <li> Because it definitely does not work--my very fair family all got lightly burned within 1 hour using this sunscreen at a non-water non-sweaty activity.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty oily so washes off easily and needs to be reapplied often but it worked great on all my fair skinned kids and hubby and didn&#x27;t cause any rashes on my two with super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t burn easy.  </li>
            <li> so maybe I&#x27;m biased because I don&#x27;t burn easily</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that we are all olive skinned and don&#x27;t burn easy.</li>
            <li> the one week I tried using this product, I did not get burned, but I&#x27;ve never burned easily in my life.</li>
            <li> Liked it so much I bought two more tubes.</li>
            <li> My sister is severely allergic to most every kind of sunscreen- all mainstream and even most all natural and organic and baby formulations can close up her airways so she can&#x27;t breathe and swell up her face</li>
            <li> I am a avid user of all Honest Products since having my son 9 months ago.  </li>
            <li> The sunscreen goes on easily and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> And we were fine.</li>
            <li> It did not seem to come off in the water, and my skin was fine after.</li>
            <li> I will need a lot for a 7 day trip, but it works just fine for our all day beach trips in CT.</li>
            <li> but he said it&#x27;s fine for the pool.</li>
            <li> it goes on smooth and easy.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, I love that it is super moist on her skin as I feel like it gives her a bit of a protective layer from the effects of the pool chemicals on her skin.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff and was super bummed when I couldn&#x27;t find it at costco today.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best natural sunscreen I have found!</li>
            <li> my whole family is burnt to a crisp after using this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I can pay twenty bucks for a huge 8 ounce bottle that lasts all summer if I know it will protect my family.</li>
            <li> Huge mistake.</li>
            <li> What a HUGE mistake.  </li>
            <li> so I use a light coating with ZERO sunburns.  </li>
            <li> PABA free; It must spell out on the face of the container.&lt;br</li>
            <li> PABA free; It must spell out on the face of the container.</li>
            <li> Virtually scent free.  </li>
            <li> , so I was stoked to find this available at a bargain price.</li>
            <li> Well, the rumors were confirmed.</li>
            <li> Last, and most importantly, the sun protection from this product is about as good as no sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It went on smooth</li>
            <li> I got the two pack cheap at costco, but if I hadn&#x27;t sent one bottle to daycare and still had both I&#x27;d return it.</li>
            <li> this important.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d rather get some chemicals in my systems by applying a cheap sunscreen, than dying of skin cancer.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen has been a great solution for us (especially for the kids) because it works well and lets us avoid worrisome chemicals.</li>
            <li> Using sunscreen that works is important.</li>
            <li> Do not use Honest really needs to take it off the market.</li>
            <li> As with any sunscreen, whether it says water resistant or not, it is important to apply before you get in the water and after.</li>
            <li> UVA is the longer wave light (ultraviolet light) that penetrates deeper into the skin.</li>
            <li> What about the UVB light?  </li>
            <li> I wanted something free of harmful chemicals, but if I have to greece myself up like a pig</li>
            <li> But it seemed to keep my fair skinned 3 year old from getting burned.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, I would not recommend this product, there are far superior ones on the market.</li>
            <li> I have used natural sunscreens with great success</li>
            <li> Honestly, I would have been far better off using nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> I had also heard good things about the company and had enjoyed a different product they manufactured.  </li>
            <li> I feel that the thickness is actually a good thing as far as water and sweat proofing goes.</li>
            <li> I thought I was being good by using a natural lotion</li>
            <li> I bought this in a two pack thinking it was good for my sensitive skinned face.</li>
            <li> We use the spray and stick frequently and have never had any burning, and we are all extremely fair skinned.</li>
            <li> Well now you can pay considerably more for comparable sun &#x27;protection,&#x27; and walk away from every beach outing with the gratification that you have inflicted upon yourself and your loved ones the pain that only seered skin can provide.</li>
            <li> I have used many other Honest products and have liked them all, but this was a bust.</li>
            <li> I do make sure to kneed the tube before we use it, especially if it&#x27;s new otherwise</li>
            <li> and that feels really clammy and gross when the air is already syrup, but it works perfectly as a sunscreen and is super moisturizing to the skin</li>
            <li> We have always used natural sunscreen with great results, but my kids and I are all burned to a crisp after applying and reapplying this product.</li>
            <li> Back to the drawing board, Honest!</li>
            <li> can have significant impact on lung health.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> At first glance this seemed like a better deal, but both bottles are going in the trash.  </li>
            <li> Pretty sure that in every case of using this sunscreen you will burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad it was me who used it first and not my kids.</li>
            <li> And once this stage passes, you&#x27;ll delight in the shedding of layers of damaged skin in sheets of crusty fun!</li>
            <li> and I love so many of The Honest Company&#x27;s other products</li>
            <li> I try to use as many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products as possibly, so I was thrilled when I saw this at Costco.</li>
            <li> , even though it is zinc based, it doesn&#x27;t leave the white trail that so many sunscreen use, and it soaks in quite nicely, so I can use it on my bike commute to work, and not arrive looking like a ghost.</li>
            <li> zinc oxide sunscreen provides safe, effective sun protection for the entire family   Zinc oxide</li>
            <li> Makes me wonder about other honest products, and the lowering of effective ingredients in those products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zero</li>
            <li> Large companies have specially formulated lotions with many ingredients that are non-greasy.</li>
            <li> This honest sunscreen is very greasy at first, but feels like it absorbs well.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good mineral-based sunscreen, try ThinkBaby or Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li> I have used this product on my kids (both 4 year old) ever since Honest Company started making it.  </li>
            <li> I have always ordered it direct from The Honest Company</li>
            <li> The product is so greasy that what one reviewer said about it being a sunburn accelerant is true.</li>
            <li> Today I liberally applied it a good 15 to 20 min before going outside.</li>
            <li> I use honest sunblock for my 7 month old.</li>
            <li> and I think people forget it&#x27;s so low when putting it on fair skinned children.</li>
            <li> I purchased this two pack of sunscreen from a local warehouse because I thought it was a good deal</li>
            <li> Returning it for a full refund.</li>
            <li> What a full blown scam.</li>
            <li> so I made sure to pay attention to how it worked, how much we applied etc.</li>
            <li> I Bought honest sunscreen at Costco for my 9 month old baby.</li>
            <li> My fair skinned 2 and 4 year old are sunburned for the first time in their lives.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is super greasy and does not protect you from the sun at all.</li>
            <li> Not happy what so ever with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most HONEST products we have bought have been great, hence us buying this.</li>
            <li> Also, it is SUPER greasy/oily;</li>
            <li> I am super diligent about applying sunscreen every 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I am super ticked that this lotion can be sold as a sunblock or sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It does offer a mild degree of sun protection.</li>
            <li> It is super greasy and everything stuck to the kids.  </li>
            <li> I expected way better from the Honest Company.</li>
            <li> super greasy.</li>
            <li> Luckily we found this out in Iowa and before we took our Florida Vacation.  </li>
            <li> so this might not be the most appealing but it works and unless your setting a timer on your watch and am having someone put it on your shoulders and back every 80min</li>
            <li> Super greasy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as I like many other Honest Company products.  </li>
            <li> As with any other sun protection product, it works best combined with UV protective swimwear/hats, and sunglasses, as well as avoiding being directly in the sun during the strongest times of the day.</li>
            <li> It has a great consistency and goes on smooth and rubs in easily unlike a lot of the other natural sunscreens we have tried.</li>
            <li> I bought this in Costco for half the price and it has worked great.  </li>
            <li> At first I loved this sunscreen, I used it on my face and arms and was outside a couple hours.</li>
            <li> It is very oily, but that did make it easy to spread.  </li>
            <li> I am super white and have a - can&#x27;t tan to save my life - kind of complexion.</li>
            <li> We find that it works best if you pat dry, sit in the shade for snack time after reapplying, and then go back in the water.</li>
            <li> I put so much of this on my pregnant body before going out to the beach today and got severely burned!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll experience the scorching fun of skin tender and hot to the touch!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find a good, safe sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cost a zillion dollars.</li>
            <li> His generic store brand sunscreen worked amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> My shoulders burned lightly, and the rest of my body tanned as if I was wearing no sunscreen at all.&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen is VERY GREASY, and it DOESN&amp;#34;T WORK</li>
            <li> If you have had a similar experience, share it with The Honest Company.  </li>
            <li> Instead of protection we were essentially basting ourselves with oil for a nice, crispy finish.  </li>
            <li> EWG rates this on their top 1-7 rating, an excellent score especially when only 20 made the list from over 1,000 different sunscreen mix.</li>
            <li> I keep it refrigerated till I use and always go for a fresh sunscreen all the time</li>
            <li> I keep it refrigerated till I use and always go for a fresh sunscreen all the time</li>
            <li> Give me traditional sunscreens any day over The Honest Company &amp;#34;Sunscreen&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and most sunscreens make me break out in a rash, so I thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> and I rarely ever burn.</li>
            <li> Being health conscious, I purchased this sunscreen from Costco because it boasts that it is healthy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;My wife has been purchasing Honest Co diapers, wipes, hand sanitizer, and body wash/shampoo for the last couple years.</li>
            <li> We have been nothing but pleased with those products and stopped buying competing natural products because of our satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but so worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thankful that we did a trial run at a short activity, because a day at the beach could have ended us up at the doctor if Honest Company was all we had to rely</li>
            <li> Just use a mixture of Crisco and duck fat it will provide far better protection.</li>
            <li> Claiming to operate a safe natural company and poisoning oneself with tobacco is a joke.</li>
            <li> Yes, it no longer turns your skin white when you put it on, but the product is no longer effective.</li>
            <li> On a side note, I just checked the Honest website and the sunscreen is currently listed as &amp;#34;Out of Stock&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have an olive complexion and thus, have rarely ever burned.  </li>
            <li> This is not the Honest Sunscreen from years prior.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Honest Company products, but this sunscreen just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Upon further research, honest reduced the amount of zinc from 20% to 9% which appears to explain why it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> My husband purchased this in a 2 tube pack from Costco because he knows I prefer to use products with more natural ingredients</li>
            <li> You are better off going old school and slathering yourself with baby oil.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re are essentially applying an assortment of oils to you skin with the Honest product</li>
            <li> just reading the Ingredients on the Honest product raises red flags period!</li>
            <li> Like so many other reviewers, I purchased this from Costco, pleased to be purchasing a safer more natural product.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to see this product in a two pack for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The Honest Company apparently changed their formula so that it only contains 9% zinc oxide while most sunscreens contain 18-25%.</li>
            <li> , I see that I was right.  </li>
            <li> It smelled so badly right after I opened it.</li>
            <li> I did everything right, and this did not work at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly greasy and leaves skin feeling really gross for a long time.</li>
            <li> I usually buy California baby products but wanted to try honest company sunblocks as it came in a two pack for a better price.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s super pale, so we have tried and vetted out 100&#x27;s of different sunscreens over the years to try to find the perfect brand.</li>
            <li> This is the second product of theirs that I have been less than impressed with.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because it is free of the harmful cancer causing chemicals that normal name brand sunscreens use</li>
            <li> My entire family who does not burn easily all burned after a day in the sun even after applying this sunscreen three times!</li>
            <li> They cover better and are a little more fool-proof.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this sunscreen, as it was more affordable than some of the other non-nano zinc sunscreens I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Be sun smart people!</li>
            <li> I used it as directed and applied it liberally, because I&#x27;m a little on the fair side.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try the new formula sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Or are there some kind of hard feelings toward the Honest company that I&#x27;m completely oblivious to?</li>
            <li> Recently she&#x27;s been spending a lot more time on the sun at school</li>
            <li> I always use chemical free natural sunscreen for my two kids (age 2 &amp; 5) and myself</li>
            <li> I really, really hope my skin recovers from this assault!</li>
            <li> Still not my favorite zinc based product, but it makes a big difference if you follow the directions!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen, my entire family uses it and have never been burned.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen because it&#x27;s the only mineral-based sunscreen that is easier to put on.</li>
            <li> Later I looked more closely at the ingredients</li>
            <li> First, the product applies like a layer of grease -- imagine putting melted butter on your skin.</li>
            <li> (it wasn&#x27;t even that hot</li>
            <li> but my daughter and I  got burned after using this sunscreen for the first time and I will not be using it again.</li>
            <li> First off, its like rubbing oil on your skin.</li>
            <li> We used exactly as directed and they weren&#x27;t in the water at any point.</li>
            <li> Just like so many others...got this at the local store at the begining of summer.</li>
            <li> I am not even sure how its possible for sunscreen not to work AT ALL....</li>
            <li> GREASE literally comes out first when you squeeze this.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re prone to burning than I suggest a product with a higher SPF.</li>
            <li> and I got really sunburnt!</li>
            <li> Firstly, I did not buy this product from Amazon; I bought it from Costco.  </li>
            <li> It also has no questionable or problem ingredients.</li>
            <li> I applied it liberally and exactly according to the directions to myself and my three children, and we all ended up burned.  </li>
            <li> It lasts really well after a liberal application!</li>
            <li> I try to be aware of and avoid &amp;</li>
            <li> This is the first review I have ever written</li>
            <li> Most importantly, not effective at preventing sunburn, which both my daughter and I experienced after just a short time in the sun.  </li>
            <li> I will stick to CA baby sunblock even with the higher cost.</li>
            <li> We applied sunscreen before we left the house, and then TWO more times.</li>
            <li> Sure there are time&#x27;s people get sunburns because they don&#x27;t apply enough, or don&#x27;t reapply, but if this many people are saying that it&#x27;s not working with proper use, maybe there&#x27;s something to it?</li>
            <li> Same as many, bought this at Costco, to my regret.</li>
            <li> Shame on The &amp;#34;Honest&amp;#34; Company for not doing better research on their products, especially those designed for children!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what these people are doing wrong, but this is some of the BEST sunscreen I have EVER used.  </li>
            <li> I have used many different brands and types of sunscreen over the years and not gotten burned (so this is not user error).  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it on my kids, both were burned.</li>
            <li> Both of our backs were burnt to a crisp.</li>
            <li> I know this brand is generally pretty reputable, but this product does more bad then good.  </li>
            <li> The rash did go away for the most part the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We we at a water park for 4 hours in the Midwest when it was 97 degrees and the water even felt like a hot tub.</li>
            <li> The directions say to SHAKE the bottle first.</li>
            <li> You are typically more likely to get cancer from products with toxic chemicals rather than the sun itself.  </li>
            <li> Wish I had read reviews first.</li>
            <li> The EWG ratings were stellar.  </li>
            <li> It feels so hot and sticky and gets all over everything.</li>
            <li> I have used both the old formula &amp; recently have been using the new formula purchased at Costco with the same excellent results.  </li>
            <li> Will never buy this product again, and this experience will make me think twice about buying any other products from Honest as well.</li>
            <li> Natural sunscreens are all kind of gross.</li>
            <li> Back to Babyganics, it may not have the best chemicals but at least we won&#x27;t get sunburned.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe they call themselves the Honest Company and sell a sunblock that so clearly does the opposite of what they say.  </li>
            <li> Dear Honest, please bring back your old formula.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this product a fair trial, so I really layered it on super thick.</li>
            <li> First off it feels like pure grease,  </li>
            <li> mineral sunscreens have downsides, the most effective ones being very thick and leaving your whole skin with a whitish cast.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m almost positive all the oils probably are causing the accelerated burning.</li>
            <li> It went straight into the trash after the first use.</li>
            <li> BE RESPONSIBLE NOT CARELESS IN THE SUN.</li>
            <li> There are other sun products we&#x27;ve used that have never allowed us to burn, with even longer exposure (i.e. Blue Lizard, Happy Baby.)  </li>
            <li> I skin was unbearably itchy for 2 straight days, could not sleep the first night even after taking a Benadryl.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s true of all natural sunscreen brands, as a matter of fact.</li>
            <li> I follow EWG&#x27;s guidelines for application (a shot glass full to cover an adult&#x27;s arms, chest and face), and I reapply every 2 hours and reapply after water play.  </li>
            <li> We made the mistake of using this on our daughter and luckily noticed her burning within 15 minutes of being outside so managed to get her out of the sun quickly.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t look stark white once we rubbed it in, and it left my arms so incredibly and wonderfully smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I checked out EWG skin deep website on sunscreen and SOOO many have high risk chemicals in them-</li>
            <li> I will say I am very very particular with my sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read that &amp;#34;Honest CO&amp;#34; is pretty much passing the buck on this, and it really pisses me off.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer the texture since its easy to spread on a not so cooperative baby who&#x27;s always on the move.  </li>
            <li> I even like the previously formulation of the honest sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> The new sunscreen this year is a little more oily than previous years but still gave our family great protection.</li>
            <li> It feels like I&#x27;ve put pure grease/oil on my face.</li>
            <li> It almost seems like pure oil.  </li>
            <li> and it still came out as pure grease.</li>
            <li> We wore it for almost an hour on a very hot day, direct sunlight at noon time, at the pool.</li>
            <li> After the first application, I reapplied with spray of a different brand on his back and used the honest on neck, face, and ears.  </li>
            <li> I bought a two-pack at Costco (before reading reviews) and was excited to be able to use this in the pool due to its non-toxic, all natural formulation.</li>
            <li> I have applied this to myself and my kids on several sunny days and have come to the conclusion that I actually get more burned wearing this than when wearing nothing!  </li>
            <li> We are so careful to keep our kids protected from the sun, now they&#x27;ve experienced their first burns due to this product.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it would be nice if it had a little bit of a scent.</li>
            <li> now compare the product to the others with the chemicals in it that protect you from all and are a true broad spectrum sunscreen protecting you from UVB and UVA.</li>
            <li> My favorite part and why I bought is that I like that it is more natural and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, like putting a nice lotion on.</li>
            <li> and I all turned bright pink after only 1 hour</li>
            <li> before spending 1.5 hours outdoors and am very burnt today.</li>
            <li> This is seriously very concerning and a health hazard.</li>
            <li> It is very greasy to apply and DOES NOT provide sun protection.  </li>
            <li> IT STRAIGHT FROM</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sunscreen needs to protect and needs to protect for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My family of 5 used this sunscreen yesterday and all 5 of us are very burnt.</li>
            <li> It is very greasy</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My whole family used it and we were all severely burnt.</li>
            <li> I grabbed this whole at Costco as I thought it would be &amp;#34;organic&amp; safe&amp;#34; against cancer causing chemicals</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning &amp; very upset.</li>
            <li> Jessica Alba, would you really put this junk on you or your kids?</li>
            <li> and I reapplied so much in that one day that I went through a whole bottle.</li>
            <li> It does not rub into the skin very well and is not at all moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> It really has to be coated on and it takes some effort to rub into your skin.</li>
            <li> On another note, the product is indeed very greasy.  </li>
            <li> We re-apply after every 60-90 mins depending on how much she is in and out of the water.</li>
            <li> Neither of us has ever had a sunburn like this after using as much sunscreen as we did.</li>
            <li> I much rather use this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen works very well for us.</li>
            <li> she ended up burning very bad.---I  </li>
            <li> I really wish I had read the reviews before buying this at Costco.</li>
            <li> We used almost a whole tube of this just the 3 of us when we went and we are all slim people.</li>
            <li> It also felt really greasy going on and since we were on a beach it practically attracted sand.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The sunscreen came off fast once we sweated.</li>
            <li> I was ready to purchase some for myself until we noticed that my niece&#x27;s arms were getting darker and darker.  </li>
            <li> All my kids still got very burned.  </li>
            <li> You have to be ok with looking white at the beginning because it is a NATURAL sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I used this all summer for the first time and for the first time I never had to worry about my boys (10 ad 13 yrs old) getting burned.</li>
            <li> and he said works good just greasy which sucks when you looked like you oiled up before</li>
            <li> If your idea of a good time is wearing a thick, greasy coat of Vaseline all over your body, you&#x27;ll like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I was willing to overlook the greasiness for a good quality, natural product but not if it just plain doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> I live in hot and humid Florida, I am 39 and have a combination skin.</li>
            <li> I used the new formula this week and for the first time ever my son got a sunburn.  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida and go to water aerobics three times a week in the hot sun.</li>
            <li> On the other hand Honest Sunscreen leaves no whiteness and is perfectly clear.  </li>
            <li> In other good news, we left a bottle in the car on a day when the asphalt was melting while we went to the amusement park (another was in the pack</li>
            <li> So these extreme sunburns have plenty of variables like how many times did you get in and out of the water  , or did you really if you did get in and out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only part of my leg that isn&#x27;t bright red, which is the exact opposite of what should happen when you miss a spot applying sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I wonder if the people who are rating it poorly due to sunburns are using it more sparingly to counter-act the greasy feeling?</li>
            <li> I wanted to chime in on these reviews due to the latest headlines regarding this product.  </li>
            <li> As other reviews are stating, this &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; seems to act more like a tanning oil and accelerate the burn.</li>
            <li> Believe me, this sunscreen protected my skin better than any other I have used.</li>
            <li> Having watched parents not properly apply sunscreen over &amp; over again, it is my guess that that there is a very good chance that it was “user error” , not applying enough or not applying it soon enough (30 min before sun exposure) are the two most common errors I have witnessed.  </li>
            <li> look for clean formulas all the time with following pointers;&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> I look for clean formulas all the time with following pointers;</li>
            <li> in the end, if you want a natural alternative without oxybenzones and other potentially harmful chemicals, look for other varieties of Zinc Oxide sunblocks--the best zinc oxide sunblocks come in 20% or higher concentrations.</li>
            <li> Works great (little goes a long way); highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I usually like the Honest Co.</li>
            <li> Ironically just today I was going to apply this sunscreen lotion  on my my 5 yr old son and the first thing he told me was &amp;#34; mom I don&#x27;t like that one it feels like my skin gets hotter with this one &amp;#34; and I was thrown off</li>
            <li> Not sure why Honest would change the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I brought Honest Company Sunscreen for myself while he stuck to his usual store brand.  </li>
            <li> I use it, my husband uses it, and we use it on our 1.5 year old ;)</li>
            <li> Just want to ditto what most reviews have already said, and give this product a thumbs down, will no buy again.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> This is very greasy, but I could live with that.</li>
            <li> Zinc is the solution, more zinc for less money with organic ingredients that are not carcinogen or harmful to my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> More ZO cost more, less ZO cost less</li>
            <li> I wanted a sunscreen that was better for the environment and had less chemicals</li>
            <li> I along with many bough this at Costco at half the price on amazon.</li>
            <li> just wasn&#x27;t put on think enough and tried it again the next day and her skin got burnt even more.  </li>
            <li> she luckily had a rash guard on and only had the sun screen on her face and legs.</li>
            <li> but it is good to know that when I choose one, it offers the least amount of chemicals in the mix.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d started to hear horror stories about the sunscreen not working, so I made sure to only use it on myself at our next beach outing.</li>
            <li> I suppose that&#x27;s because the main ingredient (after zinc oxide) is beeswax.</li>
            <li> I bought a two pack of this sunscreen from a warehouse store based on the one main ingredient, Zinc Oxide.</li>
            <li> The scent is decent.</li>
            <li> We have tried all of the main stream sunscreens and nothing has worked.</li>
            <li> Several more outings at home in Denver and the same results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there is something to do with personal &#x27;chemistry&#x27; pH or similar things that can have an effect on how well sunscreens can work.</li>
            <li> So, yes, it&#x27;s greasy, but to me that&#x27;s a positive because it makes it a lot easier to spread over the skin of my 6 year old twins.</li>
            <li> This mix has 9.3% ZO, it is not as high as 18% ZO</li>
            <li> Texture, smell, and effectiveness of the product are all highly graded in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I thought I was splurging on a high quality, safer sunscreen, and it ended up ruining the rest of our vacation.</li>
            <li> From now on I am using Coppertone Waterbabies, highly recommended by Consumer Reports and affordable.</li>
            <li> I bought a 2-pack from a local warehouse store and was excited to have found a natural solution.</li>
            <li> So I will still use what&#x27;s left in an - I can&#x27;t find any other sunscreen - kind of emergency.</li>
            <li> only plus side is that it doesn&#x27;t create the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; effect other mineral based sunscreens do; although, I think that shows it isn&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li> The product kept my family from burns unlike many of these other reviewers, but we had to apply frequently.</li>
            <li> The lessons I&#x27;ve learned from these reviews are don&#x27;t try out a new sunscreen on a beach day and even if EWG gave it amazing reviews, cross check it with the general public reviews.</li>
            <li> Our favorite sunscreen to date is little twigs.</li>
            <li> I would rather pay a little more and have a product that works for my family.</li>
            <li> Since you can&#x27;t spray the kids in the face, or shouldn&#x27;t anyway, the stick works a little better than trying to spray your hands and rub their faces.</li>
            <li> This product does not appear to have enough active ingredient to be effective,</li>
            <li> is the ONLY active sunscreen ingredient - NO synthetic chemical sunscreens   Water resistant - tested effective for up to 80 minutes   </li>
            <li> so probably better to apply outdoor (not right before getting in vehicles or near furniture)</li>
            <li> Instead of storming to the Internet to bring bad press to an otherwise great company that literally functions to make safe and affordable products for people, maybe some of you should simply take your business elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I really feel like doing a class action lawsuit.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would work because it contains all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Love the idea of the Honest Company, and bought the product based on name brand alone, but product really failed to meet my basic expectations of what a sunscreen should do.</li>
            <li> but more importantly, it is NO NANO</li>
            <li> What I put on my skin is the same as consuming it through my skin since it is absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li> I insure to check the expiration date and purchase anything that I consume especially anything that it goes on my skin which is absorbed by the skin and processed by the liver.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li> I insure to check the expiration date and purchase anything that I consume especially anything that it goes on my skin which is absorbed by the skin and processed by the liver.</li>
            <li> We would have been better off going with no sunscreen than this garbage - at least we would not have had the false sense of being safe from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays, and would have worn protective clothing and found more frequent shade.  </li>
            <li> I do shake and squeeze the bottle a few times to make sure that the zinc oxide is dispersed before using.  </li>
            <li> Why no negative star options?</li>
            <li> First, this product goes on very heavy--consistency and smell is similar to melted wax.  </li>
            <li> We were outside in the mid day sun for about 4 hours with0ut any kind of color at all definitely no burns</li>
            <li> This product does not use harsh chemicals and will be more beneficial.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t find the sunscreen I normally use.</li>
            <li> I applied a good amount before leaving the house and then sat and watched my son&#x27;s baseball game for 3 hours while reapplying this sunscreen every 45 min&#x27;s to an hour</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t that, because we live in a humid area and it sometimes makes sweat form little droplets on top of my skin instead of letting it evaporate well</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite sunscreen for both my 21 month old daughter and myself.  </li>
            <li> My review below is the letter I sent directly to Honest Co regarding the failure of this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Second, and most important for my pale family, you have to actually follow directions.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking that it would be a great alternative to the more expensive brand I usually purchase.</li>
            <li> I just want people to know that they are buying and would live to see this sunscreen off the market.</li>
            <li> I use the lotion and face stick, live in Florida and have never burnt while wearing it.</li>
            <li> We live in a seaside town in New England and spend loads of time outdoors and at the beach.</li>
            <li> We live in FL and have used it for months out at the pool and at the beach.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is very oily, the oil and white substance is separated no matter how much you try to shake it.</li>
            <li> Trust me, I&#x27;m not someone who is looking to place blame unnecessarily, I gave this product a fair chance, used it as direct and suffered for it.</li>
            <li> By that evening it was very clear that your sunscreen did virtually nothing to protect me and my family from the sun, and each one of us has varying degrees of severe sunburns.</li>
            <li> We usually only think of shaking the spray cans of sunscreen, but if you read the instructions on this product, it very clearly states to shake to tube first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many many mineral-based sunscreens and I think this is the worst.</li>
            <li> Absolutely offers no protection yet costs a fortune!</li>
            <li> got so sunburned except for my mother in law and 2 yr old which were the ones that didn&#x27;t use this  product !</li>
            <li> The ingredients are all natural and the zinc is non-nano!</li>
            <li> Put this on my 9 year old son and he BURNED!  </li>
            <li> Then I came here and discovered that everybody else had the exact same experience.  </li>
            <li> I applied it once before going outside for the first time</li>
            <li> Use as directed and reapply, and always, no matter what sun protection you use, limit time in direct sun!</li>
            <li> We usually reapply before the listed time just to be safe</li>
            <li> The ONLY sunscreen that protected me from photosensitivity reaction after trying MANY others, much more expensive.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it on my daughter, we went for a short walk before her doctor&#x27;s appointment.  </li>
            <li> My mom bought this at Costco for my 1 year old niece because you couldn&#x27;t beat the price!  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this junk!</li>
            <li> Now having to lather up in aloe &amp; wet clothes to keep cool.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;ve never even been pink after a full day in the sun.</li>
            <li> Majority have many different ingredients than zinc and titanium as ACTIVE INGREDIENTS.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Majority have many different ingredients than zinc and titanium as ACTIVE INGREDIENTS.</li>
            <li> We live near the beach</li>
            <li> It has now been a month and my skin is still not back to normal!!</li>
            <li> Now when I open the tube I get this clear greasy liquid that comes out first before the lotion.</li>
            <li> As far as wear throughout the day, this product seemed to cause me to sweat a lot more than usual.  </li>
            <li> and he spent the first week of our much anticipated summer vacation with it</li>
            <li> My 6-year old daughter has very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Why do I need fragrance on my skin which is alcohol regardless, and this is from an athlete where I consume fresh garlic napping in vinegar every single day.</li>
            <li> Why do I need fragrance on my skin which is alcohol regardless, and this is from an athlete where I consume fresh garlic napping in vinegar every single day.</li>
            <li> Use some common sense and test it before you trust your whole family with it during a full day in the sun!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be going back to our tried and true Banana Boat Natural Reflect.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this sunscreen sucks!</li>
            <li> My first comment is that it is very oily in comparison to other sunscreen on the market.</li>
            <li> This natural ingredient sunscreen allowed the natural sun to naturally burn our skin - so natural!  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that this has a little extra oil in it to make it easier to spread.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little greasy, but in my opinion better than chemical laden products or aerosol sunscreen sprays which studies are starting to show</li>
            <li> If this product can protect a 45 year old bald surfer with pale skin, then it should be fine for everyone, just remember to read the directions when applying.</li>
            <li> I will try to return it to the whole sale store where I purchased it, and a huge complaint will go with it.</li>
            <li> My least favorite natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I used it under direct sun for only 30 minutes and my skin got very itchy.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I see the signs for a &amp;#34;going out of business sale&amp;#34; and all the hype that goes with it, I also steer clear.  </li>
            <li> One of my kids has excema and nearly every sunscreen caused her to cry out this</li>
            <li> I was putting something natural on my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old is so burnt</li>
            <li> I wrote to the company in the feedback section of their website out of genuine concern a few weeks ago &amp; heard nothing in response.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old granddaughter was at the water park today for about 3 hours with her mother</li>
            <li> yes the zinc offers sun protection, but the oil does not.  </li>
            <li> In addition, the oil will cause breakouts on sensitive skin (this is what happened to me).  </li>
            <li> so if you are purchasing this, you are getting an old mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACTIVE INGREDIENT:</li>
            <li> Producers like to spin the facts and challenge our knowledge and intelligence by claiming it as WITHOUT any harsh chemical or chemical FREE or without chemical ABSORBERS.</li>
            <li> Producers like to spin the facts and challenge our knowledge and intelligence by claiming it as WITHOUT any harsh chemical or chemical FREE or without chemical ABSORBERS.</li>
            <li> I feel like I was completely duped with this product.</li>
            <li> Took my family to the waterpark for the day and applied this non-harmful, non-chemical, completely non-functional paste pretending to be sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> The whole family was burned after only 2 hours at the pool.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Thankfully my daughter only really tans in the sun</li>
            <li> My kids got burned despite frequent application, but I told myself that it must be my fault b/c</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t reapplying enough or they were in the water too much, etc.  </li>
            <li> My husband, 2 year old daughter</li>
            <li> We used this on our 18 month old baby</li>
            <li> I will be surprised if there isn&#x27;t a class action lawsuit.</li>
            <li> so I am definitely keeping it for trips to drier climates, like when I visit Colorado or California or really anywhere besides the South.</li>
            <li> My 1 year old was SEVERLY burned using this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s complete garbage.</li>
            <li> Interesting to read all the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> If you are an attorney, file a class action lawsuit and we will all sign up.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my kiddos with sensitive skin but never again.</li>
            <li> For all of these young moms out there, I would be upset as well.  </li>
            <li> It offers zero protection against the sun</li>
            <li> I used Water Babies on my 20 month old son before leaving the house.</li>
            <li> I bought this two pack at Costco before heading to an all day event in nearly 100 degree weather.</li>
            <li> It is completely ineffective as a sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really that simple</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Have tried the product on myself and my three year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this on my 2 year old all summer.</li>
            <li> Really greasy and gross feeling</li>
            <li> This product does not work at all, it offers no protection.  </li>
            <li> I applied this well and reapplied to my three young children</li>
            <li> which was unexpected by me</li>
            <li> I use it on myself and my daughter who is 10 months old.</li>
            <li> I am near tears...</li>
            <li> Used on 8, 10, and 42 year old.  </li>
            <li> My son is 14 months old</li>
            <li> Who cares if it is all natural if it doesn&#x27;t work?  </li>
            <li> I took my boys (3 years old and 18 months old) to the beach today and used this sunscreen on them as well as myself.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old didn&#x27;t even go in the water</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s an all natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using these products since my now 2.5yr old was born.</li>
            <li> I know that the majority of people don&#x27;t use enough sunscreen to begin with or reapply within appropriate time frames, but even if you take a lack of common sense into account, these reviews are still very telling.  </li>
            <li> We also frequent the pool and again we&#x27;ve never had any problems.</li>
            <li> This product is completely ineffective.</li>
            <li> Naturally derived, unscented, broad-spectrum (UVA and UVB)</li>
            <li> It took a long time to wash off with soap, hot water, a wash cloth, and a lot of scrubbing.</li>
            <li> I too am surprised by so many negative reviews.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen protected my pale family (so pale my sister mixes the lightest color of foundations with a good amount of goth targeted pure white costume foundation to make it actually match her real skin color) at the beach, the pool, and the amusement park.</li>
            <li> Unlike other mineral-based sunscreens, this one applies smoothly and without a white residue.</li>
            <li> Not only did we have to cut a special outing with old friends short, but my son&#x27;s face looked like he had 3rd degree burns</li>
            <li> First of all, this is a physical sunscreen, not the scary chemical kind.</li>
            <li> Sat at the beach for 2 hours, applied it twice and got what I&#x27;m pretty sure is a second degree, maybe worse, sunburn on my chest and the sides of my breasts.</li>
            <li> The honest company should do some major work on their brand before putting a name like &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; behind a sunscreen that promotes skin cancer.</li>
            <li> I usually wear a 15 and am fine for 4 hours.  </li>
            <li> but anyways Honest sunscreen doesn&#x27;t get gross in the bottle, it also doesn&#x27;t feel super cold when you put it on like</li>
            <li> I may have left it outside and it was hot out, but helllloooo people -</li>
            <li> Not sure why it hasn&#x27;t worked for others, but it most definitely works for us!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t complain at all with other brands, but I thought if it worked well, they could deal with it, since it&#x27;s better for them than other brands.</li>
            <li> my husband and I ever used, so we only applied it once - the first and only time.  </li>
            <li> We have tried very hard to protect our children outdoors as we are aware of scientific research indicating the significant increase in cancer risk for each severe sunburn received as a child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> I saw this at Costco the other and grabbed it the price was right so why not try I.</li>
            <li> However, I highly suggest to purchase a different brand unless you want a sunburn.  </li>
            <li> I rarely leave a review but being a very fair skinned person who got a terrible burn on vacation from this</li>
            <li> We bought ours from Costco, like many other reviewers (the two pack was less than $15 there,) and fully plan to return this product.  </li>
            <li> They have never had a sunburn and we live in Southern Arizona with a pool.  </li>
            <li> She has NEVER had a sunburn, and we live in Southern California where temps reach 100</li>
            <li> ACTIVE INGREDIENTS of more zinc less titanium, the best-rated mineral sun blocks.</li>
            <li> ACTIVE INGREDIENTS of more zinc less titanium, the best-rated mineral sun blocks.</li>
            <li> My husband and daughter used this product (I stuck to the old faithful Banana Boat Natural and was unburned the entire time)</li>
            <li> /&gt;7. BROAD SPECTRUM</li>
            <li> BROAD SPECTRUM</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m furious that, like the other reviewers, we were basically basting ourselves to be burned to a crisp.</li>
            <li> First, the product is extremely greasy and oily coming out of the package.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this product ruined the first part of our vacation due to his pain and having to find places in Colorado to stay inside to avoid the sun to let him heal.  </li>
            <li> applied on her first then applied Neutrogena beach defense on my other kids ( who did not burn at all).</li>
            <li> Producers of sunscreens sells their products for what they think they can get for each ounce of sunscreen based on their formula and ingredients that they put in that particular sunscreen, especially the percentage of the ZO varies by different production.</li>
            <li> In reviewing your company values, itis clear to me that you are not acting on your principles regarding honesty, service, outperform, and sustaining (not harming) life.</li>
            <li> If  you want a natural sunscreen check out think baby, that stuff actually works.</li>
            <li> The 2 year old had it applied to her face only</li>
            <li> I stopped for some aloe with lidocaine and even after applying that I could barely move without pain.  </li>
            <li> This was a sunburn SO dark it was almost purple with blisters everywhere, my skin was swollen and hot to the touch for days.  </li>
            <li> I can buy Alba or Kiss My Face for a similar price and natural quality</li>
            <li> I used this last week on my 6 month old.</li>
            <li> She was completely burn (very red) and broke out in a rash.</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t get burned from using it, but my family is pretty dark skinned.</li>
            <li> normally stay out twice as long with Paula&#x27;s Choice spf 50 with no problem.</li>
            <li> I am so angry with the Honest Company because of this product.  </li>
            <li> The more you apply, the worse the burn.</li>
            <li> There are some five star reviews defending the Honest Company, saying that all of us who got burned must have been doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Sun reflective chemicals such as AVOBENZONE that may be absorbed or broken down into more harmful substances</li>
            <li> So I am super surprised to see the amount of negative reviews-</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t have to reapply multiple times as some reviewers said they have to, but we&#x27;ve learned long ago how not to get fried in the sun, and that includes not relying on any brand of sunscreen to provide full protection after one application if you&#x27;re swimming, sweating or active outdoors.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even have to reapply much even when they spent hours in the sun!</li>
            <li> &amp; so I need a product that works &amp; has much safer ingredients than then other chemical based sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> Six June days in Florida at the theme parks including 3 days on the beach and not a single burn on the 4 of us.</li>
            <li> I love Honest products, but this one is terrible.</li>
            <li> We used a different brand natural product on our faces with the same application frequency.</li>
            <li> As a 21-year old, I used to slather on baby oil (prior to being diagnosed with melanoma at 23) to get as tan as possible.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like the lotion because it is difficult to rub in, especially on squirmy kids, and you can&#x27;t be sure that you&#x27;ve shaken it up well enough, but I&#x27;ve heard that they&#x27;ve improved that product.</li>
            <li> Then after reading reviews on Amazon about this exact product, I got a little frightened to use it, thinking that it might not work.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a more natural product for my little one&#x27;s delicate skin</li>
            <li> Just wanted to chime in that I also purchased this two-pack from Costco, and my two children who have never had a sunburn before were pretty red after less than one hour in the sun.</li>
            <li> which hardly any other sunscreen producer uses, it is the better ZO</li>
            <li> I avoid OXYBENZONE which apparently disrupts human hormonal</li>
            <li> I avoid OXYBENZONE which apparently disrupts human hormonal system.</li>
            <li> I rarely burn and when I do, it&#x27;s just in a small spot I missed while applying sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I wish I could post pictures of my poor 6-year-old who fell asleep crying tonight from the hideous sunburn she acquired after 90 minutes in the sun today, completely slathered in Honest Company Sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Banana Boat, Coppertone, and the like get gross and melty in the sun, which is ridiculous considering it is made to be used in the Summer when it gets hot, and also because it&#x27;s chemically so the whole world of nonmelting ingredients is open to them-</li>
            <li> I am generally not a noticeable sweater, but this product brought forth the sweat beads like no other.</li>
            <li> I was in the sun for less than an hour and my whole family was burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used this liberally instead of my normal spray on protection and spent the same time in the sun and got burned when I never had before.  </li>
            <li> and my skin would get red when I put this sunscreen on in the hotel room before heading down to the water (where we sat in the shade the whole time).</li>
            <li> I was so excited to buy this product, and having a big star (i.e. Jessica Alba) helps promote this company, but the product is not good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really upset as I feel this company is outright misleading the public and putting helpless little ones at risk.</li>
            <li> other brands do, it works for super pale people with infrequent reapplication (</li>
            <li> This past weekend I applied the new formula to my 3yr old son &amp; he was in &amp; out of the water for 2-3 hours without any redness.  </li>
            <li> After only about 1 1/2 hours on the beach (way less than normal)</li>
            <li> I shared it with friends and praised the absence of the white glow often left by other natural sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> Maybe this is due to the all natural ingredients - do they just not store well?</li>
            <li> Zinc oxide is quite affective, but in the end I think what made this product &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; is its lower concentration of about 9% Z.O. versus 20% of other &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; products out there like Tom&#x27;s of Maine natural baby</li>
            <li> With this brand, not only can I work outside for hours without burning, the coconut oil makes my skin feel so soft - not greasy like other suncreens!  </li>
            <li> As a 41-year old who still requires bi-annual visits to the dermatologist for skin checks, I am VERY CAREFUL about sun protection.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why there are so many negative reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> I really hate to give such a poor review, because I love the Honest Company and use a ton of their products.</li>
            <li> It is mineral oil-based so it does have a slightly greasy feel on your skin, but it&#x27;s not that bad, and it works great for sun protection.</li>
            <li> Have used the past two summers on the whole family and no burns.</li>
            <li> We have very tan skin so usually just brown in the sun...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s back to long sleeves for me and I will repurpose this as a diaper rash ointment (yes, it&#x27;s that greasy)&lt;br /&gt;Maybe after I try to get a refund...</li>
            <li> Despite my long held belief in using organic products and following the EWG recommendations I will never use this product again and would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Long story short</li>
            <li> Then spent about an hour and half at the pool when  we noticed that the baby&#x27;s skin was feeling very hot and had a few red bumps.</li>
            <li> It does rub off a little bit once it&#x27;s first applied though so a little bit got on the back of the leather car seats from my shoulder, so put a towel there or something if it bothers you.</li>
            <li> After an hour and a half I was completely burnt so I went inside.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this works on a people with less sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I purchased this 2-pack from Costco in May and put it on my 2 1/2 year old daughter to protect her sensitive skin from the late May sun.</li>
            <li> Seems to work as well as the Blue Lizard we have used in the past, but no nearly as thick and easier to rub in.</li>
            <li> We were only on a lakeside beach in early May for a few hours.</li>
            <li> several other reviewers, I bought it at Costco, - and I&#x27;ll be taking it back tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I returned the product and today there have been numerous news articles regarding other consumers who have had the same issue with this product.</li>
            <li> I am pale but don&#x27;t usually burn that quickly or to that degree, even without sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This stuff will leave you burned and offers little to no protection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really upset because I have been trying so hard to take care of my skin, and</li>
            <li> I can not believe this many people are unhappy.</li>
            <li> We weren&#x27;t in the sun for long and she was under a blanket most of the time because it was a chilly afternoon at the beach.</li>
            <li> so I never worry about few months old mix.</li>
            <li> so I never worry about few months old mix.</li>
            <li> So far this summer, she is a few shades tanner but no sign of burns.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully the kids had long sleeve swim shirts and long board shorts</li>
            <li> I am from a family with a long history of melanoma.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t exspect for a sunscreen to work all day long?</li>
            <li> You have to reapply and get the kids out of the sun for a sec , I&#x27;m mixed</li>
            <li> My 4 year old is crying in pain because his shoulders are so burned.</li>
            <li> (hat, long sleeves,</li>
            <li> Mineral blocks must be reapplied often, especially when you get wet and towel off.</li>
            <li> and even I had my share of red shoulders and pink nose, but</li>
            <li> My toddler and I spent the afternoon outside.</li>
            <li> My kids are still getting pink after several applications.</li>
            <li> Never have issues as long as we reapply often.</li>
            <li> The burn keeps getting worse and of course it&#x27;s only the first day of our vacation.</li>
            <li> The consistency is thick, so you can&#x27;t really rub it on like lotion.</li>
            <li> Burned my skull (young woman with long hair), in less than an hour!</li>
            <li> They are thick, white, and typically not at all like commercial sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I have a 3 and 5 year old (the oldest with pale skin) and have yet to find a sunscreen that worked so well.</li>
            <li> It is very greasy and sticky and less than an hour in the sun and not only did I have a sunburn but have broken out in a red, bumpy, and itchy rash where sunscreen was applied and still have the rash two days later.  </li>
            <li> My other child doesn&#x27;t have the same skin sensitivities.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, like the other reviews, it does not work to protect you from the sun</li>
            <li> Our entire family has worn this sunscreen at various times and we have each burned with exposure as little as 30minutes.</li>
            <li> The next time, I shook the tube, kneaded it, everything I could to mix those ingredients -- still extremely greasy.</li>
            <li> I am actually so relieved to see the other reviews here because I, like another reviewer, thought it was my fault that the sunscreen wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers - this simply doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> One tube was all liquid while other was in solid form.</li>
            <li> Does it leave you white: yes, and so are all the other sunblocks I have used.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed whether or not my kids were protected, as they weren&#x27;t out in the sun for very long both times I applied it.</li>
            <li> We were not out in the sun for very long (maybe an hour or 2) and it was during the morning hours, but my toddler still got burned using this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry.  </li>
            <li> Applied liberally, let it dry, reapplied often, still burned badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried babyganics and green screen, and both worked well but left our skin very white.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the latter is true, but the former is not, since it was absolutely not effective in any way and was just a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Now did you see that the only Active ingredient is Zinc Oxide?  </li>
            <li> but I think that&#x27;s a small price to pay for having a natural product.  </li>
            <li> but then again, less ZO offers less protection.</li>
            <li> and I feel it comes down to lack of reapplication and not putting enough on.</li>
            <li> My husband, 3 year old, and I lathered it on and never reapplied because we were too lazy and all that my husband got was a slight burn on the back of his shoulders.</li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviewers, I bought this at one of the warehouse stores, and suffered a bad sunburn despite several applications to my face and shoulders.</li>
            <li> In stark contrast, the other brand product used on our faces protected us completely leaving no evidence that we had spent the day in the sun.</li>
            <li> After less than 2 hours in the later afternoon sun (went out at 2:30)</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Costco and had a similar experience to the many disappointed parents who have reviewed here.  </li>
            <li> and she was only out in the sun for less than an hour (it was applied twice within the hour) and</li>
            <li> and I was the one with a slight sun burn because I didn&#x27;t use any sunblock and he was white as the day he was born!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As the other reviews state, it is also extremely greasy and leaves a white residue on the skin.</li>
            <li> It is the only sunscreen that works for us and is not full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Not only that, it was was hard to miss the fact that I was sweating because the sweat condensed on the skin in the form of white ooze, so i looked like a melting wax sculpture.  </li>
            <li> What a huge disappointment in my search for a sunscreen with fewer chemicals.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised to read all the negative reviews of this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I am surprised by all of the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> I chose this product because it is natural and at least 30spf.</li>
            <li> Have used a wide variety of sunscreens and my children have never burnt.  </li>
            <li> My mom used it minimally and sat out in the sun for hours and didn&#x27;t get burned.</li>
            <li> After only a few hours in the sun we were fried.</li>
            <li> They say they re made the recipe for it, but it&#x27;s still not very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry.</li>
            <li> It is a bit greasy but it does soak in enough after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I am careful about  </li>
            <li> I have olive toned skin and tan without any effort and have maybe had pink cheeks and shoulders a couple of times in my life.  </li>
            <li> Last year however, my grandmother had a few skin cancers removed and I decided to grow up and use some sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I used this product on my face for only a few weeks in the spring.  </li>
            <li> I used this on the last day of vacation after I had heard that it has caused sunburn in a few cases.</li>
            <li> I had a pretty dark base tan and had been using tanning oil for the whole week leading up to the last day with no sunburn.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at Costco and it was a big waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely not SPF 30.</li>
            <li> Applied this generously, and twice, each of the 2 days we spent at the beach.</li>
            <li> id rather have the proper stuff on for a few hours than burn my skin.</li>
            <li> So we tried the other tube of sunscreen a few weeks later at the pool and shook vigorously.  </li>
            <li> Another failure could be product separation which can be fixed by kneading the tube to mix it.  </li>
            <li> Super super greasy, shaking does not help, felt awful on my skin and didn&#x27;t rub in.</li>
            <li> and she mentioned that any products containing essential citrus oils (lemon, orange, etc.) could be the cause, so I switched face lotion and deodorant, but continued to burn, even small amounts of sun exposure (i.e. getting my kids into the car and fastening seatbelts at a few different stores).  </li>
            <li> First off, it goes on really, really greasy, and my kids hate when I put it on them.</li>
            <li> product failed, and after experiencing severe sunburns while using your product, our online research makes it very clear that countless others have been harmed due to your negligence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would echo what other reviewers are saying...</li>
            <li> I noticed from the beginning that it&#x27;s extremely oily</li>
            <li> I agree with a lot of the other moms and there post.  </li>
            <li> The other person I gave this to also got fried.  </li>
            <li> I have never had any rashes or allergic reactions to this sunscreen unlike all other sunscreens except Vanicream.  </li>
            <li> It does not come close to other brand of 80% organic but</li>
            <li> For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc.</li>
            <li> the other reviews said.</li>
            <li> If anything, I feel that other mainstream types of sunscreens are too greasy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I looked at the other reviews and it make sense.  </li>
            <li> I have used the other products and they worked well.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviews said, it felt like I lathered with baby oil.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> We have used her other products in the bath and will continue to do so but will not buy the sunscreen again.  </li>
            <li> It was EXTREMELY greasy, and if you&#x27;re sweating it comes off with in minutes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review but after using this I feel an obligation to let other mothers know...</li>
            <li> Other than that, we haven&#x27;t noticed sunburn after using it.</li>
            <li> I like their other products</li>
            <li> I was even under a sun umbrella almost the entire few hours!</li>
            <li> It is also extremely greasy.  </li>
            <li> But if you have sun and other skin allergy issues, give it a try.</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t break out from this one, but it gave him absolutely NO sun protection!  </li>
            <li> I applied 3 times in 4 hours, and he (as well as 2 of my other kids) ended the day slathered in aloe because of their burns.  </li>
            <li> Their company does not care and say&#x27;s it&#x27;s such a small percentage who it does not work for that</li>
            <li> All other sunscreens not rated well on the EWG will cause you cancer, not the sun.  </li>
            <li> Like any other sunscreen, it must be reapplied every 80 minutes or sooner.</li>
            <li> Is it greasy: yes, and so are all other zinc sunblock I have used.</li>
            <li> does not have any of the harmful chemicals that other brands have.</li>
            <li> What a total waste of money, but worse still, a complete health hazard.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen was very greasy, uncomfortable, hot, and left a white film on my skin to wear, and then I got very badly burned, so, all that discomfort not only wasn&#x27;t worth it, but resulted in an itchy, hot, red, painful sunburn that may lead to premature aging, or worse. . . .</li>
            <li> I ruined a black bathing suit with permanent white stains that wouldn&#x27;t hand wash out of my expensive new Land&#x27;s End bathing suit.  </li>
            <li> My poor fair skinned daughter got an extremely bad sunburn after using this product even with two application.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize the active ingredient was Sunburn...</li>
            <li> and I had an extra red-face from the embarrassment of providing such a poor sunscreen to my friends.</li>
            <li> I can only conclude that those who are rating this product poorly are not applying properly.  </li>
            <li> Always read the ingredients (active and inactive).</li>
            <li> My sunburn was horrible and I reapplied frequently and more often than my husband did.  </li>
            <li> thanks to this crap product, it burned much faster than it would have with no sunscreen at all.</li>
            <li> No sunscreen is going to protect you from any sunburn if you fail to look at the temperatures, heat and how much you get to rinse due to being in water.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get it wet and reapplied after 3 hours as I felt that I was getting a little burned.</li>
            <li> So upset that I didn&#x27;t use my typical other coopertone sport babies stuff.</li>
            <li> I felt even MORE stupid, because I had tried it again.  </li>
            <li> I really wish I had read these reviews before I took this sunscreen on my vacation and kept reapplying it, thinking I was doing something wrong when I got burned.</li>
            <li> The one negative I have is that it will not come off of clothing or things such as strollers (I have a ghost in the stroller now from applying it on him while sitting in it).  </li>
            <li> And the same could be said for all negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> And it kept us from getting too dark or burned.</li>
            <li> We left the water park where we were early over 10 days ago because we could see our children were getting pink, and by the time we got home they had the worst sunburn (and first) sunburn of their lives.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure who tested this product or if the test batches were rigged, but as a long time user and a person who is dependent on sunscreen, I can tell you this doesn&#x27;t screen you from anything.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I see a sign for a &amp;#34;huge garage sale&amp;#34;, I know that it is probably not worth visitng.  </li>
            <li> Physical sunscreens require that you put a thick layer</li>
            <li> mind you that zinc oxide based sunscreens should be thick and white,.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, greasy and takes a lot of rubbing effort to not remain white once applied.</li>
            <li> Yes, it was white and thick but it worked.  </li>
            <li> Costco is very picky about the products they sell and if enough people bring it back, they&#x27;ll stop selling that crap.  </li>
            <li> We had four bottles with us for the trip and used a bottle and a half before throwing them all away and getting a conventional brand at the hotel.</li>
            <li> keep cost down??</li>
            <li> Your product was applied on my wife, four children (7 down to 5 months), and myself.</li>
            <li> I applied this product 30 minutes before heading down to the beach.  </li>
            <li> Hands down, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> Not just a little pink, fried!</li>
            <li> I applied it to my children and after minimal sun-exposure, they are both sun-burned!!</li>
            <li> They owe everyone an apology and a gift certificate towards other products if they hope to redeem themselves!  </li>
            <li> Mean time my skin is starting to peel from the burn.</li>
            <li> You have be liberal about applying I mean a big glob just for your arm.</li>
            <li> I used this on my 4 year old and reapplied, my poor little guy got fried.</li>
            <li> They need to reformulate product to contain less oil, which also goes rancid in heat.  </li>
            <li> If you want to go by what Consumer Report recommends which rates protection without any consideration for ingredients in the sunscreen then in that case, I can get you roofing tar for less money, so we might as well consider that...</li>
            <li> I reapplied even after an hour and a half was burnt like I had worn no sunscreen at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had less severe sunburns when I didn&#x27;t wear anything.</li>
            <li> We were in the sun for an hour and a half</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE on less</li>
            <li> This is not like the chemical sunblocks that you apply and forget for half the day.</li>
            <li> We have dealt with sunscreen for years since we can literally get a sunburn in less than 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> My kids had never been burned until this happened, much less blistered until we used this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is made with non-nano zinc as the only active ingredient and  uses natural inactive ingredients such as beeswax as the lotion base.</li>
            <li> Too thick, leaves white residue, just not easy to apply to squirmy toddlers.</li>
            <li> We have a fair-skinned family, but after less than two hours in the sun; we all had at least minor sunburns.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy into the hype, but it&#x27;s true: this product is truly, truly bad.</li>
            <li> This was the first sunburn for my children which is so disappointing.  </li>
            <li> What a mess.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t mess around with something</li>
            <li> /&gt;Purchased at Costco as well, very rarely have I been disappointed by a product from Costco.</li>
            <li> I think people who hate it aren&#x27;t properly reapplying on dry skin as often as needed and are probably used to spraying on chemicals that last for a long time.</li>
            <li> but I definitely thought the sun protection was a little weak.  </li>
            <li> It reminded me of using those little pods of beeswax to waterproof my ski gloves years ago.  </li>
            <li> In so much pain and very angry that everyone else used other brands and were not sunburne.</li>
            <li> I applied as directed and burned so badly I peeled, and I rarely ever get sunburned.  </li>
            <li> On the same day, I applied to my 9 year old son for day camp, and he got badly sunburned on his neck and face.  </li>
            <li> We spent two hours in the late afternoon sun and each of them burned on areas where I thoroughly applied the sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It is like it made it worse as I didn&#x27;t apply it on her legs and those are not red at all, but everywhere I applied it</li>
            <li> There is a trade off for natural unfortunately in this case.  </li>
            <li> The Honest Company has lost all of my confidence after selling this awful product.  </li>
            <li> Tried this product because it is one of the few I have found that I can use</li>
            <li> I purchased a 2-pack at Costco a few months ago and have been waiting to go to the beach to try it out...</li>
            <li> used it a few times now</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and risk your health with this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now for midday bike rides in 85+</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any trouble with sunburn</li>
            <li> We have used this product a few times this summer and have reapplied throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Honestly this is the worst product I have ever come across.</li>
            <li> for your mediocrity&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I just used this sunscreen yesterday while paddle boarding for 2.5 hours in the harsh Denver sun from 11:30 to 2:00.</li>
            <li> I sold sunscreen at a surf shop for a few years</li>
            <li> product is Jar Jar Binks&#x27; semen after masturbating to an ICP album while watching House of the Dead by Uwe Boll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish I had read all these comments on this page before purchase our 2 tubes from costco a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> We were there less than 2 hours!</li>
            <li> As someone with EXTREMELY pale skin, I reapply every hour, or whenever I feel like My skin is burning (usually less than an hour!)</li>
            <li> He has never gotten a burn while using this and is pale.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m putting this out on the curb for some other sucker to have.</li>
            <li> it was as if I had applied plain baby oil to all 3 of us.</li>
            <li> Previously, the only one I would use was Supergoop which was expensive.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to write this review due to my sever sunburn!</li>
            <li> I was so greasy that I could not put on the thin long sleeve shirt that I had brought along to stay covered so</li>
            <li> I would much rather have a sun burn from the sun rather than cancer from the other harsh products out there, especially the spray suncscreens that are rated the worst.</li>
            <li> Today early on in the day I noticed how red I was getting and kept slathering on this stupid sunscreen.</li>
            <li> truly shocked at some of the reviews here because my personal experience was so completely different.</li>
            <li> I was out in the sun for less than 4 hours and reapplied this at least 5 times.</li>
            <li> Besides the smell being a little off putting and the consistency being greasy, it didn&#x27;t work!  </li>
            <li> All of the other mineral sunscreens are thick pastes that are hard to spread over skin in an even layer.</li>
            <li> As for it intensifying the sun, how about a little common sense?</li>
            <li> Very little to no protection.</li>
            <li> you really shouldnt diss this so bad.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand all the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Not sure the inconsistency.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Trans oil used is questionable ingredient especially when I have no idea of what percent of the mix is each ingredient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> I will definitely think twice before blindly trusting this company.</li>
            <li> It usually takes hours for a burn to develop.</li>
            <li> and after the first day of using this product and following manufacturers instructions, were horribly burned.  </li>
            <li> Everything sticks to me (dirt, grass, sand, small insects).  </li>
            <li> I did reapply a couple more times throughout the day and was disgusted by the heaviness and greasiness of this product.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how this product is even on the market since it does not do what it is meant for - protecting your skin from burning.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> Definitely something seriously wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> and my mom can vouch for the fact that in the past, no matter which sunscreen I have used, I burn within 15 minutes of being in the sun.  </li>
            <li> I love this company but this is the worst sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mineral based sunscreen for my small kids.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what formulation changes they made, but they need to fix it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really sad that you put your trust in an &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; company but the expensive product you buy because you want safer and better products for you and your family actually do the opposite and give you and your family the worst sunburn of your life!!</li>
            <li> It does not have that awful smell that most have.</li>
            <li> Fiance brought this &amp;#34;sun protection&amp;#34; on our hike this past weekend.  </li>
            <li> Will be returning this and have already ordered a tube of the MyChelle brand which has worked well in the past.</li>
            <li> sits on top of the skin, and worst of all, does NOTHING to protect you from the sun.</li>
            <li> I am very afraid of the sun, so I am not shy when slathering on sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Quality sunscreens are not over 30 SPF and if any above 30 SPF, it is a simple marketing, meaning positively worthless.</li>
            <li> Major disappointment.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I used this sunscreen and both were terribly burned, usually neither of us easily burn.</li>
            <li> A friend told me you have to SHAKE the sunscreen, so I felt stupid and thought that maybe it was because I hadn&#x27;t shaken it first.  </li>
            <li> No more, &amp;#34;we use it on our children&amp;#34; garbage that you believe may protect you from litigation as you avoid taking responsibility for this failure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say the protection it gives is approximately like a typical spf 5 &amp;#34;suntan lotion&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very surprised about the bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> I live in the tropics, but I applied it when we were out in the late afternoon, when the sun wouldn&#x27;t be too bad.</li>
            <li> Also, it was too greasy and way hard to put on.</li>
            <li> I have a really hard time rubbing this in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also hard to apply on kids skin.</li>
            <li> Save yourself or your little ones a sunburn and pass on this one!!  </li>
            <li> We applied this sunblock 3 times (almost once an hour), but still got as bad of a burn as if we&#x27;d completely forgotten sunblock.</li>
            <li> I bought because the Environmental Working Group recommended and said my old brand Neutrogena contained v. bad ingredients.</li>
            <li> I REAPPLY AT LEAST EVERY 2 HOURS SOMETIMES EVERY HOUR, IT DEPENDS ON THE DAY.</li>
            <li> I read all these negative reviews mentioning how greasy this sunscreen is.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t got burned so hope that means that it at least protected our skin.&lt;br /&gt;Bought</li>
            <li> Not effective as sunscreen at all.</li>
            <li> and I did not experience anything negative about this product.</li>
            <li> If I could give this negative stars I would.</li>
            <li> Read the directions or use common sense.</li>
            <li> I wanted to write this review after reading all of the negative comments about this product.</li>
            <li> Are the negative reviews coming from people used to Nuetrogena sprays and Waterbabies SPF 100 with a 10 rating on the EWG scale?</li>
            <li> This product sucks.</li>
            <li> I never leave negative reviews, but I can&#x27;t help myself with this one.  </li>
            <li> If I could give this product negative stars I would.</li>
            <li> I see all the negative comments and wonder what these people are doing to cause the burns.</li>
            <li> I literally had at least 50 blisters with my sunburn after using this product.</li>
            <li> stuff sucks.</li>
            <li> product is dishonest about its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I was in Mexico where I applied a thick layer quite frequently...and still got scorched and peeled.</li>
            <li> It feels thick and greasy and sticky.</li>
            <li> Thick.</li>
            <li> 5-8 hours though that&#x27;s beyond bottle recommended time) in thick layers</li>
            <li> Goes on thick like Vaseline and does not absorb.</li>
            <li> I was burned even after I slathered a thick layer on.</li>
            <li> satisfaction came to an abrupt and very dangerous halt this last weekend when we tried your SPF 30 sunscreen at a Texas Gulf beach.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the other reviews are spot-on...</li>
            <li> I mean, this stuff is greasy like petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> Burnt real badly, and only spent less than an hour is the sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s worse, the &amp;#34;toxic&amp;#34; old-school sunscreens or a severe sunburn.</li>
            <li> I feel like I don&#x27;t eve need to bother writing this after so many other bad reviews, but just want to reiterate how terrible this stuff is.</li>
            <li> Just because you were burnt, doesn&#x27;t mean that it is not a good sunscreen for someone else.</li>
            <li> and I got serious color bordering on a burn.  </li>
            <li> After applying numerous times throughout 3 hours on the beach....I was left with one of the worst sunburns of my life....</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t seem to take our experience seriously.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous how it is still on shelves.</li>
            <li> Absolutely ridiculous to be selling this as sunblock.</li>
            <li> We have used other competitors and never had a problem with using a natural sunscreen, but after using this product our child broke out into a horrible rash.</li>
            <li> I find it hard to believe all the poor reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li> The problem with Vanicream is that it leaves the skin looking white which makes you look bad in pictures.  </li>
            <li> so people will not be scared away from using this product by recent bad reviews on the Today Show.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this sunscreen is getting such a bad rap.</li>
            <li> there is no good smell to combat the oil smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now completely red and the burns are SO painful.</li>
            <li> This product is no good.</li>
            <li> This is three days later and is extremely painful.  </li>
            <li> I felt so guilty for letting my kids get burnt &amp; thankfully theirs weren&#x27;t as bad as mine which took 3 days to even start to calm down &amp; not be painful.</li>
            <li> My son received the worst sunburn of his young little life.  </li>
            <li> Bought this at Costco for my two granddaughters to use this summer, we used it for the first time today and both were terribly burned.</li>
            <li> Her face is quite burned,  her mother reapplied it at least every 40 minutes!  </li>
            <li> First of all the texture and consistency is disgusting.</li>
            <li> At the least, stay away from this product!</li>
            <li> This lotion really sucks!</li>
            <li> but I guess you need some dishonest chemicals in sunscreen!</li>
            <li> And yes, I too ended up with a pretty nasty burn after a couple hours in the sun.</li>
            <li> I felt compelled to write a less than scathing review based on their commitment to customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> However, after shaking, applying liberally, and reapplying an hour and a half later, I was horribly burned.</li>
            <li> it is very thick.</li>
            <li> As a parent, you feel horrible and responsible when these things happen.  </li>
            <li> The absolute  worst product I have ever seen.  </li>
            <li> Really grease and feels horrible.</li>
            <li> Greasy and thin.</li>
            <li> My burns continued to get worse throughout the day.</li>
            <li> this &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; was worse than using none.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute worst sunscreen I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I was really sad to see the negative reviews for this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> the poor thing got burnt!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s 12 and had never experienced a sunburn before using this product.  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t use a thin veil and think it will do anything.</li>
            <li> I stand behind it 100% and will continue to use this on both of my kids.</li>
            <li> My whole family is burned after using this horrible sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t much longer before I realized my legs, face, and shoulders hurt horribly.  </li>
            <li> workably thin consistency</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s had way worse and we never reapplied.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t use it on your children, I&#x27;d hate to see the pain they would be in from such a severe burn.</li>
            <li> This product should be pulled from the shelves - it gives parents a false sense of security.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is hard to express the anger, frustration and disappointment we have been feeling due to your product&#x27;s failure.</li>
            <li> The new formula is awful!</li>
            <li> maui vacation we used this and got really bad sun burns after less than 1.5 hours.</li>
            <li> I have read the negative reviews and don&#x27;t understand why people are so unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> I also feel terribly for Jessica Alba and her company because I applaud what she is trying to do bringing natural products to market.</li>
            <li> The worst sunblock I have ever bought , its a greasily  oily product that offers no protection.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it provides NO protection.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> Not happy!</li>
            <li> and unfortunately it stained her clothing.</li>
            <li> but what is disturbing is the consistency of the mix as well as the smell of the mix since the five star ones use VCO not these type of</li>
            <li> Greasy, gross sunscreen that feels terrible going on.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately now we are stuck with another tube that we won&#x27;t be using.  </li>
            <li> This is beyond irresponsible, it is reckless that it has not been recalled and that a big retailer would still carry this terrible product.</li>
            <li> Plus I didn&#x27;t find the greasy factor that uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of different sunscreens and words can&#x27;t come close to describing how terrible this product compares even to the cheapest stuff you find at discount stores.</li>
            <li> I used this sunscreen for only 4-5 hours (wasn&#x27;t in water or anything) and I was horribly burned.</li>
            <li> We played outside for around an hour and all had horrible sunburns.  </li>
            <li> They should be taken off shelves and should be illegal selling it.</li>
            <li> For them to advertise this as a 30 SPF is CRIMINAL!  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not get a tan, but I also did not get sunburned.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> but I feel like I have to because this stuff is scary.</li>
            <li> The lousy reviews for this product do not surprise me at all.</li>
            <li> If this is a blatant hypocrisy then I don&#x27;t know what is.</li>
            <li> I am incredibly angry.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is quite possibly the worst stuff I ever used.  </li>
            <li> NOT IMPRESSED!!!!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews unfortunately after experience.  </li>
            <li> My legs on a bike ride looked worse than not putting on sunscreen!  </li>
            <li> I was shocked to see all the negative reviews on here.  </li>
            <li> I hate to waste anything</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Very poor protection.</li>
            <li> We aren&#x27;t idiots and know to apply sunscreen every 60-85 minutes and to apply it thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just terrible and not worth even using the remaining stuff I have.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the worst sunscreen ever.</li>
            <li> Two charred thumbs down for this awful product.</li>
            <li> My husband and I took her for a walk and again, she looked as if she got a terrible sunburn from the little time we were out.  </li>
            <li> All the bad reviews had me skeptical</li>
            <li> and we were crazy.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll waste money and feel horrible when your kid gets burned.</li>
            <li> Even after liberally applying every 45 min, my small daughter still got a horrible burn.</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> So so mad at the damage to our skin.</li>
            <li> It is painful and scary and ugly.  </li>
            <li> While I did not burn using this, it is just horribly, horribly greasy and thick.</li>
            <li> I felt buttered up using this, and it was nearly impossible to wash off.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s impossible to rub in.</li>
            <li> Impossible to rub in, greasy,</li>
            <li> Horrible and obviously not good for your skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been burnt that badly in years</li>
            <li> so bad it was as if I hadn&#x27;t put any on.  </li>
            <li> She is burnt bad and I even applied 2 x in a 2 hour period</li>
            <li> I think this company has a bad product and a liability issue.  </li>
            <li> BELIEVE ALL THESE BAD REVIEWS.</li>
            <li> ALL THESE BAD REVIEWS TRY THE PRODUCT FOR YOURSELF.</li>
            <li> I am not saying they are bad sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t badly burnt</li>
            <li> The burns were so bad they both wound up with sun poisoning.  </li>
            <li> BAD</li>
            <li> BAD BAD.  </li>
            <li> Even with that history, I have never been burned as bad as I was as this product.</li>
            <li> I have seen tons of bad reviews...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never burned this bad, ever.</li>
            <li> I feel really bad as a parent that I used this on my kids.</li>
            <li> I feel like a bad parent.</li>
            <li> My arms aren&#x27;t so bad because I covered them up with a towel.  </li>
            <li> Too bad they havent made a scented version</li>
            <li> it was that bad.</li>
            <li> I could have made they all got burnt and burnt badly, and they did reapply as directed.</li>
            <li> I feel badly for all those children who got burned by this ineffective grease that calls itself an &amp;#34;Honest Sunscreen Lotion&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE NEVER BURNT THIS BAD IN MY LIFE</li>
            <li> I am shocked by all the reviews on here.</li>
            <li> I am shocked by the  bad reviews.</li>

            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> disappointed in what used to be a trusted brand in our household.</li>

            <li> Disappointed with the quality.</li>
            <li> We are totally disappointed with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> hate seeing all the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Wish that you and Costco tested this before selling it - lots of disappointed customers and one unscrupulous company.  </li>
            <li> Very unhappy consumer.</li>
            <li> How stupid, I am going in the ocean, in salt water under the sun.</li>
            <li> How stupid, I am going in the ocean, in salt water under the sun.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be stupid.</li>
            <li> I feel so stupid.</li>
            <li> The product can&#x27;t cure people from being stupid.</li>
            <li> This item has a base of sunflower oil.  </li>
            <li> Claiming certified organic without specifying the entity that issued the certification makes it as worthless as the tube that it is printed on.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Costco but to hopefully save some unsuspecting families from purchasing this crap</li>
            <li> This stuff is worthless</li>
            <li> I realized this crap hourly &amp; when we came home from beach</li>
            <li> I HATE this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible and dangerous product.  </li>
            <li> Totally crap.</li>
            <li> Yes it is greasy, but I also have Babo and that stuff is IMPOSSIBLE to spread!</li>
            <li> This sunblock is terrible, my daughters face suffered bad burn after using this in Mexico.</li>
            <li> so I was really shocked to end the day with one of the worst burns of my life.</li>
            <li> but it is so bad everyone needs to know!</li>
            <li> And also, my daughter had a bad reaction to the lotion and we had to rush to the emergency room because she had a rush on both her arms after applying it!</li>
            <li> They blistered so bad she had to stay in for a week!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Sick of, \\&quot;this works this!</li>
            <li> What I hated and why it got 2 stars is after I opened it ....</li>
            <li> But I had to write that this is a worthless and also horrible and harmful product.  </li>
            <li> The truth of the matter is that I hated the consistency of the product</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this sunblock.</li>

            <li> This was probably the worst sunscreen I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s freaking terrible.</li>
            <li> How in the crap did this even pass testing and get packaging?!?</li>
            <li> Horrible and shame on the FDA for giving it the SOFbrating they did.</li>
            <li> Disgusting!</li>

            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, one of the worst sunburns of my life.</li>
            <li> The WORST sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> and I read all of the horrible reviews about this product and how</li>
            <li> I am absolutely disgusted at the damage I have done to my skin this summer, all while thinking I had been protecting it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; aka it used to have 20% zinc oxide and now it has 9.3%.....</li>
            <li> This is really awful. I bought this from a local warehouse club because it was a good price and people seem to love the Honest Company products. I prefer mineral-based sunscreens so I figured it would be a safe buy. I&#x27;ve tried many many many mineral-based sunscreens and I think this is the worst. It&#x27;s incredibly greasy and leaves skin feeling really gross for a long time. It went straight into the trash after the first use. If you&#x27;re looking for a good mineral-based sunscreen, try ThinkBaby or Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as I like many other Honest Company products.  Unfortunately, it provides NO protection.  My kids got so sunburned.  As a parent, you feel horrible and responsible when these things happen.  DO NOT BUY THIS!!  If you have had a similar experience, share it with The Honest Company.  They need to know!</li>
            <li> It is hard to write this review due to my sever sunburn! My entire family who does not burn easily all burned after a day in the sun even after applying this sunscreen three times! Worst sunscreen ever!</li>
            <li> I would echo what other reviewers are saying... Do not buy this sunscreen.  I purchased this at our warehouse club thinking it would be a good choice (based on the ingredients) for my three boys ages 1, 3 and 5.  We spent two hours in the late afternoon sun and each of them burned on areas where I thoroughly applied the sunscreen.  It&#x27;s incredibly greasy too, which isn&#x27;t great when you&#x27;re trying to hold a wiggly baby.</li>
            <li> I have used this product on my kids (both 4 year old) ever since Honest Company started making it.  They have never had a sunburn and we live in Southern Arizona with a pool.  I chose this product because it is free of the harmful cancer causing chemicals that normal name brand sunscreens use (Google the ingredients some day).  It is greasy so I use a light coating with ZERO sunburns.  One of my kids has excema and nearly every sunscreen caused her to cry out this it was burning her skin-except this one.  As a matter of fact, I love that it is super moist on her skin as I feel like it gives her a bit of a protective layer from the effects of the pool chemicals on her skin.  My other child doesn&#x27;t have the same skin sensitivities.  I&#x27;m sorry so many others have had burns with this product.  We have used it since 2013 with ZERO burns.  I have always ordered it direct from The Honest Company so I don&#x27;t know if the formulation varies depending on seller.</li>
            <li> This product should be pulled off of shelves. I bought a 2-pack from a local warehouse store and was excited to have found a natural solution. I shave my head and wanted to avoid chemicals on my dome. Thought this would be a great solution....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applied before spending 1.5 hours outdoors and am very burnt today. Not happy!</li>
            <li> Does not work - kids and I got burned</li>
            <li> While I did not burn using this, it is just horribly, horribly greasy and thick. I felt buttered up using this, and it was nearly impossible to wash off.</li>
            <li> I am shocked by all the reviews on here. I have a 3 and 5 year old (the oldest with pale skin) and have yet to find a sunscreen that worked so well. After the first application, I reapplied with spray of a different brand on his back and used the honest on neck, face, and ears.  You could see my fingerprints where the two different ones were applied. I quickly ordered the Honest stick and the Honest spray.  We have been to the beach and to the watermark numerous times, and my kids have yet to experience sunburn again.  Not sure the inconsistency.  Definitely has my vote!</li>
            <li> I thought I liked this product, and felt good knowing I was putting something natural on my daughter&#x27;s skin. I noticed from the beginning that it&#x27;s extremely oily and unfortunately it stained her clothing. But it seemed to keep my fair skinned 3 year old from getting burned. Recently she&#x27;s been spending a lot more time on the sun at school and I&#x27;ve noticed she&#x27;s been slightly red. I thought that her teacher possibly wasn&#x27;t applying it a second time. But that isn&#x27;t the case. And after reading all of these reviews (that I wish I had read before purchasing) I definitely will discontinue using this product.</li>
            <li> If I could give no stars I would.  I rarely leave a review but being a very fair skinned person who got a terrible burn on vacation from this, i felt like it was my duty to warn people.  This block does not work.  I applied as directed and was only out in the sun one hour before I got a severe burn.  If  you want a natural sunscreen check out think baby, that stuff actually works.</li>
            <li> Worst! I wouldn&#x27;t even call it Sunblock!  My 2 year old is so burnt and I am one Pissed Mother! Absolutely offers no protection yet costs a fortune!</li>
            <li> Have used a wide variety of sunscreens and my children have never burnt.  Applied this generously and kids all got burnt.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I always use chemical free natural sunscreen for my two kids (age 2 &amp; 5) and myself and I love so many of The Honest Company&#x27;s other products so I was excited to try the new formula sunscreen. After less than 2 hours in the later afternoon sun (went out at 2:30) it was as if I had applied plain baby oil to all 3 of us. I haven&#x27;t been burnt that badly in years and my kids had never had sunburns before until I used this sunscreen. It truly was like a sun accelerant!  I felt so guilty for letting my kids get burnt &amp; thankfully theirs weren&#x27;t as bad as mine which took 3 days to even start to calm down &amp; not be painful. I wrote to the company in the feedback section of their website out of genuine concern a few weeks ago &amp; heard nothing in response. This is seriously very concerning and a health hazard. Don&#x27;t even risk it!</li>
            <li> We took this sunscreen to the lake. My first comment is that it is very oily in comparison to other sunscreen on the market. Secondly, like the other reviews, it does not work to protect you from the sun and I ended up having to reapply Banana Boat because I felt like I was burning.</li>
            <li> This product needs to be recalled as it does not work! I used it at the pool for myself and 2 children, applied it liberally, and after 1.5 hours we were all burned. We would have been better off wearing nothing as the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; just attracted the sun! Do NOT buy!!!</li>
            <li> This is a terrible sunscreen product and should not be used.  The entire family was burned after a day in the sun applying and re-applying this product.  It is very greasy to apply and DOES NOT provide sun protection.  We threw our remaining bottles away!</li>
            <li> IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK; DO NOT BUY.  I bought this at Costco, thinking it was a trustworthy brand if Costco was featuring it, took it to Hawaii, put it on and even reapplied a couple of times and I got sunburned so bad it was as if I hadn&#x27;t put any on.  I was born and raised in Hawaii and I know what sunscreen is supposed to do, when to reapply it, and what to expect if you don&#x27;t put any on.  This is a TERRIBLE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I have applied this to myself and my kids on several sunny days and have come to the conclusion that I actually get more burned wearing this than when wearing nothing!  Instead of protection we were essentially basting ourselves with oil for a nice, crispy finish.  What a huge disappointment in my search for a sunscreen with fewer chemicals.  I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Does not prevent suncreen.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen does not work!  My poor fair skinned daughter got an extremely bad sunburn after using this product even with two application.  I made the mistake of thinking it just wasn&#x27;t put on think enough and tried it again the next day and her skin got burnt even more.  I would urge people not to buy this product!</li>
            <li> This is the worst sunscreen.  I agree with a lot of the other moms and there post.  I applied this is my daughter and thought since it was made of zinc it would be great. NO NO!!!  She is burnt bad and I even applied 2 x in a 2 hour period and she is so red and getting redder and redder. It is like it made it worse as I didn&#x27;t apply it on her legs and those are not red at all, but everywhere I applied it she is beet red.</li>
            <li> I bought a 2 pack of honest sunscreen at Costco.  My skin got fried. I never burn but I think the ingredients in this magnify the sun.  The other person I gave this to also got fried.  I think this company has a bad product and a liability issue.  Do not buy this junk!  Go buy a name brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Costco and had a similar experience to the many disappointed parents who have reviewed here.  My entire family got a sunburn even though we applied multiple times throughout the day.  This was the first sunburn for my children which is so disappointing.  Will go back to what I know works, Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li> ACCELERATES BURNS!!  Do not purchase this if you are looking for a sunblock.  This is as effective as olive oil.</li>
            <li> The absolute  worst product I have ever seen.  Bought this at Costco for my two granddaughters to use this summer, we used it for the first time today and both were terribly burned. The 2 year old had it applied to her face only and then I used a different brand that was a spray for the rest of her body.  The  only place on her body that was burned was her face, we were in the pool for only 20 minutes! My 4 year old granddaughter was at the water park today for about 3 hours with her mother she luckily had a rash guard on and only had the sun screen on her face and legs. Her face is quite burned,  her mother reapplied it at least every 40 minutes!  DO NOT BUY...AMAZON needs to take this product off it&#x27;s  website and the Honest Company needs to recall it!</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT FROM AMAZON I GET IT STRAIGHT FROM HONEST.COM I CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE ALL THESE BAD REVIEWS. I USE THIS SUNSCREEN ON MY CHILDREN, AND MYSELF. I PUT IT ON 15 MIN BEFORE GOING OUT. AND YOU DO NEED TO REAPPLY AS WITH ALL SUNSCREEN. I REAPPLY AT LEAST EVERY 2 HOURS SOMETIMES EVERY HOUR, IT DEPENDS ON THE DAY. MY KIDS DO NOT BURN. THEY MIGHT TAN BUT DO NOT BURN. SO BEFORE GOING BY ALL THESE BAD REVIEWS TRY THE PRODUCT FOR YOURSELF. DON&#x27;T THINK YOU CAN PUT IT ON IN THE MORNING AND NOT REAPPLY ALL DAY. BE RESPONSIBLE NOT CARELESS IN THE SUN. IF YOU HAVE FAIR SKIN REAPPLY EVERY HOUR.</li>
            <li> I was outside for 3.5 hours yesterday at an amusement park. We applied this sunblock 3 times (almost once an hour), but still got as bad of a burn as if we&#x27;d completely forgotten sunblock. Very disappointed. I wish I&#x27;d checked out reviews before picking this up at Costco!</li>
            <li> Beware!!!  This item has a base of sunflower oil.  Oil will ATTRACT the sun...yes the zinc offers sun protection, but the oil does not.  This is perhaps why the reviews of this product are so low.  There is a trade off for natural unfortunately in this case.  They need to reformulate product to contain less oil, which also goes rancid in heat.  In addition, the oil will cause breakouts on sensitive skin (this is what happened to me).  I was so excited to buy this product, and having a big star (i.e. Jessica Alba) helps promote this company, but the product is not good.  Shows what fame mongers we are!  Marketing works!</li>
            <li> I read all these negative reviews mentioning how greasy this sunscreen is. I can not believe this many people are unhappy. I live in hot and humid Florida, I am 39 and have a combination skin. I absolutely love this sunscreen. It has Shea butter, that is why it is greasy. I put a pea size amount of lotion into my palm and spread it with my finger and apply it to my face. It feels greasy, yes, but it absorbs into my skin and leaves it glowing and nourished and moisturized. Its not like Vaseline that stays greasy on your skin forever. Shea butter is amazing for your skin, I have no breakouts. I am glowing, skin looks youthful. I am so in love with this lotion. I hope I help people change their view on this lotion. Update: I have been using it daily for months now, haven&#x27;t had a sunburn, haven&#x27;t seen any tanning, it protects from sun perfectly.</li>
            <li> Just want to ditto what most reviews have already said, and give this product a thumbs down, will no buy again.&lt;br /&gt;When you squeeze it out, the lotion part sits in a pool of oil. Maybe this adds to its water resistance factor but it just feels so greasy going on. If that wasn&#x27;t enough, it smells gross. My kids complain when I put it on saying &amp;#34;Yucky!&amp;#34; and begging me to apply a different sunscreen to their face so they won&#x27;t have to smell it. I can&#x27; describe what it smells like.. oil? there is no good smell to combat the oil smell. We use the honest company&#x27;s body wash and love that. Don&#x27;t know why they couldn&#x27;t add some essential oils in the sunscreen to make it smell decent.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak for the sun protection factor. We haven&#x27;t got burned so hope that means that it at least protected our skin.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this from Costco and going to try to return it.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect sunscreen for people that have skin allergies.  I have never had any rashes or allergic reactions to this sunscreen unlike all other sunscreens except Vanicream.  Even Neutrogena gives me rashes.  The problem with Vanicream is that it leaves the skin looking white which makes you look bad in pictures.  On the other hand Honest Sunscreen leaves no whiteness and is perfectly clear.  It is a bit greasy but to me it feels great.  The sun protection seems to be effective and it is given an Excellent rating for UVA protection by the EWG reviewing report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.ewg.org/2014sunscreen/about-the-sunscreens/566127/The_Honest_Company_Sunscreen%2C_SPF_30/</li>
            <li> HONEST COMPANY SPF 30 SUNSCREEN... This is not made anymore so if you are purchasing this, you are getting an old mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACTIVE INGREDIENT: Non-Nano Zinc Oxide 9.3%&lt;br /&gt;INACTIVE INGREDIENTS: Beeswax*, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*, Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract*, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract*, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Jojoba Esters, Methyl Dihydroabietate, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil*, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Silica, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil*, Tocopherol. *Certified Organic Ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreen needs to protect and needs to protect for a reasonable price. If you want to go by what Consumer Report recommends which rates protection without any consideration for ingredients in the sunscreen then in that case, I can get you roofing tar for less money, so we might as well consider that... Zinc is the solution, more zinc for less money with organic ingredients that are not carcinogen or harmful to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;Trans oil used is questionable ingredient especially when I have no idea of what percent of the mix is each ingredient. Claiming certified organic without specifying the entity that issued the certification makes it as worthless as the tube that it is printed on. It does not come close to other brand of 80% organic but neither does the price. EWG rates this on their top 1-7 rating, an excellent score especially when only 20 made the list from over 1,000 different sunscreen mix. No sunscreen is going to protect you from any sunburn if you fail to look at the temperatures, heat and how much you get to rinse due to being in water. This mix has 9.3% ZO, it is not as high as 18% ZO but more importantly, it is NO NANO which hardly any other sunscreen producer uses, it is the better ZO but what is disturbing is the consistency of the mix as well as the smell of the mix since the five star ones use VCO not these type of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not, I need as close as formula to clean ingredients in the mix as my organic sunscreen formula mix. If you use a lot of sunscreen, then you may consider mixing your own since you can get protection by adding  more zinc with fewer ingredients. ZO is what surfers put on their nose for protection, the white looking chalk. If in the ocean for longer than an hour then the best protection is Vaseline. Majority of sun screens with ZOs are creams. Creams are more difficult to apply than lotions. Producers of sunscreens sells their products for what they think they can get for each ounce of sunscreen based on their formula and ingredients that they put in that particular sunscreen, especially the percentage of the ZO varies by different production. More ZO cost more, less ZO cost less but then again, less ZO offers less protection. Producers write whatever they want to push a mix and it is up to consumers to read ingredients and compare facts. Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans&#x27; salty water without any shade, then Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is, but for a surfer like me, usually higher organic ingredients are the best since I am in and out of sun which washes away the mix in the oceans’ salty water. What I put on my skin is the same as consuming it through my skin since it is absorbed by the skin. I don&#x27;t intend to have the sunscreen for snack but it is good to know that when I choose one, it offers the least amount of chemicals in the mix. Quality sunscreens are not over 30 SPF and if any above 30 SPF, it is a simple marketing, meaning positively worthless. I wear a rash guard when surfing which covers my upper body so I am protected all the time. What worries me is my face. For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc. that come with exposure to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look for clean formulas all the time with following pointers;&lt;br /&gt;1. ACTIVE INGREDIENTS of more zinc less titanium, the best-rated mineral sun blocks. Majority have many different ingredients than zinc and titanium as ACTIVE INGREDIENTS.&lt;br /&gt;2. Must have the blessing of the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s annual Sunscreen Guide.&lt;br /&gt;3. I do not pay attention to water proof or water resistant. How stupid, I am going in the ocean, in salt water under the sun. Unless I put a deck coating or a roof on my head, it will not last. Anyone looking for those wordings should avoid sun and ocean. Producers like to spin the facts and challenge our knowledge and intelligence by claiming it as WITHOUT any harsh chemical or chemical FREE or without chemical ABSORBERS. Chemical is a chemical regardless.&lt;br /&gt;4. Majority have fragrance which I avoid. After all, I am going in the ocean not on a date. Why do I need fragrance on my skin which is alcohol regardless, and this is from an athlete where I consume fresh garlic napping in vinegar every single day. If I want any perfume, I will apply the perfume I purchase separately.&lt;br /&gt;5. I never leave the sunscreen in the sun. I keep it refrigerated till I use and always go for a fresh sunscreen all the time so I never worry about few months old mix. Freshness is a priority in any mix especially when it comes to oil. I insure to check the expiration date and purchase anything that I consume especially anything that it goes on my skin which is absorbed by the skin and processed by the liver.&lt;br /&gt;6. I always apply 30 minutes before any exposure to the sun since it needs to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;7. BROAD SPECTRUM; It must spell out on the face of the container.&lt;br /&gt;8.

            <li> Burned my children in the sun. I have always used Blue Lizard, thought I would try something different with similar ingredients. I instantly threw away both bottles I had purchased from Costco. I now will have to worry that my children won&#x27;t suffer from skin cancer in their future because of the sun burn. I don&#x27;t want a refund... I just want people to know that they are buying and would live to see this sunscreen off the market.</li>
            <li> Greasy, gross sunscreen that feels terrible going on. I wish I had read the reviews before buying this. EWG recommends their products but I will never purchase this again. I haven&#x27;t noticed whether or not my kids were protected, as they weren&#x27;t out in the sun for very long both times I applied it.</li>
            <li> This lotion is made with non-nano zinc as the only active ingredient and  uses natural inactive ingredients such as beeswax as the lotion base. It is an alternative to more mainstream lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent choice if you have concerns about:&lt;br /&gt;-Nano zinc&lt;br /&gt;-Titanium Dioxide in any form&lt;br /&gt;-Sun reflective chemicals such as AVOBENZONE that may be absorbed or broken down into more harmful substances&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may not have these concerns. This product is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;Your top priority may be non greasy lotion. Large companies have specially formulated lotions with many ingredients that are non-greasy. Beeswax is greasy. Likewise, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> Besides the smell being a little off putting and the consistency being greasy, it didn&#x27;t work!  We all got sunburnt despite reapplying.  We had been using Alba Botanica sunscreen but I thought I would try Honest as the two pack was such a great deal.  Unfortunately now we are stuck with another tube that we won&#x27;t be using.  We will not be buying this sunscreen again.</li>
            <li> My family of 5 used this sunscreen yesterday and all 5 of us are very burnt. You might as well slather yourself in baby oil because that is how well it works!</li>
            <li> Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was as effective as rubbing olive oil on the skin. I rather use &amp;#34;evil chemicals&amp;#34; if they will protect us from harmful sun.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have paid more attention to the reviews, but I got distracted by the good reviews it had after the article broke that this was a great product. I was in Mexico where I applied a thick layer quite frequently...and still got scorched and peeled. I feel like I was completely duped with this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is beyond horrible. Even after liberally applying every 45 min, my small daughter still got a horrible burn. This is not sunscreen, it is a sunburn accelerant. Do not buy!!</li>
            <li> Completely worthless sunscreen! I wanted a sunscreen that was better for the environment and had less chemicals so we picked this up at Costco. First of all the texture and consistency is disgusting. It feels thick and greasy and sticky. Secondly, it does nothing to prevent sunburns. You may as well not even put sunscreen on. I applied a good amount before leaving the house and then sat and watched my son&#x27;s baseball game for 3 hours while reapplying this sunscreen every 45 min&#x27;s to an hour and I still got a horrible sunburn. This is an awful product.</li>
            <li> Bought this at Costco, and thank god for their return policy.  I got the worst sunburn of my life at the waterpark.  Terrible product, do not use.</li>
            <li> This is the worst sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.  Took my family to the waterpark for the day and applied this non-harmful, non-chemical, completely non-functional paste pretending to be sunscreen.  Now the entire family is sunburned - even though over a 5 or 6 hour window, we applied the sunscreen liberally 3-4 times.  This natural ingredient sunscreen allowed the natural sun to naturally burn our skin - so natural!  We would have been better off going with no sunscreen than this garbage - at least we would not have had the false sense of being safe from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays, and would have worn protective clothing and found more frequent shade.  Give me traditional sunscreens any day over The Honest Company &amp;#34;Sunscreen&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I really wish I had read these reviews before I took this sunscreen on my vacation and kept reapplying it, thinking I was doing something wrong when I got burned. I really, really hope my skin recovers from this assault! This sunscreen was very greasy, uncomfortable, hot, and left a white film on my skin to wear, and then I got very badly burned, so, all that discomfort not only wasn&#x27;t worth it, but resulted in an itchy, hot, red, painful sunburn that may lead to premature aging, or worse. . . . I so wanted this to work!</li>
            <li> We usually only think of shaking the spray cans of sunscreen, but if you read the instructions on this product, it very clearly states to shake to tube first. Otherwise the product comes out watery/oily and not blended with the sunblock ingredients.  Still not my favorite zinc based product, but it makes a big difference if you follow the directions!</li>
            <li> At first I loved this sunscreen, I used it on my face and arms and was outside a couple hours. My favorite part and why I bought is that I like that it is more natural and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, like putting a nice lotion on. NO issues, no sunburn. I am super white and have a - can&#x27;t tan to save my life - kind of complexion. What I hated and why it got 2 stars is after I opened it ....now the contents have separated and even with all the squeezing I did to try to reblend it in the tube, no luck. I may have left it outside and it was hot out, but helllloooo people - it&#x27;s sunscreen not a popsicle. Now when I open the tube I get this clear greasy liquid that comes out first before the lotion. Ugh. What a mess. Maybe this is due to the all natural ingredients - do they just not store well? I&#x27;m not sure. So I will still use what&#x27;s left in an - I can&#x27;t find any other sunscreen - kind of emergency. Bottom line, I would not recommend this product, there are far superior ones on the market. Would never buy it again.</li>
            <li> My kids and I burned as well using this sunscreen.  We were only out for an hour as well.</li>
            <li> I have used this along with the spray sunscreen and the face sunscreen with no issues.  I am a avid user of all Honest Products since having my son 9 months ago.  I will say I am very very particular with my sunscreens.  Previously, the only one I would use was Supergoop which was expensive.  Any time I use Nuetrogenia, Banana Boat, or Coppertone, I break out with a severe burn whenever I am exposed to the sun.  I am not saying they are bad sunscreens.  I just cannot use them as they react with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using Honest, I have not had any sunburns nor has my son.  We apply indoors well before going out and reapply often to avoid any sunburn issues.  The one negative I have is that it will not come off of clothing or things such as strollers (I have a ghost in the stroller now from applying it on him while sitting in it).  It will wash out of clothing but must be washed out.  If you accidentally get some on your shorts and then want to go out, you are stuck with it till you do your next load of laundry.  I will keep using them and have to add, that while one sunscreen works great for me, it may not work great for you.  And the same could be said for all negative reviews.  Just because you were burnt, doesn&#x27;t mean that it is not a good sunscreen for someone else.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen, my entire family uses it and have never been burned. My mom used it minimally and sat out in the sun for hours and didn&#x27;t get burned. I love knowing I&#x27;m not slathering a bunch of chemicals on my children or myself! Not sure why it hasn&#x27;t worked for others, but it most definitely works for us!</li>
            <li> Simply put...THIS SUNSCREEN DOESN&#x27;T WORK...buy this if you want to ruin your vacation.  The Honest Company has lost all of my confidence after selling this awful product.  I have used natural sunscreens with great success but I will NEVER USE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN</li>
            <li> I have bought many Honest products and always have been very pleased. This sunscreen was a huge disappointment. It was greasy and we all got burnt. We were only on a lakeside beach in early May for a few hours. The week prior, I put it on my son&#x27;s face. He has olive skin and tans nicely, but his cheeks got burnt the day he wore the Honest sunscreen. I promptly threw out what was left over after our lake trip.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen works great! Virtually scent free.  I have super sensitive skin and this product is great!</li>
            <li> Why is this still on the market? If I could give this zero stars I would. Imagine passing this out to your family to use at the beach, everyone applies liberally, everyone is sunburned! This is beyond irresponsible, it is reckless that it has not been recalled and that a big retailer would still carry this terrible product. Can you imagine what might be in the children&#x27;s toothpaste they sell?</li>
            <li> Bought not from here but it is so bad everyone needs to know! This sunscreen is super greasy and does not protect you from the sun at all. Our entire family has worn this sunscreen at various times and we have each burned with exposure as little as 30minutes. I reapplied even after an hour and a half was burnt like I had worn no sunscreen at all. Horrible and obviously not good for your skin. Listen to the reviews on here because they are true! Ours is now in the trash.</li>
            <li> The worst sunscreen I have ever tried. It&#x27;s greasy as butter, disgusting to apply! And also, my daughter had a bad reaction to the lotion and we had to rush to the emergency room because she had a rush on both her arms after applying it! I won&#x27;t buy it anymore</li>
            <li> My husband and I used this sunscreen and both were terribly burned, usually neither of us easily burn. After only a few hours in the sun we were fried. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not effective as sunscreen at all.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this sunscreen worked well for me and my toddler. We wore it for almost an hour on a very hot day, direct sunlight at noon time, at the pool. And it kept us from getting too dark or burned. I did not think it was too greasy at all like the other reviews said. If anything, I feel that other mainstream types of sunscreens are too greasy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have to say that I was excited to use it because it&#x27;s from The Honest Company and I love everything they make ( I have used about 8 of their products and have always been highly impressed with every product.) Then after reading reviews on Amazon about this exact product, I got a little frightened to use it, thinking that it might not work.  Then curiosity got the best of me and I did try it and I did not experience anything negative about this product. Texture, smell, and effectiveness of the product are all highly graded in my opinion. I am not sure why there are so many negative reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy into the hype, but it&#x27;s true: this product is truly, truly bad. I usually like the Honest Co., so I was stoked to find this available at a bargain price. I sampled it and immediately noticed how greasy it was. The next time, I shook the tube, kneaded it, everything I could to mix those ingredients -- still extremely greasy. I&#x27;d started to hear horror stories about the sunscreen not working, so I made sure to only use it on myself at our next beach outing. I live in the tropics, but I applied it when we were out in the late afternoon, when the sun wouldn&#x27;t be too bad. Well, the rumors were confirmed. My arms were tingling and sore by dinnertime, and I could tell that I&#x27;d gotten a sunburn. In fact, it felt like I&#x27;d been out in the middle-of-day overhead sun, not the end-of-day sun that I&#x27;d actually experienced. So, not only does the sunscreen not block the sun, but I would also say that all that excess oil seems to actually accelerate the burn. How disappointing that the Honest Co. has not addressed this issue in a press release of some sort. I will definitely think twice before blindly trusting this company. At the least, stay away from this product!</li>
            <li> Easiest to apply and works great on the grand daughters, and me as well.</li>
            <li> I did not experience this burning my kids skin like many experienced, but I experienced this staining all of my kids swim wear. Their swim shirts and shorts now have white all over them and it does not wash off. Even a towel that hands got wiped on now has white on it. I&#x27;ve washed everything and its all ruined now. Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> No wonder.  I wasn&#x27;t badly burnt but I definitely thought the sun protection was a little weak.  I looked at the other reviews and it make sense.  I have used the other products and they worked well.  Back to the drawing board, Honest!</li>
            <li> Bought at Costco because I am allergic to most sunscreens. I cause used sunscreens with zinc and titanium only. Tried this product because it is one of the few I have found that I can use and I am red,red, red after only 2 hours 40 mins in the sun. Really grease and feels horrible. This does not prevent sunburns one bit!</li>
            <li> I try to use as many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products as possibly, so I was thrilled when I saw this at Costco. Although it smells nice and is easy to apply, it did not protect my family at all!!! We reapplied throughout the day and I truly thought we didn&#x27;t do it enough until I read all of these reviews. Save your skin and your money!!!</li>
            <li> My children have been using this sunscreen every day for 3 weeks at summer camp.  My 6-year old daughter has very sensitive skin.  Last year, she suffered 2nd degree burns in summer camp.  So far this summer, she is a few shades tanner but no sign of burns.  The sunscreen goes on easily and smoothly.  It feels oily during application but I would prefer oily than seeing chunky white sunscreen all over their skin.  I was attracted to the product because there are no synthetic chemicals added.  This sunscreen scored 1 out  8 (1 being the best) at this website, http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/about-the-sunscreens/617105/The_Honest_Company_Honest_Sunscreen_Lotion%2C_SPF_30/</li>
            <li> I was suspicious about this sunscreen because it says non-nano yet it is still invisible.  Zinc Oxide non nano is supposed to have color.  It felt like I am applying lotion.  My kids skin are tan so we don&#x27;t burn, but I still would like the protection, so I looked on the reviews and voila, I see that I was right.  I am putting them back into package and return them.</li>
            <li> Environmental Working Group (EWG) &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; category for effectiveness and product ingredient safety.  Used 3 fair-skinned kids playing 4 hrs of outdoor tennis daily, and no burns yet. Check the EWG review to see for yourself: http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/about-the-sunscreens/617105/The_Honest_Company_Honest_Sunscreen_Lotion%2C_SPF_30/</li>
            <li> My least favorite natural sunscreen. Too thick, leaves white residue, just not easy to apply to squirmy toddlers. Our favorite sunscreen to date is little twigs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised to read all the negative reviews of this sunscreen. I love this sunscreen because it&#x27;s the only mineral-based sunscreen that is easier to put on. All of the other mineral sunscreens are thick pastes that are hard to spread over skin in an even layer. I love the fact that this has a little extra oil in it to make it easier to spread.  I wonder if the people who are rating it poorly due to sunburns are using it more sparingly to counter-act the greasy feeling? So, yes, it&#x27;s greasy, but to me that&#x27;s a positive because it makes it a lot easier to spread over the skin of my 6 year old twins.</li>
            <li> We bought this product from Costco. The whole family was burned after only 2 hours at the pool. Terrible sunscreen. It doesn&#x27;t seem like The Honest Company is being very honest about this product...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very surprised about the bad reviews.  I bought this in Costco for half the price and it has worked great.  I&#x27;m at the beach almost every weekend and this sunscreen has done a great job.  It is very greasy but I think that&#x27;s a small price to pay for having a natural product.  Plus I didn&#x27;t find the greasy factor that uncomfortable.  I got used to it after a couple of applications.  You also need to apply it generously.  I also have olive skin and am not as susceptible to burns.  But no amount of sunscreen is going to save a fair person from burning, this isn&#x27;t a miracle lotion.</li>
            <li> Nope. Just got back from a water park. Reapplied every hour on the dot and both myself and my husband are burnt like lobsters. The only things that saved the 3yo were the rash guard and the hat... but his forearms are bright red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased at Costco as well, very rarely have I been disappointed by a product from Costco.</li>
            <li> Goes on white and stays that way. It is also quite greasy. Not happy what so ever with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most HONEST products we have bought have been great, hence us buying this. They say they re made the recipe for it, but it&#x27;s still not very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry.</li>
            <li> Greasy and thin. I&#x27;ll take the white out oxides please.</li>
            <li> I wish I had seen all these reviews before choosing to use this product at the beach today! I purchased a 2-pack at Costco a few months ago and have been waiting to go to the beach to try it out...HUGE MISTAKE! I rarely burn and when I do, it&#x27;s just in a small spot I missed while applying sunscreen. It usually takes hours for a burn to develop. Today early on in the day I noticed how red I was getting and kept slathering on this stupid sunscreen. After an hour and a half I was completely burnt so I went inside. My burns continued to get worse throughout the day. I&#x27;m now completely red and the burns are SO painful. The only place I didn&#x27;t use this was my face (I used another sunscreen there) and feet and those are the only places I didn&#x27;t get burned. Later I looked more closely at the ingredients and I&#x27;m almost positive all the oils probably are causing the accelerated burning. I&#x27;m FURIOUS that I jeopardized my health and my skin, when I was trying to stay safe and protect myself from the sun. Honest company should be ashamed of itself for even putting this on the market.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this sunscreen from Amazon, I bought it from Costco. I have really sensitive skin and most sunscreens make me break out in a rash, so I thought I would give this a try. I got so sun burned! I was outside for about 3 hours on the beach and during that time I applied the sunscreen 3 times (the bottle says to reapply every 90 minutes). I used this on my kids faces thinking it would be better then the spray I used on the rest of their bodies. The only place my kids got burned was on their face. Do not waste your money. This sunscreen provides no protection. Back to Baby Coppertone for me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize the active ingredient was Sunburn...&lt;br /&gt;Using this &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; was worse than using none. It took me a minute to figure out what the big white spot was on my knee... Then I realized that I&#x27;d missed a spot. It&#x27;s the only part of my leg that isn&#x27;t bright red, which is the exact opposite of what should happen when you miss a spot applying sunscreen. Honestly, I would have been far better off using nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Like several other reviewers, I bought it at Costco, - and I&#x27;ll be taking it back tomorrow. One look at me (I&#x27;m so red), and they won&#x27;t need to ask the reason for the return.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute worst sunscreen I&#x27;ve used.  We bought ours from Costco, like many other reviewers (the two pack was less than $15 there,) and fully plan to return this product.  We have a fair-skinned family, but after less than two hours in the sun; we all had at least minor sunburns.  There are other sun products we&#x27;ve used that have never allowed us to burn, with even longer exposure (i.e. Blue Lizard, Happy Baby.)  Also, it is SUPER greasy/oily; which made me feel like it was causing me to burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only plus side is that it doesn&#x27;t create the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; effect other mineral based sunscreens do; although, I think that shows it isn&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this sunscreen. I bought it at Costco for our vacation. WORST MISTAKE EVER. Thankfully my daughter only really tans in the sun but my husband and I are fried. I am super diligent about applying sunscreen every 30 minutes. Like other reviews said, it felt like I lathered with baby oil. The burn keeps getting worse and of course it&#x27;s only the first day of our vacation. I am super ticked that this lotion can be sold as a sunblock or sunscreen. Do not buy!!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the worst sunscreen ever. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of different sunscreens and words can&#x27;t come close to describing how terrible this product compares even to the cheapest stuff you find at discount stores. First, the product applies like a layer of grease -- imagine putting melted butter on your skin. Next, the grease doesn&#x27;t wash off, even with vigorous scrubbing and multiple hand washes. Last, and most importantly, the sun protection from this product is about as good as no sunscreen. I was in the sun for less than an hour and my whole family was burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you Jessica Alba.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen. I actually like how it feels on my skin. I have put in on my son for field day and it protected him all day. My husband is more fair and it also protects him. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars is because of the price.</li>
            <li> Took to Puerto Rico and my husband as I got terribly burned, despite reapplying as directed. Thankfully the kids had long sleeve swim shirts and long board shorts and they were spared. Each morning I&#x27;d think the burn was getting better and my skin would get red when I put this sunscreen on in the hotel room before heading down to the water (where we sat in the shade the whole time). So there&#x27;s also something in it that aggravates skin when you put in on skin that&#x27;s been over-exposed. We had four bottles with us for the trip and used a bottle and a half before throwing them all away and getting a conventional brand at the hotel. If I could give this negative stars I would.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read these reviews before I bought two tubes for spring break in Mexico.  My kids got burned despite frequent application, but I told myself that it must be my fault b/c I wasn&#x27;t reapplying enough or they were in the water too much, etc.  But today I wore this on my face during a regular Saturday in the city (it wasn&#x27;t even that hot and I was in and out of the sun) and I got serious color bordering on a burn.  More like SPF 2 (at best) than SPF 30.</li>
            <li> This sunblock is terrible, my daughters face suffered bad burn after using this in Mexico. She was left with scars !</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. Yes, it&#x27;s a little greasy, but in my opinion better than chemical laden products or aerosol sunscreen sprays which studies are starting to show can have significant impact on lung health. My daughter is in the sun most of the day at camp this summer and with application in the morning before camp and with repeated applications by her counselors she has not gotten a sunburn.</li>
            <li> Imagine rubbing Crisco all over your skin. Thick. GREASY. Horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve used it a few times now but I think I will toss the rest in the trash. It does offer a mild degree of sun protection. We haven&#x27;t burned when we are out for an hour or so.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Costco in preparation for my trip to Hawaii.  My husband and daughter used this product (I stuck to the old faithful Banana Boat Natural and was unburned the entire time) and after the first day of using this product and following manufacturers instructions, were horribly burned.  The burns were so bad they both wound up with sun poisoning.  This product does not protect the wearer from the sun at all and should be pulled from the market. Honest, I think not!</li>
            <li> I do not have a photo but my daughter and I  got burned after using this sunscreen for the first time and I will not be using it again.</li>
            <li> I used this sunscreen for only 4-5 hours (wasn&#x27;t in water or anything) and I was horribly burned. This product is no good.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this sunscreen.  That was short-lived.  First off, its like rubbing oil on your skin. It is super greasy and everything stuck to the kids.  We played outside for around an hour and all had horrible sunburns.  I&#x27;ve had less severe sunburns when I didn&#x27;t wear anything.</li>
            <li> I was really sad to see the negative reviews for this sunscreen.  I bought a double pack at Costco and have used it on my toddler.  It works extremely well.  He has never gotten a burn while using this and is pale.  I do shake and squeeze the bottle a few times to make sure that the zinc oxide is dispersed before using.  And I apply several minutes before going into water. I love the natural ingredients.  Thanks Honest Co!</li>
            <li> Ironically just today I was going to apply this sunscreen lotion  on my my 5 yr old son and the first thing he told me was &amp;#34; mom I don&#x27;t like that one it feels like my skin gets hotter with this one &amp;#34; and I was thrown off but now then I started to  think about it we all used this for our vacation in June to cabo and all of got so sunburned except for my mother in law and 2 yr old which were the ones that didn&#x27;t use this  product !</li>
            <li> I am actually so relieved to see the other reviews here because I, like another reviewer, thought it was my fault that the sunscreen wasn&#x27;t working. I tried it on my son and on myself and both of us got burnt.  Perhaps this works on a people with less sensitive skin but it did not work on us.  I also feel terribly for Jessica Alba and her company because I applaud what she is trying to do bringing natural products to market. We have used her other products in the bath and will continue to do so but will not buy the sunscreen again.  I bought two packages of two bottles at a warehouse club and will be throwing all 4 bottles away.</li>
            <li> Worst sunscreen I have ever tried. Thought I was doing good by buying a mineral based sunscreen by &amp;#34;The Honest Company&amp;#34;. What a joke. I&#x27;m really upset as I feel this company is outright misleading the public and putting helpless little ones at risk. My husband, 2 year old daughter and I all turned bright pink after only 1 hour and we had slathered this junk on too. The product is so greasy that what one reviewer said about it being a sunburn accelerant is true. Avoid at all costs.</li>
            <li> Bought this at Costco and it doesn&#x27;t work. I applied on my daughters before going to the beach and they both got burned. We were there less than 2 hours! I will never use this sunscreen again!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this sunblock. I have used many other Honest products and have liked them all, but this was a bust. First off, it goes on really, really greasy, and my kids hate when I put it on them. They don&#x27;t complain at all with other brands, but I thought if it worked well, they could deal with it, since it&#x27;s better for them than other brands. Today I liberally applied it a good 15 to 20 min before going outside. We were out for aprox 2 hours. It was a 78 degree, partly cloudy day. We were not in the water. Tonight all three of my kids have a sunburn. I purchased it at Costco, so will be returning it this week. As I said, I&#x27;ve bought Honest products before and liked them. I hope they fix this and make it better. It&#x27;s so hard to find a good, safe sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cost a zillion dollars. Oh, and it would be nice if it had a little bit of a scent. Just a bit.</li>
            <li> No stars (I gave it one because I HAD to...Amazon you need a &amp;#34;no stars&amp;#34; category) I am from a family with a long history of melanoma. This sunscreen is NOT sunscreen.  It was greasy and I was burned even after applying every two hours on my bike ride.  It&#x27;s back to long sleeves for me and I will repurpose this as a diaper rash ointment (yes, it&#x27;s that greasy)&lt;br /&gt;Maybe after I try to get a refund...</li>
            <li> I bought this at Costco but to hopefully save some unsuspecting families from purchasing this crap I&#x27;m going to leave a review here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the two pack of spf 30 spray and lotion and used the lotion on my arms, chest, back and legs at my cousin&#x27;s graduation. We were in the sun for an hour and a half and I rarely ever burn. My uncle also used the sunscreen and we are both as red as lobsters! In so much pain and very angry that everyone else used other brands and were not sunburne. It&#x27;s almost like this intensified the burn. Wish I could give zero stars. The honest company should do some major work on their brand before putting a name like &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; behind a sunscreen that promotes skin cancer.</li>
            <li> For its intended purpose of sun protection, I have no complaints because I didn&#x27;t burn while using this product.  That&#x27;s why it gets 2 stars.  The remaining 3 won&#x27;t be given because of the greasy, slimy nature of the product.  I can&#x27;t believe how slimy this stuff is! It didn&#x27;t even wash off with tons of soap and a loofah.  I don&#x27;t plan on wearing this again.</li>
            <li> We purchased this 2-pack through Costco and it&#x27;s horrible!! My wife and I love all of Honest products except for this one. We used this on our 18 month old baby and she was only out in the sun for less than an hour (it was applied twice within the hour) and the poor thing got burnt!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT PURCHASE THIS!!!! We trusted Honest Sunscreen for our baby and was burned (pun intended)!!</li>
            <li> Got sunburn even though I made sure to lather up with this sunscreen. I used different sunscreen for my face, which did not get burned. There is definitely something defective with this product.</li>
            <li> This is the worst SPF lotion. I reapplied several times during the day and got sun burned. Stay away! I regret ever buying this product. They should be taken off shelves and should be illegal selling it. It does not work and now I am suffering! I really feel like doing a class action lawsuit. This lotion really sucks!</li>
            <li> Like so many other reviewers, I purchased this from Costco, pleased to be purchasing a safer more natural product.  For them to advertise this as a 30 SPF is CRIMINAL!  I was out for 1 hour and got burned.  I don&#x27;t burn easy.  I usually wear a 15 and am fine for 4 hours.  Don&#x27;t waste your money and risk your health with this product.  BAD BAD BAD.  I will be surprised if there isn&#x27;t a class action lawsuit.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews.  But I had to write that this is a worthless and also horrible and harmful product.  My son received the worst sunburn of his young little life.  He&#x27;s 12 and had never experienced a sunburn before using this product.  Shame on you &amp;#34;Honest&amp;#34; company!  Why no negative star options?</li>
            <li> Got to go with all the 1 stars.  Used this liberally instead of my normal spray on protection and spent the same time in the sun and got burned when I never had before.  This stuff is worthless</li>
            <li> If your idea of a good time is wearing a thick, greasy coat of Vaseline all over your body, you&#x27;ll like this sunscreen. Avoid</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rather suspicious of all the people who&#x27;ve claimed they got horrible burns even when using this. Not like they are liars, but maybe they didn&#x27;t actually know how to apply physical sunscreens- they don&#x27;t work the same way as your name brand chemically sunscreens at all. First of all, this is a physical sunscreen, not the scary chemical kind. Physical sunscreens require that you put a thick layer on- you can&#x27;t use a thin veil and think it will do anything. That&#x27;s true of all natural sunscreen brands, as a matter of fact. Second, and most important for my pale family, you have to actually follow directions. The bottle says you have to reapply every x hours, how can you expect a good result if you never reapply? This sunscreen protected my pale family (so pale my sister mixes the lightest color of foundations with a good amount of goth targeted pure white costume foundation to make it actually match her real skin color) at the beach, the pool, and the amusement park. My sister is severely allergic to most every kind of sunscreen- all mainstream and even most all natural and organic and baby formulations can close up her airways so she can&#x27;t breathe and swell up her face so she&#x27;s unrecognizable- and she loves the beach and she&#x27;s super pale, so we have tried and vetted out 100&#x27;s of different sunscreens over the years to try to find the perfect brand. This isn&#x27;t that, because we live in a humid area and it sometimes makes sweat form little droplets on top of my skin instead of letting it evaporate well and that feels really clammy and gross when the air is already syrup, but it works perfectly as a sunscreen and is super moisturizing to the skin so I am definitely keeping it for trips to drier climates, like when I visit Colorado or California or really anywhere besides the South. In other good news, we left a bottle in the car on a day when the asphalt was melting while we went to the amusement park (another was in the pack so we could reapply every now and then) andthe bottle didn&#x27;t become gross and liquidy like name brand chemical lotions do- Banana Boat, Coppertone, and the like get gross and melty in the sun, which is ridiculous considering it is made to be used in the Summer when it gets hot, and also because it&#x27;s chemically so the whole world of nonmelting ingredients is open to them- but anyways Honest sunscreen doesn&#x27;t get gross in the bottle, it also doesn&#x27;t feel super cold when you put it on like other brands do, it works for super pale people with infrequent reapplication (5-8 hours though that&#x27;s beyond bottle recommended time) in thick layers but it didn&#x27;t look stark white once we rubbed it in, and it left my arms so incredibly and wonderfully smooth and moisturized. It does rub off a little bit once it&#x27;s first applied though so a little bit got on the back of the leather car seats from my shoulder, so put a towel there or something if it bothers you.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to chime in that I also purchased this two-pack from Costco, and my two children who have never had a sunburn before were pretty red after less than one hour in the sun. We used exactly as directed and they weren&#x27;t in the water at any point. This product does not appear to have enough active ingredient to be effective,</li>
            <li> All these people saying that it doesn&#x27;t work are crazy! I have not gotten burned when I have used this sunscreen. You have to be ok with looking white at the beginning because it is a NATURAL sunscreen. You also have to reapply. You can&#x27;t put it on before you leave, drive to the pool and then think your good all day. Read the directions or use common sense. You can&#x27;t be in the sun all day only applying once...</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used The Honest Company&#x27;s sunscreen since my oldest daughter was born, and she is almost three. She has NEVER had a sunburn, and we live in Southern California where temps reach 100+ in the summer, and we have a pool. I wanted to write this review after reading all of the negative comments about this product. I stand behind it 100% and will continue to use this on both of my kids.</li>
            <li> Just like so many others...got this at the local store at the begining of summer. I have very fair skin and always very cautious in the sun. After applying numerous times throughout 3 hours on the beach....I was left with one of the worst sunburns of my life....It has now been a month and my skin is still not back to normal!! I am not even sure how its possible for sunscreen not to work AT ALL....&lt;br /&gt;AVOID!!</li>
            <li> This was probably the worst sunscreen I have ever used. It was EXTREMELY greasy, and if you&#x27;re sweating it comes off with in minutes (I imagine it&#x27;s the same if you&#x27;re in water). Because it&#x27;s so greasy it&#x27;s impossible to rub in. With that, it did practically nothing against the sun.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunblock my husband, tofdler, and I have used all summer. Not one burn. Works great (little goes a long way); highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I loved this. It went on smooth and I DID NOT get burnt. I don&#x27;t get why people are blaming this product for not working, because it does the job ? You can&#x27;t exspect for a sunscreen to work all day long? You have to reapply and get the kids out of the sun for a sec , I&#x27;m mixed so maybe I&#x27;m biased because I don&#x27;t burn easily but I know my very fair skinned (Caucasian) mother used this with me and didn&#x27;t burn ? We where outside for 4 hours and reapplied twice And we were fine. Like my moms not even peeling?  So these extreme sunburns have plenty of variables like how many times did you get in and out of the water  , or did you really if you did get in and out.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers - this simply doesn&#x27;t work.  DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> I use honest sunblock for my 7 month old. We were both in the sun and I was the one with a slight sun burn because I didn&#x27;t use any sunblock and he was white as the day he was born!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m truly shocked at some of the reviews here because my personal experience was so completely different.</li>
            <li> My 1 year old was SEVERLY burned using this product. I applied every hour generously. I called and reported it to the company sending them emails with pictures and haven&#x27;t heard anything back. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> use only if you want to get cancer.  My whole family used it and we were all severely burnt. I informed Honest Company of what happened and they didn&#x27;t seem to take our experience seriously. The product has the same consistency as mayonnaise and has about the same effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review but after using this I feel an obligation to let other mothers know...this doesn&#x27;t work! My 3 sons and I all got burnt. They never have burned like this &amp; I haven&#x27;t burned like this in years!! I realized this crap hourly &amp; when we came home from beach we all were burned. Now having to lather up in aloe &amp; wet clothes to keep cool. So upset that I didn&#x27;t use my typical other coopertone sport babies stuff. I grabbed this whole at Costco as I thought it would be &amp;#34;organic&amp; safe&amp;#34; against cancer causing chemicals but clearly it isn&#x27;t safe against the sun!!!! I&#x27;m returning &amp; very upset. I don&#x27;t even want to give it one star.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews before buying this on sale at Costco.  It&#x27;s horrible.  It goes on like Crisco.  It reminded me of using those little pods of beeswax to waterproof my ski gloves years ago.  It doesn&#x27;t dry.  It doesn&#x27;t wash off my hands.  Everything sticks to me (dirt, grass, sand, small insects).  After taking a shower I still feel like I am wearing a coat of wax.  I suppose that&#x27;s because the main ingredient (after zinc oxide) is beeswax.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen in Spring and felt like I had found a healthier option for protecting myself and my children from the sun.  I thought the sunscreen went on well and felt good on the skin.  I had also heard good things about the company and had enjoyed a different product they manufactured.  I shared it with friends and praised the absence of the white glow often left by other natural sunscreens.  Come to find out, we were all left with red bodies (from sunburn) and I had an extra red-face from the embarrassment of providing such a poor sunscreen to my friends.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen. I am shocked by the  bad reviews. You just apply this often since it is mineral sunscreen. It is the only sunscreen that works for us and is not full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I wish I could post pictures of my poor 6-year-old who fell asleep crying tonight from the hideous sunburn she acquired after 90 minutes in the sun today, completely slathered in Honest Company Sunscreen. We have always used natural sunscreen with great results, but my kids and I are all burned to a crisp after applying and reapplying this product. This shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to be marketed as sunscreen. It&#x27;s complete garbage.</li>
            <li> Interesting to read all the negative reviews. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now for midday bike rides in 85+ degree weather at 8,000 ft. altitude. No sunburns at all while using this as directed. It is a bit greasy but it does soak in enough after a few minutes. I feel that the thickness is actually a good thing as far as water and sweat proofing goes. This product rates 1 on the EWG site, which is the best score a product can receive in regards to the safety of ingredients. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t turn my skin glowing white and it has no scent. Are the negative reviews coming from people used to Nuetrogena sprays and Waterbabies SPF 100 with a 10 rating on the EWG scale? Natural sunscreens are all kind of gross. They are thick, white, and typically not at all like commercial sunscreens. Or are there some kind of hard feelings toward the Honest company that I&#x27;m completely oblivious to?</li>
            <li> Your better off going without sunscreen!!!  I purchased this sunscreen for my family thinking it was a safer alternative to the chemical laden counterparts. Boy was I wrong. First off it feels like pure grease,  mind you that zinc oxide based sunscreens should be thick and white,. We applied the sunblock per directions and all of us got sunburned, including my 9-month-old! Keep in mind that we are all olive skinned and don&#x27;t burn easy. Yet we were only in the sun for an hour and got sunburned. Back to Babyganics, it may not have the best chemicals but at least we won&#x27;t get sunburned.</li>
            <li> GREASE literally comes out first when you squeeze this. Jessica Alba, would you really put this junk on you or your kids? I am irate that this is endorsed by a celebrity that claims to have the morals of Jessica. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS. I put this grease concoction on my arms, and it rubbed off on everything. I had to wipe it off. I can&#x27;t even say how it works because it was so disgusting. One of my nightmares would be to have this grease on my face. I couldn&#x27;t even imagine.</li>
            <li> My whole family is burned after using this horrible sunscreen. My 4 year old is crying in pain because his shoulders are so burned. We went to the waterpark and applied 4 times in 6 hours. I am throwing this in the trash. I am so upset. My children have never been sunburned. I am so diligent about protecting their skin. Shame on you Honest Company.</li>
            <li> This is the worst sunscreen we have ever used on a child. We have used other competitors and never had a problem with using a natural sunscreen, but after using this product our child broke out into a horrible rash. I would not consider buying this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is awesome! The ingredients are all natural and the zinc is non-nano! I was going to make my own sunscreen, but after looking into the ingredients I decided to buy this! I used this on myself, my husband, and my four nieces. We were in the sun for 8 hours (reapplying every 2 hours and waiting 20 minutes before entering water again) Unfortunately, I did not get a tan, but I also did not get sunburned.</li>
            <li> This product sucks. If you are an attorney, file a class action lawsuit and we will all sign up. I am burned everywhere but my face where I used a spf 15 in the morning. This spf 30 did nothing and I didn&#x27;t get it wet and reapplied after 3 hours as I felt that I was getting a little burned.</li>
            <li> THIS SUNSCREEN DOES NOT WORK!</li>
            <li> I am a licensed esthetician. I am careful about  what sunscreen I buy. I was on the beach for only one day and I reapplied so much in that one day that I went through a whole bottle. I got the WORST sunburn of my life. My back was blistered and everything. Thus product needs to be recalled IMMEDIATELY. If I could give it zero stars I would. DO NOT trust this &amp;#34;honest company&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I agree!! DO NOT USE!!! I recently bought this at Costco thinking that it was the best buy ever...NOT SO!! I used as directed and my daughter had third degree burns on her face!! They blistered so bad she had to stay in for a week! I just saw the news report and had to write this review!! I don&#x27;t think that they should have compromised the amount of zinc oxide in the product since that is a key ingredient to blocking  harmful rays!!??@@#&lt;br /&gt;What are they thinking? keep cost down?? I would rather pay a little more and have a product that works for my family.</li>
            <li> I love the sunscreen! I use the lotion and face stick, live in Florida and have never burnt while wearing it. I use on the kids as well and they&#x27;ve never even been pink after a full day in the sun. I shake the bottle of lotion and apply as directed &amp; reapply every 2 hours. It is only SPF 30 and I think people forget it&#x27;s so low when putting it on fair skinned children. If you&#x27;re prone to burning than I suggest a product with a higher SPF. Be sun smart people!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my kiddos with sensitive skin but never again. I will stick with Vanicream sunscreen. My kids never got burned when using Vanicream sunscreen even when at the pool but that was not the case with Honest Company! Sunscreen! DO NOT BUY! IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK!</li>
            <li> I never leave negative reviews, but I can&#x27;t help myself with this one.  I NEVER sunburn.  I have olive toned skin and tan without any effort and have maybe had pink cheeks and shoulders a couple of times in my life.  Last year however, my grandmother had a few skin cancers removed and I decided to grow up and use some sunscreen.  Being health conscious, I purchased this sunscreen from Costco because it boasts that it is healthy.  My husband and I went to the beach and I slathered this all over my body, feeling very proud of myself for actually using sunscreen.  After only about 1 1/2 hours on the beach (way less than normal) We headed home.  It wasn&#x27;t much longer before I realized my legs, face, and shoulders hurt horribly.  I couldn&#x27;t even touch them. I stopped for some aloe with lidocaine and even after applying that I could barely move without pain.  This was a sunburn SO dark it was almost purple with blisters everywhere, my skin was swollen and hot to the touch for days.  I ONLY BURNED, where I placed the sunscreen.  Not on my arms, or my lower legs or my back.  Only on my shoulders, face, and thighs where I actually used the sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is horrible.  I can&#x27;t believe they call themselves the Honest Company and sell a sunblock that so clearly does the opposite of what they say.  A friend told me you have to SHAKE the sunscreen, so I felt stupid and thought that maybe it was because I hadn&#x27;t shaken it first.  So we tried the other tube of sunscreen a few weeks later at the pool and shook vigorously.  Every one of my children came home burned that day.  My son had blisters.  I felt even MORE stupid, because I had tried it again.  Don&#x27;t be stupid.</li>
            <li> I am surprised by all of the negative reviews.  This is hands down my favorite sunscreen for both my 21 month old daughter and myself.  It is rated well on Environmental Working Group for both protection and stability. I&#x27;ve tried babyganics and green screen, and both worked well but left our skin very white. This honest sunscreen is very greasy at first, but feels like it absorbs well. I can even wear it under makeup.  I have very fair skin (over 50% Irish) and sunscreen is my beauty defense.  My daughter and I spend a lot of time out doors in the summer both in and out of water. I follow EWG&#x27;s guidelines for application (a shot glass full to cover an adult&#x27;s arms, chest and face), and I reapply every 2 hours and reapply after water play.  My daughter has yet to get a tan line.  I can only conclude that those who are rating this product poorly are not applying properly.  Also, the product does say to shake it before use, and I&#x27;m wondering if this could be part of the issue.</li>
            <li> I hated this stuff! It didn&#x27;t work at all and I got really sunburnt! Also, it was too greasy and way hard to put on.</li>
            <li> I wanted to chime in on these reviews due to the latest headlines regarding this product.  Firstly, I did not buy this product from Amazon; I bought it from Costco.  To continue, I have had skin cancer (basal and squamous) several times with 4 surgeries on my nose alone.  I used this product on my face for only a few weeks in the spring.  The truth of the matter is that I hated the consistency of the product and so I stopped using it.  For all of these young moms out there, I would be upset as well.  I was a child of the 60&#x27;s and no one knew of the danger of sunburns and blisters.  I am living proof that it is severely damaging and has taken me years to reverse the damage.  It is best to stay out of direct sunlight as much as possible and use a good sunblock on all exposed skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to see these reviews, I thought it was just us and we were crazy. As other reviews are stating, this &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; seems to act more like a tanning oil and accelerate the burn. We are so careful to keep our kids protected from the sun, now they&#x27;ve experienced their first burns due to this product.</li>
            <li> Burned my skull (young woman with long hair), in less than an hour! I&#x27;ve never burned my head in my life! It&#x27;s probably best if you don&#x27;t wear any, this things is a sun magnet. Ridiculous how it is still on shelves.</li>
            <li> I used this product on both my sons (4 and 6) four times and each time they ended the day with sunburns.  I was really hoping this would work because it contains all natural ingredients.  There is actually a lawsuit against this company because of claims that it doesn&#x27;t actually work.  Don&#x27;t spend your money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product a 1 star  because I can&#x27;t think of any positives related to it.  I purchased this two pack of sunscreen from a local warehouse because I thought it was a good deal and because I thought it was a healthier alternative to traditional chemical laden sunscreens. I&#x27;m not sure if the latter is true, but the former is not, since it was absolutely not effective in any way and was just a waste of money.  First, this product goes on very heavy--consistency and smell is similar to melted wax.  It does not rub into the skin very well and is not at all moisturizing.  In fact, I would say that it actually dries your skin out.  As far as wear throughout the day, this product seemed to cause me to sweat a lot more than usual.  I am generally not a noticeable sweater, but this product brought forth the sweat beads like no other. Not only that, it was was hard to miss the fact that I was sweating because the sweat condensed on the skin in the form of white ooze, so i looked like a melting wax sculpture.  As for sun protection, that is non-existent.  I had a noticeable color line from my where my clothing ended and where my skin began even though I applied a heavy coating of this sunscreen (since it&#x27;s really the only option you have since it doesn&#x27;t apply well).  I&#x27;m putting this out on the curb for some other sucker to have.</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible! It offers zero protection against the sun and I believe, as others have said in reviews here, that it actually increases sunburns. I bought this for my toddler and sent it to daycare. That day she came home with really red arms and I thought they had forgotten to apply it. Then I used it at home and saw that it looks like baby oil when you put it on. This stuff is dangerous! DO NOT USE ON KIDS! Go for Thinkbaby. It is also mineral based, non-nano and works fantastically.</li>
            <li> My review below is the letter I sent directly to Honest Co regarding the failure of this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;My wife has been purchasing Honest Co diapers, wipes, hand sanitizer, and body wash/shampoo for the last couple years. We have been nothing but pleased with those products and stopped buying competing natural products because of our satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This satisfaction came to an abrupt and very dangerous halt this last weekend when we tried your SPF 30 sunscreen at a Texas Gulf beach. Your product was applied on my wife, four children (7 down to 5 months), and myself. We applied and then waited before getting in the water, and then reapplied before going back in the water after lunch. We used a different brand natural product on our faces with the same application frequency. By that evening it was very clear that your sunscreen did virtually nothing to protect me and my family from the sun, and each one of us has varying degrees of severe sunburns. In stark contrast, the other brand product used on our faces protected us completely leaving no evidence that we had spent the day in the sun. Now three days later I have blisters on my back from the burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to express the anger, frustration and disappointment we have been feeling due to your product&#x27;s failure. We have tried very hard to protect our children outdoors as we are aware of scientific research indicating the significant increase in cancer risk for each severe sunburn received as a child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your product failed, and after experiencing severe sunburns while using your product, our online research makes it very clear that countless others have been harmed due to your negligence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product should be recalled, pulled from shelves and online marketplaces immediately. No more, &amp;#34;we use it on our children&amp;#34; garbage that you believe may protect you from litigation as you avoid taking responsibility for this failure. In reviewing your company values, itis clear to me that you are not acting on your principles regarding honesty, service, outperform, and sustaining (not harming) life. This product is having the opposite result. I repeat, recall this product now!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> DOES NOT WORK. I&#x27;m furious that, like the other reviewers, we were basically basting ourselves to be burned to a crisp. Even my husband who never ever burns is lobster red. WORST product I&#x27;ve ever bought. Id rather have bought generic dollar store sunscreen and skipped frying my family. Thank God I used Water Babies on my 20 month old son before leaving the house. That&#x27;s the only thing that saved him! DO NOT BUY THIS SUNSCREEN.</li>
            <li> Put this on my 9 year old son and he BURNED!  So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Does not work, all my family members had burns after using this product!! DO NOT USE on less you want sunburns!! The worst sunblock I have ever bought , its a greasily  oily product that offers no protection.  See my pics of the sunburn.  *******Update*******  Do a Goggle Search of the Honest Company Sunscreen and read the news articles about the product problems. Seems that thousands of people have had the same problems.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen from Costco - not Amazon. As a 21-year old, I used to slather on baby oil (prior to being diagnosed with melanoma at 23) to get as tan as possible. Even with that history, I have never been burned as bad as I was as this product. As a 41-year old who still requires bi-annual visits to the dermatologist for skin checks, I am VERY CAREFUL about sun protection. I chose this product because it is natural and at least 30spf. I was out in the sun for less than 4 hours and reapplied this at least 5 times. I was so burned by the time I got home, I ended up using prescription radiation lotion to get relief from the pain. I threw away both tubes immediately upon getting home.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have looked it up before buying 4 bottles at Costoco. My son and I went to the beach yesterday and both got very badly sunburnt! 4 hours and reapplied 3 times. Very disappointed. I expected way better from the Honest Company. If they have a product that doesn&#x27;t work I would expect them to pull it and apologize. Makes me never want to use any of their products.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve found! Great deal.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with most of these reviews. I bought this two pack at Costco before heading to an all day event in nearly 100 degree weather. I tried to cover myself with this grease about 15 minutes before we left the house and again an hour later before setting up our chairs. I was so greasy that I could not put on the thin long sleeve shirt that I had brought along to stay covered so went to a vendor and bought a shawl instead. I did reapply a couple more times throughout the day and was disgusted by the heaviness and greasiness of this product. Both bottles are now sitting by the door awaiting a return to Costco. I was covered heat to toe with probably protected me more than this sunscreen did. I was really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I find it hard to believe all the poor reviews for this product.  I bought a two pack of this sunscreen from a warehouse store based on the one main ingredient, Zinc Oxide. It is mineral oil-based so it does have a slightly greasy feel on your skin, but it&#x27;s not that bad, and it works great for sun protection. It also has no questionable or problem ingredients. Don&#x27;t take my word for it. Check the very reputable EWG site for their top-rating for this product:  http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/about-the-sunscreens/617105/The_Honest_Company_Honest_Sunscreen_Lotion%2C_SPF_30/</li>
            <li> I bought the two pack at Costco for $13 and unlike everyone else, it actually prevented my son from getting burned. However, it is disgustingly greasy. No joke, as greasy and just rubbing olive oil on your body. It&#x27;s just terrible and not worth even using the remaining stuff I have.</li>
            <li> I am so angry with the Honest Company because of this product.  It is completely ineffective as a sunscreen.  I applied it liberally and exactly according to the directions to myself and my three children, and we all ended up burned.  Then I came here and discovered that everybody else had the exact same experience.  This product needs to be pulled from shelves immediately!</li>
            <li> The WORST sunscreen ever. EVER. This doesn&#x27;t deaerve one star. It&#x27;s greasy like baby oil. And it attracts the sun like baby oil. It&#x27;s freaking terrible. How in the crap did this even pass testing and get packaging?!? It&#x27;s AWEFUL. Babyganics is where it is at!!!!</li>
            <li> It has worked for us but there are some limitations: 1) goes on greasy-- so probably better to apply outdoor (not right before getting in vehicles or near furniture), 2) husband said that since we started using it, he noticed an accumulation in swimming pool filter. So we&#x27;ll have to look at alternative when using swimming pool. Other than that, we haven&#x27;t noticed sunburn after using it.</li>
            <li> If you want this sunscreen head to Costco since it&#x27;s only $13 for this pack. However, I highly suggest to purchase a different brand unless you want a sunburn.  My daughter turns red within a hour of application when we&#x27;re out at the park.  At the beach I had to apply the sunscreen 6 times within the 2 hours we were there and she was still red!  Try thinkbaby it&#x27;s expensive but so worth it</li>
            <li> I like everything about it. I think people who hate it aren&#x27;t properly reapplying on dry skin as often as needed and are probably used to spraying on chemicals that last for a long time. Consider using something safer, and be ok with maybe having to reapply a couple times vs. What effect the chemicals have on your kids</li>
            <li> So I am super surprised to see the amount of negative reviews- I have been using this consistently, and always had good results. I never got a sunburn with it on, even after 6 hours in the sun, with reapplication.&lt;br /&gt;Also, even though it is zinc based, it doesn&#x27;t leave the white trail that so many sunscreen use, and it soaks in quite nicely, so I can use it on my bike commute to work, and not arrive looking like a ghost.</li>
            <li> super greasy. I have a really hard time rubbing this in. I got the two pack cheap at costco, but if I hadn&#x27;t sent one bottle to daycare and still had both I&#x27;d return it. I don&#x27;t have any trouble with sunburn but it&#x27;s not on my top 10 list for sure! Thinkbaby sunscreen is way better imo.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Costco not wanting to line the pocket of some&lt;br /&gt;Century but because it was at Costco and thought it was well vetted and tested this being carried at that wholesaler. I took my son and his friend fully lathered up in this sunblock and they both got so burnt they had blisters . Horrible and shame on the FDA for giving it the SOFbrating they did.</li>
            <li> I purchased mine from Costco. I HATE this sunscreen. It feels like I&#x27;ve put pure grease/oil on my face. Disgusting! Took it for a trip to Thailand and had to dump it because it just makes you feel yucky and sticky.. Like your face is sweating bullets. Bummed that I have another tube waiting for me at home when I get back. Zero stars</li>
            <li> I am a longtime user of mineral sunscreen, and this is the worst one I&#x27;ve ever used.  First, the product is extremely greasy and oily coming out of the package.  It almost seems like pure oil.  I suspect that it separates inside the bottle, and that might be why it doesn&#x27;t work well.  Because it definitely does not work--my very fair family all got lightly burned within 1 hour using this sunscreen at a non-water non-sweaty activity.  I&#x27;d say the protection it gives is approximately like a typical spf 5 &amp;#34;suntan lotion&amp;#34;.  Nothing like a SPF 30 block should be!  I&#x27;m thankful that we did a trial run at a short activity, because a day at the beach could have ended us up at the doctor if Honest Company was all we had to rely on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most mineral sunscreens have downsides, the most effective ones being very thick and leaving your whole skin with a whitish cast.  I think the happy medium for me is Mexitan spf 30.  perfect ingredient list, decent results, workably thin consistency so it doesn&#x27;t take all day to lotion up.  At first glance this seemed like a better deal, but both bottles are going in the trash.  I can pay twenty bucks for a huge 8 ounce bottle that lasts all summer if I know it will protect my family.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product negative stars I would. I am not sure how this product is even on the market since it does not do what it is meant for - protecting your skin from burning. I purchased this 2-pack from Costco in May and put it on my 2 1/2 year old daughter to protect her sensitive skin from the late May sun. I wanted a more natural product for my little one&#x27;s delicate skin and I thought that I had found a winner with this product. We were not out in the sun for very long (maybe an hour or 2) and it was during the morning hours, but my toddler still got burned using this sunscreen. This product should be pulled from the shelves - it gives parents a false sense of security.</li>
            <li> My husband, toddler, and I love this sunscreen. Unlike other mineral-based sunscreens, this one applies smoothly and without a white residue. It lasts really well after a liberal application!</li>
            <li> I try to be aware of and avoid &amp;#34;group think,&amp;#34; but it seems this product&#x27;s reviews here got to me. I bought a two-pack at Costco (before reading reviews) and was excited to be able to use this in the pool due to its non-toxic, all natural formulation. Zinc oxide is quite affective, but in the end I think what made this product &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; is its lower concentration of about 9% Z.O. versus 20% of other &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; products out there like Tom&#x27;s of Maine natural baby sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the one week I tried using this product, I did not get burned, but I&#x27;ve never burned easily in my life. I&#x27;m still susceptible to sunburn but I can go longer in the sun than most people. I swam 30 minutes at a time with my dog and the stuff seemed to stay on my skin. The scent is decent. The consistency is thick, so you can&#x27;t really rub it on like lotion. It really has to be coated on and it takes some effort to rub into your skin. It did not seem to come off in the water, and my skin was fine after. I also used this to do some yard work, but I was mostly covered up doing so (hat, long sleeves, gloves).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in the end, if you want a natural alternative without oxybenzones and other potentially harmful chemicals, look for other varieties of Zinc Oxide sunblocks--the best zinc oxide sunblocks come in 20% or higher concentrations. Good luck!</li>
            <li> this is the worst sunscreen ever. It smelled so badly right after I opened it. It&#x27;s also hard to apply on kids skin.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff and it did not work for me. It works for some people, but not every one gets the same results. However I support this company and what they stand for, and the majority of their products are perfect. Instead of storming to the Internet to bring bad press to an otherwise great company that literally functions to make safe and affordable products for people, maybe some of you should simply take your business elsewhere. It&#x27;s really that simple</li>
            <li> This is the WORST Sunscreen ever!!!  Our children are still dealing with the repercussions of having used this sunscreen according to directions.  We left the water park where we were early over 10 days ago because we could see our children were getting pink, and by the time we got home they had the worst sunburn (and first) sunburn of their lives.  Our children are 7 and 11 and fair skinned so we have always been religious about sunscreen.  Not only did we have to cut a special outing with old friends short, but my son&#x27;s face looked like he had 3rd degree burns and he spent the first week of our much anticipated summer vacation with it peeling and now scarring. I am praying the scarring is not permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this product ruined the first part of our vacation due to his pain and having to find places in Colorado to stay inside to avoid the sun to let him heal.  Despite my long held belief in using organic products and following the EWG recommendations I will never use this product again and would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for myself and my kiddos and wont use anything else. One of the top best sunscreens for the best protection. Please follow the directions on the bottle and re-apply more often than the directions say and use plenty for best protection!!!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/</li>
            <li> This does not work. I reaplied multiple times and my kids and I still got burned. Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> We have used this product a few times this summer and have reapplied throughout the day. Every time we have gotten sunburned. It doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> 17 years in Fl and using this product by accident gave me the worst burn ever. I thought I was using actual  sunscreen but came to find out it was an accelerant. Just use a mixture of Crisco and duck fat it will provide far better protection. Honestly this is the worst product I have ever come across. It should be required to list the SPF as -30.</li>
            <li> I used this on the last day of vacation after I had heard that it has caused sunburn in a few cases. Pretty sure that in every case of using this sunscreen you will burn. I had a pretty dark base tan and had been using tanning oil for the whole week leading up to the last day with no sunburn. I got fried using Honest Company sunscreen! Not just a little pink, fried! My skin is still sore 3 days later from the sunburn I got. Thank goodness my sister didn&#x27;t put it on her children! Total waste of money. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> This is the first review I have ever written but I feel like I have to because this stuff is scary. I&#x27;m just glad I used it on myself before putting it on my children. I had it on for one day at the beach and reapplied it several times. I am someone who almost never burns so I was really shocked to end the day with one of the worst burns of my life. I like their other products but I guess you need some dishonest chemicals in sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  Have tried the product on myself and my three year old daughter.  Most importantly, not effective at preventing sunburn, which both my daughter and I experienced after just a short time in the sun.  Tried the product on three separate occasions not thinking that the product could be the issue, but each time experienced far more sun damage than should have occurred considering the time of exposure.  On another note, the product is indeed very greasy.  Simply covering my daughters neck, forehead and ears with the sunscreen resulted in incredibly greasy hair.  Love the idea of the Honest Company, and bought the product based on name brand alone, but product really failed to meet my basic expectations of what a sunscreen should do.</li>
            <li> Very little to no protection. Would not recommend this product. California Baby is a great organic sunscreen option.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to see this product in a two pack for a reasonable price. The product kept my family from burns unlike many of these other reviewers, but we had to apply frequently. I greatly dislike the texture and consistency. It&#x27;s thick, greasy and takes a lot of rubbing effort to not remain white once applied. I also did not like the smell of the lotion at all. For those reasons, I will not be purchasing this again. I can buy Alba or Kiss My Face for a similar price and natural quality and I like them a lot better.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY this product!  It will burn your skin!  I used it under direct sun for only 30 minutes and my skin got very itchy.  I would have been better off without putting on this sunscreen.  I skin was unbearably itchy for 2 straight days, could not sleep the first night even after taking a Benadryl.</li>
            <li> I love Honest products, but this one is terrible. I bought 4 tubes of it for a trip to the beach with my family. Thankfully I put Badger on my kids, but my husband used Honest because it runs in so well. We were at the beach for 90 minutes and he got an awful burn. Dear Honest, please bring back your old formula. This one is terrible.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t protect your skin.</li>
            <li> The lousy reviews for this product do not surprise me at all. The cofounder, Jessica Alba, was smoking prior to the founding of this company in 2011. If this is a blatant hypocrisy then I don&#x27;t know what is. Claiming to operate a safe natural company and poisoning oneself with tobacco is a joke.</li>
            <li> We have been using this sunscreen for the last 2 years. We have never had a problem with it. The new sunscreen this year is a little more oily than previous years but still gave our family great protection.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my 2 year old all summer. It&#x27;s easy to apply, smells great and works wonderfully. I see all the negative comments and wonder what these people are doing to cause the burns. This is not like the chemical sunblocks that you apply and forget for half the day. Mineral blocks must be reapplied often, especially when you get wet and towel off.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works great from me and my 10 month old! We re-apply after every 60-90 mins depending on how much she is in and out of the water. We also dress her in a rash guard and keep her in the shade when we are playing on the beach. Sunscreen is not the only protection needed against the sun-- its very important to also be safe about sun exposure! I have seen tons of bad reviews... but it works perfectly for my family!</li>
            <li> Bought it and burned. Never again!</li>
            <li> My youngest is allergic to the sun and since I have started using this sunscreen he has stopped breaking out in a rash. All my kids use it while swimming and we have t had any issues. I have used all of their products for years after starting with their diapers.</li>
            <li> Burnt real badly, and only spent less than an hour is the sun.</li>
            <li> The new formula is awful! Yes, it no longer turns your skin white when you put it on, but the product is no longer effective. My fair skinned 2 and 4 year old are sunburned for the first time in their lives. I reapply sunscreen constantly (went through an entire tube in one afternoon), and still came home from a day at the beach with a sunburn. I couldn&#x27;t understand why my kids were so burned, since I applied lotion so frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year, we used the the Honest Company sunscreen for a trip to Hawaii and came home without any burns. Not sure why Honest would change the formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed in what used to be a trusted brand in our household.</li>
            <li> Love it! Best sunscreen I have ever tried! Don&#x27;t know where all the recent criticism is from. I&#x27;m guessing people didn&#x27;t apply it properly or use enough of it. I used this all summer for the first time and for the first time I never had to worry about my boys (10 ad 13 yrs old) getting burned. Didn&#x27;t even have to reapply much even when they spent hours in the sun! And we do spend a lot of time in the sun - we&#x27;re always outside. And it&#x27;s 100% safe! I checked it on EWG, the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep website, and it&#x27;s one of the greenest out there!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never burned this bad, ever. I feel like filing a lawsuit. I literally had at least 50 blisters with my sunburn after using this product. No joke. And I&#x27;m a guy, so my skin is tougher, yet this still managed to happen. Imagine, is like rubbing yourself with oil waiting to just deep fry in the sun. Literally. I feel really bad as a parent that I used this on my kids. Please do not buy this. By the way, that&#x27;s not regular peeling on the picture, those are my blisters that popped after the shower.</li>
            <li> Love this product! My niece was in the sun for hours and we reapplied about every hour. No burns!</li>
            <li> Used on my 3 year old…she sunburned.  Tried it again on another day, thinking I missed a spot, and she sunburned again.  On the same day, I applied to my 9 year old son for day camp, and he got badly sunburned on his neck and face.  This is a terrible and dangerous product.  It should not continue to be sold.  DO NOT USE.  On a side note, I just checked the Honest website and the sunscreen is currently listed as &amp;#34;Out of Stock&amp;#34;.  Hmmmm, interesting.</li>
            <li> Really greasy and gross feeling</li>
            <li> Sunburn Accelerant! I feel like filing a lawsuit against Honest. You don&#x27;t mess around with something this important. We applied this before going to the beach and reapplied at the beach after swimming. We all got burned, especially my daughter. I feel like a bad parent. I had a bottle of Neutrogena sunscreen spray but forgot to take it. The Honest sunscreen seemed to make my daughter burn even more than if she had no sunscreen at all.</li>
            <li> I usually buy California baby products but wanted to try honest company sunblocks as it came in a two pack for a better price. my preschooler has two outside play times in the morning and afternoon. I apply the sunblock in the morning and The teachers apply sunblock in the afternoon. He never had a problem with CA baby sunblock but after using honest brand he comes home sunburned. The cream itself is very oily, the oil and white substance is separated no matter how much you try to shake it. I tried doubling the amount but he still gets sunburned. I will stick to CA baby sunblock even with the higher cost.</li>
            <li> I applied this product 30 minutes before heading down to the beach.  It is very oily, but that did make it easy to spread.  While sitting on the beach I felt my upper legs starting to burn, so I reapplied multiple times.  I found that this product does NOT work.  My legs were horribly burnt.  My arms aren&#x27;t so bad because I covered them up with a towel.  I&#x27;m just thankful I had a hat on so my face isn&#x27;t burnt.  I guess I should have realized that something so oily was going to amplify the sun&#x27;s effects and not reduce them.  Please do not count on this product to provide sun protection for yourself or your family!  I am going to return it to Costco.</li>
            <li> Can I give this product a ZERO?  It is the WORST sunscreen I have ever used!  I grew up in Europe; sunbathing was a daily event during the summer and even I had my share of red shoulders and pink nose, but I can&#x27;t remember getting a severe sunburn after applying sunscreen.  Both my daughter and I were at the pool for 4 1/12 hours.  We applied sunscreen before we left the house, and then TWO more times. The skin on her shoulders is peeling off and I am fighting redness on every surface of my body: hands, legs, chest.  It is painful and scary and ugly.  I am very afraid of the sun, so I am not shy when slathering on sunscreen.  This product does not work at all, it offers no protection.  I thought I was being good by using a natural lotion but I&#x27;d rather get some chemicals in my systems by applying a cheap sunscreen, than dying of skin cancer.  I will try to return it to the whole sale store where I purchased it, and a huge complaint will go with it.</li>
            <li> My daughter is allergic to he chemicals used in most sunscreens. We have tried all of the main stream sunscreens and nothing has worked. She breaks out in blistering rashes from most sunscreens and others just leave red blotches. I saw this at Costco the other and grabbed it the price was right so why not try I. I applied it once before going outside for the first time this season we have no red blotches! We were outside in the mid day sun for about 4 hours with0ut any kind of color at all definitely no burns</li>
            <li> Bought into the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sunscreen idea, and decided to give this sunscreen a go. At the time of purchase it was at 3 stars, but lots of big name brands sit around 4 stars so I thought it might be alright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, one of the worst sunburns of my life. Applied liberally, let it dry, reapplied often, still burned badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read that &amp;#34;Honest CO&amp;#34; is pretty much passing the buck on this, and it really pisses me off. I&#x27;ll resort to the one thing that us as consumers can do to send a message, and that&#x27;s this review. Sure there are time&#x27;s people get sunburns because they don&#x27;t apply enough, or don&#x27;t reapply, but if this many people are saying that it&#x27;s not working with proper use, maybe there&#x27;s something to it? Will never buy this product again, and this experience will make me think twice about buying any other products from Honest as well.</li>
            <li> Works good for us.  Have used the past two summers on the whole family and no burns.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a local warehouse and will be returning it. I applied it to my children and after minimal sun-exposure, they are both sun-burned!! As others have stated, this &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; seems to act as an accelerant.</li>
            <li> Way too greasy to use on my face but great everywhere else. Smells funky. Too bad they havent made a scented version</li>
            <li> The WORST sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. Goes on thick like Vaseline and does not absorb. I reapplied 3 times over a 5 hour period and am left burnt like I never used anything at all. I usually don&#x27;t burn. Would not recommend this product. Returning it for a full refund.</li>
            <li> I want to see Jessica Alba use this on her kids. Why did the EWG gave this its highest rating? http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/about-the-sunscreens/617105/The_Honest_Company_Honest_Sunscreen_Lotion%2C_SPF_30/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson to be learned. Always read the ingredients (active and inactive). You know that there has to be something wrong when a sunscreen has more oils than it has protective ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen for my family.  It is the best closest all natural sunscreen I&#x27;ve found that works really well for all day play and water time!</li>
            <li> Same as many, bought this at Costco, to my regret. Super super greasy, shaking does not help, felt awful on my skin and didn&#x27;t rub in. And yes, I too ended up with a pretty nasty burn after a couple hours in the sun. I am pale but don&#x27;t usually burn that quickly or to that degree, even without sunscreen. Definitely something seriously wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I have an olive complexion and thus, have rarely ever burned.  I have been using this greasy product on myself and kiddos since the beginning of summer and could not figure out why we kept burning.  I talked to my holistic doc and she mentioned that any products containing essential citrus oils (lemon, orange, etc.) could be the cause, so I switched face lotion and deodorant, but continued to burn, even small amounts of sun exposure (i.e. getting my kids into the car and fastening seatbelts at a few different stores).  Ironically enough, I was burning in the places I had applied the sunblock, but nowhere else. Finally, my brother sent me this link and I read all of the horrible reviews about this product and how, in addition to staining your clothes, it causes people to burn.  I am absolutely disgusted at the damage I have done to my skin this summer, all while thinking I had been protecting it.  Shame on The &amp;#34;Honest&amp;#34; Company for not doing better research on their products, especially those designed for children!  They owe everyone an apology and a gift certificate towards other products if they hope to redeem themselves!  They are a billion dollar company and had better start doing damage control unless they want a class-action lawsuit brought against them.</li>
            <li> I bought this in a two pack thinking it was good for my sensitive skinned face. Wrong! It burned my cheeks and nose. One tube was all liquid while other was in solid form.</li>
            <li> Save yourself the time and money and do not buy this. I shook and shook it up and it still came out as pure grease. I wear sunblock on my face every day and thought something organic would be better. Wear something else. I can say it only works as a lip moisturizer.</li>
            <li> We live in a seaside town in New England and spend loads of time outdoors and at the beach. This sunscreen has been a great solution for us (especially for the kids) because it works well and lets us avoid worrisome chemicals. We don&#x27;t have to reapply multiple times as some reviewers said they have to, but we&#x27;ve learned long ago how not to get fried in the sun, and that includes not relying on any brand of sunscreen to provide full protection after one application if you&#x27;re swimming, sweating or active outdoors.</li>
            <li> Was previously a huge Honest Company fan but now I&#x27;m having my doubts. My husband used this sunscreen at the beach and ended up with a horrid sunburn. We aren&#x27;t idiots and know to apply sunscreen every 60-85 minutes and to apply it thick. This stuff doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL! The more you apply, the worse the burn. I prefer that my family use &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sunscreens but I will definitely do more research before buying just anything, even if it&#x27;s a great deal at Costco and from what I thought was a reputable company. This stuff needs to be taken off the market!</li>
            <li> I put so much of this on my pregnant body before going out to the beach today and got severely burned! I am a sunscreen queen and haven&#x27;t burned in 10 years!! I am incredibly angry. I applied this well and reapplied to my three young children and it&#x27;s as if I slathered them in baby oil. Thank God they had sun shirts on so they aren&#x27;t burned where the shirt was. I was even under a sun umbrella almost the entire few hours! So so mad at the damage to our skin. DO NOT BUY!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at Costco and it was a big waste of money.  It felt like I slabbed on Canola Oil, not to mention the sunburn that resulted all over my daughter&#x27;s face and shoulders.  She was only in the sun for 1 hour and didn&#x27;t even go swimming.  I used this product according to directions.  This sunscreen is terrible!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what these people are doing wrong, but this is some of the BEST sunscreen I have EVER used.  I have extremely fair skin and my mom can vouch for the fact that in the past, no matter which sunscreen I have used, I burn within 15 minutes of being in the sun.  With this brand, not only can I work outside for hours without burning, the coconut oil makes my skin feel so soft - not greasy like other suncreens!  This is the only sun protection I will ever use!</li>
            <li> I love this company but this is the worst sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used! My kids &amp; I were sunburned! We used as directed &amp; made sure to reapply... and still burned. We have very tan skin so usually just brown in the sun... seems like this sunscreen contains an ingredient that accelerates sunburn on skin. Beware!! :(</li>
            <li> Holy mother of all burns.No frickin way is this SPF 30. I&#x27;m Mediterranean and use SPF 30 all the time and show zippy while golfing. Used this piece of garbage sunscreen. What a frickin mistake.Never again. Told the wife to never bring another Honest Company product into our house it was that bad. What a full blown scam. Mean time my skin is starting to peel from the burn.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this sunscreen, as it was more affordable than some of the other non-nano zinc sunscreens I have tried.  Unfortunately, the other reviews are spot-on...I honestly believe this sunscreen accelerated my sunburn instead of prohibiting it.  It is also extremely greasy.  I am just thankful that I tried it on myself before applying it on my two kids.</li>
            <li> As someone with EXTREMELY pale skin, I reapply every hour, or whenever I feel like My skin is burning (usually less than an hour!) I&#x27;ve used everything from Hawaiian Tropic, Bull Frog, stuff I bought at Sephora to this stuff... YOU NEED TO REAPPLY!!! I&#x27;m Sick of, \\&quot;this works this! This doesn&#x27;t!\\&quot; The sun doesn&#x27;t care what you use, watch your or your kids skin. Everyone is different, nothing is a miracle cure. Stop blaming media bulls*** for your mediocrity&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product zero stars I would. I purchased this thinking that it would be a great alternative to the more expensive brand I usually purchase. I liked that it does not contain the toxic chemicals that so many sunscreens do. However, this simply does not work!! I used this last week on my 6 month old. We weren&#x27;t in the sun for long and she was under a blanket most of the time because it was a chilly afternoon at the beach. When we got in the car I noticed her arms were red. I had used this sunscreen all over her arms and legs.  I returned the product and today there have been numerous news articles regarding other consumers who have had the same issue with this product. The Honest Company apparently changed their formula so that it only contains 9% zinc oxide while most sunscreens contain 18-25%. Save yourself or your little ones a sunburn and pass on this one!!  This is the second product of theirs that I have been less than impressed with. Will not be purchasing anything from the &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; company again!</li>
            <li> Try the spray and stick instead. They cover better and are a little more fool-proof. We use the spray and stick frequently and have never had any burning, and we are all extremely fair skinned. I don&#x27;t particularly like the lotion because it is difficult to rub in, especially on squirmy kids, and you can&#x27;t be sure that you&#x27;ve shaken it up well enough, but I&#x27;ve heard that they&#x27;ve improved that product. The spray works so well that I never bothered to re-order the lotion. Since you can&#x27;t spray the kids in the face, or shouldn&#x27;t anyway, the stick works a little better than trying to spray your hands and rub their faces. Keep in mind that this is only SPF 30 and not bullet-proof. Use as directed and reapply, and always, no matter what sun protection you use, limit time in direct sun! We subscribe to Honest Co&#x27;s bundles and we&#x27;ve had a great experience with nearly every product we&#x27;ve tried and have been able to return a couple of products that didn&#x27;t work for us with no problem. I felt compelled to write a less than scathing review based on their commitment to customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I really hate to give such a poor review, because I love the Honest Company and use a ton of their products. This one needs to be reformulated. I was looking for a mineral based sunscreen for my small kids. This is very greasy, but I could live with that. However, after shaking, applying liberally, and reapplying an hour and a half later, I was horribly burned. I wasn&#x27;t swimming or sweating profusely, just walking around. I did everything right, and this did not work at all. There are some five star reviews defending the Honest Company, saying that all of us who got burned must have been doing something wrong. They are a great company, and I really do love most of their products. Their sunscreen doesn&#x27;t work though, and people should know that. Using sunscreen that works is important.</li>
            <li> I am redheaded and fair skinned, my wife is blond and fair skinned, and obviously are children are light haired and fair skinned.  We have dealt with sunscreen for years since we can literally get a sunburn in less than 15 minutes.  We usually reapply before the listed time just to be safe and we know how to apply it.  I have used many different brands and types of sunscreen over the years and not gotten burned (so this is not user error).  This sunscreen is quite possibly the worst stuff I ever used.  I thought it applied nicely and almost seemed to warm to body temperature very quickly, which the kids appreciated since it wasn&#x27;t  &amp;#34;cold.&amp;#34;  However, we burned like bacon when we wore this stuff. I am not sure what formulation changes they made, but they need to fix it.  I am not sure who tested this product or if the test batches were rigged, but as a long time user and a person who is dependent on sunscreen, I can tell you this doesn&#x27;t screen you from anything.  I wish I had taken photos of the burns so that I could share them.  Luckily we found this out in Iowa and before we took our Florida Vacation.  NOT IMPRESSED!!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible. Day 1 of 2 week maui vacation we used this and got really bad sun burns after less than 1.5 hours. Put a damper on our vacation for sure. And it wasn&#x27;t just kid skin it was my already tan skin too. Do not use Honest really needs to take it off the market.</li>
            <li> Bought at Costco,not Amazon. Do not buy this product unless you are a masochist. Remember using a magnifying glass to burn ants as a kid? This is like rubbing magnifying glass all over you, and you&#x27;re an ant. You will fry.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen does not work! Makes me wonder about other honest products, and the lowering of effective ingredients in those products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zero stars wasn&#x27;t an option!!!</li>
            <li> I too am surprised by so many negative reviews. This is the best sunscreen we have tried! It has a great consistency and goes on smooth and rubs in easily unlike a lot of the other natural sunscreens we have tried. We have used it all summer and there have been no burns where it was applied. In fact I know it works because just yesterday my son had it applied while playing outside, he took his shirt off which was unexpected by me so I had not applied any under his shirt, well he only got burnt where I had not applied the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really sad that you put your trust in an &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; company but the expensive product you buy because you want safer and better products for you and your family actually do the opposite and give you and your family the worst sunburn of your life!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star. I bought this at Costco because it was one of two lotion based options. Now I wished I would have read the reviews. This stuff is awful. The first time I used it on my kids, both were burned. I thought maybe I hadn&#x27;t put enough on. The second time it happened again, even after multiple applications. I was burned even after I slathered a thick layer on. It seemed to intensify the burn. It was as though I had put oil on. Absolutely ridiculous to be selling this as sunblock.</li>
            <li> I applied as directed and burned so badly I peeled, and I rarely ever get sunburned.  I gave it a second shot and burned again, then threw away the rest of the tube.  I&#x27;m just glad it was me who used it first and not my kids.</li>
            <li> I love this sunblock. It does not have that awful smell that most have. I have been using it all summer at the beach, in pools, and outside. I use it on myself and my daughter who is 10 months old. We have never once burned from it. I reapply every hour -two hours (depending on when I remember). It works well. We are both super fair skinned and urn easily. Like real easily.</li>
            <li> I bought the SPF 30 two-pack at Costco after running out of our standard Coppertone sunscreen. Husband and I liberally applied this product and reapplied once during a four hour snorkel in Hawaii. Both of our backs were burnt to a crisp. Neither of us has ever had a sunburn like this after using as much sunscreen as we did. I wish I had read the reviews before buying this product. As the other reviews state, it is also extremely greasy and leaves a white residue on the skin. Horrible product.</li>
            <li> Please do NOT buy this product.  Horrible, horrible, horrible.  I am near tears...my whole family is burnt to a crisp after using this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I used this sunscreen on myself and my two children.  I applied it to both of my kids three times during our four hour outdoor pool time.  THEY BOTH GOT BLISTERED and I got very badly burned!  The tube claims it is waterproof for up to 80 minutes.  Do the math - TOTAL LIE!  I bought this at a warehouse in a two pack because it seemed like a good buy.  Worst buy ever!  My kids had never been burned until this happened, much less blistered until we used this sunscreen.  I will definitely be going back to our tried and true Banana Boat Natural Reflect.</li>
            <li> Horrible. DO NOT BUY!!! I know this brand is generally pretty reputable, but this product does more bad then good.  I used this on my 4 year old and reapplied, my poor little guy got fried. If you want a good organic sun screen try the Coola brand.  Very unhappy consumer.</li>
            <li> Please read these reviews before you consider buying it.  It is obviously not working!  I read the reviews unfortunately after experience.  My legs on a bike ride looked worse than not putting on sunscreen!  They should rather try again</li>
            <li> The ONLY sunscreen that protected me from photosensitivity reaction after trying MANY others, much more expensive. Yes, a bit greasy, yes, apply a bit more often. But if you have sun and other skin allergy issues, give it a try.</li>
            <li> Found like many others that this seemed to increase burn rate.  Used on 8, 10, and 42 year old.  Reapplied often, followed directions.  Very poor protection.</li>
            <li> I dont know what everyone is complaining about. I bought this at Costco and was weary after reading some reviews on here. My son is 14 months old and we went to the beach twice this weekend and I applied it to myself and him about 4x during the hours of 10-3pm. He played in the sand, water and neither of us got burned at all. I actually prefer the texture since its easy to spread on a not so cooperative baby who&#x27;s always on the move.  Yes it is greasy, but I also have Babo and that stuff is IMPOSSIBLE to spread! I much rather use this sunscreen.  I dont think I will bring this on our trip to the Dominican Republic b/c I will need a lot for a 7 day trip, but it works just fine for our all day beach trips in CT.</li>
            <li> My toddler and I spent the afternoon outside. After diligently applying this &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34;, both of us are sporting a sunburn. I have always used ThinkBaby, but decided to give Honest a try. Huge mistake. A one star rating is too kind in my book, but zero isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li> Bought this at Costco for my child who breaks out from every summer screen we have ever tried.  He didn&#x27;t break out from this one, but it gave him absolutely NO sun protection!  I applied 3 times in 4 hours, and he (as well as 2 of my other kids) ended the day slathered in aloe because of their burns.  They never burn...this is an accelerant!  Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Formula has changed! This is not the Honest Sunscreen from years prior. Disappointed with the quality. My kids are still getting pink after several applications.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works very well for us. Six June days in Florida at the theme parks including 3 days on the beach and not a single burn on the 4 of us. Several more outings at home in Denver and the same results. All the bad reviews had me skeptical so I made sure to pay attention to how it worked, how much we applied etc. I have to say I&#x27;m very happy with this. Seems to work as well as the Blue Lizard we have used in the past, but no nearly as thick and easier to rub in. I do make sure to kneed the tube before we use it, especially if it&#x27;s new otherwise it is very thick. Liked it so much I bought two more tubes. I&#x27;m sure there is something to do with personal &#x27;chemistry&#x27; pH or similar things that can have an effect on how well sunscreens can work. Use some common sense and test it before you trust your whole family with it during a full day in the sun!</li>
            <li> Whenever I see a sign for a &amp;#34;huge garage sale&amp;#34;, I know that it is probably not worth visitng.  Whenever I see the signs for a &amp;#34;going out of business sale&amp;#34; and all the hype that goes with it, I also steer clear.  Though would would have thought that a company that names itself &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; might not be that honest after all?  I was under the impression that The Honest Company was a wonderful company to go to for baby products.  I admit I chose this sunscreen because of the company&#x27;s supposed reputation.  The first time I used it on my daughter, we went for a short walk before her doctor&#x27;s appointment.  While in the waiting room, I was thinking her skin looked really red but how could she be burnt when I put this sunscreen on her...  I thought it was just because of the heat.  The doctor, when giving her her checkup, remarked that she noticed she had sun exposure.  Boy, did I feel like a terrible mom!  Not thinking it was the sunscreen I tried it again.  My husband and I took her for a walk and again, she looked as if she got a terrible sunburn from the little time we were out.  This sunscreen does not work!!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Honest Company products, but this sunscreen just doesn&#x27;t work. I reapplied and reapplied and reapplied and I STILL got sunburned. Hands down, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> I Bought honest sunscreen at Costco for my 9 month old baby. The sunscreen did not work.  It was like I put nothing on her. She was completely burn (very red) and broke out in a rash. The rash did go away for the most part the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied on her first then applied Neutrogena beach defense on my other kids ( who did not burn at all). Then spent about an hour and half at the pool when  we noticed that the baby&#x27;s skin was feeling very hot and had a few red bumps. Long story short she ended up burning very bad.---I  won&#x27;t  buy this again it was like I put nothing on her at all. 😡</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see all the negative reviews on here.  I so wanted to love this stuff.  Who cares if it is all natural if it doesn&#x27;t work?  I took my son and his friend to the waterpark.  We applied and reapplied this throughout the day.  We all got severely sunburnt.  My friend borrowed a bottle and got sunburnt as well.  The best bet is having the kids wear swim shirts and using regular sunscreen for arms, faces, and necks.</li>
            <li> I really wish I had read the reviews before buying this at Costco. I took my boys (3 years old and 18 months old) to the beach today and used this sunscreen on them as well as myself. We applied it 15 minutes before going in the sun and then reapplied it 2 additional times while out at the beach. We were only there for 4 hours and we are all burnt! My 3 year old didn&#x27;t even go in the water so it wasn&#x27;t like he was washing it off. I was willing to overlook the greasiness for a good quality, natural product but not if it just plain doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> Ok- I saw a headline on yahoo regarding how this sunscreen isn&#x27;t great so I decided to post my review. I along with many bough this at Costco at half the price on amazon. My husband is Irish and fair skinned!! He burns walking in front of a window! So- I read the complaints this morning sent him a text on how he likes it and he said works good just greasy which sucks when you looked like you oiled up before you golf- but he said it&#x27;s fine for the pool. We we at a water park for 4 hours in the Midwest when it was 97 degrees and the water even felt like a hot tub. My husband, 3 year old, and I lathered it on and never reapplied because we were too lazy and all that my husband got was a slight burn on the back of his shoulders. He&#x27;s had way worse and we never reapplied. I see a lot of the photos of the sunburns and they are shoulder and back and I feel it comes down to lack of reapplication and not putting enough on. We used almost a whole tube of this just the 3 of us when we went and we are all slim people. You have to &amp;#34;liberally&amp;#34; apply and evenly. You should look like a greasy monster then your done. The greasy look goes away. Some people might not like that but it&#x27;s an all natural sunscreen. I bought it because I checked out EWG skin deep website on sunscreen and SOOO many have high risk chemicals in them- so this might not be the most appealing but it works and unless your setting a timer on your watch and am having someone put it on your shoulders and back every 80min you really shouldnt diss this so bad. You can&#x27;t put sunscreen on your back by yourself!! I like this stuff. I take my son to our local zoo several times a month and we lather in this and never get a burn. I have to put bronzer on my face just to look like I have color on it. You have be liberal about applying I mean a big glob just for your arm. I thinks it&#x27;s one of the more affordable products on the market . I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Honest Co suncare products. My family uses all 3 kinds. We&#x27;ve been using these products since my now 2.5yr old was born. The directions say to SHAKE the bottle first. This may explain why some people are having an issue with the contents separating. This is also a mineral based SUNBLOCK not like traditional sunscreen most of us grew up with. The sunblock sits on top of your skin and does not absorb into your bloodstream the way sunscreen does. You have to reapply it within the time frame the bottle tells you. 80 min MAX water resistance. We find that it works best if you pat dry, sit in the shade for snack time after reapplying, and then go back in the water. As with any other sun protection product, it works best combined with UV protective swimwear/hats, and sunglasses, as well as avoiding being directly in the sun during the strongest times of the day.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T PURCHASE THIS YOU WILL BURN AND Itch! This product discolors your skin weeks later! Their company does not care and say&#x27;s it&#x27;s such a small percentage who it does not work for that it does not matter! That was their statement this morning on the news! Shame on you Alba! This should have been tested! It ruined our vacation!!!!!!! We will never use any of this companies products again! Everyone in my family and friends are going to hear about this!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Honest brand sunscreen for almost two years and it has worked excellent &amp; when I say that, I mean excellent for any sunscreen not just natural sunscreens.  I have had skin cancer &amp; so I need a product that works &amp; has much safer ingredients than then other chemical based sunscreens.  I have used both the old formula &amp; recently have been using the new formula purchased at Costco with the same excellent results.  This past weekend I applied the new formula to my 3yr old son &amp; he was in &amp; out of the water for 2-3 hours without any redness.  I applied to myself &amp; I was out in the sun for 3-4 hours with no redness.  I wanted to give my review so people will not be scared away from using this product by recent bad reviews on the Today Show.  Having watched parents not properly apply sunscreen over &amp; over again, it is my guess that that there is a very good chance that it was “user error” , not applying enough or not applying it soon enough (30 min before sun exposure) are the two most common errors I have witnessed.  Another failure could be product separation which can be fixed by kneading the tube to mix it.  If this product can protect a 45 year old bald surfer with pale skin, then it should be fine for everyone, just remember to read the directions when applying.</li>
            <li> Major disappointment.  My husband and I went to Mexico and I brought Honest Company Sunscreen for myself while he stuck to his usual store brand.  What a HUGE mistake.  I got FRIED.  My sunburn was horrible and I reapplied frequently and more often than my husband did.  His generic store brand sunscreen worked amazingly well.  FYI- his was a 15 SPF and mine was a 30 SPF.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this stuff to anyone.  It also felt really greasy going on and since we were on a beach it practically attracted sand.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff sucks.</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t get burned from using it, but my family is pretty dark skinned. However we stil try to use sunscreen and it is soo greasy. Pour olive oil on your hands and that is what it feels like. Blah...no wonder it was deeply discounted when I bought it. I hate to waste anything but we will be throwing this out.</li>
            <li> Great price at Costco ($13 for two) it goes on smooth and easy. It&#x27;s pretty oily so washes off easily and needs to be reapplied often but it worked great on all my fair skinned kids and hubby and didn&#x27;t cause any rashes on my two with super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but felt the urge to do so with all the negative reviews. I just used this sunscreen yesterday while paddle boarding for 2.5 hours in the harsh Denver sun from 11:30 to 2:00. It did a perfect job of protecting my skin and I did not get any sun damage. As with any sunscreen, whether it says water resistant or not, it is important to apply before you get in the water and after. With that being said, I actually only applied it about an hour before I went paddle boarding. I did get in the water quite a bit and it never washed off. It did a good job of protecting me.</li>
            <li> Scarlet. Crimson. Cardinal. Poppy. Whatever your preferred shade of red, this &#x27;sunscreen,&#x27; can help you achieve it. Not getting red enough with just your regular sun exposure? Do you wish you could attain the gorgeous, lustrous skin tone of a lobster? Honest sunscreen can help you achieve these complexion goals! You&#x27;ll experience the scorching fun of skin tender and hot to the touch! You&#x27;ll have the pleasure of being moved to tears each time you have to lift your arms to remove your shirt! And once this stage passes, you&#x27;ll delight in the shedding of layers of damaged skin in sheets of crusty fun! Enjoy family togetherness as your loved ones gather around and gleefully tug at your decaying skin as you molt like a majestic, ruby-colored Python. Remember wearing various oils to the poolside to amplify sun exposure? Well now you can pay considerably more for comparable sun &#x27;protection,&#x27; and walk away from every beach outing with the gratification that you have inflicted upon yourself and your loved ones the pain that only seered skin can provide. Two charred thumbs down for this awful product.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, this is the worst suncreen I have ever encountered. I sold sunscreen at a surf shop for a few years so I know what works and what doesn&#x27;t as a seller. This stuff will leave you burned and offers little to no protection. If you want skin cancer, buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think of it like this, this product is the Carrot Top of sunscreen lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the Donald Trump of sunscreen lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the Hasbro Gummi Bears of sunscreen lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the Meek Mill of sunscreen lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the ICP of sunscreen lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the Uwe Boll of sunscreen lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the Hayden Christenson of sunscreen lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is Jar Jar Binks&#x27; semen after masturbating to an ICP album while watching House of the Dead by Uwe Boll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a lying patient of the TV show House, M.D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is Chernobyl to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is in fact, the ball sweat of John Goodman, not butter for popcorn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is dishonest about its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Fiance brought this &amp;#34;sun protection&amp;#34; on our hike this past weekend.  It is the equivalent of mayonnaise and appears to have intensified the sun (see pic).  This is three days later and is extremely painful.  Save your money - honestly.</li>
            <li> All sunscreens have to be applied more often if your&#x27;re in the sun.  Mineral sunscreens are always the best and any product with the high of a quality is a better bet.  All other sunscreens not rated well on the EWG will cause you cancer, not the sun.  You are typically more likely to get cancer from products with toxic chemicals rather than the sun itself.  This product does not use harsh chemicals and will be more beneficial.  I would much rather have a sun burn from the sun rather than cancer from the other harsh products out there, especially the spray suncscreens that are rated the worst.</li>
            <li> Have been using it on my son all summer and never have had issues. I apply it before we get to the beach, when we get there and about 1-2hrs after. He also has sun protective clothing on him  his arms, legs, and face are exposed and has never been sunburned</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an honest customer for years and have loved the products.  I even like the previously formulation of the honest sunscreen.  Yes, it was white and thick but it worked.  I used the new formula this week and for the first time ever my son got a sunburn.  He has a blister on his nose.  This sunscreen does not work.  Upon further research, honest reduced the amount of zinc from 20% to 9% which appears to explain why it doesn&#x27;t work.  It would have been nice to have received notice that the zinc was being reduced so drastically.  Don&#x27;t use this--you&#x27;ll waste money and feel horrible when your kid gets burned.</li>
            <li> I love this brand but they need to own up to their sunscreen being ineffective. And God help you if you try and advise their customer service about your concern. Instead of considering that maybe something compromised the effectiveness of their product, they spit out some nonsense about how it&#x27;s safe according to tests. We are diligent about sunscreen and started burning after switching to this product. The only difference is we put Babyganics on our daughter the last time and she was finally not burning. Mommy and daddy burned that day. Boo! Be HONEST, your sunscreen has issues.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this sunscreen from Amazon, but I will in the future. I have read the negative reviews and don&#x27;t understand why people are so unhappy with this product. I live in Florida and go to water aerobics three times a week in the hot sun. Believe me, this sunscreen protected my skin better than any other I have used. I will definitely buy it again.  And it is not greasy. Maybe people that complain about that are slathering themselves with it. I don&#x27;t understand the negativeness.</li>
            <li> Wish I had read all these comments on this page before purchase our 2 tubes from costco a few weeks ago. We are totally disappointed with this sunscreen. Totally crap. Claims it is water resistant and non greasy. Totally opposite. The sunscreen came off fast once we sweated. Super greasy. If this is non greasy.. I don&#x27;t know what greasy is. My face and my husband&#x27;s bald head shined to a point people looked at us.The sunscreen is dripping along with the sweat. My husband&#x27;s bald head now have about appox.7 pimples since we used this product. Absolutely not SPF 30. as we got so tanned.</li>
            <li> I feel so stupid. I&#x27;ve been using this for my children and myself since April and I just realized this doesn&#x27;t work! At all.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty upset that all those applications(3 faces for 60 days) and struggles to cleanse that grease away (Yes, very greasy) were all waste.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this in a 2 tube pack from Costco because he knows I prefer to use products with more natural ingredients and I couldn&#x27;t find the sunscreen I normally use. I used this for 4 hours of an afternoon in in the sun on a 75 degree day. It was a greasy sunscreen and I burned on both arms which is the only place I applied it. It has been years since I&#x27;ve had any sunburn. I have vitiligo and can&#x27;t afford to take risks with my skin in the sun. Not feeling too happy tonight. Will be returning this and have already ordered a tube of the MyChelle brand which has worked well in the past. http://www.amazon.com/MyChelle-Sunshield-SPF-2-3-Ounces-Coconut/dp/B003VPK4M0/ref&#x3D;sr_1_6?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1435035849&amp;sr&#x3D;8-6&amp;keywords&#x3D;mychelle</li>
            <li> We bought the double pack and took it to the beach.  I am religious about applying proper amounts so I applied generous amounts.  It is very greasy and sticky and less than an hour in the sun and not only did I have a sunburn but have broken out in a red, bumpy, and itchy rash where sunscreen was applied and still have the rash two days later.  Wish I had read reviews first.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  Greasy and still got burned!</li>
            <li> Great product! Never have issues as long as we reapply often.</li>
            <li> My mom bought this at Costco for my 1 year old niece because you couldn&#x27;t beat the price!  The EWG ratings were stellar.  I was ready to purchase some for myself until we noticed that my niece&#x27;s arms were getting darker and darker.  She has olive skin that doesn&#x27;t burn.  So thankfully she&#x27;s not burning, but we all know that damage is still being done.  Then I read the reviews here and saw the pictures.  I&#x27;m so sad that so many people are getting fried.  I know that the majority of people don&#x27;t use enough sunscreen to begin with or reapply within appropriate time frames, but even if you take a lack of common sense into account, these reviews are still very telling.  I see that people have written the company and haven&#x27;t received good responses.  If you got it at Costco, take that stuff back!  Costco is very picky about the products they sell and if enough people bring it back, they&#x27;ll stop selling that crap.  I&#x27;ve written EWG about this and hopefully they&#x27;ll look into their rating.  The lessons I&#x27;ve learned from these reviews are don&#x27;t try out a new sunscreen on a beach day and even if EWG gave it amazing reviews, cross check it with the general public reviews.</li>
            <li> We love this sunscreen. We live in FL and have used it for months out at the pool and at the beach. I use it, my husband uses it, and we use it on our 1.5 year old ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate seeing all the bad reviews. I feel like maybe people just don&#x27;t know to apply before you go outside (not once you are out there) and to re-apply often.</li>
            <li> I used this over the weekend while lounging on our boat.  It was 90 degrees and sunny.  I applied sunscreen before leaving the house and two more times over a 6-hour period.  It protected me perfectly, and I had no problem with it being too greasy.  It felt good going on, moisturizing.  I bought mine at Costco, ​and it expires 05/17.  Maybe I got a good batch???</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this sunscreen is getting such a bad rap. Yes, it&#x27;s a tad greasy, but that&#x27;s what helps it blend in so well, and doesn&#x27;t leave me or my daughter white and pasty. Like any other sunscreen, it must be reapplied every 80 minutes or sooner. I am guessing the people that got burned wearing this didn&#x27;t reapply as needed. Sunscreen is not the only answer to sun protection, people..hats, clothing, shade and limiting time in the sun all work together WITH the sunscreen. I love this stuff and was super bummed when I couldn&#x27;t find it at costco today.</li>
            <li> You are better off going old school and slathering yourself with baby oil. Sun protection is non-existent. My advice is to avoid at all costs. I bought because the Environmental Working Group recommended and said my old brand Neutrogena contained v. bad ingredients. My 13-yearold daughter does a junior lifeguard program that involves hours at the beach in L.A. Sunscreen is very important. She wore this, applied before she left - copiously - and reapplied during the day and still came home a crispy sunburnt critter. DOES NOT WORK. Bought at Costco and am going to recommend that they stop carrying it.</li>
            <li> we bought this two pack at costco and it didn&#x27;t work at all. My husbands hands where so burned he had to go to the DR twice.</li>
            <li> I brought this to the beach and had my kids and my sister and her family use it. Worst mistake I could have made they all got burnt and burnt badly, and they did reapply as directed. We were only there 2 hours, and some who used it never even went in the water and still got burnt. HORRIBLE STUFF!!!!!! EWG needs to take this off the list.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Our entire family spends all day out in the boat in 100 degree weather.  OBVIOUSLY (like any sunscreen) you need to reapply if you want protection for 8+ hours.  Goes on smooth with NO residue! And moisturises well too.  This is by far the best natural sunscreen I have found!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand all the bad reviews. Is it greasy: yes, and so are all other zinc sunblock I have used. Does it leave you white: yes, and so are all the other sunblocks I have used. As for it intensifying the sun, how about a little common sense? If you apply it according to directions it works, and if you notice you are getting red why don&#x27;t you reapply and get some shade for a while? The product can&#x27;t cure people from being stupid.</li>
            <li> My family of four has used this sunscreen all summer with no problems. We live near the beach so we spend plenty of time in the sun and water. We also frequent the pool and again we&#x27;ve never had any problems. I always apply it liberally and re-apply as directed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy or use this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would give is 0 stars if I could. This product is completely ineffective. I used it as directed and applied it liberally, because I&#x27;m a little on the fair side. Sat at the beach for 2 hours, applied it twice and got what I&#x27;m pretty sure is a second degree, maybe worse, sunburn on my chest and the sides of my breasts. Soooo painful. A week later it has almost healed to the point that it doesn&#x27;t hurt, but it is still quite pink/red. I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s worse, the &amp;#34;toxic&amp;#34; old-school sunscreens or a severe sunburn. Trust me, I&#x27;m not someone who is looking to place blame unnecessarily, I gave this product a fair chance, used it as direct and suffered for it. Please don&#x27;t use it on your children, I&#x27;d hate to see the pain they would be in from such a severe burn.</li>
            <li> Applied this generously, and twice, each of the 2 days we spent at the beach. All my kids still got very burned.  I&#x27;d say zero sunburn protection if you&#x27;ll be in the sun all day. I thought I was splurging on a high quality, safer sunscreen, and it ended up ruining the rest of our vacation. My kids were miserable.</li>
            <li> Sunburn for myself and my 3 kids.  Never use this product.</li>
            <li> Increase sunburns!! Warning!!!!</li>
            <li> Can I submit zero stars?  I ruined a black bathing suit with permanent white stains that wouldn&#x27;t hand wash out of my expensive new Land&#x27;s End bathing suit.  This was the greasiest lotion my husband and I ever used, so we only applied it once - the first and only time.  On my hands, they were too greasy to pick up a book and read .  Wish that you and Costco tested this before selling it - lots of disappointed customers and one unscrupulous company.  I feel badly for all those children who got burned by this ineffective grease that calls itself an &amp;#34;Honest Sunscreen Lotion&amp;#34;.  The nerve!.  From now on I am using Coppertone Waterbabies, highly recommended by Consumer Reports and affordable.</li>
            <li> If anyone would bother to research on how sunscreen actually works, you wouldn&#x27;t buy this product.  This is what the honest writes on their website about the ingredients in the product.    Naturally derived, unscented, broad-spectrum (UVA and UVB) SPF mineral sunscreen - everything you need, nothing you don&#x27;t   Easy to apply, non-greasy, non-whitening (non-nano!) zinc oxide sunscreen provides safe, effective sun protection for the entire family   Zinc oxide is the ONLY active sunscreen ingredient - NO synthetic chemical sunscreens   Water resistant - tested effective for up to 80 minutes   Shake well before use!   Hypoallergenic • Non-Nano • Mineral-Based • Biodegradable • Reef-Friendly • Water Resistant (80 minutes) • pH Balanced  Now did you see that the only Active ingredient is Zinc Oxide?  Zinc oxide protects against UVA. UVA is the longer wave light (ultraviolet light) that penetrates deeper into the skin. What about the UVB light?  the uvb light is whats giving you the burn!  now compare the product to the others with the chemicals in it that protect you from all and are a true broad spectrum sunscreen protecting you from UVB and UVA. what would you do?  id rather have the proper stuff on for a few hours than burn my skin. you&#x27;re are essentially applying an assortment of oils to you skin with the Honest product Remember the day of applying baby oil?  just reading the Ingredients on the Honest product raises red flags period!</li>
            <li> Worst sunscreen. Got burned color of lobster.</li>
            <li> I feel like I don&#x27;t eve need to bother writing this after so many other bad reviews, but just want to reiterate how terrible this stuff is. Impossible to rub in, greasy, sits on top of the skin, and worst of all, does NOTHING to protect you from the sun. We made the mistake of using this on our daughter and luckily noticed her burning within 15 minutes of being outside so managed to get her out of the sun quickly. If we hadn&#x27;t, I dread to think what she would have looked like after 30 minutes or more. We threw this in the trash the second we got home. What a total waste of money, but worse still, a complete health hazard. The company should be ashamed.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this junk! Like others, we experienced significant sunburns after using it. Why is there not an option to give a zero, instead of 1-5 stars?</li>
            <li> one of the best on the market. does not have any of the harmful chemicals that other brands have. we use this all the time for the kids and us at the pool as well as at the beach</li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviewers, I bought this at one of the warehouse stores, and suffered a bad sunburn despite several applications to my face and shoulders. I like the consistency and smell, but it seems like this product provides almost no sun protection. Did they underdose the zinc? Who knows. I will be returning this item.</li>
            <li> Just horrible. Does not work at all!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Honest Company&amp;#34;? Honestly, this sunscreen sucks! I just slathered it all over my skin (even waited 15 minutes before going outside). I went for a walk around mid-day (71&#x27; sunny day) and was outside for only 30 minutes. I BURNED. My nose is totally red. My shoulders burned lightly, and the rest of my body tanned as if I was wearing no sunscreen at all.&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen is VERY GREASY, and it DOESN&amp;#34;T WORK AT ALL! I&#x27;m really upset because I have been trying so hard to take care of my skin, and thanks to this crap product, it burned much faster than it would have with no sunscreen at all. It&#x27;s probably all that grease. The product feels like Crisco with baby powder in it.&lt;br /&gt;I normally stay out twice as long with Paula&#x27;s Choice spf 50 with no problem. I wanted to give this product a fair trial, so I really layered it on super thick. I was as slippery as an eel. I mean, this stuff is greasy like petroleum jelly. As soon as I got home, I washed it off because I knew it would clog my pores if I left it on longer. It feels so hot and sticky and gets all over everything. It&#x27;s disgusting. It took a long time to wash off with soap, hot water, a wash cloth, and a lot of scrubbing. I can&#x27;t imagine wearing it for more than 30 minutes. I already felt like I had been deep fried after 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;This is the worst sunscreen I have ever tried. I wanted something free of harmful chemicals, but if I have to greece myself up like a pig and it still doesn&#x27;t work, even for 30 freaking minutes, what&#x27;s the point? I bought this at Costco on a day when I forgot my sunscreen. I will be returning it and make sure never to leave home without my trusty brand.</li>
            <li> THIS WILL INCREASE YOUR SUNBURN BY 200%. I HAVE NEVER BURNT THIS BAD IN MY LIFE, THIS IS NOT A JOKE THE PEOPLE HERE VENTING ARE TELLING THE TRUTH. I WISH I WOULD HAVE READ THIS BEFORE I PUT IT ON MY ENTIRE FAMILY.</li>
