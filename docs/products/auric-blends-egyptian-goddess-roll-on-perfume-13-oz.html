            <li>My best friend fell in love with it and asks for it for her birthday every year.</li>
            <li>My body chemistry seems to blend better with musky aromatics so this is the perfect fragrance for me.</li>
            <li>It should come with a warning and a can of mace, it is so effective at attracting men!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t always been able to find Auric Blends brand, but they are the best.</li>

            <li>It has a distinctive and pleasant smell, not too over powering.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful &amp; arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>I will probably wind up layering this one with Auric&#x27;s Rose or Water Lily which I was much more impressed with.  </li>
            <li>My wife smelled this on someone else, and was happy to own for herself.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend says it smells so good it must be pheromones.</li>

            <li>I thought I would have loved Auric&#x27;s Amber or even the Amber Patchouli</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>being said, I love Auric blends and just because some of their oils are hit and miss; when it&#x27;s a hit, it&#x27;s a HIT!</li>
            <li>LOVE this!</li>
            <li>Been years since I have used it, but still love it!</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do, I&#x27;ve tried other companies and Auric Blends is the best of the best.</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly and I&#x27;m happy on taking the chance on this one.</li>
            <li>Egyptian Goddess is an amazing scent.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing in the bottle but once applied the scent is gone in a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I bought my bottle through Tom&#x27;s Incense because Tom is an amazing seller.</li>
            <li>it is amazing.</li>
            <li>I chose it because a friend wears it and always smells amazing</li>
            <li>Get Egyptian Musk from an Egyptian and get Abdul Kareem which is  AMAZING</li>
            <li>The smell is AMAZING (egyptian goddess).</li>
            <li>Kind of smells like laundry detergent with florals.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very affordable and truly wonderful!</li>
            <li>I bought this scent because of the enthusiastic reviews, and according to the manufacturer&#x27;s website (Auric Blends)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wildly popular.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a warm, powdery, floral musk</li>
            <li>this one is warm and inviting and makes me feel at home.  </li>
            <li>Her father must own the company.</li>
            <li>It was nice the way I could smell it whenever I moved around, but it wasn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Nice oil.  </li>
            <li>I wasnt expecting too much from an eight dollar fragrance, but damn, this is like on eof the best perfumes Ive ever had, and Im a vet at fragrances, Im a perfume</li>
            <li>: the Divine Opium doesn&#x27;t smell like the branded opium smell found in beauty supply stores, and to me, this a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;Rasta is a heavier smell, but seems to be more along the lines of sandalwood.&lt;br</li>
            <li>told me I smelled nice.</li>
            <li>&quot; its nice one but</li>
            <li>but it was a nice scent</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s why I kind of like it.</li>
            <li>but honestly there is nothing there.</li>
            <li>Its a nice musky scent, but not what I was looking for, although my boyfriend says he likes it.</li>
            <li>I smelled what seemed like a pine sol scent or some kind of cleanser</li>
            <li>Even then I could kind of smell it</li>
            <li>they all liked it wanted to know where I bought it</li>
            <li>Nice smell can&#x27;t wait to try it</li>
            <li>This is the kind of reaction I got with Egyptian Goddess.  </li>
            <li>and this is the best by far!!!</li>
            <li>You dont need alot, and I catch these whiffs of it thruout the day and its fabulous, Love it!!</li>
            <li>But as the oil blends with the oils on your skin, it begins to grow, to blossom, and it becomes a truly lovely and very sexy fragrance.  </li>
            <li>but doesnt wear off quick and the roll on bottle is great for application.</li>
            <li>I have bought Egyptian goddess for many years as a most LOVED perfume.</li>
            <li>It is a very strong and</li>
            <li>This has a nice scent, but I think it smells more like a men&#x27;s fragrance than a woman&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this fragrance!</li>
            <li>This is a fragrance that you wear as much for yourself, as you do to smell good to others!  </li>
            <li>This one is extremely mild but pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I also love the incense this brand makes, for it sets this soft and delicious mood in my home.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exotic, spicy, warm and sexy rolled into one.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is pleasant but fades rather quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a romantic and musky scent that smells great and feels great.</li>
            <li>The hot dunes, coolly moon and sexy fleshy musk is perfectly captured in this roll on essence.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see that it was delivered on the exact day</li>
            <li>When I first opened it, it smelled great but as time went on &amp;</li>
            <li>This perfume smells really good, a slightly sweet floral scent.  </li>
            <li>Fine job!</li>
            <li>As others have said, this scent goes on very light.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have ordered it before.</li>
            <li>Thank you Auric and also Amazon.:)</li>
            <li>I love this perfume</li>
            <li>its nice and comfortable make you feel sexy,</li>
            <li>This is, and has been for many years now, my wife&#x27;s favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have to admit I love it on her too.</li>
            <li>I like the LOVE one if it was a bit stronger</li>
            <li>While this perfume oil is definitely a musk, it&#x27;s the cleanest most delicious smell I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought Lovely by SJP, I&#x27;ve gotten DK Gold, I&#x27;ve tried Gwen Stefani LAMB...</li>
            <li>You wont find it for a better price.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I receive many compliments when I use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.  </li>
            <li>I love my oils I have worn them for years, I get compliments all the time</li>
            <li>I waited for a while, and then I applied more; however, there was no noticeable increase in the scent</li>
            <li>This Egyption Goddess perfume reminds me of one called &amp;#34;Amazing Grace&amp;#34;, which I love.</li>
            <li>Im buying more once i run out.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when wearing it.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad she told me about it.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed, so I left without it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mystery and magic in a bottle.  </li>
            <li>I like both the ones I tried; this one and LOVE.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and so does everyone else.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous scent!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did, because I absolutely love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad my husband \\&quot;gets\\</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Of course, since it is what my wife wears, I might be biased :)</li>
            <li>I WILL ORDER MORE..</li>
            <li>I have been wearing Egyptian Goddess for 21 years this summer, using Auric Blends for most of that time.</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle of this years ago and just started using it again and fell in love with it all over again.</li>
            <li>I found it here by accident and bought more.</li>
            <li>I was so disapointed that it smelled more like cooking oil rather than the exotic aroma described.  </li>
            <li>and I am so glad I stumbled upon it here.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Love\\&quot; fragrance is also very sexy, but in a sweet way.</li>
            <li>This one is much more primal and sensual.</li>
            <li>I personally am enjoying the musky/campside/ freshness of this scent and will order again.</li>
            <li>I have gotten sooooooo many compliments from both men and women.</li>
            <li>Not to mention I fallen in love with me all over again.</li>
            <li>you will find a scent you like:)</li>
            <li>(See [[ASIN:074327718X What Remains: A Memoir of Fate, Friendship, and Love]] and [[ASIN:B000GG4J9Q</li>
            <li>I will always love this smell though.</li>
            <li>I wear this scent often &amp; get so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d still be able to smell it at the end of the night, so</li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>I also like Auric Blends Love</li>
            <li>I love the incense oils at Romancing The Stone.</li>
            <li>My favorite is Egyptian Musk.</li>
            <li>but I got more on my perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I thought it was ok if it wasnt the scent.</li>
            <li>I just love this earthy, musky scent.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s like catnip for me and most of the people that smelled it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent of all the Auric Blends.</li>
            <li>and I love the scent it gives off on my skin.</li>
            <li>Both me and my girlfriend LOVE the Egyptian Goddess scent.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try on more scents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with it, and I&#x27;m going to try Vanilla Musk this time as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not the most authentic Egyptian Musk I&#x27;ve smelled.</li>
            <li>Geez us instead of Jesus, :)</li>
            <li>Since you make us add more words  trying to add more words  </li>
            <li>I recommend this oil you will love it.</li>

            <li>Not buying any more Auric Blends.</li>
            <li>This scent does not overpower like most of the hideously overpriced and nauseating designer perfumes.  </li>

            <li>Egyptian Goddess has been one of my FAVORITE fragrance oils ever.</li>
            <li>i am 28 and this smells like what I think my grand kids will say I smell like in 40 or 50 years, when i have kids</li>
            <li>but it is more musk than anything else.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been enjoying this perfume oil...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell of the roll on &amp;#34;Goddess&amp;#34; perfume.</li>

            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this scent.    </li>
            <li>Love the convenience of this roll-on.</li>
            <li>that you aren&#x27;t able to smell beforehand.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love it; the scent lasts forever without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>It has an interesting \\&quot;familiar\\&quot; scent</li>
            <li>This scent is captivating.</li>
            <li>This Egyption Musk oil smells ok</li>
            <li>Its very exotic and slightly sweet, nothing like I have smelled.</li>
            <li>It mixes well with Love, also made by Auric Blends.</li>
            <li>EGYPTIAN GODDESS is so many things.</li>
            <li>but i WILL make sure to have a witness for my next purchase lol!</li>
            <li>I get soooooooo many compliments either way.</li>
            <li>This was a reorder as it&#x27;s my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s somewhat exotic yet not cloying or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Egyptian Goddess is my hands-down favorite fragrance of all and have purchased it many times over the years.  </li>
            <li>Very unique smell..</li>
            <li>However it does have its own unique scent, I like it.</li>
            <li>After reading the intriguing reviews for this product, I was expecting a wonderful new scent to try...</li>
            <li>It ends up smelling very clean as opposed to earthy but not at all soapy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong but not too strong and very easy to apply with the roll-on applicator.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too sweet, and kind of old-fashioned.  </li>
            <li>on me, it is just warm and slightly sweet.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend smells so sexy with this on, its not so strong that it turns you off.</li>
            <li>From Kuumba Made to Madinni and Possets, I Love perfume oils and this is the best one!&lt;br /&gt;Its not fake smelling, or synthetic smelling at all, and its very subtle and awesome, almost like an invisible perfume, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very clean, fresh scent, but also warm.  </li>
            <li>Glad it was cheap.    </li>
            <li>So incredible its cult like in its following.</li>
            <li>it makes me feel beautiful and sexy, and it&#x27;s the ONLY musk I will ever wear.  </li>
            <li>It was mailed to me and was nice and safe in the package.no defects in product,just loved  the roll on oil,this is my 2nd order...</li>
            <li>My sister and her husband loved it so much I gave her some.</li>
            <li>Word to wise go straight to Auric Blends</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It was too strong and really didn&#x27;t smell good at all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m excited to try out Night Queen or One Love though.</li>
            <li>roll on body perfume oil is quite unique and sexy as can be.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>Egyptian Goddess is a cult favorite because it falls under \\&quot;done surprisingly well\\&quot; and is a decent, straightforward Egyptian style musk without a lot of frills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I love rubbing my wrists together because the oil gets warm and really activates the smell.    </li>
            <li>and I can easily see why</li>
            <li>was very quick, and the item was well packed, so I did leave Tom&#x27;s Incense five stars.</li>
            <li>:) Worth the buy. :)</li>
            <li>The scent is a clean flowery scent that makes heads turn twice, like okay I smell something</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely terrific smelling, and I can see myself being more attractive with it on.</li>
            <li>enticing!While it arrived very quickly,..</li>
            <li>But, having said that, I am also one who likes a strong fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Every time I meet someone who smells good they always wear some kind of musk wether America, Egyptian or Japanese, and let me tell you this stuff</li>
            <li>but I found that it wasn&#x27;t strong at all.  </li>
            <li>Really strong.</li>
            <li>and yes, the smell isn&#x27;t as strong</li>
            <li>A fresh, clean scent that illicits many compliments...if they aren&#x27;t anosmic to it!</li>
            <li>Maybe to help others out, I love musky but sweet scents</li>
            <li>Love love love these oils, have bought 3 times now, very earthy</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a beautiful scent--my new favorite! :)</li>
            <li>The third note is as wonderful as the first</li>
            <li>This brand smells fine, but I have not gotten any compliments, so I don&#x27;t think anybody else is picking it up.</li>
            <li>I could not be happier with the speedy quick delivery of my favorite scent, Egyptian Goddess</li>
            <li>than that, it goes on nicely and lingers for a good long while.</li>
            <li>The smell is still very nice, but it&#x27;s barely detectable to almost nonexistent.</li>
            <li>Plus the little bottle it comes in is perfect to tote around in your purse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On me it is not a strong scent at all, but I think it&#x27;s perfect for those who may get a headache from strong scents.</li>
            <li>Fabulous scent.</li>
            <li>Apply lightly, and preferable not on your arms.</li>
            <li>It has a fragrance of light musk and a floral scent.</li>
            <li>Stays on all day and smells fabulous on.  </li>
            <li>Take the cap off and sniff, and you&#x27;ll get a light whiff of this perfume.</li>
            <li>Put it on, enjoy.</li>
            <li>They smell fantastic stay on for awhile and are not to over powering.</li>
            <li>It lasts the whole day, and changes throughout the day, always whispering \\&quot;goddess\\&quot; with its amazing empowering aroma.</li>
            <li>I get fantastic comments on it - and if you should order a bottle, and it is not for you, please find a friend to give it to..</li>
            <li>I did a google search a few weeks ago entering in \\&quot;best selling perfume for women\\&quot; and the website Auric Blends came up with Egyptian Goddess listed on the site.  </li>
            <li>heady.&lt;br /&gt;Divine Opium is also fantastic-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a constant, great product.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it had such great reviews</li>
            <li>Very Grandma-like, kind of a musky funky closet smell.</li>
            <li>~ it reminds me of something from  childhood  and brings back a happy feeling in me.  </li>
            <li>The scent is so light, I feel as if I have to literally douse myself to smell anything.  </li>
            <li>What a treat to wear at such a great price.</li>
            <li>The scent is fantastic.</li>
            <li>i quite enjoy&amp;</li>
            <li>(my favorite fragrance for many years), but I am very hesitant to order it after this experience with Egyptian Goddess...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very familiar, a perfectly lovely oil and very well made; but a bit too dated for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s warm, sexy and layers nicely with some of my other perfumes (like \\&quot;Boyfriend\\&quot; by Kate Walsh).</li>
            <li>I admit that like some of the reviews have said it does wear off (most perfumes wear off anyway right?)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad my sister told me she purchased it because I bought it right after I smelled it on her.  </li>
            <li>Right after I put it on this really sexy guy</li>
            <li>I actually like this one better than Egyptian Musk!!</li>
            <li>The great thing about this oil is that a little goes a long way and it smells delicious.</li>
            <li>but the shipment so fast!!!</li>
            <li>The scent changed drastically and turned into a delicious soft floral, kind of floral, but not your typical sweet floral, more earthy but still sweet...</li>
            <li>I used it before work a few times and now its stuck to the sleeves of the shirt from me putting it on my wrist, it always smells amazing on my work shirt week after week- its amazing!</li>
            <li>Sometimes, they may even smell it on someone else or smell it lightly when they sniff the bottle the first time, and then not be able to smell it again.  </li>
            <li>Love the roll on its easy to gauge how much you are putting on and it&#x27;s not over powering.</li>
            <li>I ordered this fragrance after admiring it on two other women--it smelled so good, I just had to take a chance on it!  </li>
            <li>I do Hot Yoga (which is doing yoga for an hour or more in a room of 110 degrees with humidity)</li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s sexy, crisp with a sensual and musky aroma.</li>
            <li>The first was okay.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>but that is why I love it SO much!</li>
            <li>That is what makes it unique.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect touch to wear everyday!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this, I put some on and it lasts for 2 seconds.</li>
            <li>It smells clean, like you&#x27;ve just had a shower.</li>
            <li>Too bad - after all the great reviews I was thinking that this would smell wonderful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s warm and soft with a light scent that isn&#x27;t over powering or headache inducing.  </li>
            <li>This is a heavenly, clean smell that I will continue to use forever -  </li>
            <li>It is soft, sexy, and somewhat exotic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for everyday wear, which is nice.</li>
            <li>A fresh bottle will not smell strong.  </li>
            <li>On the positive side, the baby powder smell went away and the scent of the Egyptian Goddess came through, which I like, and  is a lovely summer days scent.  </li>
            <li>I had read So many positive reviews on the Egyptian Goddess\\&quot; scent,and it sounded so</li>
            <li>It smells different on everyone, stronger on some than others, but always good.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is slightly sweet and floral with a spicy undertone.</li>
            <li>It also became more intense when I was out cleaning my car in the heat</li>
            <li>They make them all sound so tempting, so I splurged and ordered $50 worth of samples.  </li>
            <li>I got a chance to smell Love at a retail store and really like that scent as well</li>
            <li>I finally asked her what kind of perfume she was wearing because I liked it so much.  </li>
            <li>Note: If you are into really sweet, Escada-ish fruity scents or gourmand perfumes, I probably would not recommend this for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible, so I wear it sometimes, but I much prefer the Egyptian Goddess.  </li>
            <li>It has a sweet smell to it..</li>
            <li>Oh, I love this stuff so much.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s true,</li>
            <li>but it did stay on my wrists for a full day.</li>
            <li>So as I really tried and wanted to love Egyptian</li>
            <li>but I must have an extremely different idea of what good smells like.</li>
            <li>no prob w/O.G.,it just troubles me that i clicked on Auric Blends in order to be sure the E.G.oil was the real thing&amp;still ended up getting it from elsewhere.</li>
            <li>version:  Not a bad scent, but no clue what all the hype is about.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not a bad scent though.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance is so light, soft and sexy.</li>
            <li>, I have my super stick of Egyptian Goddess</li>
            <li>Egyptian Goddess is such a lovely exotic fragrance.</li>
            <li>Its a mysterious thing because even now, when I put my nose up to my wrist and smell, I&#x27;m still not all that impressed, but when I just let it be and take a deep breath, I can smell the fragrance</li>
            <li>Personally I like how light the smell is, its not overpowering so that when I walk by I irritate peoples noses and irriate my own nose for that matter.</li>
            <li>I love this classic fragrance.  </li>
            <li>the minute I rolled this water of the nile on my wrists, my mood lifted tremendously.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, the fragrance Night Queen that I ordered at the same time from a different vendor (I think) is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Decently quick shipping to upstate NY.</li>
            <li>If you like musk in a fragrance (think Coty&#x27;s Wild Musk, or the old favorite, Evening in Paris Musk), you will absolutely love this!  </li>
            <li>other than that, it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li>I normally roll on my wrist :)</li>
            <li>This oil is incredibly sticky and the formula has changed in the past couple of years.</li>
            <li>and yeah ,when you put it on and smell it, it smells cheap powdery!I am so dissapointed by this purchase not just because of the bucks I spent,but to think I made such a bum of myself by buying this cheap thing,with so many expectations..  </li>
            <li>and she said that she could smell it well, that it smelled very pretty, and wasn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>When I opened and applied the perfume at first, I was thrilled with the soft smell.</li>
            <li>I get headaches from scents so easily, LAMB really kills me after a while...</li>
            <li>Well first off, I ordered this on (Good) Friday and received it the following Monday (today).</li>
            <li>I have a highly sensitive nose with keen recognition of scent and this is watered down at best.</li>
            <li>and after you get out of hot yoga your are DRENCHED IN SWEAT!</li>
            <li>I have to say that the Water Lily fragrance is my second favorite!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not mad</li>
            <li>Occasionally I have been known to combine the 2 and that smells FANTASTIC!!</li>
            <li>The one I received from this vendor, however, is not the real thing!!  </li>
            <li>Idk, thats a bit odd and takes away some value of the perfume when i know i could get this at a local wallgreens in some places, but i honestly dont care its still a great perfume.</li>
            <li>The fragance is super nice, but unfortuately, no matter how much I used ...just did&#x27;nt seem to match my skin as far as bringing the fragrance out like a perfume should.  </li>
            <li>We returned it, and Amazon was AMAZING about giving us our money back.</li>
            <li>I thought this would smell similar to Amazing Grace</li>
            <li>It brought back a lot of memories, and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a low priced roll-on oil that smells AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>It is supposedly a safe ingredient, but I googled it and read that in lab testing, rats developed liver and kidney problems.</li>
            <li>Then go out for a day or so (walk around in the fresh air) and you&#x27;ll start to notice the scent.</li>
            <li>It was so much fun</li>
            <li>IN LOVE WITH THE SOFT SMELL.</li>
            <li>This scent is on the natural side which I find matches me more then some over price perfumes you find in a department store.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for a perfume with a fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>I found this perfume oil in a store called Success Express in NJ when I was visiting family one year.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping it&#x27;d be a bit more masculine and earthy, but it still just smells like school teacher perfume to me.</li>
            <li>Had ran across it at a natural foods store but found a better deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money to purchase a smell online</li>
            <li>And people who can smell one kind of musk molecule just fine can still be anosmic to other kinds of musk.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d thought I found the right perfume for me.</li>
            <li>the price was right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing it right now.</li>
            <li>She said it was just the right</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t smell right at all</li>
            <li>I usually prefer spray on fragrance as they are easy to use, but I love to roll this oil all over my wrists and beck to the point where I can smell the clean and gorgeous scent all day long.  </li>
            <li>A sweet musky scent that isn&#x27;t overly flowery like commercial perfumes and it isn&#x27;t too overwhelming like Patchouli.</li>
            <li>The smell is beautiful, simple, and different on each person who wears it.  </li>
            <li>Some of my favorite perfumes are Hillary Duff&#x27;s &#x27;With Love,&#x27; and B+BW&#x27;s Amber and Black Amethyst.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had any qualms about ordering from him because if there&#x27;s ever a problem, he&#x27;s quick to respond and fix any mistakes (which I&#x27;ve only had one out of the many orders).</li>
            <li>Not sure what all the great reviews are about.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t think Love would since I could barely smell it.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t count how many compliments I received from people at work, strangers in Starbucks and general people on the street.</li>
            <li>Not bad, really.</li>
            <li>, that is the advantage of wearing oils - as long as they mix well with your own skin oil.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this company and their quality natural perfume oils!  </li>
            <li>, floral with no soft, warm musky tones at all.</li>
            <li>This smells like warm skin bathed in cool blue moonlight, its really beyond description, as this scent is pure sexapill without the animal pheromones and fancy shmancy stinky perfume stuff they use these days.</li>
            <li>A nice smell, certainly, but not exactly reminiscent of Egypt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>This fragrance is warm and senual and it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it at all, it has a good staying power though but is a flowery scent, not very strong</li>
            <li>This oil is great for a day time dab and it last the entire day.</li>
            <li>I wasnt impressed with the scent, reminded me of an old closet smell, i&#x27;m 34yrs old and enjoy a variety of both subtle and pronounced scents but this wasnt fresh smelling at all.  </li>
            <li>The scent almost seems to change every few hours, which is kind of fun!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a clean light scent.  </li>
            <li>so the seller is very reliable!</li>
            <li>The egyptian musk oil I received is the exact product and quality I remember.  </li>
            <li>First time trying Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess Roll On Perfume.</li>
            <li>I think I only like 3 out of the 7 I bought which would be ONE LOVE AND EGYPTIAN GODDESS.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to Egyptian Goddess by my hair colorist.  </li>
            <li>I let my friend try this perfume with me before we went to do hot yoga together, and when we came out we were like</li>
            <li>When you walk into a shop of essential oils or health food store, this is the scent in the air most of the time.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more items under this label in future.</li>
            <li>Its enough that its a not too light scent and not too heavy and can still be smelled by me and people around me who have complimented how great it smells.</li>
            <li>If you are thinking of ordering this make sure you read all the reviews and keep an open mind when you get it...</li>
            <li>Going to try the Love scent next too...</li>
            <li>Way too much of a bite!</li>
            <li>Not for me, thanks!</li>
            <li>what exactly is the \\&quot;magic\\&quot; formula in this,</li>
            <li>Fast delivery! .</li>
            <li>First time i bought this.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to most scents especially ones that come as a spray.</li>
            <li>this is the only place i can find my favorite oil.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more when my supply gets low.</li>
            <li>Definitely one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>Thanks bunches!</li>
            <li>This perfume is absolutely divine!  </li>
            <li>Now I have two favorite perfumes:  Lalique (French) and Egyptian Goddess...</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It is light and warm and floral but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>first day I put it on a ton of women</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying it</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li>My favorite above anything else.</li>
            <li>a funny thing she said to me</li>
            <li>The EXACT scent.</li>
            <li>Otherwise its one of those gifts you give out for xmas to someone you don&#x27;t exactly like.</li>
            <li>recently I was amazed how many people approach me asking me what I was wearing</li>
            <li>( the first was the vanilla) and have given to my mother(she</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t recall him ever doing this, but it&#x27;s exactly the reception</li>
            <li>It is the only perfume that I have really enjoyed.</li>
            <li>This oil smells okay, but it does not last at all.  </li>
            <li>I reapplied a few times before I got a good concentration of fragrance.</li>
            <li>And the little bottle with the roller top is so easy and convenient to carry with you.</li>
            <li>After your nose can delineate between the fresh air and the scent, you&#x27;ll notice that the scent is actually quite strong.</li>
            <li>I found that the scent was not so strong as one would expect from a scented oil product, but the real problem was that wherever I touched it to my body, I started itching and developed a rash at the site of application.</li>
            <li>I never buy perfume or frangranced items online since I can&#x27;t obviously smell it for myself, but becuse there were so many positive reviews on this scent and</li>
            <li>After reading other reviews I was expecting \\&quot;sexy\\&quot; and \\&quot;skin\\&quot;, but this is a sweet floral which doesn&#x27;t smell sexy to me.</li>
            <li>The scent is subtle, if your used to spraying on a department store perfume and becoming lost in the fumes, then this is a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>im pretty positive</li>
            <li>I, too, could hardly detect a distinct aroma despite having a good sense of smell.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;d love to keep it as my own secret weapon...</li>
            <li>I can see how people say this smells old ladyish at first because it is on the sweet side, but what I like is after awhile</li>
            <li>I assume this must be a fake as there&#x27;s no way this could get so many good reviews?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light scent and is warm, spicy and a little floral all at the same time.</li>
            <li>This scent screams feminine and grown up, a world away from those overpowering super sweet teenage girls perfumes that you can smell literally 20 feet away!</li>
            <li>Its not cloyingly sweet or floral like many typically \\&quot;girlie\\&quot; perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try it because the reviews seemed positive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m positive</li>
            <li>I was eager to try this, with all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>you will enjoy this light sexy scent when and if you get tired of all those floral scents everone is wearing.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>but mine usually lasts a good 6-8 hours</li>
            <li>oil based perfume is a sweet, soft musk smell with floral undertones...</li>
            <li>It is such a clean, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Partially because everyone liked it but mainly for how it made me feel.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t over powering or too strong, just enough to catch attention in a positive way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and wild and deep and sweet and full of mystery...</li>
            <li>Then I noticed that it stayed on a very, very long time, and the longer I had it on the more</li>
            <li>I got Black opium from vendor name \\&quot;Xtremek\\&quot;, that perfume oil still nice smell.</li>
            <li>When I smell them (even from a great distance away), I can get a migraine headache or even suffer a small R Temporal Lobe Seizure (I have adult on-set Epilepsy).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s warm yet soft, and it&#x27;s a little sweet, but not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>buy\\&quot; which can certainly lead to regretfu purchase..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pleasant musk - hard to explain really.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I will come back and edit this review as I use EG more, figuring out how it wears throughout the day, but my first impression was that it smelled of old library books.  </li>
            <li>It was not like the original one I purchased it barely has a fragrance  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably order a few more of these Auric Blends!</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite fragrance, and its such a juxtaposition of soft and meaty, juicy and sweet sink your teeth in scent that I even roll it on my skin at night before going to bed.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells wonderful, but I could only give it 2 stars because of how weak the scent is.</li>
            <li>I tried this at first because it was attributed by two biographers to be the signature fragrance of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, who both waxed rhapsodic about it&#x27;s contribution to her unmistakable classic style.</li>
            <li>At this stage of my life however, I&#x27;d prefer to radiate a bit more modern chic and less earth mother. : )  Other than that, my package was expedited quickly and wrapped very well.</li>
            <li>The roll-on bottle is very easy to use, and allows you to put the oil exactly where you want it with no spilling or messy residue.  </li>
            <li>I do my best to stay active, but suffer from long and short term memory loss.</li>
            <li>It really does get stronger, unlike most other commercial scents, which start strong and then fade away.   </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s expensive but worth every penny and will make you happy.</li>
            <li>The delivery was really fast, I got it before the estimated delivery period</li>
            <li>receive soon as I expected love it</li>
            <li>but she really likes the scent so its for every age</li>
            <li>Five stars for the seller - fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m stockpiling, I really am.</li>
            <li>Auric needs to really increase the scent to oil ratio.</li>
            <li>sadly, I am VERY disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it smells much nicer.</li>
            <li>He also commented that I smelled \\&quot;absolutely divine\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I need to really shake the bottle before use.</li>
            <li>I really like this fragrance because it doesn&#x27;t quite smell like anything else out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really picky with scents</li>
            <li>then this is really up your alley.</li>
            <li>Amazon did refund promptly which I appreciated</li>
            <li>It is very sensual but down-to-earth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The strongest part of the scent reminded me of an old teacher I had in elementary school, or a grandmother..</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to wearing this scent.</li>
            <li>REALLY like it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve packed away the Coach, the Burberry, the Issy, the light blue and the Ed hardy.</li>
            <li>(well, my boyfriend did, after much hinting, then an outright \\&quot;I NEED THIS\\&quot; )  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;oil\\&quot; is very sticky/gummy on the skin too.</li>
            <li>I really like the stuff</li>
            <li>A very feminine and luxurious perfume oil</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much at all.</li>
            <li>sellers fast shipping</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, it really smells...</li>
            <li>Smells cheap like Irish Spring.</li>
            <li>This was absolutely what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t really smell.</li>
            <li>The fragrance lasts all day &amp; the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I asked my husband to smell it and even he said he couldnt much..</li>
            <li>The reviews that are most helpful to me would be about the bottle the scent comes in, or if it arrived in the time expected.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve smelled versions of Egyptian Goddess before and they always smelled soapy or too much like a stick of incense.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>Not the real Egyptian Goddess.</li>
            <li>Go to WholeFoods to get the real perfume oil.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s light and stay about 4hours on my body but on 4th day when I open this bottle</li>
            <li>I trashed it straight away..</li>
            <li>Thanks : HP</li>
            <li>Very incense like, but also powdery and a bit musty.</li>
            <li>I have tried to give it away, but nobody wants it.  </li>
            <li>My issue with perfumes is they are all alcohol and make me sneeze so much this does not.</li>
            <li>Thanks everyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it two stars for a fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Well...technically it didn&#x27;t really smell like anything.</li>
            <li>I really like this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I remember a former manager of mine who I now think may have used this fragrance, as she always smelled strongly of said library books and particularly Kleenex.  </li>
            <li>While the product itself was of very nice quality, it had a bit too much of something really unappealing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is exactly what college in upstate New York smells like.</li>
            <li>This is more of a thanks to the company that makes it rather than a review to try to get other people to try it.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>One more thing, it&#x27;s extremely oily.</li>
            <li>Even though I love Egyptian Goddess, I like all of the other scents too just depending on my mood.  </li>
            <li>have loved and used this for the past few years as a friend told me it was her favorite scent</li>
            <li>I just had my first daughter and the post office is so far away!</li>
            <li>I have noticed a lot of people claim their purchase has &amp;#34;no scent&amp;#34; - this is probably due to about 50% of the population being anosmic to most synthetic musks.  </li>
            <li>One or several of the reviews stated the aroma would become more apparent as the perfume/tube was exposed to the air.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It wears pretty close to the skin and is light without being sharp or soapy, ever so slightly nutty, evocative of clean skin with emphasis on skin rather than clean.</li>
            <li>I purchased this a while back and loved it so much that I purchased a larger bottle from a different seller.</li>
            <li>If u want to try the REAL version, order it from the Auric Blends site directly!!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft and strong at the same time.</li>
            <li>This has a beautiful scent, but it seems rather faint when sniffing it from the bottle.</li>
            <li>I have found that the bottle needs to be exposed to air for a while (just by opening it and using it daily) for the full strength of the fragrance to emerge.  </li>
            <li>Top notch natural perfume oil, been addicted to the Egyptian Goddess oil for 20 years now. :)</li>
            <li>Just wish the smell would last longer but for the price point it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li>&quot; It&#x27;s a comforting, sweet scent, but it smells old, as in a popular scent that we grew up with when we were little, so it lends itself as an older woman scent from the last generation.</li>
            <li>I have the Black Opium and Love scents in addition to this one</li>
            <li>The Sexy Black Egyptian Goddess</li>
            <li>I am more purchasing from Xtremek Black opium.</li>
            <li>Love the smell its practically last the entire day and doesn&#x27;t lose the strength in its smell.</li>
            <li>Its a mysterious blend of deep and sexy smells.</li>
            <li>It will infuse your clothing in the same way that classic fragrances used to do before they were designed to dissipate quickly.  </li>
            <li>I think of older women when I smell this by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Almost one year later, and I&#x27;m back for more.</li>
            <li>i bought this product mainly because of the reviews.</li>
            <li>Patchouli is classic and tried and true.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want Egyptian Musk do yourself a favor and get the better quality more expensive Abdul Kareem oil.</li>
            <li>They still need to work on the quality of their candles, the wick burns straight down the center within a few hours (instead of the 70-80 hours on the label) but I use the remaining wax in my candle warmer for a light version of this beautiful scent.</li>
            <li>Meaning, the scent dissapates (at least on me) after a half day or so.     Love it and love the price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was on of the very first to get Botox for my Migraines before it even was approved by the FDA by my Neurologist back in 2000.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at all the good reviews all over the internet, and decided I cant go wrong, and they are right</li>
            <li>Guys, if your wife is killing your budget with high-end perfume purchases, I highly recommend you ask her to try this fragrance.</li>
            <li>for people that don&#x27;t want to be overrun with a high end perfume smell.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more in the very near future.</li>
            <li>and it changed a little bit more.  </li>
            <li>I love these little roll-ons.</li>
            <li>Finding Egyptian Goddess Oil in a little shop in Jackson, Wyoming seemed appropriate.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try Egyptian Goddess to compare it with Abdul Kareem Egyptian oil since it&#x27;s a little cheaper, more portable.</li>
            <li>Honestly, you can tell it&#x27;s a nice-smelling perfume because of the occasional hints of fragrance that come out of the bottle, but they&#x27;re so rare that you&#x27;re really left with what some other reviewers described as car oil smell, which I guess is like the basis oil the perfume uses.</li>
            <li>Long lasting fragrance that didn&#x27;t highly appeal to me, but is simply okay.</li>
            <li>So disappointing as the fragrance is incredible.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t smoke...but its a strangely weird scent and uncommon</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this perfume based on the great reviews written but unfortunately, it is just was not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible and it&#x27;s not fabulous.</li>
            <li>could barely detect any fragrance at all after I first rolled it on.</li>
            <li>did try layering with my everyday perfume, and it added more musk and spiciness, which I thought was lacking.</li>
            <li>and for what its worth it doesnt even last 1 hour..by which I mean,after 1 hour when I smelled the area I rubbed it in,there was nothing!</li>
            <li>Also my husband politely didn&#x27;t say anything until I asked his opinion, of which he said &amp;#34;It&#x27;s like a business professional scent, nice but not sexy.</li>
            <li>This scent smells really good; I&#x27;m not sure what different scents they used</li>
            <li>This scent in not common.</li>
            <li>Pretty much the same reason I cannot give it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn Amber Romance from Victoria&#x27;s Secret for years and while my husband never complained about the scent, he never nuzzled up on me and told me how good I smelled.  </li>
            <li>In the future I will try other roll-on oils and most certainly the seller.</li>
            <li>Guys always love a faint smell on a woman, when its so strong that you can smell her from 5 yards away everyones thinking</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell musky to me at all, just slightly earthy and very sweet.</li>
            <li>The other fragrances I bought stay very true to what they smell like out of the bottle, which is preferable, but this one seems to change completely depending on body temperature.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 24) but it definitely has the right amount of floral and musky notes.</li>
            <li>Strange thing happened today at the super market.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried because it does smell more mature than what people my age normally wear</li>
            <li>It does smell very nice, however the smell is extremely faint</li>
            <li>It is very, very soft and only smellable if you put your nose right to your skin.</li>
            <li>Memories of traveling to F street in Washington D.C. purchasing egyptian musk oil and other items from coner stands that were run primarily by jamaicans.   </li>
            <li>I love the scent, it is vey powerful so a little goes a long Way!</li>
            <li>Enjoy this perfume oil,it begs to be worn,shared&amp;experienced..just be careful in crowded places,you may find yourself overwhelmed!</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think this scent was strong enough, but after a few times, I realized I REALLY</li>
            <li>This new formulation has NO scent.</li>
            <li>I just knew that I needed to try something new</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new scent to change things up.  </li>
            <li>Rather it combines the earthy sensuality of musk with exotic overtones such as sandalwood to create a rich scent that is both distinctive yet subtle.  </li>
            <li>After so many failed attempts to find a subtle, yet sultry scent I have finally found the perfect one!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m looking forward to purchasing a larger bottle as well as solid perfume(when available).</li>
            <li>I was very surprised she did</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as if I&#x27;m not wearing anything at all, and I have a very sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a new perfume for your significant other give this a try</li>
            <li>Use a little more if you don&#x27;t think you can smell it (think rolling a spot the size of a nickel on wrists and throat), and it will develop over an hour into a stronger, more complex scent.</li>
            <li>WOW WE CAN STILLLLL SMELL THIS!</li>
            <li>I was first introduce to this by a mutual friend last year</li>
            <li>Initially when you first buy the perfume, you may need to put on about 12\\&quot; of it on your body to detect the scent.</li>
            <li>Musk scents are created by several different types of molecules and interestingly, some people are anosmic to these molecules -- simply can&#x27;t smell them.</li>
            <li>Not really my favorite fragrance but its ok.</li>
            <li>Everyone who knows me calls this my scent because I have worn it for nearly 8-9 years and its not a common perfume.</li>
            <li>I had to go put some on after reading all the other reviews and it is so familiar to me.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m usually not picky</li>
            <li>BUT IT WAS THE EXACT SAME SCENT.</li>
            <li>the buying is simple and the shipping is so fast!</li>
            <li>Many other reviewers have the same experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a big lover of musk perfumes and was STUNNED when I opened this and smelled it for the first time.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t fully care for the initial \\&quot;spicy\\&quot; scent when I first put it on, but as the oil soaks in, my body heat sort of makes it bloom.  </li>
            <li>I was also a little worried that it might be too strong</li>
            <li>,I had also read in some reviews that the bottle just might need to be exposed to the air a little to really bring out the true scent,I gave it 2 days on my skin,which you can not get off for about 2 days any way,even after scrubbing in the shower,..</li>
            <li>This will definitely be my scent of choice for as long as the make it available.</li>
            <li>By far a extremely well worth perfume!</li>
            <li>Not sure how Kleenex and library books are translated into \\&quot;soft sexy powdery musk\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Right from the bottle, the oil is odorless, and at first I was a little dissapointed when it came in the mail.</li>
            <li>Based on the overall positive reviews here (and the price), I decided to try this oil.</li>
            <li>I returned for refund as well as a large bottle of the same fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The particles are simply too large for some people to smell.  </li>
            <li>and I thought I would order from amazon rather than the auric blends site because it was free shipping and a little cheaper..</li>
            <li>almost gave up on this little bottle of oil after a mere 2 wears, but luckily I came back on Amazon and read a few more reviews saying the bottle almost needs to breathe to really develop a good scent.  </li>
            <li>Order the larger bottle and refill your little one :)</li>
            <li>The roller ball to apply it was stuck, and once I was able to get the oil out, I could hardly smell anything.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe, so if one was curious about what all the Egyptian oil user rave about, this is a good place to start.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightly floral with just enough musk, but devoid of the animalic/unshowered woman smell that some of them can take on.  </li>
            <li>even my 13 year old daughter loves it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering it directly from Auric Blends website</li>
            <li>so I can actually smell like the real stuff.</li>
            <li>The next day and ever since, when I use it I can&#x27;t smell much, just the hint, and only if I put my nose very close to the wrist and sniff it well.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the bottle we got was old or defective.</li>
            <li>I had intended to try the Amber that Auric Blends offers as well</li>
            <li>I tried to wash it off (hence the much hand-washing) but again, 9 hours later I can still smell it and my husband won&#x27;t get close to me.</li>
            <li>I wonder if they sent me an old bottle.  </li>
            <li>It is soft and is not over powering on.  </li>
            <li>I make sure to have at least 1 of these in my perfume collection.  </li>
            <li>I tried this fragrance out at a store near my house that sells all of the auric blends perfumes.  </li>
            <li>SMELLS LIKE AN OLD LADY.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend even said I smelled like an old lady.</li>
            <li>I dressed in my costume, fixed my makeup and hair while inhaling my E.Musk incense and that scent did it for me.</li>
            <li>It drives her wild when I wear it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being REALLY picky about scents,(I only wear two)</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s old or what</li>
            <li>And it really does last a while.</li>
            <li>We now see the commercials on TV for Botox and Migraines quite frequently.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old told me I smelled like a dog.</li>
            <li>Arrived early.</li>
            <li>Khiel&#x27;s is the real deal while products such as this are imposters.,</li>
            <li>I am suspecting that the item that I got is an old batch.</li>
            <li>wow ,I said you can find it there</li>
            <li>(came 2 days early)</li>
            <li>from\\&quot;OLD</li>
            <li>The scent completely changed &amp; wore off almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>Oh god the old lady perfume smell...</li>
            <li>I love this scent - but it only lasts a few moments.</li>
            <li>And really how often do random men tell you that you smell nice?</li>
            <li>it smells really good, but unfortunately, the smell lasts for about 5 mins after applying and thats it.</li>
            <li>I have worn this oil perfume for years and usually buy it here in Vermont, but this was so easy and no travel.  </li>
            <li>But who knows, maybe the more they sell the less they&#x27;ll charge(hah) or at least in these tough economic times a good review</li>
            <li>The smell is subtle, last long n pleasant.</li>
            <li>Musky for sure, but there&#x27;s a subtle sweetness to it.</li>
            <li>the only thing I smell is a slight hint of Patchouli which is fine</li>
            <li>It is different from anything I have, and I wear it every other couple of days and when I go walking because the clean scent helps me stay motivated.</li>
            <li>Please note that this is just my perception of these scents and that I typically prefer earthy over floral, powders, or fresh</li>
            <li>I rolled a little bit on my wrists when I first opened the package, and can still detect the scent 9 hours later, despite much hand-washing (up to my wrists), getting caught in a rainstorm, and doing the dishes.</li>
            <li>and I recommend curious buyers pay attention to the positive feedback, and buy it from this seller.</li>
            <li>I am aware that an individual&#x27;s personal chemistry can affect perfumes, but I expect some scent, even if different once applied.</li>
            <li>There are no other detectable notes but smoke and fireplace.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong enough, but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I opened it and without smelling it first just rolled a little bit on my arm, I smelled like an old lady all day (no offense intended).</li>
            <li>I would purchase from seller in the near future.</li>
            <li>I consider it a fragrance that whispers, yet loud enough to be heard without being offensive.</li>
            <li>I can barely smell it.</li>
            <li>Wow, I only wore this one day</li>
            <li>The scent is barely detectable.</li>
            <li>oil and the fragrance is barely perceptible.  </li>
            <li>I personally think it smells like old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>I have been trying for years to find a light, sweet, floral perfume that didn&#x27;t smell like sickening sweet cotton candy or bubble-gum.  </li>
            <li>To sum it up very quickly: Do not buy this scent if you are under the age of 75; it smells like old lady, exactly.  </li>
            <li>My Egyptian Goddess has finally run out, with not daily, but very frequent use.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure because my nose becomes immune to the scent quickly.</li>
            <li>Are larger bottles in the near future?</li>
            <li>My old Egptian Musk would last the entire day</li>
            <li>I cant belive how people can give this absolute piece of crap so many positive reviews,which tricked me into buying this..</li>
            <li>You will definately not be disappointed and happy that you purchased this.  </li>
            <li>However, for now, I will go back to Kiehl&#x27;s,  and buy their original musk oil which lasts at least 1/2 a day on my body.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this product or any other auric blends product.  </li>
            <li>I will spend the extra few dollars and go to the real site!</li>
            <li>Its sexual and earthy and makes me feel like running around naked with a tribe of dirty tree huggers!! :)</li>
            <li>It goes on with a very soft scent, a bit sweet and very subtle.  </li>
            <li>I agree with the others that it does smell really good, however, the smell is so weak that i cant hardly smell it.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s never given much more than a shrug with any other scent I waft beneath his nose, so the instant dislike of this was serious.</li>
            <li>This particular brand is consistent with all other Egyptian Musk oils that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I even put a little bit of the scent on my upper lip so that I could smell it through out the day instead of sniffing my hand the whole time.</li>
            <li>The first time you wear it, you&#x27;ll think it has very little scent.  </li>

            <li> I thought I would have loved Auric&#x27;s Amber or even the Amber Patchouli</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> being said, I love Auric blends and just because some of their oils are hit and miss; when it&#x27;s a hit, it&#x27;s a HIT!</li>
            <li> LOVE this!</li>
            <li> Been years since I have used it, but still love it!</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do, I&#x27;ve tried other companies and Auric Blends is the best of the best.</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly and I&#x27;m happy on taking the chance on this one.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Goddess is an amazing scent.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing in the bottle but once applied the scent is gone in a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought my bottle through Tom&#x27;s Incense because Tom is an amazing seller.</li>
            <li> it is amazing.</li>
            <li> I chose it because a friend wears it and always smells amazing</li>
            <li> Get Egyptian Musk from an Egyptian and get Abdul Kareem which is  AMAZING</li>
            <li> The smell is AMAZING (egyptian goddess).</li>
            <li> Kind of smells like laundry detergent with florals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very affordable and truly wonderful!</li>
            <li> I bought this scent because of the enthusiastic reviews, and according to the manufacturer&#x27;s website (Auric Blends)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wildly popular.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a warm, powdery, floral musk</li>
            <li> this one is warm and inviting and makes me feel at home.  </li>
            <li> Her father must own the company.</li>
            <li> It was nice the way I could smell it whenever I moved around, but it wasn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Nice oil.  </li>
            <li> I wasnt expecting too much from an eight dollar fragrance, but damn, this is like on eof the best perfumes Ive ever had, and Im a vet at fragrances, Im a perfume</li>
            <li> : the Divine Opium doesn&#x27;t smell like the branded opium smell found in beauty supply stores, and to me, this a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;Rasta is a heavier smell, but seems to be more along the lines of sandalwood.&lt;br</li>
            <li> told me I smelled nice.</li>
            <li> &quot; its nice one but</li>
            <li> but it was a nice scent</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s why I kind of like it.</li>
            <li> but honestly there is nothing there.</li>
            <li> Its a nice musky scent, but not what I was looking for, although my boyfriend says he likes it.</li>
            <li> I smelled what seemed like a pine sol scent or some kind of cleanser</li>
            <li> Even then I could kind of smell it</li>
            <li> they all liked it wanted to know where I bought it</li>
            <li> Nice smell can&#x27;t wait to try it</li>
            <li> This is the kind of reaction I got with Egyptian Goddess.  </li>
            <li> and this is the best by far!!!</li>
            <li> You dont need alot, and I catch these whiffs of it thruout the day and its fabulous, Love it!!</li>
            <li> But as the oil blends with the oils on your skin, it begins to grow, to blossom, and it becomes a truly lovely and very sexy fragrance.  </li>
            <li> but doesnt wear off quick and the roll on bottle is great for application.</li>
            <li> I have bought Egyptian goddess for many years as a most LOVED perfume.</li>
            <li> It is a very strong and</li>
            <li> This has a nice scent, but I think it smells more like a men&#x27;s fragrance than a woman&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this fragrance!</li>
            <li> This is a fragrance that you wear as much for yourself, as you do to smell good to others!  </li>
            <li> This one is extremely mild but pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I also love the incense this brand makes, for it sets this soft and delicious mood in my home.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exotic, spicy, warm and sexy rolled into one.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is pleasant but fades rather quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a romantic and musky scent that smells great and feels great.</li>
            <li> The hot dunes, coolly moon and sexy fleshy musk is perfectly captured in this roll on essence.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see that it was delivered on the exact day</li>
            <li> When I first opened it, it smelled great but as time went on &amp;</li>
            <li> This perfume smells really good, a slightly sweet floral scent.  </li>
            <li> Fine job!</li>
            <li> As others have said, this scent goes on very light.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have ordered it before.</li>
            <li> Thank you Auric and also Amazon.:)</li>
            <li> I love this perfume</li>
            <li> its nice and comfortable make you feel sexy,</li>
            <li> This is, and has been for many years now, my wife&#x27;s favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I love it on her too.</li>
            <li> I like the LOVE one if it was a bit stronger</li>
            <li> While this perfume oil is definitely a musk, it&#x27;s the cleanest most delicious smell I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought Lovely by SJP, I&#x27;ve gotten DK Gold, I&#x27;ve tried Gwen Stefani LAMB...</li>
            <li> You wont find it for a better price.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I receive many compliments when I use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.  </li>
            <li> I love my oils I have worn them for years, I get compliments all the time</li>
            <li> I waited for a while, and then I applied more; however, there was no noticeable increase in the scent</li>
            <li> This Egyption Goddess perfume reminds me of one called &amp;#34;Amazing Grace&amp;#34;, which I love.</li>
            <li> Im buying more once i run out.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when wearing it.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad she told me about it.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed, so I left without it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mystery and magic in a bottle.  </li>
            <li> I like both the ones I tried; this one and LOVE.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and so does everyone else.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous scent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did, because I absolutely love the scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad my husband \\&quot;gets\\</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Of course, since it is what my wife wears, I might be biased :)</li>
            <li> I WILL ORDER MORE..</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Egyptian Goddess for 21 years this summer, using Auric Blends for most of that time.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this years ago and just started using it again and fell in love with it all over again.</li>
            <li> I found it here by accident and bought more.</li>
            <li> I was so disapointed that it smelled more like cooking oil rather than the exotic aroma described.  </li>
            <li> and I am so glad I stumbled upon it here.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Love\\&quot; fragrance is also very sexy, but in a sweet way.</li>
            <li> This one is much more primal and sensual.</li>
            <li> I personally am enjoying the musky/campside/ freshness of this scent and will order again.</li>
            <li> I have gotten sooooooo many compliments from both men and women.</li>
            <li> Not to mention I fallen in love with me all over again.</li>
            <li> you will find a scent you like:)</li>
            <li> (See [[ASIN:074327718X What Remains: A Memoir of Fate, Friendship, and Love]] and [[ASIN:B000GG4J9Q</li>
            <li> I will always love this smell though.</li>
            <li> I wear this scent often &amp; get so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d still be able to smell it at the end of the night, so</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.</li>
            <li> I also like Auric Blends Love</li>
            <li> I love the incense oils at Romancing The Stone.</li>
            <li> My favorite is Egyptian Musk.</li>
            <li> but I got more on my perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I thought it was ok if it wasnt the scent.</li>
            <li> I just love this earthy, musky scent.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s like catnip for me and most of the people that smelled it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent of all the Auric Blends.</li>
            <li> and I love the scent it gives off on my skin.</li>
            <li> Both me and my girlfriend LOVE the Egyptian Goddess scent.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try on more scents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with it, and I&#x27;m going to try Vanilla Musk this time as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not the most authentic Egyptian Musk I&#x27;ve smelled.</li>
            <li> Geez us instead of Jesus, :)</li>
            <li> Since you make us add more words  trying to add more words  </li>
            <li> I recommend this oil you will love it.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells on me</li>
            <li> Not buying any more Auric Blends.</li>
            <li> This scent does not overpower like most of the hideously overpriced and nauseating designer perfumes.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;ll love you for it.</li>
            <li> And I have been getting compliments on it (mostly by women</li>

            <li> my coworkers also love it.</li>
            <li> and I love that.  </li>
            <li> Egyptian Goddess has been one of my FAVORITE fragrance oils ever.</li>
            <li> i am 28 and this smells like what I think my grand kids will say I smell like in 40 or 50 years, when i have kids</li>
            <li> but it is more musk than anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been enjoying this perfume oil...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of the roll on &amp;#34;Goddess&amp;#34; perfume.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> but I still love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best, and longest lasting Egyptian Goddess perfume I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this scent.    </li>
            <li> Love the convenience of this roll-on.</li>
            <li> that you aren&#x27;t able to smell beforehand.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I love it; the scent lasts forever without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> It has an interesting \\&quot;familiar\\&quot; scent</li>
            <li> This scent is captivating.</li>
            <li> This Egyption Musk oil smells ok</li>
            <li> Its very exotic and slightly sweet, nothing like I have smelled.</li>
            <li> It mixes well with Love, also made by Auric Blends.</li>
            <li> EGYPTIAN GODDESS is so many things.</li>
            <li> but i WILL make sure to have a witness for my next purchase lol!</li>
            <li> I get soooooooo many compliments either way.</li>
            <li> This was a reorder as it&#x27;s my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat exotic yet not cloying or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Goddess is my hands-down favorite fragrance of all and have purchased it many times over the years.  </li>
            <li> Very unique smell..</li>
            <li> However it does have its own unique scent, I like it.</li>
            <li> After reading the intriguing reviews for this product, I was expecting a wonderful new scent to try...</li>
            <li> It ends up smelling very clean as opposed to earthy but not at all soapy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong but not too strong and very easy to apply with the roll-on applicator.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too sweet, and kind of old-fashioned.  </li>
            <li> on me, it is just warm and slightly sweet.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend smells so sexy with this on, its not so strong that it turns you off.</li>
            <li> From Kuumba Made to Madinni and Possets, I Love perfume oils and this is the best one!&lt;br /&gt;Its not fake smelling, or synthetic smelling at all, and its very subtle and awesome, almost like an invisible perfume, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very clean, fresh scent, but also warm.  </li>
            <li> Glad it was cheap.    </li>
            <li> So incredible its cult like in its following.</li>
            <li> it makes me feel beautiful and sexy, and it&#x27;s the ONLY musk I will ever wear.  </li>
            <li> It was mailed to me and was nice and safe in the package.no defects in product,just loved  the roll on oil,this is my 2nd order...</li>
            <li> My sister and her husband loved it so much I gave her some.</li>
            <li> Word to wise go straight to Auric Blends</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It was too strong and really didn&#x27;t smell good at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to try out Night Queen or One Love though.</li>
            <li> roll on body perfume oil is quite unique and sexy as can be.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> Egyptian Goddess is a cult favorite because it falls under \\&quot;done surprisingly well\\&quot; and is a decent, straightforward Egyptian style musk without a lot of frills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> and I love rubbing my wrists together because the oil gets warm and really activates the smell.    </li>
            <li> and I can easily see why</li>
            <li> was very quick, and the item was well packed, so I did leave Tom&#x27;s Incense five stars.</li>
            <li> :) Worth the buy. :)</li>
            <li> The scent is a clean flowery scent that makes heads turn twice, like okay I smell something</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely terrific smelling, and I can see myself being more attractive with it on.</li>
            <li> enticing!While it arrived very quickly,..</li>
            <li> But, having said that, I am also one who likes a strong fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Every time I meet someone who smells good they always wear some kind of musk wether America, Egyptian or Japanese, and let me tell you this stuff</li>
            <li> but I found that it wasn&#x27;t strong at all.  </li>
            <li> Really strong.</li>
            <li> and yes, the smell isn&#x27;t as strong</li>
            <li> A fresh, clean scent that illicits many compliments...if they aren&#x27;t anosmic to it!</li>
            <li> Maybe to help others out, I love musky but sweet scents</li>
            <li> Love love love these oils, have bought 3 times now, very earthy</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a beautiful scent--my new favorite! :)</li>
            <li> The third note is as wonderful as the first</li>
            <li> This brand smells fine, but I have not gotten any compliments, so I don&#x27;t think anybody else is picking it up.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with the speedy quick delivery of my favorite scent, Egyptian Goddess</li>
            <li> than that, it goes on nicely and lingers for a good long while.</li>
            <li> The smell is still very nice, but it&#x27;s barely detectable to almost nonexistent.</li>
            <li> Plus the little bottle it comes in is perfect to tote around in your purse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On me it is not a strong scent at all, but I think it&#x27;s perfect for those who may get a headache from strong scents.</li>
            <li> Fabulous scent.</li>
            <li> Apply lightly, and preferable not on your arms.</li>
            <li> It has a fragrance of light musk and a floral scent.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day and smells fabulous on.  </li>
            <li> Take the cap off and sniff, and you&#x27;ll get a light whiff of this perfume.</li>
            <li> Put it on, enjoy.</li>
            <li> They smell fantastic stay on for awhile and are not to over powering.</li>
            <li> It lasts the whole day, and changes throughout the day, always whispering \\&quot;goddess\\&quot; with its amazing empowering aroma.</li>
            <li> I get fantastic comments on it - and if you should order a bottle, and it is not for you, please find a friend to give it to..</li>
            <li> I did a google search a few weeks ago entering in \\&quot;best selling perfume for women\\&quot; and the website Auric Blends came up with Egyptian Goddess listed on the site.  </li>
            <li> heady.&lt;br /&gt;Divine Opium is also fantastic-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a constant, great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it had such great reviews</li>
            <li> Very Grandma-like, kind of a musky funky closet smell.</li>
            <li> ~ it reminds me of something from  childhood  and brings back a happy feeling in me.  </li>
            <li> The scent is so light, I feel as if I have to literally douse myself to smell anything.  </li>
            <li> What a treat to wear at such a great price.</li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic.</li>
            <li> i quite enjoy&amp;</li>
            <li> (my favorite fragrance for many years), but I am very hesitant to order it after this experience with Egyptian Goddess...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very familiar, a perfectly lovely oil and very well made; but a bit too dated for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s warm, sexy and layers nicely with some of my other perfumes (like \\&quot;Boyfriend\\&quot; by Kate Walsh).</li>
            <li> I admit that like some of the reviews have said it does wear off (most perfumes wear off anyway right?)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad my sister told me she purchased it because I bought it right after I smelled it on her.  </li>
            <li> Right after I put it on this really sexy guy</li>
            <li> I actually like this one better than Egyptian Musk!!</li>
            <li> The great thing about this oil is that a little goes a long way and it smells delicious.</li>
            <li> but the shipment so fast!!!</li>
            <li> The scent changed drastically and turned into a delicious soft floral, kind of floral, but not your typical sweet floral, more earthy but still sweet...</li>
            <li> I used it before work a few times and now its stuck to the sleeves of the shirt from me putting it on my wrist, it always smells amazing on my work shirt week after week- its amazing!</li>
            <li> Sometimes, they may even smell it on someone else or smell it lightly when they sniff the bottle the first time, and then not be able to smell it again.  </li>
            <li> Love the roll on its easy to gauge how much you are putting on and it&#x27;s not over powering.</li>
            <li> I ordered this fragrance after admiring it on two other women--it smelled so good, I just had to take a chance on it!  </li>
            <li> I do Hot Yoga (which is doing yoga for an hour or more in a room of 110 degrees with humidity)</li>
            <li> ; it&#x27;s sexy, crisp with a sensual and musky aroma.</li>
            <li> The first was okay.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> but that is why I love it SO much!</li>
            <li> That is what makes it unique.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect touch to wear everyday!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this, I put some on and it lasts for 2 seconds.</li>
            <li> It smells clean, like you&#x27;ve just had a shower.</li>
            <li> Too bad - after all the great reviews I was thinking that this would smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s warm and soft with a light scent that isn&#x27;t over powering or headache inducing.  </li>
            <li> This is a heavenly, clean smell that I will continue to use forever -  </li>
            <li> It is soft, sexy, and somewhat exotic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for everyday wear, which is nice.</li>
            <li> A fresh bottle will not smell strong.  </li>
            <li> On the positive side, the baby powder smell went away and the scent of the Egyptian Goddess came through, which I like, and  is a lovely summer days scent.  </li>
            <li> I had read So many positive reviews on the Egyptian Goddess\\&quot; scent,and it sounded so</li>
            <li> It smells different on everyone, stronger on some than others, but always good.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is slightly sweet and floral with a spicy undertone.</li>
            <li> It also became more intense when I was out cleaning my car in the heat</li>
            <li> They make them all sound so tempting, so I splurged and ordered $50 worth of samples.  </li>
            <li> I got a chance to smell Love at a retail store and really like that scent as well</li>
            <li> I finally asked her what kind of perfume she was wearing because I liked it so much.  </li>
            <li> Note: If you are into really sweet, Escada-ish fruity scents or gourmand perfumes, I probably would not recommend this for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible, so I wear it sometimes, but I much prefer the Egyptian Goddess.  </li>
            <li> It has a sweet smell to it..</li>
            <li> Oh, I love this stuff so much.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s true,</li>
            <li> but it did stay on my wrists for a full day.</li>
            <li> So as I really tried and wanted to love Egyptian</li>
            <li> but I must have an extremely different idea of what good smells like.</li>
            <li> no prob w/O.G.,it just troubles me that i clicked on Auric Blends in order to be sure the E.G.oil was the real thing&amp;still ended up getting it from elsewhere.</li>
            <li> version:  Not a bad scent, but no clue what all the hype is about.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not a bad scent though.  </li>
            <li> This fragrance is so light, soft and sexy.</li>
            <li> , I have my super stick of Egyptian Goddess</li>
            <li> Egyptian Goddess is such a lovely exotic fragrance.</li>
            <li> Its a mysterious thing because even now, when I put my nose up to my wrist and smell, I&#x27;m still not all that impressed, but when I just let it be and take a deep breath, I can smell the fragrance</li>
            <li> Personally I like how light the smell is, its not overpowering so that when I walk by I irritate peoples noses and irriate my own nose for that matter.</li>
            <li> I love this classic fragrance.  </li>
            <li> the minute I rolled this water of the nile on my wrists, my mood lifted tremendously.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, the fragrance Night Queen that I ordered at the same time from a different vendor (I think) is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Decently quick shipping to upstate NY.</li>
            <li> If you like musk in a fragrance (think Coty&#x27;s Wild Musk, or the old favorite, Evening in Paris Musk), you will absolutely love this!  </li>
            <li> other than that, it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li> I normally roll on my wrist :)</li>
            <li> This oil is incredibly sticky and the formula has changed in the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> and yeah ,when you put it on and smell it, it smells cheap powdery!I am so dissapointed by this purchase not just because of the bucks I spent,but to think I made such a bum of myself by buying this cheap thing,with so many expectations..  </li>
            <li> and she said that she could smell it well, that it smelled very pretty, and wasn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> When I opened and applied the perfume at first, I was thrilled with the soft smell.</li>
            <li> I get headaches from scents so easily, LAMB really kills me after a while...</li>
            <li> Well first off, I ordered this on (Good) Friday and received it the following Monday (today).</li>
            <li> I have a highly sensitive nose with keen recognition of scent and this is watered down at best.</li>
            <li> and after you get out of hot yoga your are DRENCHED IN SWEAT!</li>
            <li> I have to say that the Water Lily fragrance is my second favorite!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not mad</li>
            <li> Occasionally I have been known to combine the 2 and that smells FANTASTIC!!</li>
            <li> The one I received from this vendor, however, is not the real thing!!  </li>
            <li> Idk, thats a bit odd and takes away some value of the perfume when i know i could get this at a local wallgreens in some places, but i honestly dont care its still a great perfume.</li>
            <li> The fragance is super nice, but unfortuately, no matter how much I used ...just did&#x27;nt seem to match my skin as far as bringing the fragrance out like a perfume should.  </li>
            <li> We returned it, and Amazon was AMAZING about giving us our money back.</li>
            <li> I thought this would smell similar to Amazing Grace</li>
            <li> It brought back a lot of memories, and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a low priced roll-on oil that smells AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> It is supposedly a safe ingredient, but I googled it and read that in lab testing, rats developed liver and kidney problems.</li>
            <li> Then go out for a day or so (walk around in the fresh air) and you&#x27;ll start to notice the scent.</li>
            <li> It was so much fun</li>
            <li> IN LOVE WITH THE SOFT SMELL.</li>
            <li> This scent is on the natural side which I find matches me more then some over price perfumes you find in a department store.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a perfume with a fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> I found this perfume oil in a store called Success Express in NJ when I was visiting family one year.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping it&#x27;d be a bit more masculine and earthy, but it still just smells like school teacher perfume to me.</li>
            <li> Had ran across it at a natural foods store but found a better deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money to purchase a smell online</li>
            <li> And people who can smell one kind of musk molecule just fine can still be anosmic to other kinds of musk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d thought I found the right perfume for me.</li>
            <li> the price was right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing it right now.</li>
            <li> She said it was just the right</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell right at all</li>
            <li> I usually prefer spray on fragrance as they are easy to use, but I love to roll this oil all over my wrists and beck to the point where I can smell the clean and gorgeous scent all day long.  </li>
            <li> A sweet musky scent that isn&#x27;t overly flowery like commercial perfumes and it isn&#x27;t too overwhelming like Patchouli.</li>
            <li> The smell is beautiful, simple, and different on each person who wears it.  </li>
            <li> Some of my favorite perfumes are Hillary Duff&#x27;s &#x27;With Love,&#x27; and B+BW&#x27;s Amber and Black Amethyst.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any qualms about ordering from him because if there&#x27;s ever a problem, he&#x27;s quick to respond and fix any mistakes (which I&#x27;ve only had one out of the many orders).</li>
            <li> Not sure what all the great reviews are about.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think Love would since I could barely smell it.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t count how many compliments I received from people at work, strangers in Starbucks and general people on the street.</li>
            <li> Not bad, really.</li>
            <li> , that is the advantage of wearing oils - as long as they mix well with your own skin oil.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this company and their quality natural perfume oils!  </li>
            <li> , floral with no soft, warm musky tones at all.</li>
            <li> This smells like warm skin bathed in cool blue moonlight, its really beyond description, as this scent is pure sexapill without the animal pheromones and fancy shmancy stinky perfume stuff they use these days.</li>
            <li> A nice smell, certainly, but not exactly reminiscent of Egypt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> This fragrance is warm and senual and it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it at all, it has a good staying power though but is a flowery scent, not very strong</li>
            <li> This oil is great for a day time dab and it last the entire day.</li>
            <li> I wasnt impressed with the scent, reminded me of an old closet smell, i&#x27;m 34yrs old and enjoy a variety of both subtle and pronounced scents but this wasnt fresh smelling at all.  </li>
            <li> The scent almost seems to change every few hours, which is kind of fun!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a clean light scent.  </li>
            <li> so the seller is very reliable!</li>
            <li> The egyptian musk oil I received is the exact product and quality I remember.  </li>
            <li> First time trying Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess Roll On Perfume.</li>
            <li> I think I only like 3 out of the 7 I bought which would be ONE LOVE AND EGYPTIAN GODDESS.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to Egyptian Goddess by my hair colorist.  </li>
            <li> I let my friend try this perfume with me before we went to do hot yoga together, and when we came out we were like</li>
            <li> When you walk into a shop of essential oils or health food store, this is the scent in the air most of the time.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy more items under this label in future.</li>
            <li> Its enough that its a not too light scent and not too heavy and can still be smelled by me and people around me who have complimented how great it smells.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking of ordering this make sure you read all the reviews and keep an open mind when you get it...</li>
            <li> Going to try the Love scent next too...</li>
            <li> Way too much of a bite!</li>
            <li> Not for me, thanks!</li>
            <li> what exactly is the \\&quot;magic\\&quot; formula in this,</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! .</li>
            <li> First time i bought this.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most scents especially ones that come as a spray.</li>
            <li> this is the only place i can find my favorite oil.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more when my supply gets low.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> Thanks bunches!</li>
            <li> This perfume is absolutely divine!  </li>
            <li> Now I have two favorite perfumes:  Lalique (French) and Egyptian Goddess...</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It is light and warm and floral but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> first day I put it on a ton of women</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying it</li>
            <li> I would most definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> My favorite above anything else.</li>
            <li> a funny thing she said to me</li>
            <li> The EXACT scent.</li>
            <li> Otherwise its one of those gifts you give out for xmas to someone you don&#x27;t exactly like.</li>
            <li> recently I was amazed how many people approach me asking me what I was wearing</li>
            <li> ( the first was the vanilla) and have given to my mother(she</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t recall him ever doing this, but it&#x27;s exactly the reception</li>
            <li> It is the only perfume that I have really enjoyed.</li>
            <li> This oil smells okay, but it does not last at all.  </li>
            <li> I reapplied a few times before I got a good concentration of fragrance.</li>
            <li> And the little bottle with the roller top is so easy and convenient to carry with you.</li>
            <li> After your nose can delineate between the fresh air and the scent, you&#x27;ll notice that the scent is actually quite strong.</li>
            <li> I found that the scent was not so strong as one would expect from a scented oil product, but the real problem was that wherever I touched it to my body, I started itching and developed a rash at the site of application.</li>
            <li> I never buy perfume or frangranced items online since I can&#x27;t obviously smell it for myself, but becuse there were so many positive reviews on this scent and</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I was expecting \\&quot;sexy\\&quot; and \\&quot;skin\\&quot;, but this is a sweet floral which doesn&#x27;t smell sexy to me.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle, if your used to spraying on a department store perfume and becoming lost in the fumes, then this is a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> im pretty positive</li>
            <li> I, too, could hardly detect a distinct aroma despite having a good sense of smell.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;d love to keep it as my own secret weapon...</li>
            <li> I can see how people say this smells old ladyish at first because it is on the sweet side, but what I like is after awhile</li>
            <li> I assume this must be a fake as there&#x27;s no way this could get so many good reviews?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very light scent and is warm, spicy and a little floral all at the same time.</li>
            <li> This scent screams feminine and grown up, a world away from those overpowering super sweet teenage girls perfumes that you can smell literally 20 feet away!</li>
            <li> Its not cloyingly sweet or floral like many typically \\&quot;girlie\\&quot; perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try it because the reviews seemed positive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m positive</li>
            <li> I was eager to try this, with all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> you will enjoy this light sexy scent when and if you get tired of all those floral scents everone is wearing.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> but mine usually lasts a good 6-8 hours</li>
            <li> oil based perfume is a sweet, soft musk smell with floral undertones...</li>
            <li> It is such a clean, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> Partially because everyone liked it but mainly for how it made me feel.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t over powering or too strong, just enough to catch attention in a positive way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh and wild and deep and sweet and full of mystery...</li>
            <li> Then I noticed that it stayed on a very, very long time, and the longer I had it on the more</li>
            <li> I got Black opium from vendor name \\&quot;Xtremek\\&quot;, that perfume oil still nice smell.</li>
            <li> When I smell them (even from a great distance away), I can get a migraine headache or even suffer a small R Temporal Lobe Seizure (I have adult on-set Epilepsy).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s warm yet soft, and it&#x27;s a little sweet, but not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> buy\\&quot; which can certainly lead to regretfu purchase..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pleasant musk - hard to explain really.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I will come back and edit this review as I use EG more, figuring out how it wears throughout the day, but my first impression was that it smelled of old library books.  </li>
            <li> It was not like the original one I purchased it barely has a fragrance  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably order a few more of these Auric Blends!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite fragrance, and its such a juxtaposition of soft and meaty, juicy and sweet sink your teeth in scent that I even roll it on my skin at night before going to bed.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells wonderful, but I could only give it 2 stars because of how weak the scent is.</li>
            <li> I tried this at first because it was attributed by two biographers to be the signature fragrance of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, who both waxed rhapsodic about it&#x27;s contribution to her unmistakable classic style.</li>
            <li> At this stage of my life however, I&#x27;d prefer to radiate a bit more modern chic and less earth mother. : )  Other than that, my package was expedited quickly and wrapped very well.</li>
            <li> The roll-on bottle is very easy to use, and allows you to put the oil exactly where you want it with no spilling or messy residue.  </li>
            <li> I do my best to stay active, but suffer from long and short term memory loss.</li>
            <li> It really does get stronger, unlike most other commercial scents, which start strong and then fade away.   </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s expensive but worth every penny and will make you happy.</li>
            <li> The delivery was really fast, I got it before the estimated delivery period</li>
            <li> receive soon as I expected love it</li>
            <li> but she really likes the scent so its for every age</li>
            <li> Five stars for the seller - fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stockpiling, I really am.</li>
            <li> Auric needs to really increase the scent to oil ratio.</li>
            <li> sadly, I am VERY disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it smells much nicer.</li>
            <li> He also commented that I smelled \\&quot;absolutely divine\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I need to really shake the bottle before use.</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance because it doesn&#x27;t quite smell like anything else out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really picky with scents</li>
            <li> then this is really up your alley.</li>
            <li> Amazon did refund promptly which I appreciated</li>
            <li> It is very sensual but down-to-earth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The strongest part of the scent reminded me of an old teacher I had in elementary school, or a grandmother..</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to wearing this scent.</li>
            <li> REALLY like it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve packed away the Coach, the Burberry, the Issy, the light blue and the Ed hardy.</li>
            <li> (well, my boyfriend did, after much hinting, then an outright \\&quot;I NEED THIS\\&quot; )  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;oil\\&quot; is very sticky/gummy on the skin too.</li>
            <li> I really like the stuff</li>
            <li> A very feminine and luxurious perfume oil</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much at all.</li>
            <li> sellers fast shipping</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame, it really smells...</li>
            <li> Smells cheap like Irish Spring.</li>
            <li> This was absolutely what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t really smell.</li>
            <li> The fragrance lasts all day &amp; the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I asked my husband to smell it and even he said he couldnt much..</li>
            <li> The reviews that are most helpful to me would be about the bottle the scent comes in, or if it arrived in the time expected.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve smelled versions of Egyptian Goddess before and they always smelled soapy or too much like a stick of incense.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> Not the real Egyptian Goddess.</li>
            <li> Go to WholeFoods to get the real perfume oil.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s light and stay about 4hours on my body but on 4th day when I open this bottle</li>
            <li> I trashed it straight away..</li>
            <li> Thanks : HP</li>
            <li> Very incense like, but also powdery and a bit musty.</li>
            <li> I have tried to give it away, but nobody wants it.  </li>
            <li> My issue with perfumes is they are all alcohol and make me sneeze so much this does not.</li>
            <li> Thanks everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it two stars for a fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Well...technically it didn&#x27;t really smell like anything.</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I remember a former manager of mine who I now think may have used this fragrance, as she always smelled strongly of said library books and particularly Kleenex.  </li>
            <li> While the product itself was of very nice quality, it had a bit too much of something really unappealing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is exactly what college in upstate New York smells like.</li>
            <li> This is more of a thanks to the company that makes it rather than a review to try to get other people to try it.</li>
            <li> Not too strong, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> One more thing, it&#x27;s extremely oily.</li>
            <li> Even though I love Egyptian Goddess, I like all of the other scents too just depending on my mood.  </li>
            <li> have loved and used this for the past few years as a friend told me it was her favorite scent</li>
            <li> I just had my first daughter and the post office is so far away!</li>
            <li> I have noticed a lot of people claim their purchase has &amp;#34;no scent&amp;#34; - this is probably due to about 50% of the population being anosmic to most synthetic musks.  </li>
            <li> One or several of the reviews stated the aroma would become more apparent as the perfume/tube was exposed to the air.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It wears pretty close to the skin and is light without being sharp or soapy, ever so slightly nutty, evocative of clean skin with emphasis on skin rather than clean.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a while back and loved it so much that I purchased a larger bottle from a different seller.</li>
            <li> If u want to try the REAL version, order it from the Auric Blends site directly!!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft and strong at the same time.</li>
            <li> This has a beautiful scent, but it seems rather faint when sniffing it from the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have found that the bottle needs to be exposed to air for a while (just by opening it and using it daily) for the full strength of the fragrance to emerge.  </li>
            <li> Top notch natural perfume oil, been addicted to the Egyptian Goddess oil for 20 years now. :)</li>
            <li> Just wish the smell would last longer but for the price point it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> &quot; It&#x27;s a comforting, sweet scent, but it smells old, as in a popular scent that we grew up with when we were little, so it lends itself as an older woman scent from the last generation.</li>
            <li> I have the Black Opium and Love scents in addition to this one</li>
            <li> The Sexy Black Egyptian Goddess</li>
            <li> I am more purchasing from Xtremek Black opium.</li>
            <li> Love the smell its practically last the entire day and doesn&#x27;t lose the strength in its smell.</li>
            <li> Its a mysterious blend of deep and sexy smells.</li>
            <li> It will infuse your clothing in the same way that classic fragrances used to do before they were designed to dissipate quickly.  </li>
            <li> I think of older women when I smell this by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Almost one year later, and I&#x27;m back for more.</li>
            <li> i bought this product mainly because of the reviews.</li>
            <li> Patchouli is classic and tried and true.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want Egyptian Musk do yourself a favor and get the better quality more expensive Abdul Kareem oil.</li>
            <li> They still need to work on the quality of their candles, the wick burns straight down the center within a few hours (instead of the 70-80 hours on the label) but I use the remaining wax in my candle warmer for a light version of this beautiful scent.</li>
            <li> Meaning, the scent dissapates (at least on me) after a half day or so.     Love it and love the price!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was on of the very first to get Botox for my Migraines before it even was approved by the FDA by my Neurologist back in 2000.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at all the good reviews all over the internet, and decided I cant go wrong, and they are right</li>
            <li> Guys, if your wife is killing your budget with high-end perfume purchases, I highly recommend you ask her to try this fragrance.</li>
            <li> for people that don&#x27;t want to be overrun with a high end perfume smell.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back for more in the very near future.</li>
            <li> and it changed a little bit more.  </li>
            <li> I love these little roll-ons.</li>
            <li> Finding Egyptian Goddess Oil in a little shop in Jackson, Wyoming seemed appropriate.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try Egyptian Goddess to compare it with Abdul Kareem Egyptian oil since it&#x27;s a little cheaper, more portable.</li>
            <li> Honestly, you can tell it&#x27;s a nice-smelling perfume because of the occasional hints of fragrance that come out of the bottle, but they&#x27;re so rare that you&#x27;re really left with what some other reviewers described as car oil smell, which I guess is like the basis oil the perfume uses.</li>
            <li> Long lasting fragrance that didn&#x27;t highly appeal to me, but is simply okay.</li>
            <li> So disappointing as the fragrance is incredible.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t smoke...but its a strangely weird scent and uncommon</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this perfume based on the great reviews written but unfortunately, it is just was not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible and it&#x27;s not fabulous.</li>
            <li> could barely detect any fragrance at all after I first rolled it on.</li>
            <li> did try layering with my everyday perfume, and it added more musk and spiciness, which I thought was lacking.</li>
            <li> and for what its worth it doesnt even last 1 hour..by which I mean,after 1 hour when I smelled the area I rubbed it in,there was nothing!</li>
            <li> Also my husband politely didn&#x27;t say anything until I asked his opinion, of which he said &amp;#34;It&#x27;s like a business professional scent, nice but not sexy.</li>
            <li> This scent smells really good; I&#x27;m not sure what different scents they used</li>
            <li> This scent in not common.</li>
            <li> Pretty much the same reason I cannot give it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn Amber Romance from Victoria&#x27;s Secret for years and while my husband never complained about the scent, he never nuzzled up on me and told me how good I smelled.  </li>
            <li> In the future I will try other roll-on oils and most certainly the seller.</li>
            <li> Guys always love a faint smell on a woman, when its so strong that you can smell her from 5 yards away everyones thinking</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell musky to me at all, just slightly earthy and very sweet.</li>
            <li> The other fragrances I bought stay very true to what they smell like out of the bottle, which is preferable, but this one seems to change completely depending on body temperature.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 24) but it definitely has the right amount of floral and musky notes.</li>
            <li> Strange thing happened today at the super market.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried because it does smell more mature than what people my age normally wear</li>
            <li> It does smell very nice, however the smell is extremely faint</li>
            <li> It is very, very soft and only smellable if you put your nose right to your skin.</li>
            <li> Memories of traveling to F street in Washington D.C. purchasing egyptian musk oil and other items from coner stands that were run primarily by jamaicans.   </li>
            <li> I love the scent, it is vey powerful so a little goes a long Way!</li>
            <li> Enjoy this perfume oil,it begs to be worn,shared&amp;experienced..just be careful in crowded places,you may find yourself overwhelmed!</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think this scent was strong enough, but after a few times, I realized I REALLY</li>
            <li> This new formulation has NO scent.</li>
            <li> I just knew that I needed to try something new</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new scent to change things up.  </li>
            <li> Rather it combines the earthy sensuality of musk with exotic overtones such as sandalwood to create a rich scent that is both distinctive yet subtle.  </li>
            <li> After so many failed attempts to find a subtle, yet sultry scent I have finally found the perfect one!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m looking forward to purchasing a larger bottle as well as solid perfume(when available).</li>
            <li> I was very surprised she did</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as if I&#x27;m not wearing anything at all, and I have a very sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a new perfume for your significant other give this a try</li>
            <li> Use a little more if you don&#x27;t think you can smell it (think rolling a spot the size of a nickel on wrists and throat), and it will develop over an hour into a stronger, more complex scent.</li>
            <li> WOW WE CAN STILLLLL SMELL THIS!</li>
            <li> I was first introduce to this by a mutual friend last year</li>
            <li> Initially when you first buy the perfume, you may need to put on about 12\\&quot; of it on your body to detect the scent.</li>
            <li> Musk scents are created by several different types of molecules and interestingly, some people are anosmic to these molecules -- simply can&#x27;t smell them.</li>
            <li> Not really my favorite fragrance but its ok.</li>
            <li> Everyone who knows me calls this my scent because I have worn it for nearly 8-9 years and its not a common perfume.</li>
            <li> I had to go put some on after reading all the other reviews and it is so familiar to me.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m usually not picky</li>
            <li> BUT IT WAS THE EXACT SAME SCENT.</li>
            <li> the buying is simple and the shipping is so fast!</li>
            <li> Many other reviewers have the same experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a big lover of musk perfumes and was STUNNED when I opened this and smelled it for the first time.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t fully care for the initial \\&quot;spicy\\&quot; scent when I first put it on, but as the oil soaks in, my body heat sort of makes it bloom.  </li>
            <li> I was also a little worried that it might be too strong</li>
            <li> ,I had also read in some reviews that the bottle just might need to be exposed to the air a little to really bring out the true scent,I gave it 2 days on my skin,which you can not get off for about 2 days any way,even after scrubbing in the shower,..</li>
            <li> This will definitely be my scent of choice for as long as the make it available.</li>
            <li> By far a extremely well worth perfume!</li>
            <li> Not sure how Kleenex and library books are translated into \\&quot;soft sexy powdery musk\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Right from the bottle, the oil is odorless, and at first I was a little dissapointed when it came in the mail.</li>
            <li> Based on the overall positive reviews here (and the price), I decided to try this oil.</li>
            <li> I returned for refund as well as a large bottle of the same fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The particles are simply too large for some people to smell.  </li>
            <li> and I thought I would order from amazon rather than the auric blends site because it was free shipping and a little cheaper..</li>
            <li> almost gave up on this little bottle of oil after a mere 2 wears, but luckily I came back on Amazon and read a few more reviews saying the bottle almost needs to breathe to really develop a good scent.  </li>
            <li> Order the larger bottle and refill your little one :)</li>
            <li> The roller ball to apply it was stuck, and once I was able to get the oil out, I could hardly smell anything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe, so if one was curious about what all the Egyptian oil user rave about, this is a good place to start.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightly floral with just enough musk, but devoid of the animalic/unshowered woman smell that some of them can take on.  </li>
            <li> even my 13 year old daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering it directly from Auric Blends website</li>
            <li> so I can actually smell like the real stuff.</li>
            <li> The next day and ever since, when I use it I can&#x27;t smell much, just the hint, and only if I put my nose very close to the wrist and sniff it well.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the bottle we got was old or defective.</li>
            <li> I had intended to try the Amber that Auric Blends offers as well</li>
            <li> I tried to wash it off (hence the much hand-washing) but again, 9 hours later I can still smell it and my husband won&#x27;t get close to me.</li>
            <li> I wonder if they sent me an old bottle.  </li>
            <li> It is soft and is not over powering on.  </li>
            <li> I make sure to have at least 1 of these in my perfume collection.  </li>
            <li> I tried this fragrance out at a store near my house that sells all of the auric blends perfumes.  </li>
            <li> SMELLS LIKE AN OLD LADY.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend even said I smelled like an old lady.</li>
            <li> I dressed in my costume, fixed my makeup and hair while inhaling my E.Musk incense and that scent did it for me.</li>
            <li> It drives her wild when I wear it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being REALLY picky about scents,(I only wear two)</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s old or what</li>
            <li> And it really does last a while.</li>
            <li> We now see the commercials on TV for Botox and Migraines quite frequently.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old told me I smelled like a dog.</li>
            <li> Arrived early.</li>
            <li> Khiel&#x27;s is the real deal while products such as this are imposters.,</li>
            <li> I am suspecting that the item that I got is an old batch.</li>
            <li> wow ,I said you can find it there</li>
            <li> (came 2 days early)</li>
            <li> from\\&quot;OLD</li>
            <li> The scent completely changed &amp; wore off almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> Oh god the old lady perfume smell...</li>
            <li> I love this scent - but it only lasts a few moments.</li>
            <li> And really how often do random men tell you that you smell nice?</li>
            <li> it smells really good, but unfortunately, the smell lasts for about 5 mins after applying and thats it.</li>
            <li> I have worn this oil perfume for years and usually buy it here in Vermont, but this was so easy and no travel.  </li>
            <li> But who knows, maybe the more they sell the less they&#x27;ll charge(hah) or at least in these tough economic times a good review</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle, last long n pleasant.</li>
            <li> Musky for sure, but there&#x27;s a subtle sweetness to it.</li>
            <li> the only thing I smell is a slight hint of Patchouli which is fine</li>
            <li> It is different from anything I have, and I wear it every other couple of days and when I go walking because the clean scent helps me stay motivated.</li>
            <li> Please note that this is just my perception of these scents and that I typically prefer earthy over floral, powders, or fresh</li>
            <li> I rolled a little bit on my wrists when I first opened the package, and can still detect the scent 9 hours later, despite much hand-washing (up to my wrists), getting caught in a rainstorm, and doing the dishes.</li>
            <li> and I recommend curious buyers pay attention to the positive feedback, and buy it from this seller.</li>
            <li> I am aware that an individual&#x27;s personal chemistry can affect perfumes, but I expect some scent, even if different once applied.</li>
            <li> There are no other detectable notes but smoke and fireplace.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong enough, but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I opened it and without smelling it first just rolled a little bit on my arm, I smelled like an old lady all day (no offense intended).</li>
            <li> I would purchase from seller in the near future.</li>
            <li> I consider it a fragrance that whispers, yet loud enough to be heard without being offensive.</li>
            <li> I can barely smell it.</li>
            <li> Wow, I only wore this one day</li>
            <li> The scent is barely detectable.</li>
            <li> oil and the fragrance is barely perceptible.  </li>
            <li> I personally think it smells like old lady perfume.</li>
            <li> I have been trying for years to find a light, sweet, floral perfume that didn&#x27;t smell like sickening sweet cotton candy or bubble-gum.  </li>
            <li> To sum it up very quickly: Do not buy this scent if you are under the age of 75; it smells like old lady, exactly.  </li>
            <li> My Egyptian Goddess has finally run out, with not daily, but very frequent use.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure because my nose becomes immune to the scent quickly.</li>
            <li> Are larger bottles in the near future?</li>
            <li> My old Egptian Musk would last the entire day</li>
            <li> I cant belive how people can give this absolute piece of crap so many positive reviews,which tricked me into buying this..</li>
            <li> You will definately not be disappointed and happy that you purchased this.  </li>
            <li> However, for now, I will go back to Kiehl&#x27;s,  and buy their original musk oil which lasts at least 1/2 a day on my body.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this product or any other auric blends product.  </li>
            <li> I will spend the extra few dollars and go to the real site!</li>
            <li> Its sexual and earthy and makes me feel like running around naked with a tribe of dirty tree huggers!! :)</li>
            <li> It goes on with a very soft scent, a bit sweet and very subtle.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the others that it does smell really good, however, the smell is so weak that i cant hardly smell it.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s never given much more than a shrug with any other scent I waft beneath his nose, so the instant dislike of this was serious.</li>
            <li> This particular brand is consistent with all other Egyptian Musk oils that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I even put a little bit of the scent on my upper lip so that I could smell it through out the day instead of sniffing my hand the whole time.</li>
            <li> The first time you wear it, you&#x27;ll think it has very little scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very subtle but is still strong enough to smell without having to load it on or reapply during the day.</li>
            <li> This has a casual, flirty scent that I love for every day.</li>
            <li> I cannot use regular perfumes due to the fact that I suffer from chronic migraines and am ultra sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s weird at first, but once it&#x27;s on for a while it smells better, and it lasts for at least 6-8 hours.</li>
            <li> Its subtle yet intriguing.</li>
            <li> I am still having Seizures constantly and taking several meds.</li>
            <li> Fans of Egyptian Goddess would probably enjoy \\&quot;Special Delivery\\&quot; from the small soapery Dirty Sanchez Soaps on Etsy; it&#x27;s an extremely similar musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and if I feel I need a little more later in the day its small enough that I carry it in my purse and can refresh with a little dab on my wrist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting and people always ask me what it is.</li>
            <li> it went flat.  </li>
            <li> and I had been looking for a patchouli that dries down softly.</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last very long either.</li>
            <li> it had a slight perfumey smell when I opened it and rolled it on my wrist but given my expectations based on these glowing reviews it was a complete letdown.</li>
            <li> The other thing I love about it is that my wife used to buy really expensive high-end perfume</li>
            <li> This oil has little to no fragrance, you can smell it a little at first, then nothing.</li>
            <li> its a closely guarded secret!...</li>
            <li> It has a long life though</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and I get lots of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it lasts so long considering the price.  </li>
            <li> This perfume oil lasts for a long time and is never overpowering.</li>
            <li> It lasts long too.  </li>
            <li> A friend introduced me to this perfume oil in college, and while the bottle lasted (which was a long time)</li>
            <li> Egyptian Goddess has been my go-to fragrance for a long time now.</li>
            <li> (The &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; perfume lingers even after a long day &amp; lasts on scarves, etc....)  </li>
            <li> you never know how long it&#x27;s sat around &amp; who tampered with it.  </li>
            <li> not clear.</li>
            <li> Ok so at first I hated it.</li>
            <li> Every batch is slightly varied, but the basic scent is always the same.</li>
            <li> I have to say, the reviews that the smell is \\&quot;horrific\\&quot; and other negative things -- are almost funny to me.  </li>
            <li> Better than any of my expensive perfumes!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s completely dry and sunken into my skin</li>
            <li> fragrance reminds me of my Kindergarten teachers and older women in their late 30s up to 60s wearing this stuff.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough to last through the day.</li>
            <li> I shopped at two local stores - one closed and the other stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li> The first two times I rolled this on, the smell reminded me of  baby powder AND after rolling it on both wrists, behind ears and on neck, the scent was GONE from my wrists.</li>
            <li> Obviously it&#x27;s not a great idea to buy any type of perfume online without knowing it first.  </li>
            <li> and I actually threw this product away because it had absolutely no scent!!</li>
            <li> The roll-on is small enough to carry on a plane and it&#x27;s the only fragrance I take with me on trips.</li>
            <li> Objects you handle regularly pick up a faint but recognizable trace of this enchanting scent.  </li>
            <li> probably less than I had paid for it 5 years earlier.</li>
            <li> above half of the bottle still remains...</li>
            <li> This item is so great smelling, it seems a waste to spend a lot of money on expensive, over-priced scents that are not nearly as good!</li>
            <li> I have read the negative reviews from other seller&#x27;s reviews about this particular oil</li>
            <li> I put a little bit on my hands and wound up having to wash my hands several times just to get the smell off.</li>
            <li> It smelled like unscented oil w/ a little TINY hint of Egyptian Goddess.</li>
            <li> little goes along way, and the fragrant last all day.</li>
            <li> stinky smell and wont even last for a sec!!!</li>
            <li> However, it is a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I want my money back... or at least the same roll on stuff</li>
            <li> , so its not very noticeable.</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no fragrance to any of the four bottles that I purchased.  </li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not a big waste of cash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this specific scent of oil for a few years</li>
            <li> She gave me the empty bottle of the roll on</li>
            <li> Even though the bottle is empty and( I do not do that with folks I do not know,)</li>
            <li> In reading reviews, alot said it smelled different on everyday</li>
            <li> It had absolutely no fragrance to it whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Once my mother reminded me, I remembered that she used to wear this perfume when I was younger ( her and a few other women).</li>
            <li> It is very difficult for me to go shopping on Sundays because Men and Women have gotten all dressed up for Church and have applied cologne and strong perfumes that I can smell at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> With an inexpensive perfume brand like Auric, you can generally expect to find one or two scents done surprisingly well amid a lot of scents that are mediocre or, frankly, bad.</li>
            <li> I was curious about the other scents they have, so I went to the Auric Blends website.  </li>
            <li> , my only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t las as long as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> This is soft and subtle and doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze when applying.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t linger long.</li>
            <li> I bought the roll on and wanted very much to like it, but, unfortunately, this one is not for me.</li>
            <li> ,I GOT IT DUE</li>
            <li> The Other Man : John F. Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Bessette, and Me]]).  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use anything other perfume or scent in years.</li>
            <li> I am extremely bummed out.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning to try other Auric Blends.</li>
            <li> and it is not diluted like other egyptian musks I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was the vender, or if this is standard for this blend.  </li>
            <li> This has absolutely no fragrance at all,and I could detect it only if I smelled hard..</li>
            <li> And, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long on me, which is very disappointing, because oil perfumes are supposed to have lasting power, and that is one of the main reasons I purchased it.</li>
            <li> its not right.</li>
            <li> The musk is accompanied by some quiet and unobtrusive woods and spices that are hard to pick out (which in this case means they&#x27;re doing their job well).</li>
            <li> , oh let me go back and smell again, type of scent, it&#x27;s hard to explain.</li>
            <li> Because it is an oil, watch out if you have leather furniture because the oil will transfer and make a dark spot.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my husband really dislikes the smell.</li>
            <li> Not worth it,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for at least 6 months and it still retains its fragrance, unlike the Egyptian Goddess that I purchased at the same time.</li>
            <li> My ONLY complaint is that it does not wear all day.</li>
            <li> You either hate it or love it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no place on their web site to ask about what the base oil is, and the phone number on the bottle just gives you a phone tree with options to buy more.</li>
            <li> and I swear it&#x27;s never let me down.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for years and have never been let down.</li>
            <li> I like to mix it with the Sandalwood oil to take some of the sweetness down.  </li>
            <li> and I knew I could not set it down.</li>
            <li> She had her window down and waited for me to move it out of her way.</li>
            <li> they had auric blend&#x27;s other scents!)  </li>
            <li> seriously words can&#x27;t describe it; complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> and instead I get a very sharp, watery (muguet?)</li>
            <li> I almost want to say it was just vegetable oil, but it had a slight burnt rubber smell to it.</li>
            <li> and I find that it is gone from my skin in less than an hour.  </li>
            <li> Is it going to be slightly floral, is it going to be a sultry musk?  </li>
            <li> It smells like your typical scented oil at a head shop.</li>
            <li> A little goes along way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to bet the wrong scent was packaged altogether!</li>
            <li> I rub a little on each arm and a little on my chest after showeing and it lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> It was weak, and only lasted minutes on my skin (and my skin tends to hold</li>
            <li> It smells a little spicy, musky, a little powdery, a little floral, a bit medicinal.</li>
            <li> , i thought it&#x27;d stay on little longer.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s a little too musky for spring or summer though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to try their other scents, but now I am not sure I should stray from the patchouli.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever, too, because you use so little.</li>
            <li> Also i broke out a little with redness and itching where I applied it.</li>
            <li> However, the oil was missing the roller ball</li>
            <li> Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the price for an everyday scent.</li>
            <li> I GOT FEW COMPLIMENTS</li>
            <li> I spread some on my skin, after I shook the bottle vigorously, and waited a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> It no longer lasts longer than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I purchased a few.</li>
            <li> so i wouldnt waste it.</li>
            <li> hope that this helps a few people.</li>
            <li> Its not that harsh on your skin and doesn&#x27;t have an in your face smell.</li>
            <li> order was placed and within a few days I recieved my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Happy Customer</li>
            <li> waste money on this \\&quot;Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess\\&quot; by DayDream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell</li>
            <li> Then a few weeks a go</li>
            <li> not what I was expecting... waste of money...</li>
            <li> I purchased Egyptian Goddess a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money and was ripped off.</li>
            <li> The first time I applied, it was very faint and lasted a few minutes.</li>
            <li> haha, I need to send this crap back.</li>
            <li> I discovered it about 8 years ago, then the store I used to buy it at stopped stocking it, for some odd reason (why?!</li>
            <li> its not strong at all tho</li>
            <li> my family members laugh on me so badly, and we realized no more scent smell and it&#x27;s \\&quot;just oil</li>
            <li> Not a strong smell</li>
            <li> I am an avid amazon customer and this is by far the worst thing I have ever purchased online..</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this scent barely lasts two minutes on me.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Goddess is sort of like a sweet patchouli, with a hint of menthol, and maybe a base note of something like a milky amber and a touch of sandalwood.</li>
            <li> a little touch of it is all you need and it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> You are paying for a bottle of oil with very little scent in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that is never satisfied with a scent.  </li>
            <li> never satisfied until now.  </li>
            <li> I was actually sent the wrong perfume.</li>
            <li> The company sent me a Patchouli scent, which I normally love, but what I got was terrible.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s difficult to get the oil out without rubbing over skin numerous times.</li>
            <li> I think that how faint it is actually makes it sexyy.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is faint when you open the bottle cap and sniff it.</li>
            <li> The scent is so faint - not at all like the bottle I bought in a shop locally.</li>
            <li> but I wish someone had smelled it before they sent it to me, because it was obviously something wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Small bottle</li>
            <li> /&gt;Put a small drop on each wrist, OR roll it around your neck.</li>
            <li> Oh, I&#x27;m so sorry that I didn&#x27;t buy the larger bottle</li>
            <li> I have been wearing one Auric Blend roll-on perfume or another for the past 15 years and receive compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> I usually purchase it at Renn Faires but couldn&#x27;t go</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why Amazon won&#x27;t let me place a separate review for it - so I am attaching it here:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use Auric Oils as my perfumes because they are mellow, not harsh and artificial smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this and it smells NOTHING like what I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> prefer to get it in this small bottle, with the roll-on applicator.</li>
            <li> I can only think that it is just too weak to have a scent when spread thinly on the skin.</li>
            <li> Wow, I was definitely wrong to do that!</li>
            <li> these reviews really got me hopeful, and I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> it was so strong and terrible.</li>
            <li> hardly know I have on a musk at all.</li>
            <li> It can be hard to find</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to explain in words what it smells like because it&#x27;s like nothing I&#x27;ve smelled before.</li>
            <li> High praise for the seller, however I am somewhat disappointed in the scent.</li>
            <li> Someone complements them at least once a week.</li>
            <li> I have been using Egyptian Goddess for at least about 7 years</li>
            <li> Its a tad thick for my taste</li>
            <li> I rolled it on anyway, and let it soak in because its quite viscous, and slowly the scent started to release from my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed it had leaked when it arrived &amp; was only half full...or perhaps  it had been used or something.</li>
            <li> very small, and its some times hard</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews stating that this perfume was too faint, and that you couldn&#x27;t smell the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what happened with the Egyptian Goddess, but pee-yew!  </li>
            <li> When I got it I was somewhat disappointed because I thought it smelled like old ladies, but the smell grew on me.</li>
            <li> Very pointless having a perfume oil that doesn&#x27;t have a scent.</li>
            <li> Its a subtle scent that strengthen over time with your body heat.     </li>
            <li> , It seriously  makes my boyfriend drool</li>
            <li> I seriously couldn&#x27;t smell a thing.  </li>
            <li> it seriously smells just like vegetable oil...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle, and portable.    </li>
            <li> I always wear Cashmere by Donna Karan but that is a little expensive.  </li>
            <li> but the last bottle of roll on I got from PENNY LANE GIFTS here on Amazon was BAD.</li>
            <li> I took a chance and ordered anyways, thinking they must have had bad noses or had actually got used to the smell.</li>
            <li> Maybe it just doesn&#x27;t mix well with my body chemistry, or as I said earlier, maybe I just got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I know, that is kinda crazy and extreme, but a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do.  </li>
            <li> This oil is so diluted and weak.</li>
            <li> :/ Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Scent was weak.</li>
            <li> not good; it does  not have no smell, poor quality ...dont buy it&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its thick and absorbs without being oil, greasy, or sticky!  </li>
            <li> The oil seems very thick as well</li>
            <li> I buy and hate it shortly after.  </li>
            <li> I smelled this perfume on a girl at a ball game and HAD to know what it was...</li>
            <li> and I have yet to get tired of it.</li>
            <li> very subtle yet feminine</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very subtle.  </li>
            <li> Very subtle oil.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just sad and unnecessary meanness.)  </li>
            <li> The smell is a little faint, but thats not necissarily a bad thing.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch, but the ingredient that MAKES this scent seems to be missing!?</li>
            <li> I tried shaking it, but still very weak scent.</li>
            <li> what a waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> I have compliments on my perfume EVERYDAY!!!!</li>
            <li> so applying it is quite difficult.</li>
            <li> Until then I would not purchase again sadly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why everyone is complaining about the faint smell.</li>
            <li> Disappointing, to say the least, and I am afraid I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> Expensive perfumes just don&#x27;t have this staying power.</li>
            <li> Even the texture of the oil felt wrong, if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It drives me crazy, because I WANT to like it, but alas, I cannot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this type of scent gives me headaches.</li>
            <li> Came out in a weird greasy way from roller.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not longer disappointed and use it everyday!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the fault of the perfume oil or the shipper, but merely an olfactory issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this smells like indian food and there is nothing wrong with food, just something wrong with the odor.  </li>
            <li> I always get compliments on it, my husband loves it, and it has replaced all of my expensive perfumes I used to wear.</li>
            <li> I smell a faint musk underneath, but the predominant note is rubber.</li>
            <li> Sorry.....</li>
            <li> I sit here still with the scent on my wrist\\&quot;unable to get it off \\</li>
            <li> I work with walks in and says it smells weird in here</li>
            <li> I thought I got cold</li>
            <li> This product was so disappointing.</li>
            <li> The scent is very faint-</li>
            <li> If they made Patchouli smell bad, I don&#x27;t even want to think what they could do with the Egyptian Musk.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was a bad bottle,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad-</li>
            <li> (maybe I got a bad bottle?</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad bottle?</li>
            <li> &quot; this is the my bad experience of this product....</li>
            <li> bad luck that I don&#x27;t get online</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have smelling like a dog it was just that bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Egyptian Goddess for over a decade,  and I never get sick of it.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed with this perfume oil.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>
            <li> almost every musk oil fragrance on Amazon has its share of disappointed reviews from people insisting the product smells like nothing at all.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed</li>
            <li> and I must say, I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was 100% disappointed by the aroma of Egyptian Goddess.  </li>
            <li> Totally disappointed ....</li>
            <li> I know Auric Blends isn&#x27;t stupid and they haven&#x27;t changed the fragrance...</li>
            <li> I hate those.</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> but I hate to have to return things.</li>
            <li> To me the smell is annoying.  </li>
            <li> Blech.</li>
            <li> What am I suppose to do with this bottle of crap?</li>
            <li> Very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I hated it.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I received my oils.  </li>
            <li> However, I was very disappointed with the oil.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this and will not purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed ...</li>
            <li> I got the WRONG oil in the mail this morning!!!!!</li>
            <li> but this is awful.</li>
            <li> So disappointed!!</li>
            <li> This oil smells like CRAP!!!</li>
            <li> the smell it does give is sooooo terrible</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This scent was considered &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; so I figured I would give it a try. It was immensely floral!!!! It has a long life though, I am still smelling it 24 hours after applying one swipe to each wrist. The delivery was really fast, I got it before the estimated delivery period so the seller is very reliable!</li>
            <li> This isy wife&#x27;s favorite perfume and comes at a great price on amazon. If you are looking for a new perfume for your significant other give this a try</li>
            <li> receive soon as I expected love it</li>
            <li> Fabulous scent. Great price. Will be acquiring more!  This item is so great smelling, it seems a waste to spend a lot of money on expensive, over-priced scents that are not nearly as good!</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It lasts a long time and I get lots of compliments on it. On me, it has a musky jasmine scent that I just adore.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have ordered it before. It&#x27;s a great smell and because it&#x27;s an oil, it lasts for hours unlike spray perfumes. However, the oil was missing the roller ball so applying it is quite difficult.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that is never satisfied with a scent.  I buy and hate it shortly after.  Well, I just love this Egyptian Goddess scent!  My husband won&#x27;t stop hugging me and nuzzling my neck!  Back in the 70&#x27;s I wore Ambergris Oil by Jovan.  After it was discontinued I&#x27;ve been searching and searching...never satisfied until now.  I&#x27;m going to get the big bottle and also the soap.  I&#x27;m just so happy I have a scent again that is ME.  Thank you Auric and also Amazon.:)</li>
            <li> everyone loves this scent. very subtle yet feminine</li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly.  Perfume was well packaged, so there was no case of possible breakage during shipment. I would purchase from seller in the near future.</li>
            <li> I really hoped this was as good as the reviews I had read about this product, well it was even better!!! I love this perfume its nice and comfortable make you feel sexy, even my 13 year old daughter loves it. I was very surprised she did but she really likes the scent so its for every age you will enjoy this light sexy scent when and if you get tired of all those floral scents everone is wearing.</li>
            <li> Long lasting fragrance that didn&#x27;t highly appeal to me, but is simply okay. Kind of smells like laundry detergent with florals. It is different from anything I have, and I wear it every other couple of days and when I go walking because the clean scent helps me stay motivated. It&#x27;s not terrible and it&#x27;s not fabulous. Not sure what all the great reviews are about. Glad it was cheap.    Apply lightly, and preferable not on your arms. Because it is an oil, watch out if you have leather furniture because the oil will transfer and make a dark spot. Yep, that happened to me.</li>
            <li> Love the smell its practically last the entire day and doesn&#x27;t lose the strength in its smell. I normally roll on my wrist :)</li>
            <li> The smell of egyptian musk brings back memories.  Memories of traveling to F street in Washington D.C. purchasing egyptian musk oil and other items from coner stands that were run primarily by jamaicans.   The egyptian musk oil I received is the exact product and quality I remember.  Item arrived on time, 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is, and has been for many years now, my wife&#x27;s favorite fragrance. I have to admit I love it on her too. This fragrance is so light, soft and sexy. The other thing I love about it is that my wife used to buy really expensive high-end perfume so we&#x27;re saving $$$ with Egyptian Goddess priced at $7 for 1/3 oz. Guys, if your wife is killing your budget with high-end perfume purchases, I highly recommend you ask her to try this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was actually sent the wrong perfume. The company sent me a Patchouli scent, which I normally love, but what I got was terrible.  I put a little bit on my hands and wound up having to wash my hands several times just to get the smell off. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was too strong and really didn&#x27;t smell good at all.  If they made Patchouli smell bad, I don&#x27;t even want to think what they could do with the Egyptian Musk.</li>
            <li> I would give this a 1/5 if we were talking about the quality of the product I recieved... but the scent itself gets 5/5. Egyptian Goddess is an amazing scent. So incredible its cult like in its following. I know Auric Blends isn&#x27;t stupid and they haven&#x27;t changed the fragrance... but the last bottle of roll on I got from PENNY LANE GIFTS here on Amazon was BAD. It smelled like unscented oil w/ a little TINY hint of Egyptian Goddess. Amazon, hold PENNY LANE accountable for selling us defective stuff! I want my money back... or at least the same roll on stuff I got last summer from Tom&#x27;s Incense. I&#x27;m ordering it directly from Auric Blends website so I can actually smell like the real stuff.</li>
            <li> First time trying Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess Roll On Perfume. I have a very good sense of smell and I actually threw this product away because it had absolutely no scent!! Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> This oil has little to no fragrance, you can smell it a little at first, then nothing. I will not purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> When I opened and applied the perfume at first, I was thrilled with the soft smell. I&#x27;d thought I found the right perfume for me. The next day and ever since, when I use it I can&#x27;t smell much, just the hint, and only if I put my nose very close to the wrist and sniff it well. The smell is still very nice, but it&#x27;s barely detectable to almost nonexistent.</li>
            <li> I purchased about 7 different ones by reading reviews. I think I only like 3 out of the 7 I bought which would be ONE LOVE AND EGYPTIAN GODDESS. I like the LOVE one if it was a bit stronger but I like scents that last and I didn&#x27;t think Love would since I could barely smell it. But this one is great. I will be ordering the larger bottle.</li>
            <li> My wife smelled this on someone else, and was happy to own for herself. But when we got it, it had virtually no scent at all. Perhaps the bottle we got was old or defective. But not at all what she had thought it would be. We returned it, and Amazon was AMAZING about giving us our money back.</li>
            <li> This scent is so earthy and pleasant.  Five stars for the seller - fast delivery.  I don&#x27;t like the roller tube, it&#x27;s difficult to get the oil out without rubbing over skin numerous times.</li>
            <li> While this perfume oil is definitely a musk, it&#x27;s the cleanest most delicious smell I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;ve bought Lovely by SJP, I&#x27;ve gotten DK Gold, I&#x27;ve tried Gwen Stefani LAMB... All of them have yet to come close in comparison to how wonderful this perfume smells to me. My best friend fell in love with it and asks for it for her birthday every year. My boyfriend says it smells so good it must be pheromones. It&#x27;s always boosted my mood and my confidence level when I wear it, some people have a power suit, some people have power mascara, I have my super stick of Egyptian Goddess and I swear it&#x27;s never let me down. This is more of a thanks to the company that makes it rather than a review to try to get other people to try it. Honestly, I&#x27;d love to keep it as my own secret weapon... But who knows, maybe the more they sell the less they&#x27;ll charge(hah) or at least in these tough economic times a good review will keep them from going out of business.  I&#x27;m stockpiling, I really am. Every paycheck I get, I buy 5 bottles. You wont find it for a better price. Someday, it&#x27;ll probably be gone... I honestly don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do, I&#x27;ve tried other companies and Auric Blends is the best of the best. I don&#x27;t know, there&#x27;s just something about it. My boyfriend can tell the difference too.  It smells different on everyone, stronger on some than others, but always good. I get headaches from scents so easily, LAMB really kills me after a while... But this stuff always smells good to me. Even when I have a migraine it&#x27;s the one smell that doesn&#x27;t bother me, it always relaxes me.  Give it a shot(or don&#x27;t, lol), and thankyou Auric Blends.</li>
            <li> i love this smell!! its not strong at all tho, so its not very noticeable. and its not fruity at all, thats what i wanted. very small, and its some times hard so roll it on, but not enough to be a problem.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a musk oil  roll-on and came across this. After reading the reviews of the scent and the seller, I decided to try this.  High praise for the seller, however I am somewhat disappointed in the scent. The first two times I rolled this on, the smell reminded me of  baby powder AND after rolling it on both wrists, behind ears and on neck, the scent was GONE from my wrists. Unfortunately this scent barely lasts two minutes on me. On the positive side, the baby powder smell went away and the scent of the Egyptian Goddess came through, which I like, and  is a lovely summer days scent.  I was so hoping this would last for a while on my skin. In the future I will try other roll-on oils and most certainly the seller. However, for now, I will go back to Kiehl&#x27;s,  and buy their original musk oil which lasts at least 1/2 a day on my body. I will keep the E.Goddess and ue it as aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I receive many compliments when I use it. I was first introduced to Egyptian Goddess by my hair colorist.  I shopped at two local stores - one closed and the other stopped carrying it.  I was so happy when I found it on Amazon.com. The roll-on is small enough to carry on a plane and it&#x27;s the only fragrance I take with me on trips. It has a fragrance of light musk and a floral scent.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I received my oils.  There was absolutely no fragrance to any of the four bottles that I purchased.  I will not be purchasing this product online in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.  It&#x27;s too sweet, and kind of old-fashioned.  After reading other reviews I was expecting \\&quot;sexy\\&quot; and \\&quot;skin\\&quot;, but this is a sweet floral which doesn&#x27;t smell sexy to me.</li>
            <li> I love my oils I have worn them for years, I get compliments all the time</li>
            <li> I have worn this oil perfume for years and usually buy it here in Vermont, but this was so easy and no travel.  Everything from the ordering to the arrival was perfect! No complaints.</li>
            <li> So disappointed with this perfume oil. You are paying for a bottle of oil with very little scent in it. This oil is so diluted and weak. It smells amazing in the bottle but once applied the scent is gone in a couple minutes. Auric needs to really increase the scent to oil ratio. Until then I would not purchase again sadly.</li>
            <li> After reading the intriguing reviews for this product, I was expecting a wonderful new scent to try...sadly, I am VERY disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could barely detect any fragrance at all after I first rolled it on. I waited for a while, and then I applied more; however, there was no noticeable increase in the scent (actually all the second application did was give me a headache, which has gone away since I scrubbed the oil off.)  I had intended to try the Amber that Auric Blends offers as well (my favorite fragrance for many years), but I am very hesitant to order it after this experience with Egyptian Goddess...</li>
            <li> Well first off, I ordered this on (Good) Friday and received it the following Monday (today). I like the smell of it. It smells very warm and earthy. I rolled a little bit on my wrists when I first opened the package, and can still detect the scent 9 hours later, despite much hand-washing (up to my wrists), getting caught in a rainstorm, and doing the dishes. Being used to scents that are overwhelming and quick-fading, this is most impressive. Unfortunately, my husband really dislikes the smell. Like step away wrinkle his nose. He&#x27;s never given much more than a shrug with any other scent I waft beneath his nose, so the instant dislike of this was serious. I tried to wash it off (hence the much hand-washing) but again, 9 hours later I can still smell it and my husband won&#x27;t get close to me.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! The fragrance is slightly sweet and floral with a spicy undertone. Not too strong, and lasts a long time. And the little bottle with the roller top is so easy and convenient to carry with you. Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the price for an everyday scent. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> I ordered this fragrance after admiring it on two other women--it smelled so good, I just had to take a chance on it!  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  It goes on with a very soft scent, a bit sweet and very subtle.  The first time you wear it, you&#x27;ll think it has very little scent.  But as the oil blends with the oils on your skin, it begins to grow, to blossom, and it becomes a truly lovely and very sexy fragrance.  Now that I&#x27;ve tried it, I can&#x27;t imagine living without it.  I&#x27;ve always loved perfumes with a hint of musk.  If you like musk in a fragrance (think Coty&#x27;s Wild Musk, or the old favorite, Evening in Paris Musk), you will absolutely love this!  The roll-on bottle is very easy to use, and allows you to put the oil exactly where you want it with no spilling or messy residue.  Try it.  It&#x27;s very affordable and truly wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great shipping, the product arrived days before the estimated date. However, I was very disappointed with the oil. I wonder if they sent me an old bottle.  The roller ball to apply it was stuck, and once I was able to get the oil out, I could hardly smell anything.</li>
            <li> This Egyption Goddess perfume reminds me of one called &amp;#34;Amazing Grace&amp;#34;, which I love. This has a beautiful scent, but it seems rather faint when sniffing it from the bottle. And, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long on me, which is very disappointing, because oil perfumes are supposed to have lasting power, and that is one of the main reasons I purchased it. Update as of June 8th, 2015: I just read from an eBay listing of this same perfume that it has DPG in it (dipropylene glycol). It is supposedly a safe ingredient, but I googled it and read that in lab testing, rats developed liver and kidney problems.</li>
            <li> I dont know why I kept reading reviews on how it doesnt last well. I do Hot Yoga (which is doing yoga for an hour or more in a room of 110 degrees with humidity) and after you get out of hot yoga your are DRENCHED IN SWEAT! everyone is! and it looks like you just got out of the pool. I let my friend try this perfume with me before we went to do hot yoga together, and when we came out we were like WOW WE CAN STILLLLL SMELL THIS! I used it before work a few times and now its stuck to the sleeves of the shirt from me putting it on my wrist, it always smells amazing on my work shirt week after week- its amazing! The smell is a little faint, but thats not necissarily a bad thing. Guys always love a faint smell on a woman, when its so strong that you can smell her from 5 yards away everyones thinking YIKES! I think that how faint it is actually makes it sexyy. Im buying more once i run out. Oh one downside though is that i was downtown seattle in the CD and i walked into a walgreens, there it was in wallgreens for 5 bucks. Idk, thats a bit odd and takes away some value of the perfume when i know i could get this at a local wallgreens in some places, but i honestly dont care its still a great perfume.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Goddess is such a lovely exotic fragrance. It has the ability to unleash the goddess in you as it delights the senses. My body chemistry seems to blend better with musky aromatics so this is the perfect fragrance for me. Once I glide the applicator on my wrists, inside my elbows and the pulse points of my neck it tends to transport me to beautiful places(I adore the roll on applicator). I consider it a fragrance that whispers, yet loud enough to be heard without being offensive.</li>
            <li> Egptian Goddess roll-on perfume is so amazing!  Stays on all day and smells fabulous on.  I get so many compliments when wearing it. It is soft and is not over powering on.  I was first introduce to this by a mutual friend last year and I am so glad she told me about it.  I make sure to have at least 1 of these in my perfume collection.  I would recommend Egyptian Goddess in a heart beat.  You will definately not be disappointed and happy that you purchased this.  By far a extremely well worth perfume!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what college in upstate New York smells like. It&#x27;s very familiar, a perfectly lovely oil and very well made; but a bit too dated for me. When you walk into a shop of essential oils or health food store, this is the scent in the air most of the time. It&#x27;s not off putting, in fact it&#x27;s a bit comforting. At this stage of my life however, I&#x27;d prefer to radiate a bit more modern chic and less earth mother. : )  Other than that, my package was expedited quickly and wrapped very well.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells wonderful, but I could only give it 2 stars because of how weak the scent is. It is very, very soft and only smellable if you put your nose right to your skin. I&#x27;d give 5 stars if Auric Blends could turn the volume up some notches on this scent.</li>
            <li> I agree with the others that it does smell really good, however, the smell is so weak that i cant hardly smell it.  The oil seems very thick as well and i have to rub it into my skin.  I tried shaking it, but still very weak scent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why everyone is complaining about the faint smell. Yes, it is faint when you open the bottle cap and sniff it. Once you dab it on you - just a quarter size and let it sit and go into your skin, the fragrance will start to grow. Initially when you first buy the perfume, you may need to put on about 12\\&quot; of it on your body to detect the scent. Then go out for a day or so (walk around in the fresh air) and you&#x27;ll start to notice the scent. After your nose can delineate between the fresh air and the scent, you&#x27;ll notice that the scent is actually quite strong. Later, just a dab will last you 48 hours - through showers and repeated hand washing / dish washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance reminds me of my Kindergarten teachers and older women in their late 30s up to 60s wearing this stuff. This is definitely not for women in their 20s, as it smells too \\&quot;motherly\\&quot; and \\&quot;married.\\&quot; It&#x27;s a comforting, sweet scent, but it smells old, as in a popular scent that we grew up with when we were little, so it lends itself as an older woman scent from the last generation.</li>
            <li> love the title and scent and great for on the go, fits in pocket or purse. I plan to buy more items under this label in future.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is warm and senual and it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> With an inexpensive perfume brand like Auric, you can generally expect to find one or two scents done surprisingly well amid a lot of scents that are mediocre or, frankly, bad. Egyptian Goddess is a cult favorite because it falls under \\&quot;done surprisingly well\\&quot; and is a decent, straightforward Egyptian style musk without a lot of frills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wears pretty close to the skin and is light without being sharp or soapy, ever so slightly nutty, evocative of clean skin with emphasis on skin rather than clean. The musk is accompanied by some quiet and unobtrusive woods and spices that are hard to pick out (which in this case means they&#x27;re doing their job well). It&#x27;s a truly unisex fragrance. Fans of Egyptian Goddess would probably enjoy \\&quot;Special Delivery\\&quot; from the small soapery Dirty Sanchez Soaps on Etsy; it&#x27;s an extremely similar musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: almost every musk oil fragrance on Amazon has its share of disappointed reviews from people insisting the product smells like nothing at all. Musk scents are created by several different types of molecules and interestingly, some people are anosmic to these molecules -- simply can&#x27;t smell them. It&#x27;s sort of the olfactory equivalent of colorblindness, I guess. And people who can smell one kind of musk molecule just fine can still be anosmic to other kinds of musk. So it&#x27;s not the product, it&#x27;s just that the people leaving one-star reviews literally can&#x27;t smell the perfume.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Shipped timely.</li>
            <li> Not really my favorite fragrance but its ok. Ordered &amp;#34;Love&amp;#34; Auric Blends and it smells much nicer.</li>
            <li> I tried this fragrance out at a store near my house that sells all of the auric blends perfumes.  I bought three others which I loved immediately and while Egyptian Goddess was nice I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed, so I left without it. Then I noticed that it stayed on a very, very long time, and the longer I had it on the more I loved it.  The scent changed drastically and turned into a delicious soft floral, kind of floral, but not your typical sweet floral, more earthy but still sweet...I dont know how they do it. It also became more intense when I was out cleaning my car in the heat and it changed a little bit more.  The other fragrances I bought stay very true to what they smell like out of the bottle, which is preferable, but this one seems to change completely depending on body temperature.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a week now, and it smells different every day.  Its a mysterious thing because even now, when I put my nose up to my wrist and smell, I&#x27;m still not all that impressed, but when I just let it be and take a deep breath, I can smell the fragrance and it is divine.  This is definately made for a goddess. This scent puts me in a good mood, and keeps me happy all day, I want to know what they put in this stuff, though im sure its a closely guarded secret!...It&#x27;s mystery and magic in a bottle.  Not to mention seduction, I wore this for my husband shortly after I bought it and I&#x27;ve never seen him react to a perfume I have ever worn like that, he couldn&#x27;t stop sniffing my neck and told me he could smell me on him all day. He also commented that I smelled \\&quot;absolutely divine\\&quot;.  This scent screams feminine and grown up, a world away from those overpowering super sweet teenage girls perfumes that you can smell literally 20 feet away! uck! I hate those.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time. The smell is subtle, last long n pleasant. My husband said it reminds him of cleanliness. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because my nose used to it or not. Subsequent uses I don&#x27;t smell the fragrance as I initially did. Then the smell comes back. May be I need to really shake the bottle before use. One more thing, it&#x27;s extremely oily.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it lasts a long time.  I can&#x27;t believe it lasts so long considering the price.  I like both the ones I tried; this one and LOVE.</li>
            <li> Will defintely order again.  This scent is so wonderful.  I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> SMELLS LIKE AN OLD LADY. im pretty positive I got the WRONG oil in the mail this morning!!!!! its yellow. not clear. its not right. I hate it. im sending it back!!!</li>
            <li> I, too, could hardly detect a distinct aroma despite having a good sense of smell.  I will probably wind up layering this one with Auric&#x27;s Rose or Water Lily which I was much more impressed with.  Perhaps I will come back and edit this review as I use EG more, figuring out how it wears throughout the day, but my first impression was that it smelled of old library books.  A nice smell, certainly, but not exactly reminiscent of Egypt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  One or several of the reviews stated the aroma would become more apparent as the perfume/tube was exposed to the air.  I can definitely smell the fragrance now, but still would not call it \\&quot;sexy\\&quot;, \\&quot;fleshy\\&quot;, \\&quot;moonlit skin\\&quot; or what have you.  I remember a former manager of mine who I now think may have used this fragrance, as she always smelled strongly of said library books and particularly Kleenex.  I would rename this scent \\&quot;Egyptian Librarian with Allergies\\&quot; if it were my call, again not as a condemnation of this scent but my personal impression :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tl;dr version:  Not a bad scent, but no clue what all the hype is about.  Not sure how Kleenex and library books are translated into \\&quot;soft sexy powdery musk\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I sent this to a friend in America.  She says she likes it.  I have not smelled the fragrance myself but am considering ordering one for me.</li>
            <li> Take the cap off and sniff, and you&#x27;ll get a light whiff of this perfume. Not bad, really. But, roll it on and the scent disappears. I&#x27;ve used it several times and the result is the same...nothing. I can only think that it is just too weak to have a scent when spread thinly on the skin. I am aware that an individual&#x27;s personal chemistry can affect perfumes, but I expect some scent, even if different once applied. Disappointing, to say the least, and I am afraid I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The scent is so faint - not at all like the bottle I bought in a shop locally.</li>
            <li> Everytime I wear this oil, I get compliments.  I&#x27;ve been told several times by different guys that this is the sexiest perfume they&#x27;ve ever smelt. Its not cloyingly sweet or floral like many typically \\&quot;girlie\\&quot; perfumes.  Rather it combines the earthy sensuality of musk with exotic overtones such as sandalwood to create a rich scent that is both distinctive yet subtle.  Its enough to make any woman feel like a goddess!</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance because it doesn&#x27;t quite smell like anything else out there. It&#x27;s warm yet soft, and it&#x27;s a little sweet, but not too overpowering. It&#x27;s good for everyday wear, which is nice.</li>
            <li> This is a fragrance that you wear as much for yourself, as you do to smell good to others!  You feel very sexy, warm and feminine.  The third note is as wonderful as the first, that is the advantage of wearing oils - as long as they mix well with your own skin oil. If you pick up a garment worn yesterday with this perfume, you&#x27;ll want to bury your face, and inhale deeply!  They still need to work on the quality of their candles, the wick burns straight down the center within a few hours (instead of the 70-80 hours on the label) but I use the remaining wax in my candle warmer for a light version of this beautiful scent.</li>
            <li> I smelled this perfume on a girl at a ball game and HAD to know what it was...I ordered it the very next day. I love the smell and so does everyone else. I just wish it came in a spray instead of an oil.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous scent! I have read the negative reviews from other seller&#x27;s reviews about this particular oil and I recommend curious buyers pay attention to the positive feedback, and buy it from this seller. Ladies, you cannot douse yourselves in this oil. A little goes along way. Its a subtle scent that strengthen over time with your body heat.     So women who need immediate gratification of an over bearing scent with hope it lasts throughout the day, this scent is not for you.. This a scent for controlled women who like to tease men with an alluring essence, and can walk away from their stimulated inquisitiveness.     Think this is an overrated review??? Try it</li>
            <li> I wanted to try it because the reviews seemed positive. I love the smell! I was a little worried because it does smell more mature than what people my age normally wear (I&#x27;m 24) but it definitely has the right amount of floral and musky notes. Its not over powering but the scent lasts all day which I cannot say for my D&amp;G or Ralph Lauren perfumes. The essential oils in the perfume probably have something to do with the staying power and I love rubbing my wrists together because the oil gets warm and really activates the smell.    I bought my bottle through Tom&#x27;s Incense because Tom is an amazing seller. I&#x27;ve never had any qualms about ordering from him because if there&#x27;s ever a problem, he&#x27;s quick to respond and fix any mistakes (which I&#x27;ve only had one out of the many orders).</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews stating that this perfume was too faint, and that you couldn&#x27;t smell the fragrance.  I should have paid attention to it.  But, having said that, I am also one who likes a strong fragrance.  This one is extremely mild but pleasant.  It&#x27;s a pleasant fragrance, I just should have saved my money.  I just assumed maybe it was just the difference in chemistry and maybe it would work for me....it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Egyptian Goddess roll on perfume from Amazon just based solely off of reviews.  I&#x27;m really picky with scents but I decided..what the heck, it&#x27;s a great price and I can&#x27;t go wrong.  I&#x27;m glad I did, because I absolutely love the scent.  I was curious about the other scents they have, so I went to the Auric Blends website.  They have tons of awesome sounding fragrances!  There are so many to choose from!  They make them all sound so tempting, so I splurged and ordered $50 worth of samples.  I know, that is kinda crazy and extreme, but a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do.  I&#x27;m so glad my husband \\&quot;gets\\&quot; me. :)  It was so much fun opening up all of the samples and trying them on.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this company and their quality natural perfume oils!  Even though I love Egyptian Goddess, I like all of the other scents too just depending on my mood.  Hey, it&#x27;s a girl thing!  I have to say that the Water Lily fragrance is my second favorite!</li>
            <li> There is nothing like the scent of Egyptian Goddess. To me, it captures in scent the escence of femininity and sensuality. Of course, since it is what my wife wears, I might be biased :)</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite fragrance, and its such a juxtaposition of soft and meaty, juicy and sweet sink your teeth in scent that I even roll it on my skin at night before going to bed. This smells like warm skin bathed in cool blue moonlight, its really beyond description, as this scent is pure sexapill without the animal pheromones and fancy shmancy stinky perfume stuff they use these days. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have loved and used this for the past few years as a friend told me it was her favorite scent and I can easily see why; it&#x27;s sexy, crisp with a sensual and musky aroma. I usually prefer spray on fragrance as they are easy to use, but I love to roll this oil all over my wrists and beck to the point where I can smell the clean and gorgeous scent all day long.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you like anything musky then this is really up your alley. Every time I meet someone who smells good they always wear some kind of musk wether America, Egyptian or Japanese, and let me tell you this stuff it liquid gold, It seriously  makes my boyfriend drool and my coworkers ask me for what it is, and I tell them its Egyptian Goddess. The hot dunes, coolly moon and sexy fleshy musk is perfectly captured in this roll on essence. I also love the incense this brand makes, for it sets this soft and delicious mood in my home. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a winner, not doubts about it!!! And I don&#x27;t know anyone who has resisted the charm of this perfume!</li>
            <li> OMG!! FOR THIS EGYPTIAN GODDESS, SMELL SOOO, GOOD AND IT LAST ON ME TILL THE NEXT MORNING,I GOT IT DUE TO ALL THE GOOD REVIEWS I READ, AND I WAS SORPRICED. IT WAS SHIPPED ON TIME AND YOU CAN NOT MISS THIS ON ON THIS AFFORDABLE PRICE.. I WILL ORDER MORE.. IN LOVE WITH THE SOFT SMELL. I GOT FEW COMPLIMENTS ALREADY...  YOU SHOULD TRY IT...!!! I WILL RECOMEND IT...[[ASIN:B003ZVYQRY Auric Blends - Egyptian Goddess Body Oil]]</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Egyptian Goddess for 21 years this summer, using Auric Blends for most of that time. Every batch is slightly varied, but the basic scent is always the same. The bottle I received today is decidedly different....minty? Cinnamony? Sandalwood? I&#x27;m willing to bet the wrong scent was packaged altogether! Really disappointed</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping it&#x27;d be close to Egyptian Musk that I like. I actually like this one better than Egyptian Musk!! I rub a little on each arm and a little on my chest after showeing and it lasts for hours. I admit that like some of the reviews have said it does wear off (most perfumes wear off anyway right?) but mine usually lasts a good 6-8 hours and if I feel I need a little more later in the day its small enough that I carry it in my purse and can refresh with a little dab on my wrist. Personally I like how light the smell is, its not overpowering so that when I walk by I irritate peoples noses and irriate my own nose for that matter. Its enough that its a not too light scent and not too heavy and can still be smelled by me and people around me who have complimented how great it smells.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this years ago and just started using it again and fell in love with it all over again. I didn&#x27;t remember wear I got it, nor did I know if they still made it. I found it here by accident and bought more. YAY! The great thing about this oil is that a little goes a long way and it smells delicious. Expensive perfumes just don&#x27;t have this staying power. How can this be so good but so inexpensive? This has a casual, flirty scent that I love for every day.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for years and have never been let down. the smells doesnt weaken after time in the bottle  like with some brands. I think I have tried every brand out there and this is the best by far!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this product.  I returned for refund as well as a large bottle of the same fragrance.  I was so disapointed that it smelled more like cooking oil rather than the exotic aroma described.  Amazon did refund promptly which I appreciated but I hate to have to return things.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this fragrance! The local hippie shop that I used to buy it at stopped carrying it and I am so glad I stumbled upon it here. It is very sensual but down-to-earth. Auric Blends \\&quot;Love\\&quot; fragrance is also very sexy, but in a sweet way. This one is much more primal and sensual. It should come with a warning and a can of mace, it is so effective at attracting men! And this is a great price for one bottle. It lasts for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews where people said they couldn&#x27;t smell anything. I took a chance and ordered anyways, thinking they must have had bad noses or had actually got used to the smell. I ordered two bottles. The first was okay. It didn&#x27;t smell musky to me at all, just slightly earthy and very sweet. It was weak, and only lasted minutes on my skin (and my skin tends to hold musky/spicy/earthy smells well). I asked several family members to smell where I had rolled it- nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second bottle...I almost want to say it was just vegetable oil, but it had a slight burnt rubber smell to it. Maybe it was a bad bottle, I dunno, but I wish someone had smelled it before they sent it to me, because it was obviously something wrong with it. Even the texture of the oil felt wrong, if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All these reviews really got me hopeful, and I&#x27;m so disappointed. I would send them back if I actually had the receipt, time, and energy to do so. I just had my first daughter and the post office is so far away! Argh!</li>
            <li> Everyone who knows me calls this my scent because I have worn it for nearly 8-9 years and its not a common perfume. I haven&#x27;t always been able to find Auric Blends brand, but they are the best. And now with the internet it is easier than ever. This will definitely be my scent of choice for as long as the make it available. I had to go put some on after reading all the other reviews and it is so familiar to me. A sweet musky scent that isn&#x27;t overly flowery like commercial perfumes and it isn&#x27;t too overwhelming like Patchouli. Its a mysterious blend of deep and sexy smells. Mmmm...never let it go!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! I use it on my wrist.  Its thick and absorbs without being oil, greasy, or sticky!  I will use this forever!</li>
            <li> While the product itself was of very nice quality, it had a bit too much of something really unappealing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strongest part of the scent reminded me of an old teacher I had in elementary school, or a grandmother.. a bit too baby powdery for my taste. It drives me crazy, because I WANT to like it, but alas, I cannot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it goes on nicely and lingers for a good long while. Plus the little bottle it comes in is perfect to tote around in your purse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to try out Night Queen or One Love though. Hopefully they will tickle my fancy.</li>
            <li> I saw all the reviews on this oil/perfume and it is as everyone writes. You either hate it or love it. I personally am enjoying the musky/campside/ freshness of this scent and will order again. It arrived very quickly and I&#x27;m happy on taking the chance on this one. I got a chance to smell Love at a retail store and really like that scent as well so I&#x27;m thinking of ordering that on the same site I got this one. If you are thinking of ordering this make sure you read all the reviews and keep an open mind when you get it...its def. for people that don&#x27;t want to be overrun with a high end perfume smell. This scent is on the natural side which I find matches me more then some over price perfumes you find in a department store. Going to try the Love scent next too...</li>
            <li> I had a guest who wore this and it was so amazing!! I just had to get some myself! It&#x27;s just like hers I couldn&#x27;t be more happy!!</li>
            <li> The scent is very faint- hardly know I have on a musk at all.</li>
            <li> To me the smell is annoying.  I mixed it with another scent.  I expected a soft scent.  The scent made my head hurt.</li>
            <li> This roll on perfume is not my type. I will no longer buy products just on good reviews. I can barely smell it. Not worth it, sorry and I&#x27;m usually not picky but this is awful.</li>
            <li> I bought this scent because of the enthusiastic reviews, and according to the manufacturer&#x27;s website (Auric Blends) it&#x27;s wildly popular. I bought the roll on and wanted very much to like it, but, unfortunately, this one is not for me. I was expecting a warm, powdery, floral musk and instead I get a very sharp, watery (muguet?), floral with no soft, warm musky tones at all. Unfortunately this type of scent gives me headaches. Way too much of a bite! It&#x27;s too bad- I was really looking forward to wearing this scent. (maybe I got a bad bottle? or maybe it was mislabeled?) Not for me, thanks!</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think this scent was strong enough, but after a few times, I realized I REALLY REALLY like it.  It&#x27;s definately oily, so I wouldn&#x27;t wear it with anything that might stain.  It is really a wonderful smell that you won&#x27;t run into someone else wearing.</li>
            <li> I have gotten sooooooo many compliments from both men and women. Not to mention I fallen in love with me all over again. Are larger bottles in the near future? I&#x27;ve packed away the Coach, the Burberry, the Issy, the light blue and the Ed hardy.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product based on reviews. Wow, I was definitely wrong to do that! The order and shipping was on point, however, the the product leaves a lot to be desired.  It smells like irish spring soap.  I could have gone to the local family dollar to get this smell. Never again.</li>
            <li> This fragrance was not what I was expecting. It smells too musky and just blah. My boyfriend even said I smelled like an old lady. :/ Not impressed.</li>
            <li> This is great. My husband loves it on me and when we go out I always get complements where someone ask for the name of what I am wearing .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this scent on and off for over 10 years and I swear this is not the same! Maybe I got a bad batch, but the ingredient that MAKES this scent seems to be missing!?</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time when I wear this body oil. Love the roll on its easy to gauge how much you are putting on and it&#x27;s not over powering. I forget I&#x27;m wearing it until I get compliments. Try this scent or others by Auric blends...I&#x27;m positive you will find a scent you like:)</li>
            <li> I tried this at first because it was attributed by two biographers to be the signature fragrance of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, who both waxed rhapsodic about it&#x27;s contribution to her unmistakable classic style. (See [[ASIN:074327718X What Remains: A Memoir of Fate, Friendship, and Love]] and [[ASIN:B000GG4J9Q The Other Man : John F. Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Bessette, and Me]]).  She could have worn the most expensive perfume in the world, but this is what she chose to wear, bought from a street vendor in NYC.     Several users complain about the softness of it&#x27;s fragrance, but I think that is part of it&#x27;s appeal.  It doesn&#x27;t overwhelm from a distance, but up close, unmistakable.  Use a little more if you don&#x27;t think you can smell it (think rolling a spot the size of a nickel on wrists and throat), and it will develop over an hour into a stronger, more complex scent. It really does get stronger, unlike most other commercial scents, which start strong and then fade away.   It will infuse your clothing in the same way that classic fragrances used to do before they were designed to dissipate quickly.  Objects you handle regularly pick up a faint but recognizable trace of this enchanting scent.  An application will last almost 24  hours.  A fresh bottle will not smell strong.  I have found that the bottle needs to be exposed to air for a while (just by opening it and using it daily) for the full strength of the fragrance to emerge.  Put it on, enjoy.</li>
            <li> As others have said, this scent goes on very light. The first time I applied, it was very faint and lasted a few minutes. I reapplied a few times before I got a good concentration of fragrance. It smells a little spicy, musky, a little powdery, a little floral, a bit medicinal. I think of older women when I smell this by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try layering with my everyday perfume, and it added more musk and spiciness, which I thought was lacking. I like the scent but I&#x27;m still on the fence and will need to get a second opinion later. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Several years ago, I had a hair stylist who wore this. I finally asked her what kind of perfume she was wearing because I liked it so much.  It&#x27;s a very clean, fresh scent, but also warm.  When I searched online for it, I did not expect it to be from a store that sells incense and things of that nature.  I will always love this smell though.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on this smell.love</li>
            <li> I wear this scent often &amp; get so many compliments on it. It got delivered a cple of days after I ordered. I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Egyptian Musk Oil for years, but can no longer find anyplace to buy it locally.  I ordered Egyptian Goddess hoping it would be similar to Egyptian Musk and it definitely is.  It does smell very nice, however the smell is extremely faint and I find that it is gone from my skin in less than an hour.  My old Egptian Musk would last the entire day and I&#x27;d still be able to smell it at the end of the night, so this was kind of disappointing.  I must say, however that the seller was excellent - shipping was very quick, and the item was well packed, so I did leave Tom&#x27;s Incense five stars.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance. I haven&#x27;t use anything other perfume or scent in years. It can be hard to find so I was particularly happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this classic fragrance.  It&#x27;s long lasting and people always ask me what it is.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. I discovered it about 8 years ago, then the store I used to buy it at stopped stocking it, for some odd reason (why?! they had auric blend&#x27;s other scents!)  and I recently bought it from here.  (well, my boyfriend did, after much hinting, then an outright \\&quot;I NEED THIS\\&quot; )  it is amazing. Every time I wear it I get complemented.  it makes me feel beautiful and sexy, and it&#x27;s the ONLY musk I will ever wear.  I actually work at a store that sells a musk perfume (one for men, one for women)  and I can&#x27;t stand it.  it makes me gag.  this one is warm and inviting and makes me feel at home.  I know I am probably gushing, but I just adore it!</li>
            <li> This brand smells fine, but I have not gotten any compliments, so I don&#x27;t think anybody else is picking it up.</li>
            <li> I think you truly need to experience this in person to get what everyone says about it. I think it also is different with everyone...on me, it is just warm and slightly sweet. It becomes an aura around you.  I can&#x27;t imagine it offending anyone...it&#x27;s very subtle.  I also like Auric Blends Love, it has a touch of this in it, but is just a bit sweeter. Note: If you are into really sweet, Escada-ish fruity scents or gourmand perfumes, I probably would not recommend this for you.</li>
            <li> These are simply amazing! They smell fantastic stay on for awhile and are not to over powering. I wish i bought more!</li>
            <li> I seriously couldn&#x27;t smell a thing.  Had my teenage daughter smell it too and she couldn&#x27;t smell it either.  However, my teenage son yelled that the smell was horrible--to not pack his lunch or touch anything of his while wearing it.  Came out in a weird greasy way from roller.  Threw it away.</li>
            <li> I love the incense oils at Romancing The Stone. My favorite is Egyptian Musk. It&#x27;s exotic, spicy, warm and sexy rolled into one. I had an egyptian goddess costume for Halloween and though I had the costume, shoes, headress, jewelry, ect. No perfume. But my perfume makes my attitude. I have date perfume, hanging with friends perfume, ect. I needed an egyptian perfume. I dressed in my costume, fixed my makeup and hair while inhaling my E.Musk incense and that scent did it for me. I felt my part while smelling it so I rubbed a bit of it on my wrists and neck(egyptians used incense as perfume anyway) and I went to my party. I probably got over a dozen compliments on my costume but I got more on my perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;compliments ranged from \\&quot;You smell like  an Egyptian Queen.\\&quot; To \\&quot; You smell like Thebes and ancient Egypt.\\&quot; It made my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point of the review is, I looked everywhere for that scent. Partially because everyone liked it but mainly for how it made me feel. I have 8 bottles of \\&quot;egyptian perfume\\&quot; when I ordered this. Small bottle so I thought it was ok if it wasnt the scent. Not a big waste of cash. BUT IT WAS THE EXACT SAME SCENT. It matched perfectly. The only thing is, it is STONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put a small drop on each wrist, OR roll it around your neck. DONT DO BOTH. IT IS TOO STONG.</li>
            <li> Wow, I only wore this one day and I can&#x27;t count how many compliments I received from people at work, strangers in Starbucks and general people on the street. I can&#x27;t stop smelling myself either. I even put a little bit of the scent on my upper lip so that I could smell it through out the day instead of sniffing my hand the whole time. And I&#x27;ve NEVER done that with another scent. I just love this earthy, musky scent. I have no idea what exactly is the \\&quot;magic\\&quot; formula in this, but it&#x27;s like catnip for me and most of the people that smelled it. Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> The scent is barely detectable. It&#x27;s as if I&#x27;m not wearing anything at all, and I have a very sensitive nose. The \\&quot;oil\\&quot; is very sticky/gummy on the skin too.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent of all the Auric Blends. I have the Black Opium and Love scents in addition to this one and I love the scent it gives off on my skin. It&#x27;s strong but not too strong and very easy to apply with the roll-on applicator.</li>
            <li> This perfume makes me think of a hippie orgy but that is why I love it SO much! Its sexual and earthy and makes me feel like running around naked with a tribe of dirty tree huggers!! :)</li>
            <li> Both me and my girlfriend LOVE the Egyptian Goddess scent. It drives her wild when I wear it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One Love sort of smells like fake sweetener, which is a bummer. It&#x27;s not horrible, so I wear it sometimes, but I much prefer the Egyptian Goddess.  I can&#x27;t wait to try on more scents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Almost one year later, and I&#x27;m back for more. My Egyptian Goddess has finally run out, with not daily, but very frequent use. I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with it, and I&#x27;m going to try Vanilla Musk this time as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up throwing One Love away, it smelled fake somehow. It smelled like splenda tastes. Blech.</li>
            <li> I was eager to try this, with all the positive reviews. However, it is a huge disappointment.  I have bought oil-based perfumes, solid perfumes, etc, for travel purposes for years. The difference is that I have purchased them in person, never from an online source. Opening this, I couldn&#x27;t smell anything! I spread some on my skin, after I shook the bottle vigorously, and waited a few minutes.  Again, there is no fragrance at all.  Regardless, I am returning this product.</li>
            <li> I never buy perfume or frangranced items online since I can&#x27;t obviously smell it for myself, but becuse there were so many positive reviews on this scent and the price was right I decided I&#x27;d give it a try. When I got it I was somewhat disappointed because I thought it smelled like old ladies, but the smell grew on me. I&#x27;ve also noticed it changes throughtout the day as I&#x27;m wearing it. I&#x27;m not longer disappointed and use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I have noticed a lot of people claim their purchase has &amp;#34;no scent&amp;#34; - this is probably due to about 50% of the population being anosmic to most synthetic musks.  The particles are simply too large for some people to smell.  Sometimes, they may even smell it on someone else or smell it lightly when they sniff the bottle the first time, and then not be able to smell it again.  This isn&#x27;t the fault of the perfume oil or the shipper, but merely an olfactory issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, this has a great scent to my nose.  It&#x27;s lightly floral with just enough musk, but devoid of the animalic/unshowered woman smell that some of them can take on.  A fresh, clean scent that illicits many compliments...if they aren&#x27;t anosmic to it!</li>
            <li> Love the scent of Egyptian goddess!. Fast delivery! .</li>
            <li> Scent was weak. Not like the ones I used to buy.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with the speedy quick delivery of my favorite scent, Egyptian Goddess</li>
            <li> I really like the stuff, my only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t las as long as I&#x27;d like. other than that, it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li> This perfume oil lasts for a long time and is never overpowering. It&#x27;s a very light scent and is warm, spicy and a little floral all at the same time. A very feminine and luxurious perfume oil</li>
            <li> This oil is incredibly sticky and the formula has changed in the past couple of years. It no longer lasts longer than a few minutes. So disappointing as the fragrance is incredible.</li>
            <li> I thought this would smell similar to Amazing Grace but it does not.  However it does have its own unique scent, I like it.</li>
            <li> Very unique smell.. it&#x27;s soft and strong at the same time. It doesn&#x27;t take much at all. I put a dab on both sides of my neck, and on my wrists. It has a sweet smell to it.. it&#x27;s weird at first, but once it&#x27;s on for a while it smells better, and it lasts for at least 6-8 hours. :) Worth the buy. :)</li>
            <li> Not the most authentic Egyptian Musk I&#x27;ve smelled.</li>
            <li> I suppose I must have gotten swept up in the romance of it all...this smells like indian food and there is nothing wrong with food, just something wrong with the odor.  GROSS....sellers fast shipping and they got the star not the product.  It&#x27;s a shame, it really smells...I am fair skinned and fair haired, perhaps that is why it didn&#x27;t mix, or hold up.  I am extremely bummed out.</li>
            <li> It was not like the original one I purchased it barely has a fragrance  Dissapointing</li>
            <li> Geez us instead of Jesus, :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This roll on body perfume oil is quite unique and sexy as can be.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes along way, and the fragrant last all day. The scent is a clean flowery scent that makes heads turn twice, like okay I smell something, oh let me go back and smell again, type of scent, it&#x27;s hard to explain. Try this Egyptian Goddess perfume and you will know what I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;Veronica&lt;br /&gt; The Sexy Black Egyptian Goddess</li>
            <li> awesome love this stuff it smells so good makes me want to dance and move my feet to the beat you know</li>
            <li> I love the scent, it is vey powerful so a little goes a long Way! People notice when you wear it!</li>
            <li> Came on time. What I wanted. Since you make us add more words  trying to add more words  is this enough</li>
            <li> Smelled this on a lady who was sitting beside me on an airplane and fell in love with the scent!  Came home and ordered it immediately!  Lasts all day!</li>
            <li> This new formulation has NO scent. I have been wearing this for years and it smelled great! But, since they changed the bottle, they changed the smell. Very disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a perfume with a fresh scent.  I feel that I have found it with Auric Blends.</li>
            <li> Smells cheap like Irish Spring. One star for the convenient size and to carry around in purse, Cannot believe someone was on a Tova website talking about this stuff... Her father must own the company.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells really good, a slightly sweet floral scent.  The scent is strong enough, but not overwhelming.  I like to mix it with the Sandalwood oil to take some of the sweetness down.  The roller ball applicator works well.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is pleasant but fades rather quickly.</li>
            <li> The smell was absolutely perfect! I use it as a blend for my sheabutter, and another fragance. This was absolutely what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> First time i bought this. Couldn&#x27;t really smell. Not strong enough to last through the day.</li>
            <li> This is the most beautiful scent. Everywhere I go people stop me and ask what I am wearing. I am allergic to most scents especially ones that come as a spray. This is soft and subtle and doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze when applying. I recommend this oil you will love it.</li>
            <li> this is the only place i can find my favorite oil. the buying is simple and the shipping is so fast! very happy!</li>
            <li> all I can say is JUhST TRY IT</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 of these &amp; they smell beautiful. The fragrance lasts all day &amp; the price is reasonable. I will be ordering more when my supply gets low.</li>
            <li> i bought this product mainly because of the reviews. it smells really good, but unfortunately, the smell lasts for about 5 mins after applying and thats it. thats the downside of it, i thought it&#x27;d stay on little longer.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Goddess is the best smelling stuff on the planet. I love these little roll-ons. I have a big bottle and I have these in my purse. I have purchased about 20 roll-ons. Everyone asks what I&#x27;m wearing or tells me how wonderful I smell. My co-worker ordered these at work after I told her what I was wearing. I&#x27;m wearing it right now.</li>
            <li> loved it...It was mailed to me and was nice and safe in the package.no defects in product,just loved  the roll on oil,this is my 2nd order...</li>
            <li> I received a number of compliments after wearing this perfume. Definitely one of my favorite scents. I would say it&#x27;s a little too musky for spring or summer though.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this smell. It has become my signature scent. I love the way it smells on me and I get compliments on it daily. These roll ons are a great size too! I purchased a few. I keep one at home, at work, and in my purse.</li>
            <li> I love this scent - but it only lasts a few moments. I guess that makes it a bittersweet experience. If it lasted longer on the skin, I&#x27;d give it 50 stars!</li>
            <li> Honestly, you can tell it&#x27;s a nice-smelling perfume because of the occasional hints of fragrance that come out of the bottle, but they&#x27;re so rare that you&#x27;re really left with what some other reviewers described as car oil smell, which I guess is like the basis oil the perfume uses. I don&#x27;t know, I threw it out. Not buying any more Auric Blends.</li>
            <li> i had been wearing this for years and then couldn&#x27;t locate it anywhere until i ran across this oil online it is just like the one i had smells wondeful</li>
            <li> wonderful product,thank you!</li>
            <li> One of my favorites.  Very subtle oil.  This scent does not overpower like most of the hideously overpriced and nauseating designer perfumes.  The shop that I purchased from also will not disappoint-great service, great stuff!!</li>
            <li> Finding Egyptian Goddess Oil in a little shop in Jackson, Wyoming seemed appropriate. It&#x27;s fresh and wild and deep and sweet and full of mystery... Being REALLY picky about scents,(I only wear two) I was possessed when this scent spoke to me and I knew I could not set it down. I ordered a case of it a week later. My husband LOVES it. My sister and her husband loved it so much I gave her some. It lasts the whole day, and changes throughout the day, always whispering \\&quot;goddess\\&quot; with its amazing empowering aroma. I get fantastic comments on it - and if you should order a bottle, and it is not for you, please find a friend to give it to.. they&#x27;ll love you for it. This is an exceptional and timeless scent - I have been wearing it for almost 20 yrs - and it still possesses me.</li>
            <li> I am an avid amazon customer and this is by far the worst thing I have ever purchased online..I cant belive how people can give this absolute piece of crap so many positive reviews,which tricked me into buying this..This has absolutely no fragrance at all,and I could detect it only if I smelled hard..I asked my husband to smell it and even he said he couldnt much..I dont think both of us has olfactory probs like some reviewer mentioned here..and for what its worth it doesnt even last 1 hour..by which I mean,after 1 hour when I smelled the area I rubbed it in,there was nothing! and yeah ,when you put it on and smell it, it smells cheap powdery!I am so dissapointed by this purchase not just because of the bucks I spent,but to think I made such a bum of myself by buying this cheap thing,with so many expectations..  Pls do yourself a favor and stay away..!</li>
            <li> This oil has no scent at all...what a waste of money!!!! it seriously smells just like vegetable oil... i don&#x27;t know what they gave me but this oil doesn&#x27;t smell good or like anything at ail</li>
            <li> I have to say, the reviews that the smell is \\&quot;horrific\\&quot; and other negative things -- are almost funny to me.  If you don&#x27;t like the smell, then don&#x27;t buy it!  (Stinky hippies? That&#x27;s just sad and unnecessary meanness.)  Obviously it&#x27;s not a great idea to buy any type of perfume online without knowing it first.  The reviews that are most helpful to me would be about the bottle the scent comes in, or if it arrived in the time expected.    The smell is beautiful, simple, and different on each person who wears it.  That is what makes it unique.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve smelled versions of Egyptian Goddess before and they always smelled soapy or too much like a stick of incense. Based on the overall positive reviews here (and the price), I decided to try this oil. It&#x27;s warm, sexy and layers nicely with some of my other perfumes (like \\&quot;Boyfriend\\&quot; by Kate Walsh). And I have been getting compliments on it (mostly by women so I&#x27;m still uncertain if it appeals to men). I do wish the fragrance lasted longer though.</li>
            <li> I love this oil and receive so many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I wear this or their &amp;#34;Love&amp;#34; scent every day. I always get compliments on both. It smells clean, like you&#x27;ve just had a shower.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite secert. I wear this all the time. A little goes a long ways! Love this oil!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing these oils for years. Someone complements them at least once a week. Thanks bunches! I will be a repete customer. :)</li>
            <li> I just  got my Egyptian Goddess roll on today and it smells divine. I already  got compliments on it when  I went out earlier. I will be buying  more :)</li>
            <li> i got this item after reading all the reviews.  I wasnt impressed with the scent, reminded me of an old closet smell, i&#x27;m 34yrs old and enjoy a variety of both subtle and pronounced scents but this wasnt fresh smelling at all.  I ended up mixing with another oil perfume i had so i wouldnt waste it.</li>
            <li> This has a nice scent, but I think it smells more like a men&#x27;s fragrance than a woman&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s not feminine enough for me.  It&#x27;s definitely not a bad scent though.  It lasts long too.  I could still smell it the next morning (until I showered).  It was nice the way I could smell it whenever I moved around, but it wasn&#x27;t overpowering.  Nice oil.  I&#x27;m planning to try other Auric Blends.</li>
            <li> This perfume is absolutely divine!  I have been trying for years to find a light, sweet, floral perfume that didn&#x27;t smell like sickening sweet cotton candy or bubble-gum.  I&#x27;ve found it.  I did a google search a few weeks ago entering in \\&quot;best selling perfume for women\\&quot; and the website Auric Blends came up with Egyptian Goddess listed on the site.  I took a chance.  I had no idea what the perfume would smell like ... I just knew that I needed to try something new and I knew that I did not want to pay $24 for a 1.07 ounce bottle just in case I hated it.  I decided to try the $7 roll on fragrance.  Oh, I&#x27;m so sorry that I didn&#x27;t buy the larger bottle now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil based perfume is a sweet, soft musk smell with floral undertones... the minute I rolled this water of the nile on my wrists, my mood lifted tremendously.  I&#x27;m a big aromatherapy fan -- love incense and aromatic oils and fragrant soaps... all that great stuff.  This being an oil based perfume will ensure that the fragrance lasts.  Oh, I love this stuff so much.  Now I have two favorite perfumes:  Lalique (French) and Egyptian Goddess... I&#x27;m in heaven! ;)</li>
            <li> This is really awesome. I wasnt expecting too much from an eight dollar fragrance, but damn, this is like on eof the best perfumes Ive ever had, and Im a vet at fragrances, Im a perfume junkie!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially oils, and Ive used the best! From Kuumba Made to Madinni and Possets, I Love perfume oils and this is the best one!&lt;br /&gt;Its not fake smelling, or synthetic smelling at all, and its very subtle and awesome, almost like an invisible perfume, and it lasts all day. You dont need alot, and I catch these whiffs of it thruout the day and its fabulous, Love it!! I was amazed at all the good reviews all over the internet, and decided I cant go wrong, and they are right, it is awesome!</li>
            <li> The best Egyptian Goddess oil I have found!!! Wish they had more in stock! I will continue ordering from them!!!</li>
            <li> the reviews made me try this perfume....yeah rright, do&#x27;nt get fool with these reviews!!! stinky smell and wont even last for a sec!!! but the shipment so fast!!!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing one Auric Blend roll-on perfume or another for the past 15 years and receive compliments all the time. I figured I&#x27;d take a moment and describe some of my favorites. Please note that this is just my perception of these scents and that I typically prefer earthy over floral, powders, or fresh scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My all-time favorite is Forbidden Desire. It is sultry, earthy, and spicy; it makes me think of Marakesh. It is a very strong and heady.&lt;br /&gt;Divine Opium is also fantastic- also spicy, incense-like but sweeter than Forbidden Desire.&lt;br /&gt;Note: the Divine Opium doesn&#x27;t smell like the branded opium smell found in beauty supply stores, and to me, this a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;Rasta is a heavier smell, but seems to be more along the lines of sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;Majik is darker with cinnamon notes.&lt;br /&gt;The Patchouli is classic and tried and true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that this helps a few people.</li>
            <li> I have been using Egyptian Goddess for at least about 7 years and I thought I would order from amazon rather than the auric blends site because it was free shipping and a little cheaper.. So disappointed!! The scent is somehow different and even when I opened the package it had a different oiled scent as if one spilled over it? It just so happened to also smell like patchouli which I can&#x27;t stand!!I will no longer order from this site for that I KNOW what it should smell like and I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s old or what but that is not the Egyptian goddess I have been getting I will spend the extra few dollars and go to the real site!</li>
            <li> A friend introduced me to this perfume oil in college, and while the bottle lasted (which was a long time) it was my favorite, but then I graduated and forgot about it. Recently I&#x27;d thought about it and only remembered it was called egyptian goddess, and was overjoyed to find it on amazon for only $7- probably less than I had paid for it 5 years earlier. I was even happier when I got it, it smells every bit as great as I remembered. I always get compliments on it, my husband loves it, and it has replaced all of my expensive perfumes I used to wear. I will never again spend $100 on a bottle of perfume; all I need is $7. And it really does last a while. Oh, and sometimes I think things like this will always smell like patchouli which I can&#x27;t stand, but this one does not. It is light and warm and floral but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this specific scent of oil for a few years and I have yet to get tired of it. I bought two so i have another one when i am out. I was happy to see that it was delivered on the exact day they said it would be!</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad bottle? This smells like plastic or rubber. I smell a faint musk underneath, but the predominant note is rubber. Too bad - after all the great reviews I was thinking that this would smell wonderful. Maybe it just doesn&#x27;t mix well with my body chemistry, or as I said earlier, maybe I just got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I love this musk smell and got this after reading the reviews. Its not that harsh on your skin and doesn&#x27;t have an in your face smell. Recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed it had leaked when it arrived &amp; was only half full...or perhaps  it had been used or something.Yikes!</li>
            <li> A woman that I work with wears this scent.  I had asked her where she got it and it was somewhere in the Vineyard.  I searched for it on Amazon and found it! It is such a clean, fresh scent.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I found this perfume oil in a store called Success Express in NJ when I was visiting family one year.  I absolutely love it!! It&#x27;s warm and soft with a light scent that isn&#x27;t over powering or headache inducing.  I recently ran out and my Mom sent me a package with a bottle in it as a surprise.  I was so happy to have more...I&#x27;ve been milking my last bottle.  I highly recommend trying this product or any other auric blends product.  Very good quality for a good price.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing the price and the reviews. I have to say, I LOVE this perfume. I can put it on in the morning and have it last 7-8 hours. It might last even longer but I&#x27;m not sure because my nose becomes immune to the scent quickly. Which is good, &#x27;cause then I&#x27;m not smelling myself all day and running the risk of a headache!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day I put it on a ton of women told me I smelled nice. They just loved it. Today another woman said the same. I told her I couldn&#x27;t even smell it and she said that she could smell it well, that it smelled very pretty, and wasn&#x27;t overpowering. She said it was just the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I can smell it, I also like the smell. It&#x27;s a pleasant musk - hard to explain really. I can&#x27;t say how it works on men because no male has said anything to me about it yet. My fianc&amp;eacute; doesn&#x27;t comment on things like that and I haven&#x27;t thought to ask him. And really how often do random men tell you that you smell nice? Haha. I will definitely be purchasing again once I run out.</li>
            <li> This is a heavenly, clean smell that I will continue to use forever -  and it&#x27;s true, a little touch of it is all you need and it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Got this oil and it smells wonderful and i love it and that i can throw it in my purse :). Smells like egyptian musk to me. BUT i love em both mmmmmm.....</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not horrible it isn&#x27;t anything great. I was hoping it&#x27;d be a bit more masculine and earthy, but it still just smells like school teacher perfume to me. Also my husband politely didn&#x27;t say anything until I asked his opinion, of which he said &amp;#34;It&#x27;s like a business professional scent, nice but not sexy. It smells like an accountant would wear it.&amp;#34; So there goes that.</li>
            <li> Not the real Egyptian Goddess. Go to WholeFoods to get the real perfume oil. This oil smells like CRAP!!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. I get so many compliments when I wear it. I highly recommend it. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! I purchased this a while back and loved it so much that I purchased a larger bottle from a different seller. The quality of this roll on was much better. I will probably just stock up on these roll ons next time.</li>
            <li> I chose it because a friend wears it and always smells amazing and now I know why!!! Order the larger bottle and refill your little one :)</li>
            <li> Been wearing Auric Blends oils for twenty years now!  I absolutely love Egyptian Goddess.  It&#x27;s such a clean light scent.  My daughter (4) always sniffs me and when I ask what I smell like, she says, &amp;#34;Love.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have always loved oils.  I usually purchase it at Renn Faires but couldn&#x27;t go so I was looking for something similar online.  I&#x27;m glad my sister told me she purchased it because I bought it right after I smelled it on her.  It is just like the Ancient Egyptian oil I bought at the Renn Faire and at a great price.  I am extremely happy with the purchase and plan on buying more when I run out!!!</li>
            <li> I love love love this sofly scented oil. I&#x27;ll be back for more in the very near future. Great idea for a gift.&lt;br /&gt;My  order was placed and within a few days I recieved my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Happy Customer</li>
            <li> Review about \\&quot;Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess\\&quot; by DayDream..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I smell this perfume oil product, I like smell, it&#x27;s light and stay about 4hours on my body but on 4th day when I open this bottle and I don&#x27;t get any scent smell. I thought I got cold but I asked my family members \\&quot;did you guys smell this??\\&quot; any scent smell is there? my family members laugh on me so badly, and we realized no more scent smell and it&#x27;s \\&quot;just oil now\\&quot;!! above half of the bottle still remains... I trashed it straight away..&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t purchase this product by Day Dream.&lt;br /&gt;Yes I got Black opium from vendor name \\&quot;Xtremek\\&quot;, that perfume oil still nice smell. I am more purchasing from Xtremek Black opium. but do not buy this \\&quot;Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess\\&quot; from \\&quot;DayDream\\&quot; this is the my bad experience of this product.... I tried similar products in India called \\&quot;Attar from Ratlam Aerochem is company name\\&quot; its nice one but bad luck that I don&#x27;t get online so, I am trying this products now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t waste money on this \\&quot;Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess\\&quot; by DayDream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell gone after couple of days or within 4days. Just think if you plan to gift someone this product after 4days???? ugghghhhhh???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No smell.. No smell..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Thanks : HP</li>
            <li> Ohh my goodness I cannot say enough about Egyptian Goddess perfume...it will bring out the Goddess in you ladies!!! This is my first time trying it and I fell in love with it the moment I put it on. I would most definitely recommend it to a friend. So if you are thinking about ordering...please just order it and see for yourself!</li>
            <li> Very incense like, but also powdery and a bit musty. Reminds me of slipcovers and drawer liners. Not what I was expecting at all. Kinda sticky too. Scent doesn&#x27;t last very long either. All in all, not so great.&lt;br /&gt;(Egyptian Goddess scent)</li>
            <li> i know that everyone loves this but it is not my fav....more of a patchouli/amber girl...but it was a nice scent</li>
            <li> The Auric Egyptian Goddess Roll on Perfume is just what she needed. The main thing is the perfume arrived in two days and cost less on your site that wasting the gas and oil to go out and buy the perfume. Fine job!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume (Egyptian Goddess) because of the reviews that I read about it and I must say, I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. This scent smells really good; I&#x27;m not sure what different scents they used but it is a good combination. I was also a little worried that it might be too strong but I found that it wasn&#x27;t strong at all.  I apply it to both wrists and my neck when I use it. Love it!</li>
            <li> My favorite above anything else. Its subtle yet intriguing. Everyone asks about it when I wear it . Better than any of my expensive perfumes!</li>
            <li> Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess is an earthy musk and a great signature scent. I have been using this for years and it is not diluted like other egyptian musks I have purchased. It&#x27;s a constant, great product.</li>
            <li> I have compliments on my perfume EVERYDAY!!!! This scent in not common. It is soft, sexy, and somewhat exotic. Since it is an oil, it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Ok so at first I hated it. But I keep trying it and the scent does change over time. I can see how people say this smells old ladyish at first because it is on the sweet side, but what I like is after awhile it starts to smell like musky incense and somewhat hippyish. The musk part almost smells like cigarette smoke sometimes...and I don&#x27;t smoke...but its a strangely weird scent and uncommon and that&#x27;s why I kind of like it.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful &amp; arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> Women and men follow me in stores to compliment the scent.. my coworkers also love it.</li>
            <li> Top notch natural perfume oil, been addicted to the Egyptian Goddess oil for 20 years now. :)</li>
            <li> I was 100% disappointed by the aroma of Egyptian Goddess.  I put it on and immediately wished I hadn&#x27;t.  It stayed on for 3 good days, and I showered each day.  I have tried to give it away, but nobody wants it.  Next week it will be making it&#x27;s way to the great-grandmother, maybe she will like it.  To sum it up very quickly: Do not buy this scent if you are under the age of 75; it smells like old lady, exactly.  Pretty much the same reason I cannot give it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give 1 star, but I don&#x27;t want to trash the entire Auric Blends line.  Their Patchouli blend is awesome and I love that.  Not sure what happened with the Egyptian Goddess, but pee-yew!  I&#x27;d like to try their other scents, but now I am not sure I should stray from the patchouli.</li>
            <li> This oil blend smelled absolutely wonderful at first, but two or three weeks after receiving and opening it went flat.  Now it just smells like oil and the fragrance is barely perceptible.  What a shame... I&#x27;m not sure if it was the vender, or if this is standard for this blend.  Many other reviewers have the same experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the fragrance Night Queen that I ordered at the same time from a different vendor (I think) is wonderful.  I&#x27;m not sure why Amazon won&#x27;t let me place a separate review for it - so I am attaching it here:&lt;br /&gt;Night Queen is a wonderful oil blend.  I would describe it as musky, with delicious citrus and clean floral notes.  I&#x27;ve had it for at least 6 months and it still retains its fragrance, unlike the Egyptian Goddess that I purchased at the same time.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Goddess has been one of my FAVORITE fragrance oils ever. I used to wear it years ago, before I had children. Then a few weeks a go I recalled the product, looked it up and had to have it. It brought back a lot of memories, and it smells amazing. Not a strong smell, it&#x27;s plesant and not offensive to others. It&#x27;s the perfect touch to wear everyday!</li>
            <li> Really strong. i am 28 and this smells like what I think my grand kids will say I smell like in 40 or 50 years, when i have kids and they have kids. I&#x27;m not mad I bought it but it is more musk than anything else.</li>
            <li> I found that the scent was not so strong as one would expect from a scented oil product, but the real problem was that wherever I touched it to my body, I started itching and developed a rash at the site of application. There&#x27;s no place on their web site to ask about what the base oil is, and the phone number on the bottle just gives you a phone tree with options to buy more. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I bought the Egyptian musk because of the reviews on here and it has no smell and the smell it does give is sooooo terrible seriously words can&#x27;t describe it; complete waste of money! Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I can not wait to get it. Strange thing happened today at the super market. Putting my carriage back in the slots and a truck pulled in the spot just where I was moving the cart. She had her window down and waited for me to move it out of her way. I had to ask her After thanking her for her for waiting. I went back to her truck and excused myself and said  What perfume are you wearing. She gave me the empty bottle of the roll on so I could match it on line.&lt;br /&gt;What a funny thing she said to me I do not smell it once I put it on but I get a lot of compliments on it.  Even though the bottle is empty and( I do not do that with folks I do not know,) the smell is intoxicating, and if I can match it and try my own that is wonderful. My issue with perfumes is they are all alcohol and make me sneeze so much this does not. Awesome!</li>
            <li> Great scent, love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been enjoying this perfume oil... Had ran across it at a natural foods store but found a better deal on Amazon. On me it is not a strong scent at all, but I think it&#x27;s perfect for those who may get a headache from strong scents. Just wish the smell would last longer but for the price point it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Goddess has been my go-to fragrance for a long time now. It&#x27;s very subtle but is still strong enough to smell without having to load it on or reapply during the day.</li>
            <li> The fragance is super nice, but unfortuately, no matter how much I used ...just did&#x27;nt seem to match my skin as far as bringing the fragrance out like a perfume should.  Sorry.....</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of the roll on &amp;#34;Goddess&amp;#34; perfume. I have received several compliments, will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Got it before it was supposed to be here and I love it. I have been wearing it for over 10 years and yes, the smell isn&#x27;t as strong but I still love it. This is the best, and longest lasting Egyptian Goddess perfume I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I am a big lover of musk perfumes and was STUNNED when I opened this and smelled it for the first time. I could not help but smell my arm where I had placed it all night!!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this scent.    My ONLY complaint is that it does not wear all day. Meaning, the scent dissapates (at least on me) after a half day or so.     Love it and love the price!</li>
            <li> Love the convenience of this roll-on. The brand has been around forever. It&#x27;s a romantic and musky scent that smells great and feels great.</li>
            <li> I bought Egyptian Goddess in a head shop, once upon a time.  I haven&#x27;t been back since, and I have run out!  Miraculously found it on Amazon, and it&#x27;s been a blessing.  It&#x27;s a low priced roll-on oil that smells AMAZING.  My boss loves it, and she only wears fancy-pantsy perfumes.  It&#x27;s subtle, and portable.    Loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it had such great reviews and I have to admit that it was an excellent decision! It&#x27;s absolutely terrific smelling, and I can see myself being more attractive with it on. It&#x27;s really hard to explain in words what it smells like because it&#x27;s like nothing I&#x27;ve smelled before. Definitely worth the money to purchase a smell online that you aren&#x27;t able to smell beforehand. I&#x27;ll probably order a few more of these Auric Blends!</li>
            <li> I cannot use regular perfumes due to the fact that I suffer from chronic migraines and am ultra sensitive to smells. It is very difficult for me to go shopping on Sundays because Men and Women have gotten all dressed up for Church and have applied cologne and strong perfumes that I can smell at the grocery store. When I smell them (even from a great distance away), I can get a migraine headache or even suffer a small R Temporal Lobe Seizure (I have adult on-set Epilepsy). I use Auric Oils as my perfumes because they are mellow, not harsh and artificial smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was on of the very first to get Botox for my Migraines before it even was approved by the FDA by my Neurologist back in 2000. We now see the commercials on TV for Botox and Migraines quite frequently. I am asked to tell my story by the Neurological Foundation, but I have not. I am still having Seizures constantly and taking several meds. Thanks everyone. I do my best to stay active, but suffer from long and short term memory loss.</li>
            <li> Water Lilly beautiful made me feel fresh and smelling great all day. Many compliments also recommend Egyptian goddess will buy again great price</li>
            <li> If you want Egyptian Musk do yourself a favor and get the better quality more expensive Abdul Kareem oil.This stuff is terrible.Maybe it doesn&#x27;t work with my chemistry but all I smell initially and even an hour later is a smoky smell.Not like cigarettes but like Ive been by a fireplace or barbecue all day. There are no other detectable notes but smoke and fireplace. I had to wash it off it was so strong and terrible.My 5 year old told me I smelled like a dog. Get Egyptian Musk from an Egyptian and get Abdul Kareem which is  AMAZING</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been mulling over this perfume for ages and I finally got it. Maybe to help others out, I love musky but sweet scents and I had been looking for a patchouli that dries down softly. Some of my favorite perfumes are Hillary Duff&#x27;s &#x27;With Love,&#x27; and B+BW&#x27;s Amber and Black Amethyst. I thought I would have loved Auric&#x27;s Amber or even the Amber Patchouli but they&#x27;re too earthy smelling for me. Egyptian Goddess is sort of like a sweet patchouli, with a hint of menthol, and maybe a base note of something like a milky amber and a touch of sandalwood. It ends up smelling very clean as opposed to earthy but not at all soapy. It reminds me of another perfume but I just can&#x27;t put my finger on it!! It&#x27;s not overpowering but it did stay on my wrists for a full day. Overall, it&#x27;s a beautiful scent--my new favorite! :)</li>
            <li> I did not like this because it has no scent...not what I was expecting... waste of money...Will not even bother returning it, I just will never buy this again...</li>
            <li> This is my favorite.  The only scent I wear now.  I can&#x27;t smell it on me anymore but I always get compliments on how good I smell.  So that&#x27;s what its all about.  Love it! Love it!</li>
            <li> Think of the smell your Teachers had. Very Grandma-like, kind of a musky funky closet smell. That&#x27;s what this is. This is that scent. The EXACT scent. Don&#x27;t believe me? Buy it. One whiff and suddently.. \\&quot;Mrs. Smitherson...? I turned in my homework, I swear!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I love Auric blends and just because some of their oils are hit and miss; when it&#x27;s a hit, it&#x27;s a HIT!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try Egyptian Goddess to compare it with Abdul Kareem Egyptian oil since it&#x27;s a little cheaper, more portable. I love it; the scent lasts forever without being overpowering. This is the scent that morphs with your body chemistry to create a unique-to-you signature. It&#x27;s hard to describe, so if one was curious about what all the Egyptian oil user rave about, this is a good place to start.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t an essential oil out there that can beat this one!  I&#x27;ve been wearing Egyptian Goddess for over a decade,  and I never get sick of it.  Once you try it you&#x27;ll agree.</li>
            <li> I tried this as a tester in a local health store.  I was almost out to the car when my husband smelled it, and asked if I would go back in and buy it.  It is different....  It has an interesting \\&quot;familiar\\&quot; scent ~ it reminds me of something from  childhood  and brings back a happy feeling in me.  I have gotten compliments on it, and I NEVER have received compliments on a scent before.  It is inexpensive enough to try it, if you want something different!  Lasts forever, too, because you use so little.</li>
            <li> Great price.  Arrived early.</li>
            <li> it had a slight perfumey smell when I opened it and rolled it on my wrist but given my expectations based on these glowing reviews it was a complete letdown. people described this as sexy and musky delicious etc etc. the only thing I smell is a slight hint of Patchouli which is fine I guess but honestly there is nothing there. I have a highly sensitive nose with keen recognition of scent and this is watered down at best. I am contacting the seller to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re looking for a truly beautiful sexy and distinctive scent get Kiehl&#x27;s Musk roll on. it&#x27;s expensive but worth every penny and will make you happy. I lost mine on the bus thinking I could find something else to replace it but no. Khiel&#x27;s is the real deal while products such as this are imposters.,</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this perfume based on the great reviews written but unfortunately, it is just was not what I was hoping for. The scent is so light, I feel as if I have to literally douse myself to smell anything.  I am suspecting that the item that I got is an old batch.</li>
            <li> After so many failed attempts to find a subtle, yet sultry scent I have finally found the perfect one! This particular brand is consistent with all other Egyptian Musk oils that I have used in the past. It is a scented roll-on oil, however, so if you&#x27;re looking for a spray-on or traditional perfume, this product is probably not for you.</li>
            <li> Its a nice musky scent, but not what I was looking for, although my boyfriend says he likes it. Its a tad thick for my taste but doesnt wear off quick and the roll on bottle is great for application.</li>
            <li> This scent is captivating. I ALWAYS get compliments when wearing it. It isn&#x27;t over powering or too strong, just enough to catch attention in a positive way. I tend to get headaches with a lot of perfumes, so this roll on oil is perfect. LOVE this!</li>
            <li> I had read So many positive reviews on the Egyptian Goddess\\&quot; scent,and it sounded so enticing!While it arrived very quickly,..as soon as I opened the bottle..I smelled what seemed like a pine sol scent or some kind of cleanser,I had also read in some reviews that the bottle just might need to be exposed to the air a little to really bring out the true scent,I gave it 2 days on my skin,which you can not get off for about 2 days any way,even after scrubbing in the shower,..seemed to just keep getting stronger and started to give me a headache.So as I really tried and wanted to love Egyptian Goddess,..it was just not for me.\\&quot;as I sit here still with the scent on my wrist\\&quot;unable to get it off \\&quot; took another sniff, and ugh..</li>
            <li> I chose to get the Egyptian Goddess since it seemed to have good reviews but I must have an extremely different idea of what good smells like. I opened it and without smelling it first just rolled a little bit on my arm, I smelled like an old lady all day (no offense intended). Right after I put it on this really sexy guy I work with walks in and says it smells weird in here what is that!? I showed him the scent and the disgust on his face said it all lol. Then of course I figured it&#x27;ll fade soon enough but no I could smell it for hours so I said screw this I need to wash my wrists. Even then I could kind of smell it and I don&#x27;t have smelling like a dog it was just that bad. When I got home that night I had my grandma and mom see of they liked it and the look on their face was priceless haha, I need to send this crap back. Otherwise its one of those gifts you give out for xmas to someone you don&#x27;t exactly like.</li>
            <li> not good; it does  not have no smell, poor quality ...dont buy it&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0000ZLEJG Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess Roll-On Perfume 1/3 oz]]</li>
            <li> This Egyption Musk oil smells ok, I wore just a dab to work and it made me and others around me sneeze alot. Also i broke out a little with redness and itching where I applied it. So I do not suggest this to someone who thinks they may want to avoid these issues.</li>
            <li> This scent is magical beautiful and not overpowering ,I wore it and went to the mall recently I was amazed how many people approach me asking me what I was wearing what fragrance so I said it called Auric blends Egyptian Goddess  they all liked it wanted to know where I bought it and I said amazon website they were all said wow ,I said you can find it there,the scent made me look like a goddess too felt like cleopatra ,thank you amazon it  will be one of my favorites now.</li>
            <li> I purchased Egyptian Goddess a few days ago. I&#x27;ll give it two stars for a fast delivery. (came 2 days early) But overall I didn&#x27;t like this product. It looked, felt, and smelled like olive oil. Well...technically it didn&#x27;t really smell like anything. I rolled it on myself, and some fabric to try and smell it, but couldn&#x27;t smell it. Very pointless having a perfume oil that doesn&#x27;t have a scent.</li>
            <li> Nice smell can&#x27;t wait to try it</li>
            <li> Had ordered a different brand before this was entirely way to musky for my taste</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this, I put some on and it lasts for 2 seconds. I wasted my money and was ripped off. What am I suppose to do with this bottle of crap? Don&#x27;t order it. Junk.</li>
            <li> Which is why im giving it 3 stars. I personally think it smells like old lady perfume. Once my mother reminded me, I remembered that she used to wear this perfume when I was younger ( her and a few other women). It even made her reminisce about the days she used to wear this before she had children. This is the second Auric blends roll on ive tried that I do not like ( the first was the vanilla) and have given to my mother(she seems to like them a lot and they even smell different on her).</li>
            <li> I wanted to comment on the reviewers who state this product has no scent- Right from the bottle, the oil is odorless, and at first I was a little dissapointed when it came in the mail. I rolled it on anyway, and let it soak in because its quite viscous, and slowly the scent started to release from my skin. The scent is subtle, if your used to spraying on a department store perfume and becoming lost in the fumes, then this is a nice surprise. Its very exotic and slightly sweet, nothing like I have smelled. Patchouli? Sandalwood? Jasmine maybe? What a treat to wear at such a great price. I can feel the African sand as I bathe beneath the Giza acropolis...</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new scent to change things up.  I&#x27;ve worn Amber Romance from Victoria&#x27;s Secret for years and while my husband never complained about the scent, he never nuzzled up on me and told me how good I smelled.  This is the kind of reaction I got with Egyptian Goddess.  Yes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost gave up on this little bottle of oil after a mere 2 wears, but luckily I came back on Amazon and read a few more reviews saying the bottle almost needs to breathe to really develop a good scent.  By the fourth wearing, my husband was inhaling me!  I&#x27;ve been with the man for 13 years (since I was a teenager!) and I can&#x27;t recall him ever doing this, but it&#x27;s exactly the reception I was looking for!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t fully care for the initial \\&quot;spicy\\&quot; scent when I first put it on, but as the oil soaks in, my body heat sort of makes it bloom.  The scent almost seems to change every few hours, which is kind of fun!  Is it going to be slightly floral, is it going to be a sultry musk?  I don&#x27;t know, but I like to be kept guessing!!</li>
            <li> I have bought Egyptian goddess for many years as a most LOVED perfume. I got this and it smells NOTHING like what I have purchased in the past. actually there is no smell it smells only like a carrier oil. I am very disappointed in this and will not purchase from this seller again. Word to wise go straight to Auric Blends</li>
            <li> Seller &amp;#34;Old Glory&amp;#34;. Has almost zero scent. I assume this must be a fake as there&#x27;s no way this could get so many good reviews? And, non-returnable to boot!</li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic. I am always getting compliments and I am asked what I am wearing. It is the only perfume that I have really enjoyed.</li>
            <li> I buy this all the time. I hope you guys have a sale one day!! (hint hint) My fav like i said i buy this all the time</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see what all the fuss is about.  This oil smells okay, but it does not last at all.  I would NOT buy this again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it at all, it has a good staying power though but is a flowery scent, not very strong but you can feel it. If you are into flowery scents then try it.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend smells so sexy with this on, its not so strong that it turns you off.</li>
            <li> I did not care for this fragrance</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance. I&#x27;v been wearing it for years. It mixes well with Love, also made by Auric Blends.</li>
            <li> Decently quick shipping to upstate NY. The smell is AMAZING (egyptian goddess). Musky for sure, but there&#x27;s a subtle sweetness to it. Perfect for people that don&#x27;t like overbearing floral scents and favor medium muskiness better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t linger long. I roll it on and by the time it&#x27;s completely dry and sunken into my skin the scent is just about gone! I&#x27;m someone who likes to apply once in the morning and wake up the next day with the scent still roaming around me.</li>
            <li> i was leery to try this perfume,w/all purchases via internet,u can&#x27;t \\&quot;try before you buy\\&quot; which can certainly lead to regretfu purchase..However i was very pleased w/this oil. EGYPTIAN GODDESS is so many things. In reading reviews, alot said it smelled different on everyday,i haven&#x27;t experienced that but the scent is 1 i quite enjoy&amp; i&#x27;m looking forward to purchasing a larger bottle as well as solid perfume(when available). My ONLY drawback was that some reviewers stated to only buy from Auric Blends, i&#x27;ve no prob w/this&amp;thought I HAD but when i recieved perfume in mail the order invoice stated it came from\\&quot;OLD GLORY\\&quot;i&#x27;ve no prob w/O.G.,it just troubles me that i clicked on Auric Blends in order to be sure the E.G.oil was the real thing&amp;still ended up getting it from elsewhere.It still smells great but i WILL make sure to have a witness for my next purchase lol! Enjoy this perfume oil,it begs to be worn,shared&amp;experienced..just be careful in crowded places,you may find yourself overwhelmed!</li>
            <li> I always wear Cashmere by Donna Karan but that is a little expensive.  This oil is great for a day time dab and it last the entire day. Occasionally I have been known to combine the 2 and that smells FANTASTIC!!! I get soooooooo many compliments either way.</li>
            <li> This product was so disappointing. It had absolutely no fragrance to it whatsoever. I would not recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> This was a reorder as it&#x27;s my favorite scent. I can&#x27;t say enough about it! It&#x27;s somewhat exotic yet not cloying or overwhelming. I&#x27;ll be ordering it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to get it in this small bottle, with the roll-on applicator. There&#x27;s no spillage, and it&#x27;s convenient to carry in my purse.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Goddess is my hands-down favorite fragrance of all and have purchased it many times over the years.  The one I received from this vendor, however, is not the real thing!!  When I first opened it, it smelled great but as time went on &amp; many applications later I realized it was a fake.  The scent completely changed &amp; wore off almost immediately.  (The &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; perfume lingers even after a long day &amp; lasts on scarves, etc....)  DO NOT BUY THIS!!!  If u want to try the REAL version, order it from the Auric Blends site directly!!  Friends have told me never to buy beauty products (make up, hair products, lotions, etc) off of Amazon...you never know how long it&#x27;s sat around &amp; who tampered with it.  Lesson learned over here!!  Totally disappointed ....</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the popularity &amp; reviews. But it&#x27;s not for me. It smells like your typical scented oil at a head shop.</li>
            <li> I purchased this locally and decided to order this here because it was cheaper...I&#x27;m very disappointed ... it doesn&#x27;t smell right at all..now I&#x27;m stuck with 4 bottles...I will never buy it here again.</li>
            <li> I have loved this perfume since I was a teenager. Been years since I have used it, but still love it!</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of compliments when wearing this oil roll-on perfume. It has a distinctive and pleasant smell, not too over powering.</li>
            <li> Oh god the old lady perfume smell...</li>
            <li> Love love love these oils, have bought 3 times now, very earthy</li>
