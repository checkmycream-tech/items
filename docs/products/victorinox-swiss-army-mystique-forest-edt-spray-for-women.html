            <li>Great product for a stellar price.  </li>
            <li>First of all my Victorinox swiss army knife has been great, i literally use it every day.</li>
            <li>Secondly, my favorite color is green and I love the forest so this was perfect for me, not overpowering at all and great for all occasions.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>

            <li>Will need to order one more, don&#x27;t want to run out...</li>
            <li>Woodsy in the best way possible.</li>
            <li>My favorite</li>
            <li>I will for sure recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li>I love the Swiss Army brand.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thoroughly pleased.</li>
            <li>For me I find that it mostly dissipates within a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>Love this scent.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice, light and fresh smelling cologne.</li>
            <li>I liked it better on the testing strip in the store, but deffinantly not bad smelling.</li>
            <li>and i love the smell and stays on clothes for a long time real good my girl loves it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments on the Classic and decided to try the Forest to see if it&#x27;s as great as I imagined.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this is a great product.</li>
            <li>good quality perfume for a good price, better than any other website.</li>
            <li>Strong Effect</li>
            <li>Will most certainly get more when I run out.</li>
            <li>this is a great smelling product, spray it on and it will last all day.</li>
            <li>The fresh edge it has right after you apply it does sort of mellow and disappear throughout the day, but the oakmoss smell (I think) persists and remains really nice.</li>
            <li>Smells great, Musk isn&#x27;t the strongest but still has a great long lasting smell</li>
            <li>Clean.</li>
            <li>It is fresh, it lasts pretty well throughout the day, it smells adventurous, and masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great scent for any aged man.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of a sweet shaving cream smell.</li>
            <li>Very nice, crisp, manly and outdoor fragrance with moderate endurance.</li>
            <li>I like them very much!</li>
            <li>Subtle, very pleasant.</li>
            <li>Fresh.</li>
            <li>wish it was a liiiiitle more masculine though</li>
            <li>The smell is very nice, a little wood, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Great Perfume, manly , strong and long lasting.....</li>
            <li>3 out of 5 stars seems right to me.</li>
            <li>Do not buy the first product of this brand</li>
            <li>and so does all the girls in my class hahaha get it worth it</li>
            <li>While some colognes are definitely evening, I would say that Forest is most decidedly a day wear cologne.</li>
            <li>great fragrance but does not last as long as I would like it to</li>
            <li>The problem is that i expected a little bit more of an oak smell, not so much of that of a conifer o pine tree, but once it&#x27;s sprayed, the scent is strong at first but then dilutes to a nice fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Smells great but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>I little stronger than the original classic,also last a little longer,nice bottle,great value more of a evening scent,but very pleasant</li>
            <li>They really made a real forest - like smell with this one!</li>
            <li>my girlfriend has a very particular olfactory palate.</li>
            <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t have thought so.</li>
            <li>I received a TESTER bottle without the wooden top as opposed to a new bottle which is what I purchased..  </li>
            <li>LOVE these prices for the SAME name brand selling for LOTS more at other stores!</li>
            <li>First, this is my impression of the Forest scent, although I start out talking about the Classic.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a while for a cologne that is masculine, fresh, and outdoorsy but not musky or fruity smelling.</li>
            <li>It is certainly a light smell that doesn&#x27;t last all day, which suits me as I don&#x27;t think cologne should be broadcast to everyone in the room.</li>
            <li>A nice change from my usual Swiss Army.</li>
            <li>So Use Only What&#x27;s Needed Until You Find The Adequate Amount To Use.</li>
            <li>It smells a little like an older gentleman when it&#x27;s first applied, but after it has a few minutes to mellow it smells very nice.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last long, at all.  </li>
            <li>I got a brand new 3.4 oz.</li>
            <li>A masculine smell with a touch of citrus and pine.</li>
            <li>Im 30 years old</li>
            <li>It has a masculine scent but not overpowering</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 19 year old son and he loves it.</li>
            <li>Who knew that the swiss army knife brand could come up with a masculine smelling cologne that actually achieves the effect of drawing a woman&#x27;s attention.</li>
            <li>too heavy and sweet, not what i expected at all..</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I got a brand new 3.4 oz.</li>
            <li> A masculine smell with a touch of citrus and pine.</li>

            <li> too heavy and sweet, not what i expected at all..</li>
            <li> as a 3.4 oz bottle will last me a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only regret is the scent doesn&#x27;t hold up for very long.</li>
            <li> After smelling this in a local store, I was sold - especially when Amazon had it for half the price.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to someone who likes a stronger scent, have tried their other scents as well.</li>
            <li> Pungent enough to last for hours but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> she likes this one because it has a sharp, piney quality.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this one to all strong perfume lovers, you will not be disappointed....</li>
            <li> You can get this on eBay for less than $20.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe I found this for almost $40 less that what it cost at Kohl&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Arrived a day late, but I assume it is because of the upcoming holidays.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a subtle, nature like scent  that won&#x27;t overpower you -</li>
            <li> Also the shipping was very slow - received after the provided delivery date.  </li>
            <li> The others all smelled a bit chemically or artificially, which does not suit me.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I like them very much!</li>
            <li> Subtle, very pleasant. Already had many compliments. Will most certainly get more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> who doesn&#x27;t like the Swiss?  this is a great smelling product, spray it on and it will last all day.</li>
            <li> Smells great, Musk isn&#x27;t the strongest but still has a great long lasting smell</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to someone who likes a stronger scent, have tried their other scents as well. All are good</li>
            <li> Excellent! I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> great smell-oo-la.. I just love this stuff , great night or day. have had many complements, will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe I found this for almost $40 less that what it cost at Kohl&#x27;s! LOVE these prices for the SAME name brand selling for LOTS more at other stores!</li>
            <li> Great product, great shipping... better than expected.. and at a good price. Will need to order one more, don&#x27;t want to run out...</li>
            <li> I liked it better on the testing strip in the store, but deffinantly not bad smelling. Reminds me of a sweet shaving cream smell.</li>
            <li> They really made a real forest - like smell with this one! The problem is that i expected a little bit more of an oak smell, not so much of that of a conifer o pine tree, but once it&#x27;s sprayed, the scent is strong at first but then dilutes to a nice fresh smell. 3 out of 5 stars seems right to me.</li>
            <li> Do not buy the first product of this brand and I can say that it is always good quality. The smell is very nice, a little wood, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the scent to be so closely akin to those &amp;#34;Pine Tree&amp;#34; shaped air fresheners of which I never cottoned up to.&lt;br /&gt;Best not to buy again.</li>
            <li> Having had the same cologne for a number of years, I figured it was time to change things up. After smelling this in a local store, I was sold - especially when Amazon had it for half the price. It&#x27;s a subtle, nature like scent  that won&#x27;t overpower you - but at times you&#x27;ll get a solid whiff of it.</li>
            <li> I little stronger than the original classic,also last a little longer,nice bottle,great value more of a evening scent,but very pleasant</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a while for a cologne that is masculine, fresh, and outdoorsy but not musky or fruity smelling. Finding this has been my answer. It is fresh, it lasts pretty well throughout the day, it smells adventurous, and masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specific notes: The fresh edge it has right after you apply it does sort of mellow and disappear throughout the day, but the oakmoss smell (I think) persists and remains really nice. Give it a shot.</li>
            <li> A masculine smell with a touch of citrus and pine. Arrived a day late, but I assume it is because of the upcoming holidays. Arrived with extra fragrance samples and coupons.</li>
            <li> Lasts the night, does not fade away in a couple of hours.  I would highly recommend this is a great product.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very nice. Pungent enough to last for hours but not overwhelming. Fresh. Clean. Woodsy in the best way possible.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Great price and great scent!  My favorite</li>
            <li> Bask in the outdoorsy,woodsy fragrance that brings the great outdoors right to you in the most appealing way ever!  Mmmm!</li>
            <li> Great Perfume, manly , strong and long lasting..... I would recommend this one to all strong perfume lovers, you will not be disappointed....</li>
            <li> A nice change from my usual Swiss Army.</li>
            <li> The colony smells divine my husband loved it</li>
            <li> I love the smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last long, at all.  Seems like it&#x27;s gone in about 10 minutes. Wife loves it.</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne. Who knew that the swiss army knife brand could come up with a masculine smelling cologne that actually achieves the effect of drawing a woman&#x27;s attention. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t have thought so. I received a sample of this product, tried the sample, and then I had to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I received a TESTER bottle without the wooden top as opposed to a new bottle which is what I purchased..  Also the shipping was very slow - received after the provided delivery date.  Still like the smell though....</li>
            <li> too heavy and sweet, not what i expected at all..</li>
            <li> smells wonderful. wish it was a liiiiitle more masculine though</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, light and fresh smelling cologne. I got a set of all the cologne samples Victorinox makes, and found this to be the only one that smelled &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; enough for my tastes. The others all smelled a bit chemically or artificially, which does not suit me. This isn&#x27;t overly piney as some have stated, I think it has a great balance of smells with none being too overpowering. It is certainly a light smell that doesn&#x27;t last all day, which suits me as I don&#x27;t think cologne should be broadcast to everyone in the room. Great value too, as a 3.4 oz bottle will last me a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it 4.5-stars if I could. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5-stars is that it doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li> Im 30 years old and i love the smell and stays on clothes for a long time real good my girl loves it and so does all the girls in my class hahaha get it worth it</li>
            <li> good quality perfume for a good price, better than any other website. I will for sure recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Great purchase. Very nice scent for the summer, good price for the product.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend has a very particular olfactory palate. she likes this one because it has a sharp, piney quality. if you like that sort of thing, this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> First, this is my impression of the Forest scent, although I start out talking about the Classic. I love the Swiss Army brand. I began using Swiss Army Classic about a year and a half ago and I&#x27;m thoroughly pleased. It has a masculine scent but not overpowering and it&#x27;s bright and refreshing; perfect for a day cologne. I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments on the Classic and decided to try the Forest to see if it&#x27;s as great as I imagined. Result: It&#x27;s good. A nice woodsy scent with plenty of pine. While some colognes are definitely evening, I would say that Forest is most decidedly a day wear cologne. It&#x27;s bright and refreshing and a great start to my day. My only regret is the scent doesn&#x27;t hold up for very long. For me I find that it mostly dissipates within a couple of hours. But it&#x27;s still a great cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. You can get this on eBay for less than $20. I got a brand new 3.4 oz. bottle (not a tester) shipped to my door for $15.95.</li>
            <li> Great product for a stellar price.  My husband loves the scent and so do I!</li>
            <li> Very nice, crisp, manly and outdoor fragrance with moderate endurance.</li>
            <li> It smells a little like an older gentleman when it&#x27;s first applied, but after it has a few minutes to mellow it smells very nice.</li>
            <li> Really Nice Aftershave/Cologne. Strong Effect So Use Only What&#x27;s Needed Until You Find The Adequate Amount To Use.</li>
            <li> great fragrance but does not last as long as I would like it to</li>
            <li> This is the type of scent that lingers subtley but is not overpowering. I wear it to work as well as in the evening. It is supposed to be &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; according to another review, but I just find it very pleasant.</li>
            <li> First of all my Victorinox swiss army knife has been great, i literally use it every day. Secondly, my favorite color is green and I love the forest so this was perfect for me, not overpowering at all and great for all occasions. I recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this scent. I get allot of comments on how good it smells. A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> delicious duration of 6 to 7 hours good projection and fixing a special smell</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 19 year old son and he loves it. And so do I! This is a great scent for any aged man.</li>
