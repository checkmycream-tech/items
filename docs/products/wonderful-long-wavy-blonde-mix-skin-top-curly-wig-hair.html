            <li>Nice wig but</li>
            <li>I use a capfull of woolite or non-allergenic fabric softener in a warm sink of water on wigs to prevent matting and that shiny look.</li>

            <li>I REALLY enjoy this wig!</li>
            <li>The color is lovely, and the curls are as pictured.</li>
            <li>Repeat until you&#x27;re satisfied with the result.</li>
            <li>The hair itself is very nice and looks real - not too shiny or plastic-looking.  </li>
            <li>Very FUN!</li>
            <li>Very FUN!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s always a great idea to use a clear wig adhesive or wig tape to keep it from slipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The elastic band inside the cap to tighten the fit of the cap keeps coming unhooked.</li>
            <li>for the bangs, I tried swooping them to the side and they wouldn&#x27;t stay, even when I tried to secure them with a bobby pin.</li>
            <li>: The hair on top is very shiny and looks like doll hair.</li>
            <li>This wig has lots of potential to be gorgeous if you work with it.</li>
            <li>Love it  not as curly ad the image, fits head very nicely live how light it is...</li>
            <li>Good but a little matted on top.</li>
            <li>I really love this wig and will most likely order it</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t know exactly how to cut hair, have a stylist do it!</li>
            <li>The first wig i have ever worn!</li>
            <li>do not not not not not buy this wig, it does not even have anything to secure it really to your head</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really think I have to have the band as I secure wigs with bobby</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just loving this, but wish it were a tiny touch darker.</li>
            <li>I liked this one but the color is too blonde for me.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture but after some slight modifications with my scissors it was great.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, very light blonde.</li>
            <li>Beautiful curly wig and thick.</li>
            <li>This is very light, but way too pretty to send back.</li>
            <li>I love the overall effect on me wearing this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fibers:</li>
            <li>, a it&#x27;s pretty glorious wig.</li>
            <li>, a it&#x27;s pretty glorious wig.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more wavy than curly, especially after you brush it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m either going to hot glue the hooks into place, or cut the elastic band altogether.</li>
            <li>However, the part is really obvious and looks a bit like Barbie hair at the top.</li>
            <li>(A wig is not ever ready to wear straight out if the package!)</li>
            <li>I also cut some long layers into the sides to give it more bounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is very pretty and the curls are soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty, if not a little high-maintenance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty, if not a little high-maintenance.</li>
            <li>Beautiful and soft, not easily tangled and silky to the touch, like well-conditioned natural hair.</li>
            <li>The colors look real.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light blonde with what appear as caramel-colored lowlights.</li>
            <li>The bangs are sewn onto the cap straight across, instead of tilted to the side.</li>
            <li>This means the bangs hand straight down...and they reach my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to do it 3 times until I thought it looked like real hair.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Construction: It has a reasonable-length side-part U-shaped skin-top part, which needs a little plucking to be realistic, but that&#x27;s very easy to do.</li>
            <li>wig cap is also well-made and breathable, with the typical adjustment hooks in the center back, and a comb to secure it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color: The color on my end is more ash and less golden than the photo, with beautiful high and low lights blended throughout.</li>
            <li>This wig is so soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a decent wig.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t sweep them off to the side in any fashion that looks realistic or in a way that would stay.</li>
            <li>This is not a &amp;#34;lace front &amp;#34;wig, so this is a normal &amp;#34;as expected&amp;#34; feature for this style &amp; price</li>
            <li>It looks so natural!</li>
            <li>Sorry to say,it is nothing like the picture,it has several bald spots on top ,unwearable ,as someone who has to wear wigs while my own hair is growing back</li>
            <li>It will still have a slight shine to it, but it&#x27;ll look like healthy human hair...not hair that belongs to Barbie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wish that the net on the inside of the hair was bigger because it kind of slips off of my head a little bit</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d call it a &amp;#34;light natural blonde,&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I did not have any trouble working with this wig right out of the package for costume wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The part isn&#x27;t wide enough to be realistic.</li>

            <li> horrible... nothing like it looked in the picture..Halloween wig</li>
            <li> I love it. I just wish that the net on the inside of the hair was bigger because it kind of slips off of my head a little bit</li>
            <li> Nice wig but the bangs keep falling in my face , have use some clips to hold them back !</li>
            <li> looks nothing like the picture!!! not to happy</li>
            <li> this wig looks nothing like the picture it is light brown, has no clips inside, just a cheap bra strap inside, I am so disgusted I cannot even tell you do not I repeat do not not not not not buy this wig, it does not even have anything to secure it really to your head what a</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture but after some slight modifications with my scissors it was great.</li>
            <li> HAD TO CUT AND WORK WITH THIS WIG. CANNOT COMB BANGS BACK OR NETTING WILL SHOW. OTHERWISE  A GREAT BUY</li>
            <li> I was expecting a medium blonde. This is very light, but way too pretty to send back. I&#x27;m just loving this, but wish it were a tiny touch darker. TIP: I use a capfull of woolite or non-allergenic fabric softener in a warm sink of water on wigs to prevent matting and that shiny look. Very pretty, very light blonde.</li>
            <li> I REALLY enjoy this wig! The color is lovely, and the curls are as pictured. I did not have any trouble working with this wig right out of the package for costume wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my 3rd wig from Wiwigs and I am really happy with them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like the wig, you may contact them to work out an individual refund. (Please contact them! because the default setting is to pay postage back to the UK-- but they WILL work with you to avoid that problem!) I really love this wig and will most likely order it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features:&lt;br /&gt;Construction: It has a reasonable-length side-part U-shaped skin-top part, which needs a little plucking to be realistic, but that&#x27;s very easy to do. (A wig is not ever ready to wear straight out if the package!) The bangs however, do not include the U-part section. *This is not a &amp;#34;lace front &amp;#34;wig, so this is a normal &amp;#34;as expected&amp;#34; feature for this style &amp; price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while wearing, the bangs will have to be swooped over or made a little &amp;#34;messy&amp;#34; to cover that the part line does not continue all the way to the forehead. There is plenty of hair thickness to accomplish this easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig cap is also well-made and breathable, with the typical adjustment hooks in the center back, and a comb to secure it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color: The color on my end is more ash and less golden than the photo, with beautiful high and low lights blended throughout. I&#x27;d call it a &amp;#34;light natural blonde,&amp;#34; level 6-7. I love the overall effect on me wearing this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fibers: Beautiful and soft, not easily tangled and silky to the touch, like well-conditioned natural hair. Not too shiny! This one is NOT heat resistant and seller says so, so please do not hear style it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all wigs, if you plan to wear it if moving around a lot (walking in public, etc!) it&#x27;s always a great idea to use a clear wig adhesive or wig tape to keep it from slipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m not 100% sure I&#x27;ll use it to wear out as my own hair yet, a it&#x27;s pretty glorious wig. Very FUN! Buy it!sure I&#x27;ll use it to wear out as my own hair yet, a it&#x27;s pretty glorious wig. Very FUN! Buy it!</li>
            <li> Good but a little matted on top.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This wig is so soft and pretty. Very comfortable. Thick and lots of hair.</li>
            <li> The Good: It&#x27;s gorgeous. The colors look real. It&#x27;s light blonde with what appear as caramel-colored lowlights.That&#x27;s what I wanted as my real hair is pale blonde. It&#x27;s more wavy than curly, especially after you brush it. The length is close to the picture as it goes to about mid-back on me (I&#x27;m around 5&#x27;4&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Not So Good: The hair on top is very shiny and looks like doll hair. The part isn&#x27;t wide enough to be realistic. The elastic band inside the cap to tighten the fit of the cap keeps coming unhooked. The bangs are sewn onto the cap straight across, instead of tilted to the side. This means the bangs hand straight down...and they reach my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how to fix it: To dull the unrealistic shine, sprinkle a little of any kind of body powder on both your palms, rub palms together, then pat onto the top of the wig, moving your way down. Repeat until you&#x27;re satisfied with the result. I had to do it 3 times until I thought it looked like real hair. It will still have a slight shine to it, but it&#x27;ll look like healthy human hair...not hair that belongs to Barbie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the bangs, I tried swooping them to the side and they wouldn&#x27;t stay, even when I tried to secure them with a bobby pin. You can&#x27;t pull them over too tightly, or the wefts of the wig show. After trying several things, I finally cut them. Mind you, I know how to cut hair. If you don&#x27;t know exactly how to cut hair, have a stylist do it! Please don&#x27;t attempt to do it yourself. I also cut some long layers into the sides to give it more bounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still debating on what to do about the elastic band inside the cap. I&#x27;m either going to hot glue the hooks into place, or cut the elastic band altogether. I have an average-size head and I don&#x27;t really think I have to have the band as I secure wigs with bobby pins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a decent wig. Not high-quality by any means, but at least it&#x27;s workable. If you have the know-how and patience, the wig can be truly beautiful. I&#x27;ve worked on mine enough to make it wearable. It&#x27;s very pretty, if not a little high-maintenance. Then again, we can all be a little high-maintenance sometimes. :) Good luck!be truly beautiful.

            <li> The color is very pretty and the curls are soft. The hair itself is very nice and looks real - not too shiny or plastic-looking.  However, the part is really obvious and looks a bit like Barbie hair at the top. The bangs are very, very long and there are a lot of them. I can&#x27;t sweep them off to the side in any fashion that looks realistic or in a way that would stay. Basically, the bangs are super heavy and fall down to my nose. Debating whether I should go see my stylist to have them trimmed or if I should return it. This wig has lots of potential to be gorgeous if you work with it.</li>
            <li> It looks so natural! The first wig i have ever worn! Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It looks immensely contrastable to how it is shown in the picture. It&#x27;s a really dirty blonde color with no highlights.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say,it is nothing like the picture,it has several bald spots on top ,unwearable ,as someone who has to wear wigs while my own hair is growing back&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed won&#x27;t be ordering wigs online again.</li>
            <li> I liked this one but the color is too blonde for me.</li>
