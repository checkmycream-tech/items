            <li> I tried putting it on and it&#x27;s so tight!!!! I like the flowers and the way its made and everything , I&#x27;m probably just not wearing it right? Anyway, this item took SO LONG to get here. Most likely never ordering it again, but its cheap that&#x27;s also a plus if you&#x27;re looking to buying it.</li>
            <li> At first when I got this headband in the mail, I&#x27;ll admit- I was disappointed a bit. It looked crinkled and was shipped in a plain yellow envelope and clear bag- meaning that it was a bit squashed in the mail. But I flattened out the flowers with my fingers and- tada! They were just right! I have no problem with how they shipped it because it kept it so inexpensive and the head band really didn&#x27;t suffer form it at all.&lt;br /&gt;Yes shipping was slow. Again- this cost so little and came from of far away, it&#x27;s really not worth the complaint.&lt;br /&gt;I have red hair, and the little blue roses really pop next to the copper of my hair! I&#x27;m sure it would complement any hair color, that was just an added bonus to me! So if your hair is red- then get out of the reviews and get this! ;)&lt;br /&gt;So far it fits well, and looks like it is going to hold up alright. I didn&#x27;t think it would at first, but it seems to be staying in shape with no vizable damage so far! -As I write this review, the headband costs $1.88 with free shipping. What a deal! I&#x27;m back on the page to buy another one incase I misplace this one- or so my little girl and I can match! :) I&#x27;m very pleased!&lt;br /&gt; Thank you for such a nice product at a low cost!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that is not as tight as some of the ones i have.</li>
            <li> this is the most beautiful headband. my granddaughter has long hair and we brushed her hair out and put this on and she looked like a princess. they are nicely made and it was comfrtable on her head as well. they look nice with any hair style too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i received this at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion</li>
