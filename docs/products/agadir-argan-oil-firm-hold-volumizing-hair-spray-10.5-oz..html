            <li>price was very good.</li>
            <li>Great hold that does not feel sticky leaves your hair still manageable</li>
            <li>sent me a replacement which worked fantastic!!!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t care for product, maybe good for someone else</li>
            <li>and I immediately loved the frangrance.  </li>
            <li>good for the money...</li>
            <li>Good seller...</li>
            <li>I received a set of Agadir at a Hollywood gift-suite and fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>always incredibly pleased with Agadir!</li>
            <li>love it ,smells so good too.</li>
            <li>excellent price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Very strong hold.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that flies all over the place.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine blondish hair.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this hairspray ...</li>
            <li>Can I just say we love Agadir products!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>leaves my hair soft to the touch, can run my fingers through and smells great after using.</li>
            <li>I have no problems using this on my fine hair--</li>
            <li>It smells so good and makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>The seller was an ABSOLUTE GEM!!!</li>
            <li>You can buy many hairsprays that are for fine hair and not pay nearly as much.  </li>
            <li>If you survive the initial spraying, you will see the hold is not so good.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t really great, I only got it because of the argan oil and it didn&#x27;t have much argan oil in it.</li>
            <li>Love this product and found the price at Amazon much better than I could find locally.</li>
            <li>Together these product have tamed my frizzies and fly aways without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>One can use olive oil right in your kitchen which is far better than any product with oil.</li>
            <li>Had hopes that the smell would be as good as other Agadir products, but it&#x27;s not...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell when it first goes on, but I get compliments after using the shampoo and hair care products.  </li>
            <li>I know I sound like a commercial, but I truly think that this line has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I love Agadir products, but this spray falls short.  </li>
            <li>This was my first experience with the hairspray</li>
            <li>My hair stylist used this hairspray on me for the first time after a haircut</li>
            <li>and I was just getting ready to cut it all off, then Agadir to the rescue!</li>
            <li>I just bought a two pack to save a few dollars, but it is a good product.</li>
            <li>Only positive the smell is ok, that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>I like other sprays more than this one.</li>
            <li>especially coming right out of the can.  </li>
            <li>Really liked other products from this manufacturer and I am sure I would like the one less firm........</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not stiff and sticky.  </li>
            <li>My hair has been colored since I was 18 yrs old</li>
            <li>This hairspray is a soft hold and keeps my flyaway hair in place without making it sticky.</li>
            <li>It also is holds my hair well and is not a heavy hairspray.</li>
            <li>So as soon as you use it, you are forced to clean it off otherwise</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a medium stiffness, I have fine thin hair and this works well to hold it in a touchable way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> so I am not sure why it clogs up the nozzel?</li>
            <li> The hairspray isn&#x27;t even that thick</li>
            <li> Later I sprayed it in the air and walked through it and still so bad.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even describe how horrible it was.</li>

            <li> I love Agadir products, but this spray falls short.  The spray makes me feel like I can&#x27;t breathe and I start coughing.  Had hopes that the smell would be as good as other Agadir products, but it&#x27;s not... especially coming right out of the can.  If you survive the initial spraying, you will see the hold is not so good.  Save your money and buy Suave.</li>
            <li> This stuff is sooooo good smells yummy and works so well !!!!</li>
            <li> You can buy many hairsprays that are for fine hair and not pay nearly as much.  I saw no difference in my styles or the holding power.</li>
            <li> love it ,smells so good too. it&#x27;s not stiff and sticky.  you can comb through your hair without pulling it out..</li>
            <li> My hair has been colored since I was 18 yrs old and I&#x27;m 63.  The ends of my hair would always end up splitting and each month I&#x27;d need a trim to tak off the ends.  Well, not anymore. It holds my hair the way I want it to and the ends no longer split. I just bought a two pack to save a few dollars, but it is a good product.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t really great, I only got it because of the argan oil and it didn&#x27;t have much argan oil in it. I like other sprays more than this one. I ended up just giving it away because it was wasting space.</li>
            <li> Great hold that does not feel sticky leaves your hair still manageable and you can build on the style after it is set.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with the hairspray and I love it.  I have very fine hair that flies all over the place.  This hairspray is a soft hold and keeps my flyaway hair in place without making it sticky.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for product, maybe good for someone else but I find the oil makes hair limp and too oily. One can use olive oil right in your kitchen which is far better than any product with oil. Only positive the smell is ok, that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> sort of pricey but a little goes a long way.  Very strong hold.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist used this hairspray on me for the first time after a haircut and I immediately loved the frangrance.  It also is holds my hair well and is not a heavy hairspray.</li>
            <li> Just right..arrived on time....good for the money...thank you</li>
            <li> I received a set of Agadir at a Hollywood gift-suite and fell in love with it! my hair was feeling limp and dried out and I was just getting ready to cut it all off, then Agadir to the rescue! Even my husband has commented on the difference. It smells so good and makes my hair so soft and shiny. I know I sound like a commercial, but I truly think that this line has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Love this product and found the price at Amazon much better than I could find locally.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray ... it holds your hair but also leaves a wonderful shine and softness to my hair!  The seller was an ABSOLUTE GEM!!! I contacted her &amp; explained that the can I received was damaged/would not work &amp; she without hesitation sent me a replacement which worked fantastic!!! A++++++ Would definitely buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> My mistake because I should have chosen one less firm.........Really liked other products from this manufacturer and I am sure I would like the one less firm........</li>
            <li> I do like this hair spray smell very good and not sticky. you get your money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;the price was very good.</li>
            <li> I have almost every product in this line so I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this. Sprayed my hair immediately after package arrived and yuck. Couldn&#x27;t even stay in the same room. This is the worst smell I have ever experienced from a beauty product. I can&#x27;t even describe how horrible it was. Sour and spoiled food. Later I sprayed it in the air and walked through it and still so bad. Gag. Threw it in trash. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Good seller...excellent price and fast delivery. I like this product because it makes your hair shine and combats dryness. I am a little disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t hold better, but will probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily but the sprayer sticks.  So as soon as you use it, you are forced to clean it off otherwise, you can&#x27;t use it the next day.  The hairspray isn&#x27;t even that thick so I am not sure why it clogs up the nozzel?</li>
            <li> I use this \\&quot;Firm Hold\\&quot; hair spray along with the leave in Agadir Spray Treatment. I have very fine blondish hair. Together these product have tamed my frizzies and fly aways without weighing it down. Obviously if you over-spay your hair may become a little crunchy...But you can run a brush through it to take care of that.  I have no problems using this on my fine hair-- leaves my hair soft to the touch, can run my fingers through and smells great after using.</li>
            <li> Can I just say we love Agadir products!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hairspray works as stated. Amazon prime got it to me in a timely manner. I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell when it first goes on, but I get compliments after using the shampoo and hair care products.  It&#x27;s a medium stiffness, I have fine thin hair and this works well to hold it in a touchable way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always incredibly pleased with Agadir!</li>
