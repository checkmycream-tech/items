            <li>Easy to assemble.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no problems, and it&#x27;s easy to put together.</li>
            <li>It went together easily.</li>
            <li>Not really the best trolley for a professional hairdresser, might be good for keeping cosmetics/hair tools at home, but not for the salon..</li>
            <li>dispite the missing screw it work just as good, it glides perfect other than that it&#x27;s great exactly what I needed lots if room.</li>
            <li>The plastic still feels cheap though</li>
            <li>They sent me broken/cracked parts; the unit itself is cheaply made and has scratches all over it.  </li>
            <li>The plastic is cheap...</li>
            <li>really cheap</li>
            <li>and I have walmart shelves in my house so for me to say something is cheap...</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the lock so while I am out of town for the weekend</li>
            <li>I thought it would be MEDAL and very sturdy but its all PLASTIC and is just cheap!  </li>
            <li>It came in two days and was pretty easy to put together ..</li>
            <li>It was easy to put together no broken parts and got it quickly.</li>
            <li>It is just as described, durable and good quality, much better than the one I used at the bigger salon that I just left.  </li>
            <li>This one is by far the most sturdy plastic one I have ever had.</li>
            <li>I needed to get it to my work right away.</li>
            <li>I wish the drawers were a little bigger but over all very happy.</li>
            <li>It was easy to assemble other than the piece that the top locks too arrived cracked</li>
            <li>it looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>Hope this next one works better.</li>
            <li>I am excited that it locks so I can keep my more expensive items safe!</li>
            <li>The cart is a decent size and the ability to put the drawers on the side of the top as extra space is nice, but it is NOT worth paying $80+...</li>
            <li>/&gt;We returned it, and were credited back the money, very quickly, so for that alone it got the 2 stars..</li>
            <li>Went together easily and ready to use in a short period of time!</li>
            <li>I just opened my own hair salon room and space is tight.  </li>
            <li>I really didnt like having to build it though</li>
            <li>The plastic isn&#x27;t the highest quality, but better than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and well built.</li>
            <li>thanks..</li>
            <li>I expected a much better product for this price</li>
            <li>fast service .good</li>
            <li>really adds a lot to the cart.</li>
            <li>Lightweight, but very durable.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy.</li>
            <li>Much stronger plastic.</li>
            <li>It got here really fast, I took it out of the packaging and began putting it together.</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic doesn&#x27;t last the test of time</li>
            <li>I have had a lot of flimsy rolling carts and this one is definitely better than any other I have had.</li>
            <li>Setup was easy enough and so far it has held up.  </li>
            <li>It arrived when expected, was easy to assemble, and does the job I needed it to do.</li>
            <li>High quality, spacious, would recommend to any stylist</li>
            <li>If I saw this in a salon supply shop, I would not pay more than $10 for it, yet I wasted $90 on it.</li>
            <li>Plenty of storage spaces and wheels seem to be strong enough to stand up wear and tear of daily use</li>
            <li>the only issue is one roller did not go in right and took awhile to figure itout.</li>
            <li>It took me a long time to find something that would fit my needs for doing art shows  then to finally get it and they sent me</li>
            <li>It is much smaller than expected from the item description and is made of cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>Once I assembled it the trolley looked really cheap but as soon as I loaded my stuff into it and slapped a few stickers on it</li>
            <li>Very sturdy, lots of room for back stock, tools and implements.</li>
            <li>First real let down from Amazon.</li>
            <li>was easy to put together however one of the screws for the wheels were missing ,I had to put something there to hold the wheel in place , would of returned it but needed it for the next day.</li>
            <li>The tool to put on the wheels was so tiny and cheap that I could barely hold it to use it; I am 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; and have little hands.</li>
            <li>Moves up and down the cook&#x27;s line, just the right height, and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>but at least the shipping was free.</li>
            <li>Super super sad!</li>

            <li> Super super sad!</li>
            <li> I would have returned it due to the broken piece and cheap sides, but since it arrived nearly a week after I ordered it (despite having amazon prime)</li>
            <li> It came completely unassembled and the directions were a joke, with only faded black and white pictures to go off of.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll just have to see how long it will actually last.</li>
            <li> the price, I will see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Was hoping this would work the second time but the wheels keep falling out, side compartments fall out all the time and the doors never stay closed.  </li>
            <li> Everything was delivered as expected.  </li>
            <li> But other than that ..</li>
            <li> Not worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> Looks like they just switched up a previous return without a quality check and sent it to me.  </li>
            <li> Had to go our and look for missing parts</li>
            <li> No one has emailed me back yet to tell me what to do with the broken item.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointing I can&#x27;t just contact the company and get the missing items I have to return the whole damn thing.  </li>
            <li> not sure what from.  </li>
            <li> I am a small business owner, and I don&#x27;t want it anywhere where my customers can see it.</li>
            <li> no shipping label with company info...  Package with parts was opened wheels floating around inside wrench to attach wheels missing and there were pieces of broken black plastic in bottom of box</li>
            <li> Not all parts were with product (missing and wrong bolts).  </li>
            <li> I am starting to get frustrated.</li>
            <li> The plastic is very thin, flimsy, and was missing parts.</li>
            <li> It is not sturdy, the drawers are very shallow and hardly stay in place, and if you sneeze they will come off the tracks and fall.</li>
            <li> They are easily broken because of this.</li>
            <li> There are worse trolley carts to be had</li>
            <li> This is probably my worse amazon experience.</li>
            <li> I reported that I had received this cart one week ago and that it was broken and unable to assemble.  </li>
            <li> I noticed it had the wrong bolt</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the quality of the cart.</li>
            <li> Cracked base</li>
            <li> and I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> the wheels were sooo annoying to put on !</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I just opened my own hair salon room and space is tight.  This rolling cart is perfect for what I needed.  It is just as described, durable and good quality, much better than the one I used at the bigger salon that I just left.  I would definitely recommend this cart and would not hesitate buying it again.</li>
            <li> Great quality, picture description is just what the product is. Plenty of storage spaces and wheels seem to be strong enough to stand up wear and tear of daily use</li>
            <li> I thought it would be MEDAL and very sturdy but its all PLASTIC and is just cheap!  Super super sad!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the product. It was just what I needed. Came on time in great condition. No problems</li>
            <li> I love it! I use it at home to get organized. It have space for my hair and nails stuffs. I only wish it comes with another basket. Is perfect to organize everything in one place and move it around when u needed.</li>
            <li> this item came disassembled, so dont be alarmed when you get it in the mail. it is simple as pie to put together and i got it done in abt 30 mins, the hardest part is attaching the wheels. it looks exactly like the picture. and it comes with 2 keys</li>
            <li> Cart was a very nice size but the sliding locking doors do not slide easily.  You have to push and yank to get them to slide back and forth.  They are easily broken because of this.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who needs more storage space or moves station to station like me (I am a hair stylist) I really didnt like having to build it though (ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that!) but at least the shipping was free. Once I assembled it the trolley looked really cheap but as soon as I loaded my stuff into it and slapped a few stickers on it had some character and now I love it! The plastic still feels cheap though but that&#x27;s what happens when you buy stuff you haven&#x27;t seen or touched before. All and all it&#x27;s not too shabby.... There are worse trolley carts to be had</li>
            <li> Great storage space, and easy to put together. The plastic isn&#x27;t the highest quality, but better than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Everything was delivered as expected.  Great service.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect salon roller cart. I love it. It&#x27;s very sturdy and well built. Everyone at the salon loved it. Great investment. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dog grooming shop. It arrived when expected, was easy to assemble, and does the job I needed it to do.</li>
            <li> Product is what it shows and describes....I will order again...thanks..I just wish I could have got two instead of one....</li>
            <li> This product is not premium at all. The plastic is very thin, flimsy, and was missing parts.</li>
            <li> They sent me broken/cracked parts; the unit itself is cheaply made and has scratches all over it.  I expected a much better product for this price and I am very disappointed.  This is probably my worse amazon experience.</li>
            <li> the only issue is one roller did not go in right and took awhile to figure itout. We had to glue it to stay in</li>
            <li> Gift for daughter, she loved it.</li>
            <li> This was the only seller of everything ever purchased on amazon that you don&#x27;t have the option to contact seller!  Box looked good, no shipping label with company info...  Package with parts was opened wheels floating around inside wrench to attach wheels missing and there were pieces of broken black plastic in bottom of box not sure what from.  Looks like they just switched up a previous return without a quality check and sent it to me.  I am so disappointing I can&#x27;t just contact the company and get the missing items I have to return the whole damn thing.  It took me a long time to find something that would fit my needs for doing art shows  then to finally get it and they sent me junk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never order anything that Mix Wholesale sells through Amazon, they claim they are a brick and mortar in Florida... try and find them!</li>
            <li> fast service .good quality</li>
            <li> The cart is a decent size and the ability to put the drawers on the side of the top as extra space is nice, but it is NOT worth paying $80+...The plastic is cheap...really cheap and I have walmart shelves in my house so for me to say something is cheap...It was easy to assemble other than the piece that the top locks too arrived cracked and I had to tape it up to keep it from breaking. However, it will work for what I do. We&#x27;ll just have to see how long it will actually last. I would have returned it due to the broken piece and cheap sides, but since it arrived nearly a week after I ordered it (despite having amazon prime) I needed to get it to my work right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally excited and happy with my selection of trolley. I was looking for something versatile within the price range I paid for it. Easy to assemble, lots of space with the side pockets, I love it!</li>
            <li> It came in two days and was pretty easy to put together ..the wheels were sooo annoying to put on ! But other than that ..it&#x27;s great and was a great buy &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> Great items!  Went together easily and ready to use in a short period of time!</li>
            <li> Perfect for the salon!</li>
            <li> I use this to store all of my beauty products in my dorm room. I love all the side pockets it has. really adds a lot to the cart. I also enjoy the lock so while I am out of town for the weekend I know no one will use my product</li>
            <li> It is much smaller than expected from the item description and is made of cheap plastic. It is not sturdy, the drawers are very shallow and hardly stay in place, and if you sneeze they will come off the tracks and fall. It came completely unassembled and the directions were a joke, with only faded black and white pictures to go off of. The tool to put on the wheels was so tiny and cheap that I could barely hold it to use it; I am 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; and have little hands. If I saw this in a salon supply shop, I would not pay more than $10 for it, yet I wasted $90 on it. I am a small business owner, and I don&#x27;t want it anywhere where my customers can see it.</li>
            <li> Big inconvenience!!  Not all parts were with product (missing and wrong bolts).  Had to go our and look for missing parts</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble. Lightweight, but very durable. Would recommend to anyone, even those outside the salon industry. I use it in my restaurant to hold quality assurance supplies like thermometers, labels, scales, towels, test strips, etc. Moves up and down the cook&#x27;s line, just the right height, and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> The product functions as advertised.  Setup was easy enough and so far it has held up.  That being said, the product has a flimsy feel to it, so for storing bandages and cotton balls, no problem.  But stocking it with heavier items could cause it to degrade quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I will see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Was hoping this would work the second time but the wheels keep falling out, side compartments fall out all the time and the doors never stay closed.  Hope this next one works better.</li>
            <li> Perfect for work as a hairstylist.</li>
            <li> No issues here. Great product. Very sturdy, lots of room for back stock, tools and implements. The locking feature is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> Manufacturing not the best. Cracked base but will still work for my purposes. If I was going to use it a lot I would have returned it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cart for 3 months and it&#x27;s perfect!  I&#x27;ve had no problems, and it&#x27;s easy to put together.</li>
            <li> I love the storage space and mobility of this rolling trolley. I use it for my hair products and I have the ability to lock it to keep my teenage daughter from taking my things which she has a habit of doing with returning things. My only reason for giving it four stars is because it only comes with four drawers when it has six drawer slots. I would love to have six drawers as I have lots of hair product. Why only four?</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the quality of the cart. Very flimsy. Not worth the purchase price. Only reason I did not return the cart is I can not figure out how to get it back in the box. First real let down from Amazon.</li>
            <li> High quality, spacious, would recommend to any stylist</li>
            <li> Great quality product. I have had a lot of flimsy rolling carts and this one is definitely better than any other I have had. Much stronger plastic. Plenty of organization. I wish the drawers were a little bigger but over all very happy.</li>
            <li> It received the cart on time. was easy to put together however one of the screws for the wheels were missing ,I had to put something there to hold the wheel in place , would of returned it but needed it for the next day. dispite the missing screw it work just as good, it glides perfect other than that it&#x27;s great exactly what I needed lots if room.</li>
            <li> Very nice trolley. It went together easily. Just one issue with it, the holes for the curling irons have no metal ring. The trolley will melt when the irons are on.</li>
            <li> I love how this is such a great price for my station! I am excited that it locks so I can keep my more expensive items safe! THANK YOU!!!</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with this product. It was easy to put together no broken parts and got it quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this trolley as a gift for my wife who is a hairdresser. It got here really fast, I took it out of the packaging and began putting it together. One of the wheels on the bottom would not screw in at all on further inspection I noticed it had the wrong bolt..I might have been able to &amp;#34;rig&amp;#34; something to make it work but in reality when the wife got home and saw it she was unimpressed. She thought it looked a bit too flimsy, and thought it might just fall apart. Not really the best trolley for a professional hairdresser, might be good for keeping cosmetics/hair tools at home, but not for the salon..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We returned it, and were credited back the money, very quickly, so for that alone it got the 2 stars..</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic doesn&#x27;t last the test of time</li>
            <li> I reported that I had received this cart one week ago and that it was broken and unable to assemble.  No one has emailed me back yet to tell me what to do with the broken item.  I am starting to get frustrated.</li>
            <li> I have had several of these trolly carts over the years. This one is by far the most sturdy plastic one I have ever had. Tons of room.</li>
