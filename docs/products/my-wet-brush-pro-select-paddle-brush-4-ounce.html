            <li>I LOVE THIS BRUSH!  </li>
            <li>Great for fine, tangle prone hair.</li>
            <li>Feels amazing on your scalp.</li>
            <li>Amazing, literally changed our life.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing results.  </li>
            <li>This brush is absolutely amazing -</li>
            <li>so they could have their own.</li>
            <li>my sons mother liked it</li>
            <li>Great brush and worth every penny!</li>
            <li>This is the most magical brush ever!  </li>
            <li>Most amazing brush ever..</li>
            <li>I was trying to find a suitable replacement</li>
            <li>Great variety of colors &amp; fun print patterns.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect brush - I have daycare for kids under 5 years old</li>
            <li>but this has made it so easy!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, but medium amounts of it.</li>
            <li>It tangles really easily!</li>
            <li>But the rest of it easily brushes out!</li>
            <li>But now it&#x27;s easy!  </li>
            <li>If you have hair that tangles easily, get this brush!</li>
            <li>So, despite the fact that it doesn&#x27;t style quite as easily blow drying, it is my favorite brush!  </li>
            <li>Great gentle hairbrush!  </li>
            <li>Apparently this brush is awesome</li>
            <li>I have extra-long, fine hair, and a LOT of it!</li>
            <li>I have had the most tender head that brushing my hair has been a nightmarish task.</li>
            <li>If I had a better face, I would have shaved my head bald years</li>
            <li>So many screaming fights with my mom could have been avoided.</li>
            <li>My girls like this brush because they (and I) can brush their hair without screaming. :)</li>
            <li>Love the brand</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product!!  </li>
            <li>I honestly LOVE how well itworks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since purchased two more for my mom and dad</li>
            <li>I love, love,</li>
            <li>Just ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>when I use it I have to brush the top and the bottom.  </li>
            <li>Love it for my 3 year olds hair.  </li>
            <li>i wouldnt be able to get the knots out with this brush alone, if i did</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SO much better than what I was using before.</li>
            <li>If  I brush my hair with this brush before I shower, then it comes out ok.</li>
            <li>I am going to order more of these for us and for gifts.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love it after seeing a lot of hype about it on Youtube.  </li>
            <li>We love, love, love this brush,  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of a better endorsement of this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>glad I did not.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s just hilarious.  </li>
            <li>Have never used a better brush in my life.</li>
            <li>I figured, \\&quot;hey, why not one more?</li>
            <li>This brush is the magical unicorn of hair brushes.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>they all ordered more.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I never buy &#x27;made on TV&#x27; stuff, but I bought this on the recommendation of a friend, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t used a brush on my very fine and easy to break hair in years, until my hairdresser recommended this one.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look as good as it is, when I first saw it</li>
            <li>Perfect to use on long curly hair!</li>
            <li>its a great brush and would work great on all types of hair, just realy curly hair you might run into some trouble</li>
            <li>My dance moves are even better, but that may not be on account of My Wet Brush, rather me being totally awesome.  </li>
            <li>Worth even more than it costs!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair so the brush was ok on my hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how, but this magic brush goes through my tangled fine hair without pulling it out.  </li>
            <li>Wet brushes are the best brush ever!</li>
            <li>This is the best brush EVER for wet heir!</li>
            <li>and it tangles so easy.  </li>
            <li>and I have hair that tangles really easily</li>
            <li>but hopefully, the strong smell will fade with time being exposed to room temp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>Hands down, best brush</li>
            <li>If it works half as well as this version, I&#x27;ll be made in the shade and very happy.</li>
            <li>It turns tangles into smooth tresses.</li>
            <li>I wish I had known that this brush was available before I got sucked in by an infomercial and purchased the Michael Mercier detangling brush.  </li>
            <li>Glides smoothly through my hair and saves it from breakage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll get through your knots and smooth out your hair in no time at all, and it saves you lots of time/aggravation.</li>
            <li>No pulling, no knotting - just smooth hair.</li>
            <li>Cause it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>It is also light weight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is so much more gentle and in turn, much better for your hair because it doesn&#x27;t rip it out.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>helped to brush my hair, at first, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s better than another brush out there.</li>
            <li>Works great on my hair when its completely dry.  </li>
            <li>I heard those wide tooth combs were best and I tried those too, but they hurt my head so much.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I didn&#x27;t even have to think about that because I LOVE this brush so much!  </li>
            <li>Everyone should own one!I am very satisfied with my black paddle brush</li>
            <li>so she told me to try her special brush</li>
            <li>It works like magic and SO FAST without pain.</li>
            <li>and this makes it so its not a painful experience.</li>
            <li>the chemical, burnt odor was so overwhelming that I tried to wash it out with a gentle scented soap.  </li>
            <li>she was surprised i had picked out such a great brush for her lovely hair</li>
            <li>It gets tangled super easy to the point where I used to have to de-tangle first with my fingers then brush.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I did the brush has intelliflex bristles which means it adjust to your hair and not the other way around.</li>
            <li>Seriously the best brush when trying to grow your hair out and prevents breakage!</li>
            <li>This is the best of the &#x27;Wet Brushes&#x27; by far.</li>
            <li>The brush went through like butter, quickly detangling my matted hair.</li>
            <li>From the very first pass through my hair</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;This cheap piece of ____ isn&#x27;t going to do anything!!&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>When first arrived, I thought cheap, flimsy and it will fall apart.</li>
            <li>It is good as a regular brush but not as good as a wet brush for de tangling --- not by a mile.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to be able to brush my hair wet and have it glide right through without getting caught in my hair.</li>
            <li>I searched high and low for a good paddle brush that would handle my daughters&#x27; fine hair and all their tangles, but that didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  </li>
            <li>It only takes me a minute, I love it!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>I was a huge skeptic but gave it a shot because the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I cannot stress enough how amazing this brush is.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it</li>
            <li>Simply put this is the best brush i have found for when my hair is wet.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price I paid.  </li>
            <li>My youngest has the most sensitive head and brushing always brought out the tears.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had good experiences with Wet Brushes</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is an excellent brush and definitely lives up to the no-snag promise!</li>
            <li>This is much better than the other one (the other one was the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used, so that means quite a bit).&lt;br /&gt;Keeps hairs healthy, never breaks any hairs, and untangles the hardest to detangle tangles in my hair, things you&#x27;d think only scissors would work with.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have pretty straight and fine hair.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s return policy, am I right??  </li>
            <li>This goes right through her hair without discomfort.</li>
            <li>it just glides right through.</li>
            <li>Glides right through.</li>
            <li>It glides right threw your hair.  </li>
            <li>In addition, I noticed that the bristles were bent in the bottom right corner of the brush.  </li>
            <li>I am constantly getting mini &amp;#34;nests&amp;#34; in my hair since it tangles very easily.  </li>
            <li>Was told by my hairdresser &amp; a coworker that this brush was amazing &amp; I needed to have it for my long hair.</li>
            <li>True to its name and amazing when hair is wet!</li>
            <li>I have had long hair all my life and to be honest some days</li>
            <li>It works just as well on your dry hair, and for some reason that I don&#x27;t understand, it feels amazing when you rub it against your head.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Brushing my fine, easily tangled hair was always my least favorite part of my day....</li>
            <li>These bristles are so soft they don&#x27;t even go through fine hair.</li>
            <li>also use on my two year old daughter&#x27;s hair which is fine, and it does the trick there as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter has a very sensitive head and she loves this brush!!!</li>
            <li>I love a regular paddle brush, but don&#x27;t bother with this one.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser was the first one to want one after he used mine on me.</li>
            <li>I have super fine hair and its the ONLY brush that doesn&#x27;t jerk my hair out.</li>
            <li>The thing is that my daughter who is seven years old and has long, gorgeous, wavy hair will not let me brush her hair.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it on my hair, it just glided.  </li>
            <li>I brush my hair both before and after I shower and this brush makes it so much easier!  </li>
            <li>I can absolutely guarantee they will thank you!</li>
            <li>I first used this exact brush at my daughter in-laws home.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the entire &amp;#34;wet brush&amp;#34; set!  </li>
            <li>My first thought was \\&quot;This flimsy thing</li>
            <li>I currently own 5 wet brushes and have ordered 4 others for gifts.</li>
            <li>It feels like it&#x27;s only grazing the top layer of hair, so you may have to brush your hair in sections.</li>
            <li>and I will have to shell out a bit more to get something that actually works and doesn&#x27;t smell like a burnt tire.</li>
            <li>and I have thick hair, and this brush works great after the shower</li>
            <li>I thought it would be better than the regular size</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>I have naturally straight hair that is very fine, falls about 6&amp;#34; below my shoulders and is highlighted/colored regularly.</li>
            <li>I have very long, very fine hair, but I have A LOT of it.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend would always steal it, so I had to get him his own Wet Brush as well!</li>
            <li>No really, it has a very strong odor.</li>
            <li>I was aware that some people experienced a distinct odor when receiving the brush, but I thought the positive reviews far outweighed the negative reviews, so I thought I would give the brush a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works the same with wet hair--the purpose it is marketed for--making it great all-around brush.</li>
            <li>First thing, the brush is reasonably priced so I bought two of them.  </li>
            <li>In the winter, my hair gets particularly dry and hold a lot of static</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it is does it, but it works great on brushing out my daughters long wet hair.</li>
            <li>I love this brush because it works.&lt;br /&gt;Wet or dry hair</li>
            <li>I love how i can use it in the shower and take it with me to help detangle dry hair during/</li>
            <li>Admittedly, having never spent more than five bucks on a hair brush, I initially balked at the price...but believe me when I say it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I can laugh in the face of the wind, tease my hair into a glorious mess, brush out brittle chlorine damaged hair and overall, stop worrying about my hair and learn to enjoy it and experiment more with it.</li>
            <li>Granted my hair is short and very fine but using this brush on my wet hair was a pleasure it felt so good to brush my hair without having hair fall out due to tangles.  </li>
            <li>I thought is was a little soft when I first got it, but it works wonderfully for wet or dry fine hair.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist suggested this brush after I told her how much hair I was losing.</li>
            <li>Love my Wet Brush.</li>
            <li>I am a real person, I have NOT received this product in exchange for a review, and I DO NOT work for whatever company makes this brush.  </li>
            <li>It feels like my scalp never gets touched no matter how much I brush.</li>
            <li>love this brush since I can use it on my wet hair without breaking my hair.</li>
            <li>She hates to brush it, and really hates for me to brush it.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll be buying another one very soon.</li>
            <li>Bath time is so much happier now.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really a steal for the price.</li>
            <li>Consists of very flexible plastic-type bristles.  </li>
            <li>No matter how gently I do it</li>
            <li>So gentle though, that it just glides over the knots and doesn&#x27;t comb through them.</li>
            <li>I really considered returning it</li>
            <li>The item description didn&#x27;t state that this was the one with the holes in the back for drainage, but we were happy about it, as that one was previously more expensive.  </li>
            <li>works very well for my biracial daughter with her tangled hair</li>
            <li>It took me about one minute to detangle my waist length straight hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write reviews very often, but when something like this comes along YOU JUST HAVE TO.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Using a round brush while blow drying always make my hair frizzy, and though various drugstore paddle brushes marketed as \\&quot;styling\\&quot; or \\&quot;detangling\\&quot; often provide a good end result, I lose so much hair in the process that I wonder if it&#x27;s worth it to even fix my hair.</li>
            <li>In vain, I have spent many a day fighting with her to try to comb out her knots using everything from a de-tangler to a leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped so much in growing my hair out and limit pulling out hair.</li>
            <li>It is the ONLY brush that my 4 &amp; 2 year old daughters love and don&#x27;t mind brushing their hair with.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this brush for my 2 1/2 year old son who would run every time I would come near him with a brush or comb!</li>
            <li>Works well with her long hair and easy brushing.</li>
            <li>is NOT going to be able to handle my hot mess of a head!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>and I was incredulous at first, until that first couple inches of knots were brushed out like a hot knife through butter with no tugs on my scalp, no sounds of ripping hair and no tears coming to my eyes.</li>
            <li>really much better than expected!</li>
            <li>When I first received this brush and felt the bristles, I promptly laughed because they were so thin.</li>
            <li>Getting ready for so many fancy events would have involved so much less drama...</li>
            <li>Detangling my fine and long hair is a breeze with it!</li>
            <li>We both have very long, fine hair but lots of it.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had ordered an extra.</li>
            <li>It goes through my hair smoothly every single time.</li>
            <li>Although, using it on wet hair, the bristles don&#x27;t stand up to brush through completely, especially trying to brush over the top of my head, so I use a wide-tooth comb first.</li>
            <li>she has long thick hair and my grand daughter as well &amp; love it.</li>
            <li>Can highly recommend this to all who have problems with brushing tangled hair.</li>
            <li>brush she has ever used and highly recommends it to everyone.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it takes a few strokes to fully eradicate a tangle (the brush can kind of glide over the tangle on the first sweep), and you have to start from the bottom to properly get rid of these, but it is still eons faster than a wide-tooth comb or normal hairbrush.</li>
            <li>I bought a second one for work and sent another one to my sister because it works so great on wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li>this brush FAR surpasses my other favorite brush.  </li>
            <li>Better made for a little thinner hair I suppose.</li>
            <li>If not, it just takes a little more work in that area.</li>
            <li>Just wish it was a little more multi functional.  </li>
            <li>This hair brush will not only entirely painlessly detangle my hair, wet or dry, but not rip any out as my old brush did (Revlon, best one till I tried this).</li>
            <li>This brush is gentle enough to use on my toddler granddaughter, buy sturdy enough to use on my daughter&#x27;s thicker, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I do like it a lot as it is easier on my hair than a normal brush.</li>
            <li>and I wear it up in a messy bun most days.  </li>
            <li>Easily worth the price, especially if your hair has a tendency to snarl!</li>
            <li>The round brush version of this seems to work better for me.</li>
            <li>Brushing the tangles out of my hair after a shower is normally a time consuming daunting task, not anymore.</li>
            <li>The brush came off the handle within 3 days of normal use.</li>
            <li>My 13-year old nice has some of thickess hair on earth and usually hates brushing her hair</li>
            <li>My hair has a natural wave to it, and I prefer to blow dry it straight, but I&#x27;ve never been able to find the proper brush.</li>
            <li>How did I live before this?  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t have a bad thing to say about this product, and I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, fine hair, and this never seems to get past the top layer of hair/tangles, unlike the original brush.</li>
            <li>I very much like the brush, especially for using with a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and they give way to knots, allowing the child to keep brushing until all of the knots are out, without pain.  </li>
            <li>I have long thick hair, but to my suprise the regular one was way better as it is more flexible and this one doesn&#x27;t flex at all.</li>
            <li>I used this brush the very first day I got it and the bristles melted when I blew my hair dry.</li>
            <li>Needless to say this brush is amazing!</li>
            <li>I busted it out and OMG, the process was completely painless!  </li>
            <li>and I am sure in a few more days it will be beyond wonky.   </li>
            <li>I get peace in small doses as the father of three girls.  :-)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long, but not crazy this or curly.</li>
            <li>I use it constantly because it&#x27;s the first brush I&#x27;ve had that doesn&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li>Especially after swimming it was always full of snarls and hurt when I brushed it.</li>
            <li>Wow, was I surprised!</li>
            <li>I love this brush so much, wet or dry hair</li>
            <li>Once I purchased this brush, she gladly lets me comb through her hair, wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>I did notice that the bristles are a little stiffer on the more recent brush I received, but they&#x27;re still flexible.  </li>
            <li>overall i wish it was a little better</li>
            <li>I probably looked like some sort of wild feral child from the lord of the flies with knots and mats.</li>
            <li>The bristles completely bent after using this brush twice.</li>
            <li>then go to my old brush to get the knots mine cant get.</li>
            <li>What a joke - tried to comb my naturally curly hair after reading product reviews online.</li>
            <li>Cannot recommend enough; I wish I had picked this up years ago, because it would have made my life so much easier.</li>
            <li>Overall, this brush has a really quality design; it has a nice, almost velvety feel, and it&#x27;s rather thin and lightweight.</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim to add to my Considerable collection of detangling devices.</li>
            <li>soft on scalp and doesn&#x27;t pull hair.</li>
            <li>so pleasantly surprised, you might even call me</li>
            <li>I was surprised as well.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried the brush (just on dry hair)</li>
            <li>The first time I used it in the shower, it slid through my hair with such ease that I thought, &amp;#34;This thing is not even actually brushing my hair or getting anywhere near the tangles.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>At first it&#x27;s a bit difficult to get used to because it&#x27;s so soft compared to most brushes.</li>
            <li>Incredible for long thick hair, especially wet.</li>
            <li>Those little bristles go right to work pulling out shed hairs, working over and through knots, detangling and clumping, all WITHOUT breaking your hair!</li>
            <li>The square one still works better than a typical brush but for whatever reason the round brush pulls through my hair much easier than the square one.</li>
            <li>Another plus for me, and one of the main reasons I wanted to give this brush a try, is the solid paddle to handle design.  </li>
            <li>My last two paddle brushes that were half-way decent were constructed with a separate paddle and handle that were glued(?)</li>
            <li>(slight exaggeration, but it came quick)  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does which seems simple enough bit</li>
            <li>I went on amazon on my phone and ordered my own the moment I finished brushing out that horrid mess, which by the way took so little time because this brush gets the job done and FAST.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she has long straight hair.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair silky soft and you barely feel like you&#x27;re brushing</li>
            <li>Cuts through tangled hair (even wet hair) like a hot knife through butter.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>the holes on the back of the brush don&#x27;t keep water in like other paddle brushes, so it drys quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like this paddle brush as much as the original round Wet Brush.</li>
            <li>My old paddle brush was ripping out quite a lot of hair despite how carefully and gently I would brush my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have thick hair too - and yet it goes through smoothly and softly.</li>
            <li>It is a major chore washing her hair, and a battle when it comes to brushing out the tangles.</li>
            <li>My whole life I&#x27;ve had thin and unruly blonde hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thick, some wavy areas, and graying hair.  </li>
            <li>Also, after only a couple of uses, the brush&#x27;s bristles are almost completely bent and misshapen and are unable to get through my daughters&#x27; tangles, which it did easily and painlessly during our first use.  </li>
            <li>but then i use them with a high powered blow dryers for long periods.</li>
            <li>I opened and tried on my very thick hair and ohhhh now it feels smooth and looks tamed and under control!</li>
            <li>First time I brushed with this one...not a single hair came out!</li>
            <li>It is a little tedious, but totally worth it to get my kid brushing her own</li>
            <li>, I am a 30 year old woman with the attitude of a squirmy child who hates having her hair brushed).  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and had a baby several months ago, so my hair sheds all the time.</li>
            <li>There is barely any hair in the brush when I&#x27;m through</li>
            <li>Especially the moms with young daughters.  </li>
            <li>I was seeing the scissors in my near future.</li>
            <li>Apparently these factors make all the difference in the hair brushing experience.</li>
            <li>The thin and flexible bristles are where the magic happens.</li>
            <li>We comb right through tangles wet or dry.</li>
            <li>It usually takes 10 or more with the regular paddle brush or Wide tooth comb, Along with some detangling spray.</li>
            <li>I have really thick, long hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>My daughter has long, extremely thick hair that tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>My 6 yr old daughter has long hair that she HATES to brush because it hurts.  </li>
            <li>For the first few days, she HAD to come show me</li>
            <li>It was well worth the price, and I intend to buy a small one to carry in my bag.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, thick hair</li>
            <li>This Wet Brush went right through my wet tangled hair and didn&#x27;t hurt AT ALL!  </li>
            <li>But this brush is so soft and gentle, that she brushes her hair everyday!  </li>
            <li>i have super thick and realy realy curly hair ....</li>
            <li>I only learned about a wet brush when I started going to a new stylist and she used one on my hair; trust me it will amaze you how this brush de tangles and glides through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>downside is that you shouldn&#x27;t apply direct heat to it, so if you like using a flat brush to blow dry your hair then this may not be the brush for you.</li>

            <li> my sons mother liked it</li>
            <li> Great brush and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is the most magical brush ever!  </li>
            <li> Most amazing brush ever..</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a suitable replacement</li>
            <li> Great variety of colors &amp; fun print patterns.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect brush - I have daycare for kids under 5 years old</li>
            <li> but this has made it so easy!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, but medium amounts of it.</li>
            <li> It tangles really easily!</li>
            <li> But the rest of it easily brushes out!</li>
            <li> But now it&#x27;s easy!  </li>
            <li> If you have hair that tangles easily, get this brush!</li>
            <li> So, despite the fact that it doesn&#x27;t style quite as easily blow drying, it is my favorite brush!  </li>
            <li> Great gentle hairbrush!  </li>
            <li> Apparently this brush is awesome</li>
            <li> I have extra-long, fine hair, and a LOT of it!</li>
            <li> I have had the most tender head that brushing my hair has been a nightmarish task.</li>
            <li> If I had a better face, I would have shaved my head bald years</li>
            <li> So many screaming fights with my mom could have been avoided.</li>
            <li> My girls like this brush because they (and I) can brush their hair without screaming. :)</li>
            <li> Love the brand</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product!!  </li>
            <li> I honestly LOVE how well itworks.  </li>

            <li> when I use it I have to brush the top and the bottom.  </li>
            <li> Love it for my 3 year olds hair.  </li>
            <li> i wouldnt be able to get the knots out with this brush alone, if i did</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SO much better than what I was using before.</li>
            <li> If  I brush my hair with this brush before I shower, then it comes out ok.</li>
            <li> I am going to order more of these for us and for gifts.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to love it after seeing a lot of hype about it on Youtube.  </li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t think of a better endorsement of this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s just hilarious.  </li>

            <li> I never buy &#x27;made on TV&#x27; stuff, but I bought this on the recommendation of a friend, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used a brush on my very fine and easy to break hair in years, until my hairdresser recommended this one.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look as good as it is, when I first saw it</li>
            <li> Perfect to use on long curly hair!</li>
            <li> its a great brush and would work great on all types of hair, just realy curly hair you might run into some trouble</li>
            <li> My dance moves are even better, but that may not be on account of My Wet Brush, rather me being totally awesome.  </li>
            <li> Worth even more than it costs!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair so the brush was ok on my hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how, but this magic brush goes through my tangled fine hair without pulling it out.  </li>
            <li> Wet brushes are the best brush ever!</li>
            <li> This is the best brush EVER for wet heir!</li>
            <li> and it tangles so easy.  </li>
            <li> and I have hair that tangles really easily</li>
            <li> but hopefully, the strong smell will fade with time being exposed to room temp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> Hands down, best brush</li>
            <li> If it works half as well as this version, I&#x27;ll be made in the shade and very happy.</li>
            <li> It turns tangles into smooth tresses.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known that this brush was available before I got sucked in by an infomercial and purchased the Michael Mercier detangling brush.  </li>
            <li> Glides smoothly through my hair and saves it from breakage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll get through your knots and smooth out your hair in no time at all, and it saves you lots of time/aggravation.</li>
            <li> No pulling, no knotting - just smooth hair.</li>
            <li> Cause it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> It is also light weight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is so much more gentle and in turn, much better for your hair because it doesn&#x27;t rip it out.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> helped to brush my hair, at first, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s better than another brush out there.</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair when its completely dry.  </li>
            <li> I heard those wide tooth combs were best and I tried those too, but they hurt my head so much.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I didn&#x27;t even have to think about that because I LOVE this brush so much!  </li>
            <li> Everyone should own one!I am very satisfied with my black paddle brush</li>
            <li> so she told me to try her special brush</li>
            <li> It works like magic and SO FAST without pain.</li>
            <li> and this makes it so its not a painful experience.</li>
            <li> the chemical, burnt odor was so overwhelming that I tried to wash it out with a gentle scented soap.  </li>
            <li> she was surprised i had picked out such a great brush for her lovely hair</li>
            <li> It gets tangled super easy to the point where I used to have to de-tangle first with my fingers then brush.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I did the brush has intelliflex bristles which means it adjust to your hair and not the other way around.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best brush when trying to grow your hair out and prevents breakage!</li>
            <li> This is the best of the &#x27;Wet Brushes&#x27; by far.</li>
            <li> The brush went through like butter, quickly detangling my matted hair.</li>
            <li> From the very first pass through my hair</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This cheap piece of ____ isn&#x27;t going to do anything!!&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> When first arrived, I thought cheap, flimsy and it will fall apart.</li>
            <li> It is good as a regular brush but not as good as a wet brush for de tangling --- not by a mile.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to be able to brush my hair wet and have it glide right through without getting caught in my hair.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for a good paddle brush that would handle my daughters&#x27; fine hair and all their tangles, but that didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  </li>
            <li> It only takes me a minute, I love it!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> I was a huge skeptic but gave it a shot because the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I cannot stress enough how amazing this brush is.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth it</li>
            <li> Simply put this is the best brush i have found for when my hair is wet.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price I paid.  </li>
            <li> My youngest has the most sensitive head and brushing always brought out the tears.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had good experiences with Wet Brushes</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is an excellent brush and definitely lives up to the no-snag promise!</li>
            <li> This is much better than the other one (the other one was the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used, so that means quite a bit).&lt;br /&gt;Keeps hairs healthy, never breaks any hairs, and untangles the hardest to detangle tangles in my hair, things you&#x27;d think only scissors would work with.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have pretty straight and fine hair.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s return policy, am I right??  </li>
            <li> This goes right through her hair without discomfort.</li>
            <li> it just glides right through.</li>
            <li> Glides right through.</li>
            <li> It glides right threw your hair.  </li>
            <li> In addition, I noticed that the bristles were bent in the bottom right corner of the brush.  </li>
            <li> I am constantly getting mini &amp;#34;nests&amp;#34; in my hair since it tangles very easily.  </li>
            <li> Was told by my hairdresser &amp; a coworker that this brush was amazing &amp; I needed to have it for my long hair.</li>
            <li> True to its name and amazing when hair is wet!</li>
            <li> I have had long hair all my life and to be honest some days</li>
            <li> It works just as well on your dry hair, and for some reason that I don&#x27;t understand, it feels amazing when you rub it against your head.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Brushing my fine, easily tangled hair was always my least favorite part of my day....</li>
            <li> These bristles are so soft they don&#x27;t even go through fine hair.</li>
            <li> also use on my two year old daughter&#x27;s hair which is fine, and it does the trick there as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter has a very sensitive head and she loves this brush!!!</li>
            <li> I love a regular paddle brush, but don&#x27;t bother with this one.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser was the first one to want one after he used mine on me.</li>
            <li> I have super fine hair and its the ONLY brush that doesn&#x27;t jerk my hair out.</li>
            <li> The thing is that my daughter who is seven years old and has long, gorgeous, wavy hair will not let me brush her hair.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it on my hair, it just glided.  </li>
            <li> I brush my hair both before and after I shower and this brush makes it so much easier!  </li>
            <li> I can absolutely guarantee they will thank you!</li>
            <li> I first used this exact brush at my daughter in-laws home.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the entire &amp;#34;wet brush&amp;#34; set!  </li>
            <li> My first thought was \\&quot;This flimsy thing</li>
            <li> I currently own 5 wet brushes and have ordered 4 others for gifts.</li>
            <li> It feels like it&#x27;s only grazing the top layer of hair, so you may have to brush your hair in sections.</li>
            <li> and I will have to shell out a bit more to get something that actually works and doesn&#x27;t smell like a burnt tire.</li>
            <li> and I have thick hair, and this brush works great after the shower</li>
            <li> I thought it would be better than the regular size</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair that is very fine, falls about 6&amp;#34; below my shoulders and is highlighted/colored regularly.</li>
            <li> I have very long, very fine hair, but I have A LOT of it.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend would always steal it, so I had to get him his own Wet Brush as well!</li>
            <li> No really, it has a very strong odor.</li>
            <li> I was aware that some people experienced a distinct odor when receiving the brush, but I thought the positive reviews far outweighed the negative reviews, so I thought I would give the brush a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works the same with wet hair--the purpose it is marketed for--making it great all-around brush.</li>
            <li> First thing, the brush is reasonably priced so I bought two of them.  </li>
            <li> In the winter, my hair gets particularly dry and hold a lot of static</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it is does it, but it works great on brushing out my daughters long wet hair.</li>
            <li> I love this brush because it works.&lt;br /&gt;Wet or dry hair</li>
            <li> I love how i can use it in the shower and take it with me to help detangle dry hair during/</li>
            <li> Admittedly, having never spent more than five bucks on a hair brush, I initially balked at the price...but believe me when I say it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I can laugh in the face of the wind, tease my hair into a glorious mess, brush out brittle chlorine damaged hair and overall, stop worrying about my hair and learn to enjoy it and experiment more with it.</li>
            <li> Granted my hair is short and very fine but using this brush on my wet hair was a pleasure it felt so good to brush my hair without having hair fall out due to tangles.  </li>
            <li> I thought is was a little soft when I first got it, but it works wonderfully for wet or dry fine hair.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist suggested this brush after I told her how much hair I was losing.</li>
            <li> Love my Wet Brush.</li>
            <li> I am a real person, I have NOT received this product in exchange for a review, and I DO NOT work for whatever company makes this brush.  </li>
            <li> It feels like my scalp never gets touched no matter how much I brush.</li>
            <li> love this brush since I can use it on my wet hair without breaking my hair.</li>
            <li> She hates to brush it, and really hates for me to brush it.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll be buying another one very soon.</li>
            <li> Bath time is so much happier now.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really a steal for the price.</li>
            <li> Consists of very flexible plastic-type bristles.  </li>
            <li> No matter how gently I do it</li>
            <li> So gentle though, that it just glides over the knots and doesn&#x27;t comb through them.</li>
            <li> I really considered returning it</li>
            <li> The item description didn&#x27;t state that this was the one with the holes in the back for drainage, but we were happy about it, as that one was previously more expensive.  </li>
            <li> works very well for my biracial daughter with her tangled hair</li>
            <li> It took me about one minute to detangle my waist length straight hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews very often, but when something like this comes along YOU JUST HAVE TO.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Using a round brush while blow drying always make my hair frizzy, and though various drugstore paddle brushes marketed as \\&quot;styling\\&quot; or \\&quot;detangling\\&quot; often provide a good end result, I lose so much hair in the process that I wonder if it&#x27;s worth it to even fix my hair.</li>
            <li> In vain, I have spent many a day fighting with her to try to comb out her knots using everything from a de-tangler to a leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped so much in growing my hair out and limit pulling out hair.</li>
            <li> It is the ONLY brush that my 4 &amp; 2 year old daughters love and don&#x27;t mind brushing their hair with.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this brush for my 2 1/2 year old son who would run every time I would come near him with a brush or comb!</li>
            <li> Works well with her long hair and easy brushing.</li>
            <li> is NOT going to be able to handle my hot mess of a head!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> and I was incredulous at first, until that first couple inches of knots were brushed out like a hot knife through butter with no tugs on my scalp, no sounds of ripping hair and no tears coming to my eyes.</li>
            <li> really much better than expected!</li>
            <li> When I first received this brush and felt the bristles, I promptly laughed because they were so thin.</li>
            <li> Getting ready for so many fancy events would have involved so much less drama...</li>
            <li> Detangling my fine and long hair is a breeze with it!</li>
            <li> We both have very long, fine hair but lots of it.</li>
            <li> Luckily I had ordered an extra.</li>
            <li> It goes through my hair smoothly every single time.</li>
            <li> Although, using it on wet hair, the bristles don&#x27;t stand up to brush through completely, especially trying to brush over the top of my head, so I use a wide-tooth comb first.</li>
            <li> she has long thick hair and my grand daughter as well &amp; love it.</li>
            <li> Can highly recommend this to all who have problems with brushing tangled hair.</li>
            <li> brush she has ever used and highly recommends it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it takes a few strokes to fully eradicate a tangle (the brush can kind of glide over the tangle on the first sweep), and you have to start from the bottom to properly get rid of these, but it is still eons faster than a wide-tooth comb or normal hairbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought a second one for work and sent another one to my sister because it works so great on wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> this brush FAR surpasses my other favorite brush.  </li>
            <li> Better made for a little thinner hair I suppose.</li>
            <li> If not, it just takes a little more work in that area.</li>
            <li> Just wish it was a little more multi functional.  </li>
            <li> This hair brush will not only entirely painlessly detangle my hair, wet or dry, but not rip any out as my old brush did (Revlon, best one till I tried this).</li>
            <li> This brush is gentle enough to use on my toddler granddaughter, buy sturdy enough to use on my daughter&#x27;s thicker, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I do like it a lot as it is easier on my hair than a normal brush.</li>
            <li> and I wear it up in a messy bun most days.  </li>
            <li> Easily worth the price, especially if your hair has a tendency to snarl!</li>
            <li> The round brush version of this seems to work better for me.</li>
            <li> Brushing the tangles out of my hair after a shower is normally a time consuming daunting task, not anymore.</li>
            <li> The brush came off the handle within 3 days of normal use.</li>
            <li> My 13-year old nice has some of thickess hair on earth and usually hates brushing her hair</li>
            <li> My hair has a natural wave to it, and I prefer to blow dry it straight, but I&#x27;ve never been able to find the proper brush.</li>
            <li> How did I live before this?  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t have a bad thing to say about this product, and I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, fine hair, and this never seems to get past the top layer of hair/tangles, unlike the original brush.</li>
            <li> I very much like the brush, especially for using with a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and they give way to knots, allowing the child to keep brushing until all of the knots are out, without pain.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair, but to my suprise the regular one was way better as it is more flexible and this one doesn&#x27;t flex at all.</li>
            <li> I used this brush the very first day I got it and the bristles melted when I blew my hair dry.</li>
            <li> Needless to say this brush is amazing!</li>
            <li> I busted it out and OMG, the process was completely painless!  </li>
            <li> and I am sure in a few more days it will be beyond wonky.   </li>
            <li> I get peace in small doses as the father of three girls.  :-)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long, but not crazy this or curly.</li>
            <li> I use it constantly because it&#x27;s the first brush I&#x27;ve had that doesn&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li> Especially after swimming it was always full of snarls and hurt when I brushed it.</li>
            <li> Wow, was I surprised!</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much, wet or dry hair</li>
            <li> Once I purchased this brush, she gladly lets me comb through her hair, wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I did notice that the bristles are a little stiffer on the more recent brush I received, but they&#x27;re still flexible.  </li>
            <li> overall i wish it was a little better</li>
            <li> I probably looked like some sort of wild feral child from the lord of the flies with knots and mats.</li>
            <li> The bristles completely bent after using this brush twice.</li>
            <li> then go to my old brush to get the knots mine cant get.</li>
            <li> What a joke - tried to comb my naturally curly hair after reading product reviews online.</li>
            <li> Cannot recommend enough; I wish I had picked this up years ago, because it would have made my life so much easier.</li>
            <li> Overall, this brush has a really quality design; it has a nice, almost velvety feel, and it&#x27;s rather thin and lightweight.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim to add to my Considerable collection of detangling devices.</li>
            <li> soft on scalp and doesn&#x27;t pull hair.</li>
            <li> so pleasantly surprised, you might even call me</li>
            <li> I was surprised as well.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried the brush (just on dry hair)</li>
            <li> The first time I used it in the shower, it slid through my hair with such ease that I thought, &amp;#34;This thing is not even actually brushing my hair or getting anywhere near the tangles.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> At first it&#x27;s a bit difficult to get used to because it&#x27;s so soft compared to most brushes.</li>
            <li> Incredible for long thick hair, especially wet.</li>
            <li> Those little bristles go right to work pulling out shed hairs, working over and through knots, detangling and clumping, all WITHOUT breaking your hair!</li>
            <li> The square one still works better than a typical brush but for whatever reason the round brush pulls through my hair much easier than the square one.</li>
            <li> Another plus for me, and one of the main reasons I wanted to give this brush a try, is the solid paddle to handle design.  </li>
            <li> My last two paddle brushes that were half-way decent were constructed with a separate paddle and handle that were glued(?)</li>
            <li> (slight exaggeration, but it came quick)  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does which seems simple enough bit</li>
            <li> I went on amazon on my phone and ordered my own the moment I finished brushing out that horrid mess, which by the way took so little time because this brush gets the job done and FAST.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she has long straight hair.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your hair silky soft and you barely feel like you&#x27;re brushing</li>
            <li> Cuts through tangled hair (even wet hair) like a hot knife through butter.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> the holes on the back of the brush don&#x27;t keep water in like other paddle brushes, so it drys quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this paddle brush as much as the original round Wet Brush.</li>
            <li> My old paddle brush was ripping out quite a lot of hair despite how carefully and gently I would brush my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair too - and yet it goes through smoothly and softly.</li>
            <li> It is a major chore washing her hair, and a battle when it comes to brushing out the tangles.</li>
            <li> My whole life I&#x27;ve had thin and unruly blonde hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thick, some wavy areas, and graying hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, after only a couple of uses, the brush&#x27;s bristles are almost completely bent and misshapen and are unable to get through my daughters&#x27; tangles, which it did easily and painlessly during our first use.  </li>
            <li> but then i use them with a high powered blow dryers for long periods.</li>
            <li> I opened and tried on my very thick hair and ohhhh now it feels smooth and looks tamed and under control!</li>
            <li> First time I brushed with this one...not a single hair came out!</li>
            <li> It is a little tedious, but totally worth it to get my kid brushing her own</li>
            <li> , I am a 30 year old woman with the attitude of a squirmy child who hates having her hair brushed).  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and had a baby several months ago, so my hair sheds all the time.</li>
            <li> There is barely any hair in the brush when I&#x27;m through</li>
            <li> Especially the moms with young daughters.  </li>
            <li> I was seeing the scissors in my near future.</li>
            <li> Apparently these factors make all the difference in the hair brushing experience.</li>
            <li> The thin and flexible bristles are where the magic happens.</li>
            <li> We comb right through tangles wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It usually takes 10 or more with the regular paddle brush or Wide tooth comb, Along with some detangling spray.</li>
            <li> I have really thick, long hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long, extremely thick hair that tangles easily.  </li>
            <li> My 6 yr old daughter has long hair that she HATES to brush because it hurts.  </li>
            <li> For the first few days, she HAD to come show me</li>
            <li> It was well worth the price, and I intend to buy a small one to carry in my bag.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, thick hair</li>
            <li> This Wet Brush went right through my wet tangled hair and didn&#x27;t hurt AT ALL!  </li>
            <li> But this brush is so soft and gentle, that she brushes her hair everyday!  </li>
            <li> i have super thick and realy realy curly hair ....</li>
            <li> I only learned about a wet brush when I started going to a new stylist and she used one on my hair; trust me it will amaze you how this brush de tangles and glides through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> downside is that you shouldn&#x27;t apply direct heat to it, so if you like using a flat brush to blow dry your hair then this may not be the brush for you.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I thought it looked very similar to my other paddle brushes, but when you feel it, it has more flexible/less rigid bristles than normal brushes and the base of the brush does not give at all, really.</li>
            <li> We have tried other brushes (pretty much all of them) and nothing worked like the Wet Brush for my daughter&#x27;s thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I usually dread hair brush day (I literally only brush my hair once a week because I dread it that much).  </li>
            <li> Brushing through hair, even my tangly long hair immediately after a shower, is like cutting through warm butter.</li>
            <li> Wow, my hair was a complete mess before I drew My Wet Brush though it.  </li>
            <li> My hair, straightened, is past BSL, and though I really didn&#x27;t want to cut it...</li>
            <li> ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I showed my friend the foot long dreadlock my hair had formed one night while I simply sat at her house</li>
            <li> My first brush broke at that weak connection while actually brushing my hair and the second one broke at the same spot when I dropped it on the floor.  </li>
            <li> Works on my short hair and my gf&#x27;s long hair.</li>
            <li> But all of my doubts went away when I brushed it through my DRY hair (which was curled, loaded with hair spray, and had been in 60% humidity for hours), and I met no resistance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gentle, I can even brush my hair wet now without destroying it.</li>
            <li> I bought this after purchasing the wet brush (not paddle, same manufacturer) and kept having to take it out of the bath and back in</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and have been using this brush exactly two months.  </li>
            <li> My old round brush would rip out hair every time I used it.</li>
            <li> There is actually a difference when used on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> UPDATE 3/8/15-The Wet Brush Company mailed me a replacement brush and after two days of use the same thing is happening.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have long hair.</li>
            <li> And I have long curly hair, so</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair--24&amp;#34;, long and fine--and have problems with tangles all the time.</li>
            <li> Somehow... and I will not even attempt to explain the strange magic/science of it.</li>
            <li> As for my daughter, although it takes me longer to brush her hair because it is wavy, long and thicker, the biggest thrill for me is that now she comes to me with the brush and turns around</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> others with long hair know what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li> this is a must for swinners with long hair.</li>
            <li> I was so amazed with this wet brush, I order this paddle edition for my daughter and purchased the double pack brushes for myself and husband.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and tends to tangle and this brush just goes throught it without any problems.</li>
            <li> Can only use it on wet hair</li>
            <li> So when I happened to stumble upon this brush while browsing Amazon, I couldn&#x27;t help myself.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick, straight hair.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old has super long and thick hair that took me 30 minutes just to detangle and after buying this brush , it literally takes me 5minutes to detangle her hair !!!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money if you have thick tangly hair or just want to damage your hair less.</li>
            <li> I use my Wet Brush in the shower to remove the loose hair, and it makes a big difference in keeping excess hair out of my drains and off of my floors.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my long haired son and he loves it!</li>
            <li> really think this brush is only for people with thin hair who have minor tangles.</li>
            <li> She has very long, curly blond hair.</li>
            <li> Bought for my granddaughter for her very long curly hair and she loves it.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to try to brush out dry, chlorinated, knotty hair.</li>
            <li> This is not a styling brush - do not try to blow dry with it.  </li>
            <li> I love wet brushes, this is disappointing.</li>
            <li> I USE IT ON MY DAMP HAIR AND DRY HAIR.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair &amp; it makes it so much easier brushing it with the wet brush!</li>
            <li> I just knew my type 4a thin natural African American hair would defeat!</li>
            <li> It is rare for me to find a product that isn&#x27;t at least a little disappointing, but this one really left me feeling lucky and privileged to have found it.</li>
            <li> No more tears from my six year old who has hair all the way down her back.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended the wet brush to me since I have very long hair</li>
            <li> It definitely hurts less to brush my hair and fewer hairs are yanked out when using this brush.  </li>
            <li> I have 4a/b long, THICK, natural hair.</li>
            <li> This brush works on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> This is going to sound ridiculous but this brush is seriously LIFE CHANGING.</li>
            <li> Wet or dry!</li>
            <li> I had to run my fingers through my hair to confirm that this brush was actually getting the knots out because I couldn&#x27;t believe how little it hurt.  </li>
            <li> This one pulls out much less and has very soft, flexible bristles (so don&#x27;t expect a stiff paddle brush typically used for blow dry styling).  </li>
            <li> When I received it I have to admit I thought it looked like any other brush but having used it on wet and dry hair</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my sister after my sister in law gave me an oval Wet Brush.</li>
            <li> I use it to brush out my wet hair without a snag.</li>
            <li> It was the 5th Wet brush I bought.</li>
            <li> But really I am not, it</li>
            <li> but I would only recommend the round version.</li>
            <li> (yes you can use this on wet hair).</li>
            <li> I adore my Wet Brush.</li>
            <li> I can brush through my nieces wet ahir with ease and she doesn&#x27;s complain of tangles or pain.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This hairbrush glides through my wet hair like a charm with minimal breakage.  </li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT - thank you wet</li>
            <li> I purchased the My Wet Brush Pro Select Paddle Brush, based on the reviews submitted on this site.  </li>
            <li> wet brush cause</li>
            <li> I think I have a little less than half of the bristles left that actually do something for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I found that the bristles were too flexible and not strong enough to penetrate the hair and glide through it.</li>
            <li> sister recommended this brush and I was skeptical that it could really make that big a difference, but... HOLY COW.</li>
            <li> I now use a round brush to finish blow dry styling once my hair is nearly dry.  </li>
            <li> Works like a charm, though - wet or dry!!!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and this brush detangles it in less than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for one reason: I have incredibly damaged hair (terrible breakage, thinning, and split ends due to numerous bleaching processes that I did last year), and I&#x27;m tired of seeing little splinters of hair falling to the ground when I run a brush through it.</li>
            <li> I even went back and bought the small version of the Wet Brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m multiracial and have ridiculously thick, long, coarse, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Until the wet brush came along and changed that!</li>
            <li> But My Wet Brush has revolutionized my grooming routine!</li>
            <li> I assumed that it was just due to packaging and still thought to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten rid of all my other brushes &amp; have 3 of these now (2 paddles &amp; 1 oval</li>
            <li> My wife has extremely long and thick hair, and always had issues brushing it dry before taking a shower, or wet after taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thin hair that some how manages to turn itself into one massive dreadlock just moments after being brushed, and my entire life</li>
            <li> I really have a difficult time brushing my hair after a shower.  </li>
            <li> I did a whole infomercial post about it on my Facebook because I am that obsessed with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush gets through fake, real, and whatever else hair you have.  </li>
            <li> No more crying or fussing because it hurts to have her hair brushed.  </li>
            <li> And please don&#x27;t let me have been lazy and waited too long between detangling sessions because it could go 2.5+hours.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves it, don&#x27;t know how they get it to go through such thick hair</li>
            <li> (remember how our parents would just shove the brush into our hair and if we cried, the harder they would brush as punishment for crying out-LOL)</li>
            <li> I initially bought it for my daughters who both have thick hair that tangles.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old daughter has thin, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is that it has a slight odor.</li>
            <li> Thank You Wet Brush!!</li>
            <li> Our days of fighting, screaming and crying (mom and daughter) over combing wet hair are over!</li>
            <li> Less pulls and doesn&#x27;t rip the hair out of your head.  </li>
            <li> and  I seem to have less of an issue with my hair frizzing out towards the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight chemical/plastic-y smell to the brush, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to transfer to my hair.</li>
            <li> Previously combing her hair was always a fight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say half of them are bent, we&#x27;ll see if they return to noal now being out of the case.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and brush it when it&#x27;s wet, and I always end up causing serious breakage and damage.</li>
            <li> It takes less than a minute to brush my hair when I get out of the shower now</li>
            <li> I have spent the last 3 years struggling to comb through my very tangled hair in the shower - I have broken bristles on multiple brushes in the process, and it&#x27;s always been painful and difficult.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I typically struggle with styling and straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li> Given to person with thick, long hair</li>
            <li> Works well on granddaughters long thick hair.</li>
            <li> It typically takes me FOREVER to detangle this mess!</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t very thick, so I didn&#x27;t expect this problem, but that is my only criticism.</li>
            <li> ;  Oh... but you haven’t tried the Wet Brush!!!</li>
            <li> , it gets CRAZY TANGLED SO FAST and brushing it out brings tears to my eyes.</li>
            <li> I HATE THE WIND WITH AN AMAZING PASSION for destroying my hair and causing even worse knots...</li>
            <li> The plastic they must use is of utter poor quality.  </li>
            <li> even bush thru hair that was towel dried.</li>
            <li> she is always going to school with messy, tangled hair.  </li>
            <li> Waste.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft on the head and doesn&#x27;t tug or pull uncomfortably while getting out all my snarls.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit though that the paddle type has a smoother feel to it instead of being so stiff like the 2 round ones in a pack.</li>
            <li> No way this brush deserves less than a 5 star rating!</li>
            <li> ...At least compared to other brushes.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, has done wonders for my wet mop.</li>
            <li> I become very angry and aggressive as I try to brush out knots and need to keep people away from me while I do it because it hurts so much...</li>
            <li> It would take my forever to comb out my long, thin hair post-shower.  </li>
            <li> I was so tired of pulling out my hair every time I washed it and tried to brush it out to dry.</li>
            <li> When I take it down and wash it, it is ridiculously tangled.  </li>
            <li> The Wet Brush is a game changer.</li>
            <li> I was holding my breath, expecting to hit a snag as I usually did.</li>
            <li> The description said it was a small size</li>
            <li> I gave only four stars because it does have a weird smell, but that seems to be going away and does not transfer to my hair even when I use it with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> At first, I was a bit disappointed upon opening the brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this works</li>
            <li> No more tears after showers her Mom says.</li>
            <li> however, my other daughter has thin hair and prefers a fuller bristled brush.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to comb after washing it.  </li>
            <li> so if you have a thick mane, beware.  </li>
            <li> However, I have extremely thick hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly thick hair</li>
            <li> I have wavy, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair so takes bit longer to detangle.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair, by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has extremely thick curly hair that always got tangled in combs or brushes.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable how incrediable this brush is!  </li>
            <li> And no more pain!  </li>
            <li> No more pulling!</li>
            <li> No more breackage!</li>
            <li> I doubt I&#x27;ll ever use another brush again, and I mean that quite seriously.</li>
            <li> I have seriously avoided swimming at times</li>
            <li> And it is a serious life changer.</li>
            <li> Two weeks later, the brush is still a miserable smell that sometimes leaves similar scents in my daughters&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I know that using a traditional brush in the shower is really bad for your hair</li>
            <li> She now brushes her hair herself all the time and is never bothered if I brush it - even right after washing, which was always the worst.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that gets seriously tangled.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically impossible to comb or brush through it while wet or damp, without tearing through it.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I got this brush for my 12 year old daughter who hated brushing her hair after the shower because of tangles.  </li>
            <li> I also was really, really tired of dealing with it.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are thin and flexible (so thin and flexible</li>
            <li> my hair is thin to medium texture.</li>
            <li> I tired to wash it and use it in the shower with shampoo on it.....</li>
            <li> ;  You will not be disappointed in this Wet Brush Pro!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but as soon as I started brushing, I wasn&#x27;t in any pain</li>
            <li> Two or three of the bristles have twisted</li>
            <li> I had to ask what this random brush was.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to have broken some of the bristles!</li>
            <li> I like to brush conditioner thru my hair and the brush was useless for this, wpuldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> This is a GAME CHANGER!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this brush because it looks like it would hurt.  </li>
            <li> It is now almost completely useless and I am returning it, after two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite sad about it though.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> The rubberized body of the brush is sturdy, but the bristles are very thin and flexible and point in every direction.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am very disappointed in the paddle brush version of the Wet Brush.</li>
            <li> This Brush stinks.</li>
            <li> ; I was wrong!</li>
            <li> I wish so badly</li>
            <li> Teachers and students no longer think I am a bad mommy.  </li>
            <li> I used to dread brushing my hair after I showered because it was painful, my hair would fall out, and it would take forever to get all the tangles out.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pathetic, but I&#x27;d prefer to look like a mangy dog than deal with the pain of my hair.</li>
            <li> It also smells terrible.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible</li>
            <li> I ordered another detangle brush and it was terrible.  </li>
            <li> It is terrible.  </li>

            <li> Loved it!! Definitely worth it</li>
            <li> BEST brush ever! I have very long hair and this brush detangles it in less than 2 minutes. Amazing!</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, thick hair and it tangles so easy.  I am so tender headed I really have a difficult time brushing my hair after a shower.  I was skeptical, but as soon as I started brushing, I wasn&#x27;t in any pain and it got rid of all the tangles without any issues or breaking my hair off.  I&#x27;m pretty impressed...</li>
            <li> My hair stylist suggested this brush after I told her how much hair I was losing.</li>
            <li> I got this brush for my 12 year old daughter who hated brushing her hair after the shower because of tangles.  She had a friend that had a similar brush and asked me to get her one.  SHE LOVES IT!  For the first few days, she HAD to come show me how &amp;#34;awesome&amp;#34; it worked.  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Great gentle hairbrush!  My old paddle brush was ripping out quite a lot of hair despite how carefully and gently I would brush my hair.  This one pulls out much less and has very soft, flexible bristles (so don&#x27;t expect a stiff paddle brush typically used for blow dry styling).  So, despite the fact that it doesn&#x27;t style quite as easily blow drying, it is my favorite brush!  I now use a round brush to finish blow dry styling once my hair is nearly dry.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best brush I have ever used! Somehow it gets out all of the tangles without causing any pain. My boyfriend would always steal it, so I had to get him his own Wet Brush as well!</li>
            <li> Love my Wet Brush. Purchased one for everyone in the family.</li>
            <li> This brush is great. I have really thick, long hair that tangles easily. My old round brush would rip out hair every time I used it. First time I brushed with this one...not a single hair came out! It&#x27;s so gentle, I can even brush my hair wet now without destroying it. Definitely worth the money if you have thick tangly hair or just want to damage your hair less.</li>
            <li> This is going to sound ridiculous but this brush is seriously LIFE CHANGING. This brush is a master detangler. It works like magic and SO FAST without pain. I did a whole infomercial post about it on my Facebook because I am that obsessed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thin hair that some how manages to turn itself into one massive dreadlock just moments after being brushed, and my entire life I have had the most tender head that brushing my hair has been a nightmarish task. I have seriously avoided swimming at times so I didn&#x27;t have to try to brush out dry, chlorinated, knotty hair. I HATE THE WIND WITH AN AMAZING PASSION for destroying my hair and causing even worse knots... I become very angry and aggressive as I try to brush out knots and need to keep people away from me while I do it because it hurts so much... It doesn&#x27;t matter how short my hair is either, it gets CRAZY TANGLED SO FAST and brushing it out brings tears to my eyes. It&#x27;s pathetic, but I&#x27;d prefer to look like a mangy dog than deal with the pain of my hair. If I had a better face, I would have shaved my head bald years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I showed my friend the foot long dreadlock my hair had formed one night while I simply sat at her house so she told me to try her special brush and I was incredulous at first, until that first couple inches of knots were brushed out like a hot knife through butter with no tugs on my scalp, no sounds of ripping hair and no tears coming to my eyes. I knew everything was different then. I went on amazon on my phone and ordered my own the moment I finished brushing out that horrid mess, which by the way took so little time because this brush gets the job done and FAST.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can laugh in the face of the wind, tease my hair into a glorious mess, brush out brittle chlorine damaged hair and overall, stop worrying about my hair and learn to enjoy it and experiment more with it. I wish so badly I had this brush growing up. I probably looked like some sort of wild feral child from the lord of the flies with knots and mats. So many screaming fights with my mom could have been avoided. Getting ready for so many fancy events would have involved so much less drama... I hope every parent with a tender headed child gets this brush. You&#x27;ll be doing yourself and your child a favor.</li>
            <li> These brushes are the best!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable how incrediable this brush is!  It takes out tangles without pulling the hair out!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this brush.  There is actually a difference when used on wet hair.  Less pulls and doesn&#x27;t rip the hair out of your head.  I had to get one for my wife.</li>
            <li> This is the second brush of this brand that I&#x27;ve purchased.  I did notice that the bristles are a little stiffer on the more recent brush I received, but they&#x27;re still flexible.  I very much like the brush, especially for using with a hair dryer.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Simply put this is the best brush i have found for when my hair is wet.  Two or three of the bristles have twisted but then i use them with a high powered blow dryers for long periods.</li>
            <li> I used this brush the very first day I got it and the bristles melted when I blew my hair dry. My girls like this brush because they (and I) can brush their hair without screaming. :)</li>
            <li> Best brush ever created</li>
            <li> brush does it&#x27;s job, bristles remain intact after a month</li>
            <li> Brushing my fine, easily tangled hair was always my least favorite part of my day.... Until the wet brush came along and changed that! It&#x27;s like magic!! Runs through my hair with such ease and no pulling!</li>
            <li> Given to person with thick, long hair and she just loved it! Can highly recommend this to all who have problems with brushing tangled hair.</li>
            <li> The bristles completely bent after using this brush twice. It also smells terrible.</li>
            <li> The Wet Brush is a game changer. I was a huge skeptic but gave it a shot because the price is reasonable. I bought a second one for work and sent another one to my sister because it works so great on wet and dry hair. We both have very long, fine hair but lots of it. It gets tangled super easy to the point where I used to have to de-tangle first with my fingers then brush. Now I can painlessly brush even after a workout or sleep without ripping my hair out. I will never use another brush again.</li>
            <li> Love the brand but this version does NOT get out tangles.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a very sensitive head and she loves this brush!!!</li>
            <li> I cannot stress enough how amazing this brush is.  I have curly/kinky african-american hair and finding a brush that gets through matted knots is a nightmare.  This product had a ton of good reviews, but I still purchased with caution.  Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s return policy, am I right??  Luckily, I didn&#x27;t even have to think about that because I LOVE this brush so much!  I usually dread hair brush day (I literally only brush my hair once a week because I dread it that much).  I busted it out and OMG, the process was completely painless!  I had to run my fingers through my hair to confirm that this brush was actually getting the knots out because I couldn&#x27;t believe how little it hurt.  If you have a squirmy child who hates getting his/her hair brushed, THIS is the brush you have been searching for (I would know, I am a 30 year old woman with the attitude of a squirmy child who hates having her hair brushed).  Another plus for me, and one of the main reasons I wanted to give this brush a try, is the solid paddle to handle design.  My last two paddle brushes that were half-way decent were constructed with a separate paddle and handle that were glued(?) together.  My first brush broke at that weak connection while actually brushing my hair and the second one broke at the same spot when I dropped it on the floor.  I am hoping since this brush is one solid piece, it won&#x27;t have that weakness built into it.  Also, my hair would often snag in the groove where the two pieces were connected and rip my hair out.  Again, this is not an issue with this brush.  I haven&#x27;t tried the mini version of this brush, but I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing it for an upcoming trip I am taking.  If it works half as well as this version, I&#x27;ll be made in the shade and very happy. I cannot say enough good things about this product!!  I am a real person, I have NOT received this product in exchange for a review, and I DO NOT work for whatever company makes this brush.  I honestly LOVE how well itworks.  It is rare for me to find a product that isn&#x27;t at least a little disappointing, but this one really left me feeling lucky and privileged to have found it.</li>
            <li> The best brush ever!! I have long thick hair &amp; it makes it so much easier brushing it with the wet brush!</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and have been using this brush exactly two months.  Recently it kept snagging in my hair and after looking at the brush the bristles are all totally bent.  This should not happen after such a short amount of time.  Perhaps the brush is made for people with thinner hair or so if you have a thick mane, beware.  Total garbage.  UPDATE 3/8/15-The Wet Brush Company mailed me a replacement brush and after two days of use the same thing is happening.  The bristles are totally bending sideways.   There are already about 5 already skewed to the side and I am sure in a few more days it will be beyond wonky.   The plastic they must use is of utter poor quality.  As for now it feels like Freddy Krueger is brushing my hair.  No thanks.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work either. I just stick with my Denmen brush. These bristles are so soft they don&#x27;t even go through fine hair.</li>
            <li> This brush gets through fake, real, and whatever else hair you have.  Lol!!!  It turns tangles into smooth tresses.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look as good as it is, when I first saw it I didn&#x27;t think it would work at all....but it is GREAT!!! Perfect to use on long curly hair!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t brush my hair without this product! Love it!</li>
            <li> I had to buy one of these after seeing that every girl at a bachelorette party already owned one!  I had to ask what this random brush was.  When I received it I have to admit I thought it looked like any other brush but having used it on wet and dry hair now I have to say it&#x27;s a simple and genius idea.  It definitely hurts less to brush my hair and fewer hairs are yanked out when using this brush.  I&#x27;ve since purchased two more for my mom and dad (yes, I think guys should use it too!)</li>
            <li> I heard about the brush from you tube , once I get it I will informed you</li>
            <li> Most amazing brush ever.. Seriously, has done wonders for my wet mop.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my sister after my sister in law gave me an oval Wet Brush. I have naturally curly hair and had a baby several months ago, so my hair sheds all the time. I use my Wet Brush in the shower to remove the loose hair, and it makes a big difference in keeping excess hair out of my drains and off of my floors.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am very disappointed in the paddle brush version of the Wet Brush. I have very thick, fine hair, and this never seems to get past the top layer of hair/tangles, unlike the original brush. It feels like my scalp never gets touched no matter how much I brush. I love a regular paddle brush, but don&#x27;t bother with this one.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended the wet brush to me since I have very long hair and it&#x27;s hard to comb after washing it.  I love, love, love this brush since I can use it on my wet hair without breaking my hair.</li>
            <li> Like plastic and cigarettes</li>
            <li> I use the on my horse&#x27;s mane and tail and it works great.  The best thing I have tried to detangle my horse’s hair…</li>
            <li> Love this brush! It gets tangles out without pulling hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after my hair dresser insisted. I do like it a lot as it is easier on my hair than a normal brush. However, I have extremely thick hair and it seems to have broken some of the bristles! Yikes! Better made for a little thinner hair I suppose.</li>
            <li> This brush is so great that my wife gave it away to her cousin. Luckily I had ordered an extra. Our daughter is 4 and has never had a hair cut. This goes right through her hair without discomfort.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t tear hair and applies even pressure.</li>
            <li> Just ordered 2 more. They are that good. My hairdresser was the first one to want one after he used mine on me. I just ordered one for my daughter and granddaughter. My daughter and I both have long hair. I just realized that I no longer have split ends, and it has to be the brush. This brush is gentle enough to use on my toddler granddaughter, buy sturdy enough to use on my daughter&#x27;s thicker, fine hair. I use it to brush out my wet hair without a snag. I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much, wet or dry hair it just glides right through. I wouldn&#x27;t even brush my hair at all before I purchased this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about 2 weeks and I absolutely love it. I&#x27;m multiracial and have ridiculously thick, long, coarse, curly hair.  This brush just glides through it.  There is barely any hair in the brush when I&#x27;m through and  I seem to have less of an issue with my hair frizzing out towards the end of the day.  There is a slight chemical/plastic-y smell to the brush, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to transfer to my hair.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves it, don&#x27;t know how they get it to go through such thick hair but it works great</li>
            <li> Wow, my hair was a complete mess before I drew My Wet Brush though it.  Now I look like justin timberlake.  My dance moves are even better, but that may not be on account of My Wet Brush, rather me being totally awesome.  I clicked the order button and it was on my doorstep before I got up.  (slight exaggeration, but it came quick)  This could be my defining purchase of 2014.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> I have told all of my mom-friends about this brush.  Especially the moms with young daughters.  My daughter is 9 and she has long straight hair.  She hates to brush it, and really hates for me to brush it.  But this brush is so soft and gentle, that she brushes her hair everyday!  The bristles are very soft and they give way to knots, allowing the child to keep brushing until all of the knots are out, without pain.  Now brushing takes longer with this brush.  And I have long curly hair, so when I use it I have to brush the top and the bottom.  It is a little tedious, but totally worth it to get my kid brushing her own hair.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
            <li> Love it for my 3 year olds hair.  Previously combing her hair was always a fight but this has made it so easy!</li>
            <li> im not saying this isnt a good brush, it goes through it with bairly any tug, it would be great for fussy kids with thinner hair!! i have super thick and realy realy curly hair .... like realy curly, the back of my head get so knotted it takes over tten minuts to brush my hair. i wouldnt be able to get the knots out with this brush alone, if i did id be there forever. but i do what i can with this brush then go to my old brush to get the knots mine cant get. overall i wish it was a little better but i dont have any complaints. its a great brush and would work great on all types of hair, just realy curly hair you might run into some trouble</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.  I used it once and just threw it away.</li>
            <li> I like this brush... a lot. It&#x27;s SO much better than what I was using before. I used to dread brushing my hair after I showered because it was painful, my hair would fall out, and it would take forever to get all the tangles out. I have very fine hair, but medium amounts of it. It tangles really easily! The only issue I have is that it doesn&#x27;t brush out the knot I always get underneath my hair at the back. I guess from moving my head from side to side all day. If  I brush my hair with this brush before I shower, then it comes out ok. If not, it just takes a little more work in that area. But the rest of it easily brushes out! It only takes me a minute, I love it!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended I buy one of these, and it is a total lifesaver!  How did I live before this?  It would take my forever to comb out my long, thin hair post-shower.  But now it&#x27;s easy!  And no more pain!  This is not a styling brush - do not try to blow dry with it.  It is for detangling.</li>
            <li> Good brush, just arrived with the plastic bristles bent.  I&#x27;d say half of them are bent, we&#x27;ll see if they return to noal now being out of the case.</li>
            <li> Was told by my hairdresser &amp; a coworker that this brush was amazing &amp; I needed to have it for my long hair. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my long haired son and he loves it! He even lets his girlfriend borrow it. It was the 5th Wet brush I bought.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair--24&amp;#34;, long and fine--and have problems with tangles all the time. Every morning has been a struggle trying to get my hair snag-free. In the winter, my hair gets particularly dry and hold a lot of static so I gave this brush a shot. I was holding my breath, expecting to hit a snag as I usually did. Nothing! I brushed out everything without so much as a tiny knot. I&#x27;m in love! I think I&#x27;ll be buying another one very soon.</li>
            <li> My whole life I&#x27;ve had thin and unruly blonde hair that tangles easily. This hair brush will not only entirely painlessly detangle my hair, wet or dry, but not rip any out as my old brush did (Revlon, best one till I tried this). Will never buy anything else again when this needs replacement.</li>
            <li> What a joke - tried to comb my naturally curly hair after reading product reviews online. It did nothing. I immediately sent it back.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible I tried everything to deodorize. I love wet brushes, this is disappointing.</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;m very satisfied :)</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair when its completely dry.  Bristles are too soft and flatten on wet hair.  I like to brush conditioner thru my hair and the brush was useless for this, wpuldn&#x27;t even bush thru hair that was towel dried.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush after recommendations from a friend.  My daughter has long, extremely thick hair that tangles easily.  This brush goes through her hair with ease.  No more crying or fussing because it hurts to have her hair brushed.  I am going to order more of these for us and for gifts.  Love this brush!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my granddaughter. She has very long, curly blond hair. It is a major chore washing her hair, and a battle when it comes to brushing out the tangles. Mom has tried every type of hair detangle product but the tugging always caused her great pain. This brush is AMAZING! Bath time is so much happier now. Thank You Wet Brush!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it after seeing a lot of hype about it on Youtube.  However, this did not work for me at all.  I don&#x27;t have particularly thick hair but I have a LOT of hair and it has wave and curl in it.  I found that the bristles were too flexible and not strong enough to penetrate the hair and glide through it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it is does it, but it works great on brushing out my daughters long wet hair. Glides right through. Amazing!</li>
            <li> I will never use another brush from walmart of any beauty supplies. I have super fine hair and its the ONLY brush that doesn&#x27;t jerk my hair out. Seriously the best brush when trying to grow your hair out and prevents breakage! I also purchased the regular and mini sized.</li>
            <li> This is the best of the &#x27;Wet Brushes&#x27; by far. The description said it was a small size but it actually is much larger than the pro brush and it&#x27;s really a steal for the price.</li>
            <li> ...At least compared to other brushes.  Consists of very flexible plastic-type bristles.  True to its name and amazing when hair is wet!</li>
            <li> Our days of fighting, screaming and crying (mom and daughter) over combing wet hair are over! This brush works like a charm. Worth even more than it costs!</li>
            <li> We love, love, love this brush,  I can&#x27;t tell you how many tears it has saved!!!</li>
            <li> Cuts through tangled hair (even wet hair) like a hot knife through butter.&lt;br /&gt;One downside is that you shouldn&#x27;t apply direct heat to it, so if you like using a flat brush to blow dry your hair then this may not be the brush for you.</li>
            <li> From the very first pass through my hair I knew... This is a GAME CHANGER! I have 4a/b long, THICK, natural hair. It typically takes me FOREVER to detangle this mess! 1.5-2 hours in the shower detangling is the norm. And please don&#x27;t let me have been lazy and waited too long between detangling sessions because it could go 2.5+hours. I was seeing the scissors in my near future. My hair, straightened, is past BSL, and though I really didn&#x27;t want to cut it...I also was really, really tired of dealing with it.  One day I stumbled across an article that mentioned trying out a paddle brush for detangling.  Now if you&#x27;re anything like me you&#x27;re thinking... &amp;#34;HECK NO! A paddle brush will get caught up in my hair and never come out!&amp;#34;  Oh... but you haven’t tried the Wet Brush!!! Bristles are thin and flexible (so thin and flexible that when I got it out of the package I laughed!! &amp;#34;This cheap piece of ____ isn&#x27;t going to do anything!!&amp;#34;). The thin and flexible bristles are where the magic happens. Somehow... and I will not even attempt to explain the strange magic/science of it. Those little bristles go right to work pulling out shed hairs, working over and through knots, detangling and clumping, all WITHOUT breaking your hair! It&#x27;s pretty amazing. I don&#x27;t know how it works it just does. And it is a serious life changer. Before this brush I was a finger detangler only.  Now, I use this brush and can shave an hour off detangling time! It&#x27;s wonderful! Do yourself a favor and get one!!</li>
            <li> I wish I had known that this brush was available before I got sucked in by an infomercial and purchased the Michael Mercier detangling brush.  It did not work for me.  I have fine hair so the brush was ok on my hair but my daughter&#x27;s hair is thicker and it did not work.  The thing is that my daughter who is seven years old and has long, gorgeous, wavy hair will not let me brush her hair.  No matter how gently I do it (remember how our parents would just shove the brush into our hair and if we cried, the harder they would brush as punishment for crying out-LOL) she is always going to school with messy, tangled hair.  I feel embarassed because I feel that the students and teacher must think that I am the neglectful mom.  But really I am not, it just that if I show her a brush, she runs away screaming.  At any rate, because I order alot from Amazon and am usually satisfied, I decided to buy this brush based on all the great reviews.  First thing, the brush is reasonably priced so I bought two of them.  Secondly, IT ACTUALLY WORKS.  The first time I used it on my hair, it just glided.  Granted my hair is short and very fine but using this brush on my wet hair was a pleasure it felt so good to brush my hair without having hair fall out due to tangles.  As for my daughter, although it takes me longer to brush her hair because it is wavy, long and thicker, the biggest thrill for me is that now she comes to me with the brush and turns around so I can do her hair.  I can&#x27;t think of a better endorsement of this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.  Teachers and students no longer think I am a bad mommy.  LOL</li>
            <li> When first arrived, I thought cheap, flimsy and it will fall apart. almost wanted to send back glad I did not. I opened and tried on my very thick hair and ohhhh now it feels smooth and looks tamed and under control!</li>
            <li> I have extra-long, fine hair, and a LOT of it! It&#x27;s basically impossible to comb or brush through it while wet or damp, without tearing through it. This brush is a MIRACLE!!!! Glides smoothly through my hair and saves it from breakage. You will NOT regret this purchase if you have the same problem as me. I even bought a backup,  just in case!</li>
            <li> This brush just cannot get through my knots. I have very thick hair that gets seriously tangled. I know that using a traditional brush in the shower is really bad for your hair so I wanted to try something different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so much more gentle and in turn, much better for your hair because it doesn&#x27;t rip it out. So gentle though, that it just glides over the knots and doesn&#x27;t comb through them. When I get out of the shower I&#x27;m back at square one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really think this brush is only for people with thin hair who have minor tangles.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush ever! My 2 girls and I have hair that tangles really easily and this makes it so its not a painful experience.</li>
            <li> I have very long, very fine hair, but I have A LOT of it.  I am constantly getting mini &amp;#34;nests&amp;#34; in my hair since it tangles very easily.  This brush is amazing!  I brush my hair both before and after I shower and this brush makes it so much easier!  If you have hair that tangles easily, get this brush!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how, but this magic brush goes through my tangled fine hair without pulling it out.  I love it</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine my life without this brush, and I do no remember my life before it.</li>
            <li> When I first received this brush and felt the bristles, I promptly laughed because they were so thin. I just knew my type 4a thin natural African American hair would defeat! this brush. I really considered returning it but instead I decided to give it a try. I am so happy I did the brush has intelliflex bristles which means it adjust to your hair and not the other way around. It does not force it&#x27;s way through you hair, it glides. I&#x27;m so very happy I purchased. *note* my hair is thin to medium texture. I don&#x27;t know how this would work on thicker textures.</li>
            <li> This is the most magical brush ever!  I ordered another detangle brush and it was terrible.  I was skeptical of this brush because it looks like it would hurt.  I have long hair and I wear it up in a messy bun most days.  When I take it down and wash it, it is ridiculously tangled.  I heard those wide tooth combs were best and I tried those too, but they hurt my head so much.  This Wet Brush went right through my wet tangled hair and didn&#x27;t hurt AT ALL!  I am a total believer and you will be too!</li>
            <li> this brush FAR surpasses my other favorite brush.  I was trying to find a suitable replacement and I found &amp;#34;gold.&amp;#34;  You will not be disappointed in this Wet Brush Pro!</li>
            <li> My 9 year old has super long and thick hair that took me 30 minutes just to detangle and after buying this brush , it literally takes me 5minutes to detangle her hair !!! Needless to say this brush is amazing! I would recommend it to anyone all hair types . A definitely must buy.</li>
            <li> The item description didn&#x27;t state that this was the one with the holes in the back for drainage, but we were happy about it, as that one was previously more expensive.  Maybe they changed the design so that all of them have the holes?  With my daughter&#x27;s bi-racial mass of frizzy hair, we need to replace the brush about every 6 months.  Works like a charm, though - wet or dry!!!</li>
            <li> Since I started growing my hair out, I have struggled with tangles. I have dry hair and brush it when it&#x27;s wet, and I always end up causing serious breakage and damage. But My Wet Brush has revolutionized my grooming routine! When it arrived I thought it looked very similar to my other paddle brushes, but when you feel it, it has more flexible/less rigid bristles than normal brushes and the base of the brush does not give at all, really. Apparently these factors make all the difference in the hair brushing experience. Brushing through hair, even my tangly long hair immediately after a shower, is like cutting through warm butter. Sometimes it takes a few strokes to fully eradicate a tangle (the brush can kind of glide over the tangle on the first sweep), and you have to start from the bottom to properly get rid of these, but it is still eons faster than a wide-tooth comb or normal hairbrush. Cannot recommend enough; I wish I had picked this up years ago, because it would have made my life so much easier. Easily worth the price, especially if your hair has a tendency to snarl!</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick, straight hair. I have wavy, thick hair. It&#x27;s a great brush for both kinds.... however, my other daughter has thin hair and prefers a fuller bristled brush. Best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> This brush works on wet or dry hair. Feels amazing on your scalp.I have thick hair so takes bit longer to detangle. I&#x27;m buying another for my mom.</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair that is very fine, falls about 6&amp;#34; below my shoulders and is highlighted/colored regularly. The round brush version of this seems to work better for me. The square one still works better than a typical brush but for whatever reason the round brush pulls through my hair much easier than the square one. Great brush but I would only recommend the round version.</li>
            <li> Three girls, one brush, no tangles.  I love this brush because it works.&lt;br /&gt;Wet or dry hair the girls get the job done and don&#x27;t complain.  As a matter of fact they asked me to buy them different ones so they could have their own. I get peace in small doses as the father of three girls.  :-)  This is one of them.</li>
            <li> Best paddle brush ever. It goes through my hair smoothly every single time. Wet or dry! Awesome detangling power. Only negative is that it has a slight odor. It seems to be going away though. I love how i can use it in the shower and take it with me to help detangle dry hair during/after i blowdry it. the holes on the back of the brush don&#x27;t keep water in like other paddle brushes, so it drys quickly.</li>
            <li> works very well for my biracial daughter with her tangled hair</li>
            <li> I have had long hair all my life and to be honest some days I would just not brush it at all because it was such a pain.  Forget trying to get a comb through it, that&#x27;s just hilarious.  This brush is PERFECT.  It does exactly what it says it does which seems simple enough bit I know others with long hair know what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li> I saw this brush on a morning show and decided to order online-- it did not disappoint. Detangles my hair without ripping hair out of my head. It takes less than a minute to brush my hair when I get out of the shower now (yes you can use this on wet hair). Love it!</li>
            <li> this is a must for swinners with long hair. it detangles without breaking the hairs.</li>
            <li> Overall, this brush has a really quality design; it has a nice, almost velvety feel, and it&#x27;s rather thin and lightweight. The body of it is all one piece so hair doesn&#x27;t get caught (sometimes happens if there is a crack between the bristle part and the handle). The first time I tried the brush (just on dry hair) I was amazed at how nice it felt and didn&#x27;t pull at all! Although, using it on wet hair, the bristles don&#x27;t stand up to brush through completely, especially trying to brush over the top of my head, so I use a wide-tooth comb first. My hair isn&#x27;t very thick, so I didn&#x27;t expect this problem, but that is my only criticism. Other than that, it is an excellent brush and definitely lives up to the no-snag promise!</li>
            <li> Best brush ever. Bought 2 and my girls fight over them constantly. One won&#x27;t brush her hair without that brush.</li>
            <li> Amazing, literally changed our life. Morning routine used to include tears and whining now my daughter actually enjoys me brushing her hair!  It is a miracle.  We have tried other brushes (pretty much all of them) and nothing worked like the Wet Brush for my daughter&#x27;s thick hair.  When you buy one for yourself, buy another for a friend. I can absolutely guarantee they will thank you!</li>
            <li> Have never used a better brush in my life. Brushing the tangles out of my hair after a shower is normally a time consuming daunting task, not anymore. Have already ordered the mini for my purse and another paddle for my best friend!</li>
            <li> really much better than expected!</li>
            <li> I bought this about 6 weeks ago and I use it after I wash my hair, which is about every 2-3 days. I have pretty straight and fine hair. It&#x27;s long, but not crazy this or curly. Well, a lot of the bristles are already bent over. I think I have a little less than half of the bristles left that actually do something for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It helped to brush my hair, at first, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s better than another brush out there. Waste. Of. Money.</li>
            <li> Best brush I have ever owned!  It leaves your hair silky soft and you barely feel like you&#x27;re brushing you&#x27;re hair.  It massages your scalp for somehow your hair doesn&#x27;t get caught so there&#x27;s no pain/feeling at all getting those tangles on.  It is the ONLY brush that my 4 &amp; 2 year old daughters love and don&#x27;t mind brushing their hair with.  Love it!</li>
            <li> OMG! This brush is amazing!! I gave only four stars because it does have a weird smell, but that seems to be going away and does not transfer to my hair even when I use it with a blow dryer. I only learned about a wet brush when I started going to a new stylist and she used one on my hair; trust me it will amaze you how this brush de tangles and glides through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m ordering a second one for my gym bag</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim to add to my Considerable collection of detangling devices. I figured, \\&quot;hey, why not one more? \\&quot; Wow, was I surprised! This brush is amazing. It took me about one minute to detangle my waist length straight hair. It usually takes 10 or more with the regular paddle brush or Wide tooth comb, Along with some detangling spray. This brush works without the spray, brilliantly! It was well worth the price, and I intend to buy a small one to carry in my bag. I doubt I&#x27;ll ever use another brush again, and I mean that quite seriously. It works just as well on your dry hair, and for some reason that I don&#x27;t understand, it feels amazing when you rub it against your head.</li>
            <li> I first used this exact brush at my daughter in-laws home. She purchased it from a salon and she told me to try it b/c she has long thick hair and my grand daughter as well &amp; love it. I was so amazed with this wet brush, I order this paddle edition for my daughter and purchased the double pack brushes for myself and husband. You will be amazed. I have to admit though that the paddle type has a smoother feel to it instead of being so stiff like the 2 round ones in a pack. I just opened mine and it does have a rubbery smell to them but hopefully, the strong smell will fade with time being exposed to room temp. I am going to keep mine though b/c I have short hair.</li>
            <li> My hair will never see another brush. I adore my Wet Brush. My hair is long and tends to tangle and this brush just goes throught it without any problems. My hair feels soft and easy to manage. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I can brush through my nieces wet ahir with ease and she doesn&#x27;s complain of tangles or pain.&lt;br /&gt;I even bought one for myself!</li>
            <li> No way this brush deserves less than a 5 star rating! I hadn&#x27;t used a brush on my very fine and easy to break hair in years, until my hairdresser recommended this one. This is the best brush EVER for wet heir!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews very often, but when something like this comes along YOU JUST HAVE TO. This brush is the magical unicorn of hair brushes. I have spent the last 3 years struggling to comb through my very tangled hair in the shower - I have broken bristles on multiple brushes in the process, and it&#x27;s always been painful and difficult.&lt;br /&gt;My sister recommended this brush and I was skeptical that it could really make that big a difference, but... HOLY COW. The first time I used it in the shower, it slid through my hair with such ease that I thought, &amp;#34;This thing is not even actually brushing my hair or getting anywhere near the tangles.&amp;#34; I was wrong! It completely brushed out all my tangles, but with such ease I didn&#x27;t feel a thing. And it was so fast!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you what a difference this brush has made for me - I would recommend it in a heartbeat (and in fact have even bought them as gifts!)&lt;br /&gt;Happy brushing!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this paddle brush as much as the original round Wet Brush.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Very nice works great.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome paddle brush!  It glides right threw your hair.  I absolutely love the entire &amp;#34;wet brush&amp;#34; set!  They are all amazing!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing! I use it constantly because it&#x27;s the first brush I&#x27;ve had that doesn&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li> This hairbrush glides through my wet hair like a charm with minimal breakage.  Worth the price I paid.  Just wish it was a little more multi functional.  Can only use it on wet hair so it&#x27;s just another thing to clutter up my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for one reason: I have incredibly damaged hair (terrible breakage, thinning, and split ends due to numerous bleaching processes that I did last year), and I&#x27;m tired of seeing little splinters of hair falling to the ground when I run a brush through it. My hair has a natural wave to it, and I prefer to blow dry it straight, but I&#x27;ve never been able to find the proper brush. Using a round brush while blow drying always make my hair frizzy, and though various drugstore paddle brushes marketed as \\&quot;styling\\&quot; or \\&quot;detangling\\&quot; often provide a good end result, I lose so much hair in the process that I wonder if it&#x27;s worth it to even fix my hair. So when I happened to stumble upon this brush while browsing Amazon, I couldn&#x27;t help myself. Admittedly, having never spent more than five bucks on a hair brush, I initially balked at the price...but believe me when I say it&#x27;s worth every penny. At first, I was a bit disappointed upon opening the brush. The rubberized body of the brush is sturdy, but the bristles are very thin and flexible and point in every direction. My first thought was \\&quot;This flimsy thing is NOT going to be able to handle my hot mess of a head!\\&quot; But all of my doubts went away when I brushed it through my DRY hair (which was curled, loaded with hair spray, and had been in 60% humidity for hours), and I met no resistance. The brush went through like butter, quickly detangling my matted hair. It works the same with wet hair--the purpose it is marketed for--making it great all-around brush. Honestly, I don&#x27;t have a bad thing to say about this product, and I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more.</li>
            <li> THIS BRUSH IS VERY GOOD. DOESNT SNAG MY HAIR. FEELS GOOD ON THE SCALP. I USE IT ON MY DAMP HAIR AND DRY HAIR. I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft on the head and doesn&#x27;t tug or pull uncomfortably while getting out all my snarls.  I have thick hair too - and yet it goes through smoothly and softly.</li>
            <li> No more tears from my six year old who has hair all the way down her back.  We comb right through tangles wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I currently own 5 wet brushes and have ordered 4 others for gifts. I initially bought it for my daughters who both have thick hair that tangles. Especially after swimming it was always full of snarls and hurt when I brushed it. My stylist suggested I try it&#x27;s the only brush we have used since. I have given them to friends kids and nieces.....they all ordered more. Great brush and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> My 6 yr old daughter has long hair that she HATES to brush because it hurts.  It is terrible.  She ends up refusing to let me finish brushing her hair and it turns into a tangled nightmare.  So, I decided to get this brush to try and see if she would allow me to brush her hair - or if she could do it herself - because the hairdresser raved about this item.  Amazing results.  She now brushes her hair herself all the time and is never bothered if I brush it - even right after washing, which was always the worst.  I even went back and bought the small version of the Wet Brush so I would have one for my handbag.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT - thank you wet brush people - my child is now presentable!</li>
            <li> This Brush stinks. No really, it has a very strong odor. It makes the room smell of plastic/rubber or I don&#x27;t know what.&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to use this brush. Very unhappy. I tired to wash it and use it in the shower with shampoo on it.....Still smells.</li>
            <li> Hands down, best brush I have ever had! Love Love Love !!!&lt;br /&gt;Super soft on scalp and doesn&#x27;t pull hair. It is now a pleasure to brush my hair rather than a pain!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. At first it&#x27;s a bit difficult to get used to because it&#x27;s so soft compared to most brushes. It feels like it&#x27;s only grazing the top layer of hair, so you may have to brush your hair in sections. I have thick, wavy hair, by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damage has definitely gone down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: I had to buy a replacement because my mom used mine with a dryer. THEY ARE NOT HEAT PROOF. The bristles will melt.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old daughter has thin, curly hair.  Regardless if I put it up in a bun when she sleeps or not, her hair inevitably ends up in a rat&#x27;s nest. In vain, I have spent many a day fighting with her to try to comb out her knots using everything from a de-tangler to a leave in conditioner.  Once I purchased this brush, she gladly lets me comb through her hair, wet or dry.  It does not pull at her hair or jerk her head back.  This brush is not one to stimulate the scalp, but will assist you in brushing through coarse, curly or ratted hair.  GET IT!</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely amazing - I never buy &#x27;made on TV&#x27; stuff, but I bought this on the recommendation of a friend, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. It&#x27;ll get through your knots and smooth out your hair in no time at all, and it saves you lots of time/aggravation.</li>
            <li> Where has this brush been all my life? Detangling my fine and long hair is a breeze with it! No more pulling! No more breackage! I love it!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this brush for my 2 1/2 year old son who would run every time I would come near him with a brush or comb! He has extremely thick curly hair that always got tangled in combs or brushes. I read the reviews on this brush and decided to give it a try. The brush works like a miracle and glides through his hair without snagging or getting tangled. My mom has the same type of hair and always had issues with combs and brushes sometimes breaking on her, so I bought her one as well and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> My wife has extremely long and thick hair, and always had issues brushing it dry before taking a shower, or wet after taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;With this brush, either time is possible, and it gets through knots and untangles like magic.&lt;br /&gt;I also use on my two year old daughter&#x27;s hair which is fine, and it does the trick there as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best brush she has ever used and highly recommends it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works - I don&#x27;t care how it works - but it works! Best brush for curly, tangled hair I&#x27;ve ever tried. Five stars.</li>
            <li> Works on my short hair and my gf&#x27;s long hair.</li>
            <li> This brush has been a miracle. I don&#x27;t know why it works, but it does. I only wish I would have known about it years ago. My youngest has the most sensitive head and brushing always brought out the tears. Not anymore.</li>
            <li> Wet brushes are the best brush ever! Everyone should own one!I am very satisfied with my black paddle brush</li>
            <li> I was so tired of pulling out my hair every time I washed it and tried to brush it out to dry. This brush works perfect. No pulling, no knotting - just smooth hair. I love it.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for a good paddle brush that would handle my daughters&#x27; fine hair and all their tangles, but that didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  I purchased the My Wet Brush Pro Select Paddle Brush, based on the reviews submitted on this site.  I was aware that some people experienced a distinct odor when receiving the brush, but I thought the positive reviews far outweighed the negative reviews, so I thought I would give the brush a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the package, the chemical, burnt odor was so overwhelming that I tried to wash it out with a gentle scented soap.  It didn&#x27;t work at all.  In addition, I noticed that the bristles were bent in the bottom right corner of the brush.  I assumed that it was just due to packaging and still thought to give it a try.  Two weeks later, the brush is still a miserable smell that sometimes leaves similar scents in my daughters&#x27; hair.  Also, after only a couple of uses, the brush&#x27;s bristles are almost completely bent and misshapen and are unable to get through my daughters&#x27; tangles, which it did easily and painlessly during our first use.  It is now almost completely useless and I am returning it, after two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess you get what you pay for and I will have to shell out a bit more to get something that actually works and doesn&#x27;t smell like a burnt tire.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser told me about this brush&lt;br /&gt;My daughter and I have thick hair, and this brush works great after the shower</li>
            <li> Works well on granddaughters long thick hair.</li>
            <li> Great for fine, tangle prone hair.</li>
            <li> I thought is was a little soft when I first got it, but it works wonderfully for wet or dry fine hair.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be better than the regular size wet brush cause I have long thick hair, but to my suprise the regular one was way better as it is more flexible and this one doesn&#x27;t flex at all. It is good as a regular brush but not as good as a wet brush for de tangling --- not by a mile.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift and she loves it.  Works well with her long hair and easy brushing. \\&quot;Its the most wonderful brush I&#x27;ve ever used\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The brush came off the handle within 3 days of normal use. I&#x27;ve always had good experiences with Wet Brushes so I&#x27;m hoping I just had a dud. I&#x27;m quite sad about it though. Maybe I&#x27;ll order another in the future.</li>
            <li> My 13-year old nice has some of thickess hair on earth and usually hates brushing her hair but when I gave this brush to her as a gift, she was transformed!! She loves it and bring the brush everywhere!</li>
            <li> I bought this after purchasing the wet brush (not paddle, same manufacturer) and kept having to take it out of the bath and back in it.&lt;br /&gt;I went with the paddle.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, boy, what a treat! This is much better than the other one (the other one was the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used, so that means quite a bit).&lt;br /&gt;Keeps hairs healthy, never breaks any hairs, and untangles the hardest to detangle tangles in my hair, things you&#x27;d think only scissors would work with.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so pleasantly surprised, you might even call me amazed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m such a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this works but it does. I have very thick hair and it&#x27;s such a breeze now to brush out after the shower.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  Love this brush.  It&#x27;s so nice to be able to brush my hair wet and have it glide right through without getting caught in my hair.</li>
            <li> Incredible for long thick hair, especially wet. I have gotten rid of all my other brushes &amp; have 3 of these now (2 paddles &amp; 1 oval I use for travel). I don&#x27;t know what makes these work so well, but they are the best brush I&#x27;ve ever found. I have told everybody about them - now my mom, my daughters, my granddaughter all have them too! Great variety of colors &amp; fun print patterns.</li>
            <li> Apparently this brush is awesome my sons mother liked it alot she was surprised i had picked out such a great brush for her lovely hair lol. I was surprised as well. Cause it was so cheap. But yes this brush is awesome i recomend this to any girl or man buyin for someone. DO IT!!!</li>
            <li> The BEST brush ever. Seriously. I can brush my hair when it&#x27;s still soaked and tangled from towel drying without pulling at all. It&#x27;s helped so much in growing my hair out and limit pulling out hair.</li>
            <li> My curly, knotty hair needed this--my scalp no longer hates me! Wonderful product</li>
            <li> Bought for my granddaughter for her very long curly hair and she loves it.  No more tears after showers her Mom says.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the service and quality of product, nice features for the price, no question I would buy one again.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect brush - I have daycare for kids under 5 years old and it helps to untangle without pain or discomfort.  I LOVE THIS BRUSH!  Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this, and recommended it to me.  I have fine, thick, some wavy areas, and graying hair.  I typically struggle with styling and straightening my hair.  This brush works wonders!!  It is also light weight.</li>
