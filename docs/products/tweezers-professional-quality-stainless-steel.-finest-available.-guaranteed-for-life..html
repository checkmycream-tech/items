            <li>Work great, good quality.</li>
            <li>These are great, very pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>It might be a good gift item.</li>
            <li>best tweezers available</li>
            <li>/&gt;These tweezers are better than most tweezers I have used, but they are not the best I have used.  </li>
            <li>They work exceptionally well; one grab and the hair is gone.</li>
            <li>These are great tweezers- very precise.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with product.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I have been using tweezers for years for in grown hairs and after 4 or 5 pairs in as many years, these are easily the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>These Bodyline tweezers are the best quality of any I&#x27;ve ever owned or purchased, and at a very reasonable price as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>Boy, am I glad that I did!  </li>
            <li>The customer service has been outstanding and I am looking forward to many years of good use!</li>
            <li>Used these for the first time today &amp; they are awesome.</li>
            <li>They are great, and the carrying case makes them easy to store and find when needed.  </li>
            <li>Really nice precision tweezers.  </li>
            <li>But these really are the BEST tweezers in the world.</li>
            <li>Now when I see a hair and go grab it, either with the pointy tweezers (perfect for thinner hair or ones under the skin) or the slanted tweezers (great for coarse hair or splinters), I now know I&#x27;m not &amp;#34;seeing&amp;#34; a hair that isn&#x27;t there--the tweezer GRABS the hair and retains grip throughout.</li>
            <li>Superior product - beautiful packaging and fast delivery - thank you!</li>
            <li>so I figured I&#x27;d get my own set again.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the best!  </li>
            <li>Bought for my daughter she liked it.</li>
            <li>The carrying case is nice, too.</li>
            <li>Now my husband will have his own, and I have a spare on hand for myself and one for a gift.</li>
            <li>We liked it for the price and for its quality.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great product, thank you!</li>
            <li>I liked the case.</li>
            <li>The pouch is a nice addition that reduces my chances of losing them.</li>
            <li>Great, definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Customer service is great here, and the tweezers are the right price and quality.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li>I have been using the fancy tweezers from the beauty store for many years, but these tweezers have twice as much surface area that meets perfectly.</li>
            <li>The strong spine makes for a good grip on the object.</li>
            <li>I am more than pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li>So far, they are the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>They have the best grip of any tweezers I&#x27;ve used, and have no trouble pulling even the finest, shortest hairs.  </li>
            <li>So far, we&#x27;re impressed with these tweezers.  </li>
            <li>I must say I was quite pleasantly surprised to find the precision pin point accuracy of this purchase to go beyond my best hopes.  </li>
            <li>These tweezers are by far the best I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>The punch is very nice quality, better than expected and the tweezers are excellent.</li>
            <li>The price is great for such a great product.</li>
            <li>I have smaller/average sized hands, and the tweezer size if perfect for me, but I think the size would be great for most people; not too small and not bulky either.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>Glad I ordered them</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>I love these tweezers.</li>
            <li>I also love that they come with a carrying case as now</li>
            <li>Much better than tweezerman.</li>
            <li>I have been through lots of tweezers over the years, most are duds.  </li>
            <li>Love the slate tipped pair for removing those stray chin hairs; they work better than any tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>They are especially handy when I am applying individual lashes for my clients.</li>
            <li>These are really outstanding.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure will work just as well.</li>
            <li>These make a lovely pair of tweezers.  </li>
            <li>My Tweezerman&#x27;s work way better.</li>
            <li>I just love using them.</li>
            <li>so this is my second time to purchase these wonderful tweezers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect tweezer to pluck errant facial hair on a woman!</li>
            <li>Actually works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>They are ok.  </li>
            <li>I purchased them for my friend and my daughter and they absolutely love them too.</li>
            <li>Absolutely awesome for pulling tiny splinters out!  </li>
            <li>Love that you get 2 pair.</li>
            <li>Theyer pick up the hair like magic theyer amazinnng ..</li>
            <li>Glad I found them.</li>
            <li>one is much better than revlon&#x27;s one.</li>
            <li>.. work great...much better than what we were using before</li>
            <li>Package came with a thank you note:)</li>
            <li>I ordered two sets of these and wish I had ordered more.</li>
            <li>Loved these tweezers when I first got them.</li>
            <li>Unlike tweezers you buy in the cosmetic isle at pharmacy, these by Bodyline Skin Care are shaped perfectly and close evenly so that if even tweezing a fine short hair...</li>
            <li>The case makes it easy to keep track of them and keep them safe from damage.</li>
            <li>I do miss the bright Tweezerman colors, but these are far superior and the special price was icing on the cake.</li>
            <li>The needle points are incredibly sharp and work perfectly!  </li>
            <li>I was so impressed with the first pair that I ordered that I went back and ordered 3 more pair.</li>
            <li>The case keeps them unbent and easy to find.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the same Revlon tweezers for about 8 years and was perfectly happy with them, until I realized that there might be more precision-friendly options.</li>
            <li>Now I can easily locate my tweezers in my cosmetic drawer.  </li>
            <li>Easy to grasp hair and does the job.</li>
            <li>The carrying case makes it easy for me to take them everywhere.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product; pricey relative to store brands, but ultimately worth it.</li>
            <li>these made a 14 suture removal easy.</li>
            <li>Got this to include in a first aid kit, so the pouch comes in handy.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable to hold, sharp, and work perfectly.</li>
            <li>These are top quality tweezers and the carrying case is such a nice bonus!</li>
            <li>The grip was fine on the longer hairs, but that&#x27;s not what I needed them for.  </li>
            <li>Precise and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I had my old pair confiscated at the airport but now am glad it happened because these tweezers do a much better job!</li>
            <li>The case is very nice and being red, it&#x27;s easy to find in my somewhat cluttered drawer.</li>
            <li>Handy storage case though a little too feminine for my taste and somewhat tacky; still a great product.</li>
            <li>The case they come in is just cheap stuff and the snaps don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>I really enjoy my tweezer set and used it the moment I got them.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m so used to my Amazon Prime membership that it&#x27;s unusual for me when things don&#x27;t arrive in that kind of timeframe.  </li>
            <li>the tweezers don&#x27;t poke through and I would feel comfortable throwing them in my purse or suitcase without any concerns.</li>
            <li>They work great at getting tiny hairs.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re much better than my Revlon or even Tweezermans - which I lost because they didn&#x27;t come with a cool carrying case ;)  </li>
            <li>For the price though, they are not bad.  </li>
            <li>Its cool tool and great one to spent ur money in</li>
            <li>I would agree that the Sharp Tweezers will be great for splinters and things of that nature.</li>
            <li>The other tweezers for splinter is great though.  </li>
            <li>Omgosh, so happy I lost my other tweezers.</li>
            <li>This Bodyline Set seemed to be adequate for my needs and the Storage Case was</li>
            <li>These tweezers came quickly.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>Very pleased and would definitely recommend.  </li>
            <li>Much more effective than your average tweezer.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I would recommend them to anyone needing good tweezers for their first aid kit or for pulling tiny hairs.</li>
            <li>They refunded my Money, they acted in the most professional mannner as i will still recommend this product as it is well made !</li>
            <li>It is really nice to have a little pouch to keep the set safe so that the tweezers don&#x27;t get bent, etc.</li>
            <li>Being a Male, I wasn&#x27;t looking for a dainty pair for my eyebrows and such, I wanted a pair that could do what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>Two different pairs of tweezers with a nice case to hold them in...</li>
            <li>I use my Tweezers quite a lot and was looking for just the right pair.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t really use the super sharp, pointy pair, but I can imagine they&#x27;re good to have on hand for things like splinters.)</li>
            <li>Oh my ... for such a reasonable price, there tweezers are top quality!</li>
            <li>If they would have been a little thinner (the slanted pointed) they would have been good.</li>
            <li>The first surprise was the strudiness of the Tweezers.</li>
            <li>The sharp pair is perfect for splinters and the other pair works wonders on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>They are high quality, precision tweezers and well worth their price.</li>
            <li>They are absolutely worth the high price.</li>
            <li>The second pair has an extremely fine point, but once again, is strong enough to do what is needed.</li>
            <li>These take the entire hair out, easy to grip and work very well.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very high quality</li>
            <li>Nice little package for travel and keep everything in one place.</li>
            <li>and I really like the case they came in.</li>
            <li>Thoughtful, and definitely something to follow to ensure these retain their quality.</li>
            <li>The storage/carrying cases are very helpful for travel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They really can grab anything.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell from the picture, but it is a very sturdy case-</li>
            <li>The others are sturdy and grip very well.</li>
            <li>That said, since they do grab more hairs than most tweezers, and they pull them out by the root instead of just breaking them off at the surface, tweezing with these can be a bit more painful than with normal tweezers.  </li>
            <li>Much better than I expected!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other more expensive ones that aren&#x27;t as great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many different brands of tweezers over the years (and have never purchased the same brand twice, if that tells you anything...)</li>
            <li>These are precision made tweezers and are high quality.  </li>
            <li>High quality.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely HIGH QUALITY.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these tweezers for everyone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are really high quality.</li>
            <li>There are two types of tweezers and the seem to be high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying these tweezers.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these gems.</li>
            <li>These are definitely professional quality and work very well for shaping the brows.  </li>
            <li>These are the only ones worth the money.</li>
            <li>They contacted me to ask me about reviewing three times before I had even received the package, which seemed to take too long to reach me, and twice more before I had it open.  </li>
            <li>The pointed ones are good, the slanted ones are not as thin as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>I previously had Tweezerman, but these are just as nice and basically the same price for two as for one Tweezerman.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sharp and precise.</li>
            <li>I ended up returning them and purchasing a new set of Tweezerman tweezers.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve only used the angled tweezers, not the fine-tipped tweezers, but both are solidly and precisely made.  </li>
            <li>They pull hair from thick to fine hair very well.</li>
            <li>My dull Tweezermans were still better than these.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since gotten rid of my old pair.</li>
            <li>I have used them for two sessions and so far am</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very efficient and I do still want to get a pair of travel Tweezermans for when I&#x27;m in a pinch, but these Bodyline tweezers are the big guns.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to replace my professional grade tweezers for sometime.  </li>
            <li>Wow....</li>
            <li>The only issue with this purchase was that it felt like I had too much contact with the seller.  </li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t lose them (handy pouch makes that less likely), should last a lifetime.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and it was sent in a timely fashion</li>
            <li>The slant end Tweezers have an end that is thin enough for delicate work, yet very strong and agile for your needs.</li>
            <li>It was a tough choice between these and the Tweezermans, but I&#x27;m so glad I grabbed these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a pair of good tweezers; only the ones that come in your generic finger/toe nail packs, which are useless.</li>
            <li>I actually wasn&#x27;t planning on buying the set since I already had a pair of &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; tweezers (the slanted ones), but after reading reviews that these ones didn&#x27;t break hairs in half--an issue I was experiencing with my current slanted tweezers--I realized I might need to invest in a new pair of those as well.</li>
            <li>They were also delivered in a quick timely manner, thank you, as I was desperate for a pair of tweezers that worked being delivered quickly having lost my age old ones.</li>
            <li>I have not used them long enough to know how they will last, but they seem very high quality and are guaranteed.</li>
            <li>Sharp enough to get the smallest splinters or ingrown hairs and precise enough that you don&#x27;t dig up an excess of skin while you try to remove the foreign object.  </li>

            <li> best tweezers available</li>
            <li> /&gt;These tweezers are better than most tweezers I have used, but they are not the best I have used.  </li>
            <li> They work exceptionally well; one grab and the hair is gone.</li>
            <li> These are great tweezers- very precise.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using tweezers for years for in grown hairs and after 4 or 5 pairs in as many years, these are easily the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> These Bodyline tweezers are the best quality of any I&#x27;ve ever owned or purchased, and at a very reasonable price as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> Boy, am I glad that I did!  </li>
            <li> The customer service has been outstanding and I am looking forward to many years of good use!</li>
            <li> Used these for the first time today &amp; they are awesome.</li>
            <li> They are great, and the carrying case makes them easy to store and find when needed.  </li>
            <li> Really nice precision tweezers.  </li>
            <li> But these really are the BEST tweezers in the world.</li>
            <li> Now when I see a hair and go grab it, either with the pointy tweezers (perfect for thinner hair or ones under the skin) or the slanted tweezers (great for coarse hair or splinters), I now know I&#x27;m not &amp;#34;seeing&amp;#34; a hair that isn&#x27;t there--the tweezer GRABS the hair and retains grip throughout.</li>
            <li> Superior product - beautiful packaging and fast delivery - thank you!</li>
            <li> so I figured I&#x27;d get my own set again.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the best!  </li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter she liked it.</li>
            <li> The carrying case is nice, too.</li>
            <li> Now my husband will have his own, and I have a spare on hand for myself and one for a gift.</li>
            <li> We liked it for the price and for its quality.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product, thank you!</li>
            <li> I liked the case.</li>
            <li> The pouch is a nice addition that reduces my chances of losing them.</li>
            <li> Great, definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Customer service is great here, and the tweezers are the right price and quality.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have been using the fancy tweezers from the beauty store for many years, but these tweezers have twice as much surface area that meets perfectly.</li>
            <li> The strong spine makes for a good grip on the object.</li>
            <li> I am more than pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> So far, they are the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> They have the best grip of any tweezers I&#x27;ve used, and have no trouble pulling even the finest, shortest hairs.  </li>
            <li> So far, we&#x27;re impressed with these tweezers.  </li>
            <li> I must say I was quite pleasantly surprised to find the precision pin point accuracy of this purchase to go beyond my best hopes.  </li>
            <li> These tweezers are by far the best I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> The punch is very nice quality, better than expected and the tweezers are excellent.</li>
            <li> The price is great for such a great product.</li>
            <li> I have smaller/average sized hands, and the tweezer size if perfect for me, but I think the size would be great for most people; not too small and not bulky either.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Glad I ordered them</li>
            <li> What more can I say?</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers.</li>
            <li> I also love that they come with a carrying case as now</li>
            <li> Much better than tweezerman.</li>
            <li> I have been through lots of tweezers over the years, most are duds.  </li>
            <li> Love the slate tipped pair for removing those stray chin hairs; they work better than any tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> They are especially handy when I am applying individual lashes for my clients.</li>
            <li> These are really outstanding.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure will work just as well.</li>
            <li> These make a lovely pair of tweezers.  </li>
            <li> My Tweezerman&#x27;s work way better.</li>
            <li> I just love using them.</li>
            <li> so this is my second time to purchase these wonderful tweezers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect tweezer to pluck errant facial hair on a woman!</li>
            <li> Actually works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> They are ok.  </li>
            <li> I purchased them for my friend and my daughter and they absolutely love them too.</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesome for pulling tiny splinters out!  </li>
            <li> Love that you get 2 pair.</li>
            <li> Theyer pick up the hair like magic theyer amazinnng ..</li>
            <li> Glad I found them.</li>
            <li> one is much better than revlon&#x27;s one.</li>
            <li> .. work great...much better than what we were using before</li>
            <li> Package came with a thank you note:)</li>
            <li> I ordered two sets of these and wish I had ordered more.</li>
            <li> Loved these tweezers when I first got them.</li>
            <li> Unlike tweezers you buy in the cosmetic isle at pharmacy, these by Bodyline Skin Care are shaped perfectly and close evenly so that if even tweezing a fine short hair...</li>
            <li> The case makes it easy to keep track of them and keep them safe from damage.</li>
            <li> I do miss the bright Tweezerman colors, but these are far superior and the special price was icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> The needle points are incredibly sharp and work perfectly!  </li>
            <li> I was so impressed with the first pair that I ordered that I went back and ordered 3 more pair.</li>
            <li> The case keeps them unbent and easy to find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the same Revlon tweezers for about 8 years and was perfectly happy with them, until I realized that there might be more precision-friendly options.</li>
            <li> Now I can easily locate my tweezers in my cosmetic drawer.  </li>
            <li> Easy to grasp hair and does the job.</li>
            <li> The carrying case makes it easy for me to take them everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product; pricey relative to store brands, but ultimately worth it.</li>
            <li> these made a 14 suture removal easy.</li>
            <li> Got this to include in a first aid kit, so the pouch comes in handy.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable to hold, sharp, and work perfectly.</li>
            <li> These are top quality tweezers and the carrying case is such a nice bonus!</li>
            <li> The grip was fine on the longer hairs, but that&#x27;s not what I needed them for.  </li>
            <li> Precise and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I had my old pair confiscated at the airport but now am glad it happened because these tweezers do a much better job!</li>
            <li> The case is very nice and being red, it&#x27;s easy to find in my somewhat cluttered drawer.</li>
            <li> Handy storage case though a little too feminine for my taste and somewhat tacky; still a great product.</li>
            <li> The case they come in is just cheap stuff and the snaps don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I really enjoy my tweezer set and used it the moment I got them.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m so used to my Amazon Prime membership that it&#x27;s unusual for me when things don&#x27;t arrive in that kind of timeframe.  </li>
            <li> the tweezers don&#x27;t poke through and I would feel comfortable throwing them in my purse or suitcase without any concerns.</li>
            <li> They work great at getting tiny hairs.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re much better than my Revlon or even Tweezermans - which I lost because they didn&#x27;t come with a cool carrying case ;)  </li>
            <li> For the price though, they are not bad.  </li>
            <li> Its cool tool and great one to spent ur money in</li>
            <li> I would agree that the Sharp Tweezers will be great for splinters and things of that nature.</li>
            <li> The other tweezers for splinter is great though.  </li>
            <li> Omgosh, so happy I lost my other tweezers.</li>
            <li> This Bodyline Set seemed to be adequate for my needs and the Storage Case was</li>
            <li> These tweezers came quickly.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery</li>
            <li> Very pleased and would definitely recommend.  </li>
            <li> Much more effective than your average tweezer.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I would recommend them to anyone needing good tweezers for their first aid kit or for pulling tiny hairs.</li>
            <li> They refunded my Money, they acted in the most professional mannner as i will still recommend this product as it is well made !</li>
            <li> It is really nice to have a little pouch to keep the set safe so that the tweezers don&#x27;t get bent, etc.</li>
            <li> Being a Male, I wasn&#x27;t looking for a dainty pair for my eyebrows and such, I wanted a pair that could do what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> Two different pairs of tweezers with a nice case to hold them in...</li>
            <li> I use my Tweezers quite a lot and was looking for just the right pair.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t really use the super sharp, pointy pair, but I can imagine they&#x27;re good to have on hand for things like splinters.)</li>
            <li> Oh my ... for such a reasonable price, there tweezers are top quality!</li>
            <li> If they would have been a little thinner (the slanted pointed) they would have been good.</li>
            <li> The first surprise was the strudiness of the Tweezers.</li>
            <li> The sharp pair is perfect for splinters and the other pair works wonders on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> They are high quality, precision tweezers and well worth their price.</li>
            <li> They are absolutely worth the high price.</li>
            <li> The second pair has an extremely fine point, but once again, is strong enough to do what is needed.</li>
            <li> These take the entire hair out, easy to grip and work very well.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very high quality</li>
            <li> Nice little package for travel and keep everything in one place.</li>
            <li> and I really like the case they came in.</li>
            <li> Thoughtful, and definitely something to follow to ensure these retain their quality.</li>
            <li> The storage/carrying cases are very helpful for travel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They really can grab anything.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell from the picture, but it is a very sturdy case-</li>
            <li> The others are sturdy and grip very well.</li>
            <li> That said, since they do grab more hairs than most tweezers, and they pull them out by the root instead of just breaking them off at the surface, tweezing with these can be a bit more painful than with normal tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Much better than I expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other more expensive ones that aren&#x27;t as great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many different brands of tweezers over the years (and have never purchased the same brand twice, if that tells you anything...)</li>
            <li> These are precision made tweezers and are high quality.  </li>
            <li> High quality.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely HIGH QUALITY.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these tweezers for everyone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are really high quality.</li>
            <li> There are two types of tweezers and the seem to be high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying these tweezers.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these gems.</li>
            <li> These are definitely professional quality and work very well for shaping the brows.  </li>
            <li> These are the only ones worth the money.</li>
            <li> They contacted me to ask me about reviewing three times before I had even received the package, which seemed to take too long to reach me, and twice more before I had it open.  </li>
            <li> The pointed ones are good, the slanted ones are not as thin as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> I previously had Tweezerman, but these are just as nice and basically the same price for two as for one Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp and precise.</li>
            <li> I ended up returning them and purchasing a new set of Tweezerman tweezers.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve only used the angled tweezers, not the fine-tipped tweezers, but both are solidly and precisely made.  </li>
            <li> They pull hair from thick to fine hair very well.</li>
            <li> My dull Tweezermans were still better than these.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since gotten rid of my old pair.</li>
            <li> I have used them for two sessions and so far am</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very efficient and I do still want to get a pair of travel Tweezermans for when I&#x27;m in a pinch, but these Bodyline tweezers are the big guns.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to replace my professional grade tweezers for sometime.  </li>
            <li> Wow....</li>
            <li> The only issue with this purchase was that it felt like I had too much contact with the seller.  </li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t lose them (handy pouch makes that less likely), should last a lifetime.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and it was sent in a timely fashion</li>
            <li> The slant end Tweezers have an end that is thin enough for delicate work, yet very strong and agile for your needs.</li>
            <li> It was a tough choice between these and the Tweezermans, but I&#x27;m so glad I grabbed these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a pair of good tweezers; only the ones that come in your generic finger/toe nail packs, which are useless.</li>
            <li> I actually wasn&#x27;t planning on buying the set since I already had a pair of &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; tweezers (the slanted ones), but after reading reviews that these ones didn&#x27;t break hairs in half--an issue I was experiencing with my current slanted tweezers--I realized I might need to invest in a new pair of those as well.</li>
            <li> They were also delivered in a quick timely manner, thank you, as I was desperate for a pair of tweezers that worked being delivered quickly having lost my age old ones.</li>
            <li> I have not used them long enough to know how they will last, but they seem very high quality and are guaranteed.</li>
            <li> Sharp enough to get the smallest splinters or ingrown hairs and precise enough that you don&#x27;t dig up an excess of skin while you try to remove the foreign object.  </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t give five star reviews because real human beings usually give three or four stars.</li>
            <li> the grasp is tight and complete.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so many tweezers over the years that really don&#x27;t work and leave the root of the hair leaving a little brown mark on my eyebrows that drives me crazy!  </li>
            <li> I wish I would&#x27;ve bought these long ago - would&#x27;ve saved me a lot of time over the years!  </li>
            <li> Could not get them to grip a single hair.</li>
            <li> I finally settled on this due to the reviews--the tweezer set reportedly wasn&#x27;t flimsy (apparently a big issue with tweezers) and were reportedly less of a terror on skin than others.</li>
            <li> picked them up to replace the poor tweezers in a first aid kit - it seems every time I get a splinter</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re definitely a step-up from my previous Revlon angle-tipped tweezers.  </li>
            <li> I also like the holes in the grip area feature on the slant nose pair that help to keep the tweezers from slipping in your hand.  </li>
            <li> It took 4 or 5 tries to tweeze a hair out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seriously noticed that my face is smoother than usual by the end of the week - because these do such a good job of removing hair and quickly, the weekly waxing is much less awful than usual.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and have a carrying case so you never lose them.</li>
            <li> NO MORE RED CHIN</li>
            <li> One or two tries and voila!</li>
            <li> one tweezers pair is pinpoint end, and the other is slant.  </li>
            <li> I would have preferred to spend less and just buy the slanted as I don&#x27;t have a use for the other.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re frustrated with the cheaply made  tweezers sold at the drug stores, order these....</li>
            <li> I am a nurse practitioner frustrated with the cheap throwaway tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Not worth what I paid</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they took a while to ship.  </li>
            <li> Was very disappointed since the reviews seemed to be exceptional.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent so much money on tweezers only to be disappointed with them.</li>
            <li> Both are well constructed and have very sharp ends.</li>
            <li> The slim ones are very sharp almost like using a pair of needles.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t hack up my skin when grabbing those barely-breaking-the-surface black hairs on my face.</li>
            <li> Two tweezer types not really needed and slanted tweezer no better than tweezerman brand.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t care about that one little bit.</li>
            <li> I got two sets for the price of one, plus the little case.</li>
            <li> I tried a stubble hair and it just left a blood blister ( not attractive).</li>
            <li> I have used tweezers for over 35 years on a daily basis and often throw money away on poorly made products.  </li>
            <li> IT HAS A FIRM GRIP</li>
            <li> All this time I thought my hand-eye coordinator was off--but it was my poor excuse for tweezers that were the problem.</li>
            <li> THEY GRAB NO MORE DIGGING FOR THE HAIR</li>
            <li> NO MATTER HOW SMALL THE HAIR.</li>
            <li> I am not the usual user.</li>
            <li> The tweezers have very poor grip on the hair, such that each strand of hair requires 2 or 3 pulls.  </li>
            <li> I have had them for about 6 weeks now and can already tell they are getting dull.</li>
            <li> I had hoped they were made in USA but at least they were packaged in USA.  </li>
            <li> After failed attempts with other tweezer brands, I decided to take a chance on these.  </li>
            <li> Tweezers not good quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s humiliating and painful, so I&#x27;ve resorted to waxing my face once a week and then spending about an hour plucking out the coarse hairs the wax couldn&#x27;t pick up.</li>
            <li> the terrible tweezers you get in the first aid kits are useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tips are not perfectly made; there&#x27;s a gap in between them.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in these tweezers.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are precision made tweezers and are high quality.  Got this to include in a first aid kit, so the pouch comes in handy.</li>
            <li> Really nice precision tweezers.  High quality.  As long as you don&#x27;t lose them (handy pouch makes that less likely), should last a lifetime.  Forget the rest of the junk being sold, buy these.</li>
            <li> Absolutely HIGH QUALITY. Very pleased. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So awesome! Best ones I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> This product did not work for my needs, wrote to the company regarding my concerns and they immediately emailed back. They refunded my Money, they acted in the most professional mannner as i will still recommend this product as it is well made !</li>
            <li> Very pleased and would definitely recommend.  I&#x27;ve purchased many different brands of tweezers over the years (and have never purchased the same brand twice, if that tells you anything...) in both the slant tip style and the needle nose style. These Bodyline tweezers are the best quality of any I&#x27;ve ever owned or purchased, and at a very reasonable price as well.  The tips on both pairs meet/pair well without any gaps so they grip whatever it is that you&#x27;re trying to get ahold of without any issues.  I also like the holes in the grip area feature on the slant nose pair that help to keep the tweezers from slipping in your hand.  I have smaller/average sized hands, and the tweezer size if perfect for me, but I think the size would be great for most people; not too small and not bulky either. If you&#x27;re frustrated with the cheaply made  tweezers sold at the drug stores, order these....you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t give five star reviews because real human beings usually give three or four stars. But these really are the BEST tweezers in the world. I have been using the fancy tweezers from the beauty store for many years, but these tweezers have twice as much surface area that meets perfectly. I can tweeze the thinnest or shortest hair. I haven&#x27;t tried the slanted pair yet. The case they come in is just cheap stuff and the snaps don&#x27;t work but I don&#x27;t care about that one little bit.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are excellent.  Unlike tweezers you buy in the cosmetic isle at pharmacy, these by Bodyline Skin Care are shaped perfectly and close evenly so that if even tweezing a fine short hair...the grasp is tight and complete.  It is really nice to have a little pouch to keep the set safe so that the tweezers don&#x27;t get bent, etc.</li>
            <li> Great, definitely worth the money! Much more effective than your average tweezer.</li>
            <li> Great ! Best pair I have owned !</li>
            <li> Work great, good quality.</li>
            <li> I get slivers all the time doing construction and these are the best tweezers I have ever purchased and that is over 45 yrs!</li>
            <li> Tweezers not good quality. Not worth what I paid</li>
            <li> I use my Tweezers quite a lot and was looking for just the right pair. Being a Male, I wasn&#x27;t looking for a dainty pair for my eyebrows and such, I wanted a pair that could do what I wanted. This Bodyline Set seemed to be adequate for my needs and the Storage Case was the Clincher(it helps me keep them somewhere together so I don&#x27;t lose them). With the cost for the pair being basically in line with the Market, I made the purchase. What I didn&#x27;t know was the standout quality that the BodyLine Tweezers possessed. The first surprise was the strudiness of the Tweezers. The strong spine makes for a good grip on the object. The slant end Tweezers have an end that is thin enough for delicate work, yet very strong and agile for your needs. The second pair has an extremely fine point, but once again, is strong enough to do what is needed. I would agree that the Sharp Tweezers will be great for splinters and things of that nature. The quality of these Tweezers should allow them to last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy my tweezer set and used it the moment I got them. Glad I ordered them and I really like the case they came in.</li>
            <li> Nice little package for travel and keep everything in one place.</li>
            <li> This purchase was the result of reading epilation reviews. I didn&#x27;t have an epilator at the time, but was considering one. Reviews noted that a pointy tweezers were needed to remove the inevitable ingrown hairs that result from epilation. So, before purchasing an epilator, I decided I might as well buy the needed ingrown hair tweezer at the same time; so began my research and - holy smokes! - all the different tweezers out there!! I finally settled on this due to the reviews--the tweezer set reportedly wasn&#x27;t flimsy (apparently a big issue with tweezers) and were reportedly less of a terror on skin than others. I actually wasn&#x27;t planning on buying the set since I already had a pair of &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; tweezers (the slanted ones), but after reading reviews that these ones didn&#x27;t break hairs in half--an issue I was experiencing with my current slanted tweezers--I realized I might need to invest in a new pair of those as well. I&#x27;m glad I did! Now when I see a hair and go grab it, either with the pointy tweezers (perfect for thinner hair or ones under the skin) or the slanted tweezers (great for coarse hair or splinters), I now know I&#x27;m not &amp;#34;seeing&amp;#34; a hair that isn&#x27;t there--the tweezer GRABS the hair and retains grip throughout. All this time I thought my hand-eye coordinator was off--but it was my poor excuse for tweezers that were the problem. Gone are the days of frustration and skin mutilation. I&#x27;ve since gotten rid of my old pair. These Bodyline tweezers are a great investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notably, after I bought the pair, the company emailed me information on using, caring for, and cleaning the tweezers. Thoughtful, and definitely something to follow to ensure these retain their quality.</li>
            <li> These are top quality tweezers and the carrying case is such a nice bonus! The sharp pair is perfect for splinters and the other pair works wonders on my eyebrows. I would definitely recommend these tweezers! Best pair I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great precision tweezers. Works! I&#x27;ve had other more expensive ones that aren&#x27;t as great. These are the only ones worth the money.</li>
            <li> They do not tweeze! What more can I say?</li>
            <li> Very nice set of tweezers. Very sturdy and easy to handle. I plan to carry the tweezers in my purse and I expect the case will protect my fingers from getting poked when I need to retrieve items from my purse.</li>
            <li> Superior product - beautiful packaging and fast delivery - thank you!</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers. They are comfortable to hold, sharp, and work perfectly. I also love that they come with a carrying case as now I will not misplace them! I would recommend these to anyone! They&#x27;re much better than my Revlon or even Tweezermans - which I lost because they didn&#x27;t come with a cool carrying case ;)  Additionally, the customer service is amazing! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> These tweezers came quickly.  The storage/carrying cases are very helpful for travel.&lt;br /&gt;These tweezers are better than most tweezers I have used, but they are not the best I have used.  It took 4 or 5 tries to tweeze a hair out.  For the price though, they are not bad.  Much better than tweezerman.</li>
            <li> I had been using a set of Brookstone tweezers for a while and my girlfriend ended up taking them so I figured I&#x27;d get my own set again.  These work great.  The needle point tweezers are great for getting splinters out of you.</li>
            <li> I have been through lots of tweezers over the years, most are duds.  These are great, very pleased with this purchase.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love the slate tipped pair for removing those stray chin hairs; they work better than any tweezers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best!  I wish I would&#x27;ve bought these long ago - would&#x27;ve saved me a lot of time over the years!  They really can grab anything.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I have ever used! The case keeps them unbent and easy to find.</li>
            <li> After failed attempts with other tweezer brands, I decided to take a chance on these.  Boy, am I glad that I did!  I am a freelance makeup artist and I needed these for my makeup kit.  They are especially handy when I am applying individual lashes for my clients. The customer service has been outstanding and I am looking forward to many years of good use!</li>
            <li> Great quality. I used to tweeze hairs. Grabs even the finest hair, or just the tip of stubble.</li>
            <li> i used this productmtoday and it surpassed my expectations!</li>
            <li> These are very good quality for the price.  The case makes it easy to keep track of them and keep them safe from damage.</li>
            <li> These are really outstanding. So far, they are the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> These are excellent tweezers.  So far, I&#x27;ve only used the angled tweezers, not the fine-tipped tweezers, but both are solidly and precisely made.  They&#x27;re definitely a step-up from my previous Revlon angle-tipped tweezers.  They have the best grip of any tweezers I&#x27;ve used, and have no trouble pulling even the finest, shortest hairs.  That said, since they do grab more hairs than most tweezers, and they pull them out by the root instead of just breaking them off at the surface, tweezing with these can be a bit more painful than with normal tweezers.  I guess that pain is a sign of their effectiveness.  My only complaint is that they took a while to ship.  I received them about a week after ordering.  I guess I&#x27;m so used to my Amazon Prime membership that it&#x27;s unusual for me when things don&#x27;t arrive in that kind of timeframe.  I also didn&#x27;t see any expedited shipping option on these.  Regardless, they arrived in perfect condition.  I&#x27;ll be keeping them in my room so that nobody else can run off with them.</li>
            <li> The best pair of tweezers I have ever owned. They are sharp and have a carrying case so you never lose them. The price is great for such a great product. I highly recommend these tweezers for everyone.</li>
            <li> These are the nicest tweezers I&#x27;ve found. They&#x27;re sharp and precise. I would recommend them to anyone needing good tweezers for their first aid kit or for pulling tiny hairs.</li>
            <li> Customer service is great here, and the tweezers are the right price and quality.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product!!!!! Thank you for such attention to quality</li>
            <li> I have used Tweezerman tweezers for several years, but took a chance on these, after reading the reviews. I got two sets for the price of one, plus the little case. They are excellent and well protected by the case. I do miss the bright Tweezerman colors, but these are far superior and the special price was icing on the cake. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> The punch is very nice quality, better than expected and the tweezers are excellent. I&#x27;ve had so many tweezers over the years that really don&#x27;t work and leave the root of the hair leaving a little brown mark on my eyebrows that drives me crazy!  These take the entire hair out, easy to grip and work very well. Haven&#x27;t used the tweezers designed for splinters but it&#x27;s very high quality and I&#x27;m sure will work just as well.</li>
            <li> They work great! Quick delivery and I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I picked them up to replace the poor tweezers in a first aid kit - it seems every time I get a splinter the terrible tweezers you get in the first aid kits are useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are really high quality.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and it was sent in a timely fashion</li>
            <li> I have PCOS, which has a side effect of hirsuitism - aka, I can grow quite the impressive beard for a lady. It&#x27;s humiliating and painful, so I&#x27;ve resorted to waxing my face once a week and then spending about an hour plucking out the coarse hairs the wax couldn&#x27;t pick up. I&#x27;ve used the same Revlon tweezers for about 8 years and was perfectly happy with them, until I realized that there might be more precision-friendly options. It was a tough choice between these and the Tweezermans, but I&#x27;m so glad I grabbed these. I have used them for two sessions and so far am V E R Y impressed with the quality, the sharpness, and the ability to catch and grab hairs that are not-quite-erupted but visible and close to the surface. I&#x27;ve seriously noticed that my face is smoother than usual by the end of the week - because these do such a good job of removing hair and quickly, the weekly waxing is much less awful than usual. They&#x27;re very efficient and I do still want to get a pair of travel Tweezermans for when I&#x27;m in a pinch, but these Bodyline tweezers are the big guns. (I don&#x27;t really use the super sharp, pointy pair, but I can imagine they&#x27;re good to have on hand for things like splinters.)</li>
            <li> These make a lovely pair of tweezers.  With the 2 different tips at the end, nothing can escape these!</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter she liked it. It might be a good gift item.</li>
            <li> I know it is silly, but I love the red leather case that these tweezers came in.  Now I can easily locate my tweezers in my cosmetic drawer.  There are two types of tweezers and the seem to be high quality.</li>
            <li> My Tweezerman&#x27;s work way better. These don&#x27;t pull the beginning stubble, also I have to try over and over to get a longer hairs. I tried a stubble hair and it just left a blood blister ( not attractive). Also, I like tweezers with a thinner slant than these. I don&#x27;t understand the ratings. The second slimmer pair don&#x27;t pull anything.</li>
            <li> So far, we&#x27;re impressed with these tweezers.  The needle points are incredibly sharp and work perfectly!  The slant tweezers put the hair without breaking it.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this product. Easy to grasp hair and does the job. Would recommend. Worth every penny and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just recently decided to start taking care of my eyebrows myself, vice paying to have it done. I&#x27;ve never had a pair of good tweezers; only the ones that come in your generic finger/toe nail packs, which are useless. Bit the bullet, looked at the reviews, and ordered. I haven&#x27;t tried the pointy ones, but I am very happy with the slanted ones. They work exceptionally well; one grab and the hair is gone. The case is very nice and being red, it&#x27;s easy to find in my somewhat cluttered drawer. I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I must say I was quite pleasantly surprised to find the precision pin point accuracy of this purchase to go beyond my best hopes.  I have used tweezers for over 35 years on a daily basis and often throw money away on poorly made products.  I had hoped they were made in USA but at least they were packaged in USA.  Great product that I recommend to everyone with this need.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers ever. I am going to buy ten of these sets and give them as gifts.</li>
            <li> I have not used them long enough to know how they will last, but they seem very high quality and are guaranteed. They pull hair from thick to fine hair very well. These are the best I ever had. In fact these are the only ones I&#x27;ve ever had that actually work.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers that I have ever owned!  I just love using them. The carrying case is nice, too. Awesome product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Have bought a second set as a gift for my hairdresser who also does eyebrows.  She loves them, too!</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed since the reviews seemed to be exceptional.  My dull Tweezermans were still better than these.  I couldn&#x27;t get the short stubble with either the slanted or pointed set.  The grip was fine on the longer hairs, but that&#x27;s not what I needed them for.  I ended up returning them and purchasing a new set of Tweezerman tweezers.</li>
            <li> They work so well that mine keep disappearing so this is my second time to purchase these wonderful tweezers. I highly recommend buying these tweezers.</li>
            <li> The pointed ones are good, the slanted ones are not as thin as I had hoped.  they don&#x27;t seem to catch the hairs I could get with another pair of tweezers I have.  If they would have been a little thinner (the slanted pointed) they would have been good.</li>
            <li> Loved these tweezers when I first got them. I have had them for about 6 weeks now and can already tell they are getting dull. Was hoping they would last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> Two tweezer types not really needed and slanted tweezer no better than tweezerman brand. I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect tweezer to pluck errant facial hair on a woman!</li>
            <li> Oh my ... for such a reasonable price, there tweezers are top quality! I was so impressed with the first pair that I ordered that I went back and ordered 3 more pair. Now my husband will have his own, and I have a spare on hand for myself and one for a gift. I am more than pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> The tweezers have very poor grip on the hair, such that each strand of hair requires 2 or 3 pulls.  The tips are not perfectly made; there&#x27;s a gap in between them.  The other tweezers for splinter is great though.  I returned the product.</li>
            <li> Good tweezers! Much better than I expected!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to replace my professional grade tweezers for sometime.  These are perfect.  Sharp enough to get the smallest splinters or ingrown hairs and precise enough that you don&#x27;t dig up an excess of skin while you try to remove the foreign object.  Handy storage case though a little too feminine for my taste and somewhat tacky; still a great product.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are by far the best I&#x27;ve owned.  I have used them for all sorts of things to include removing splinters and crafting, and they always maintain their sharpness.  They are very nice quality and durable as well.  The carrying case is perfect for traveling I don&#x27;t leave home without them.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever owned!  The carrying case makes it easy for me to take them everywhere.  Great quality at a great price!</li>
            <li> Nicest tweezers I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Sellers were prompt also.</li>
            <li> Actually works wonderfully.  I had my old pair confiscated at the airport but now am glad it happened because these tweezers do a much better job!</li>
            <li> Very good product. We liked it for the price and for its quality.</li>
            <li> OH MY STARS THE BEST TWEEZERS I EVER USED.  NO MORE RED CHIN THEY GRAB NO MORE DIGGING FOR THE HAIR IT HAS A FIRM GRIP NO MATTER HOW SMALL THE HAIR.</li>
            <li> They are ok.  Over priced by $15.00</li>
            <li> Excellent product; pricey relative to store brands, but ultimately worth it. Excellent service.</li>
            <li> Great quality,first grade material,and warranty. Finest I&#x27;ve come across.You can&#x27;t beat the price and the service.Would make a great,appreciated gift.</li>
            <li> Simply the beast tweezers I have ever used.  I bought these to replace my Tweezerman slanted edge tweezers. These don&#x27;t hack up my skin when grabbing those barely-breaking-the-surface black hairs on my face. One or two tries and voila!</li>
            <li> These are honestly the best tweezers I have ever used. I purchased them for my friend and my daughter and they absolutely love them too. Precise and easy to hold. Perfect for ingrown hairs too. Highly recommend these gems.</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesome for pulling tiny splinters out!  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in these tweezers. Tried to pluck my eyebrows with the needle nose pair. Could not get them to grip a single hair. Returned them.</li>
            <li> Used these for the first time today &amp; they are awesome. Love that you get 2 pair. They have great grip to them.</li>
            <li> Wow....Nicest set of tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had. Quality is great and the ingrown hair tweezers are not messing around. I&#x27;m never buying another tweezer from wal mart again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent so much money on tweezers only to be disappointed with them. These are the best tweezers.  They are high quality, precision tweezers and well worth their price.</li>
            <li> Theyer pick up the hair like magic theyer amazinnng .. Its cool tool and great one to spent ur money in</li>
            <li> best tweezers available</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I have ever owned.  They are great, and the carrying case makes them easy to store and find when needed.  Glad I found them.</li>
            <li> I am not the usual user. I am a nurse practitioner frustrated with the cheap throwaway tweezers.  these made a 14 suture removal easy.</li>
            <li> Perfect tweezer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two  tweezers. &#x27;Bodyline basic&#x27;s&#x27; and &#x27;Revlon Diamond Grip Slant Tip Tweezer&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is much better than revlon&#x27;s one.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality .. work great...much better than what we were using before</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> What a great value!  Two different pairs of tweezers with a nice case to hold them in...one tweezers pair is pinpoint end, and the other is slant.  These are definitely professional quality and work very well for shaping the brows.  Having two different types of tweezers helps with the precision in shape.</li>
            <li> These wirk perfect, tine after time. Great service.</li>
            <li> Great product, nice case and wonderful customer service.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product, thank you!</li>
            <li> best&lt;br /&gt;tweezers&lt;br /&gt;ever</li>
            <li> These are great tweezers- very precise. I previously had Tweezerman, but these are just as nice and basically the same price for two as for one Tweezerman. I liked the case. I couldn&#x27;t tell from the picture, but it is a very sturdy case- the tweezers don&#x27;t poke through and I would feel comfortable throwing them in my purse or suitcase without any concerns. Very good product.</li>
            <li> I was bummed when I lost my tweezers so I reluctantly replaced them by buying these.  Omgosh, so happy I lost my other tweezers. I had no idea the quality of tweezers out there.  They work great at getting tiny hairs.</li>
            <li> Package came with a thank you note:)</li>
            <li> Excellent tweezers. I have been using tweezers for years for in grown hairs and after 4 or 5 pairs in as many years, these are easily the best I&#x27;ve used. Both are well constructed and have very sharp ends. The pouch is a nice addition that reduces my chances of losing them.</li>
            <li> These are amazing!  Wonderful value and use them all the time.</li>
            <li> Tweezers that work!  Bought these and they work well.  I would have preferred to spend less and just buy the slanted as I don&#x27;t have a use for the other.  I plan to try them on craft projects.  I read about how they are used on ingrown toenails but I personally have not had that problem.  They were also delivered in a quick timely manner, thank you, as I was desperate for a pair of tweezers that worked being delivered quickly having lost my age old ones.</li>
            <li> These do work the best that I have ever bought.  Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever had. They are absolutely worth the high price. You would go through 10 pairs of $5 cheapo tweezers and regret not having these.  The slim ones are very sharp almost like using a pair of needles. The others are sturdy and grip very well. The only issue with this purchase was that it felt like I had too much contact with the seller.  They contacted me to ask me about reviewing three times before I had even received the package, which seemed to take too long to reach me, and twice more before I had it open.  I ordered two sets of these and wish I had ordered more.</li>
