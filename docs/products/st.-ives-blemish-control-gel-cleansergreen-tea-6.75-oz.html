            <li>Amazing scent!</li>
            <li>It is non-drying, and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>While this product has a pleasant smell, it did not bring me any miracles.  </li>
            <li>it felt really good</li>
            <li>It smells good, is not tested on animals, has no animal by products in it and cleans well.</li>
            <li>Loved this product but it has been discontinued by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>It does a great job helping to keep my skin blemishs to a minimum, and I love the scent and astringency.</li>

            <li>love this face wash!</li>
            <li>The lather is cooling and it smells nice, not like medicine or menthol.  </li>
            <li>Very gentel and works great!</li>
            <li>And remember to follow up with a good face friendly moisturizer and non-clogging makeup.     </li>
            <li>It has some great natural ingredients in it, and I love that there are no parabens!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been able to find it in more and more stores.</li>
            <li>The more I used this product, the more I started to break out.</li>
            <li>I also LOVE how the product isn&#x27;t tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>Like most people who love St.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>So, make sure you use moisturizer after you use the product - preferably at night because your skin can \\&quot;heal.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This will make you break out more.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this face wash.</li>
            <li>The scent is so dreamy, i love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to most fragrances</li>
            <li>I love this face wash.</li>
            <li>It made me breakout more.</li>
            <li>I just wish St.Ives would develop an equally awesome daily lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this face wash</li>
            <li>I love St. Ives products.  </li>
            <li>This is beyond fantastic!</li>
            <li>i do love st ives products</li>
            <li>but this one just seemed to make my face &amp; irritate it more than anything</li>
            <li>Works okay definitely better face washes out there.</li>
            <li>I have middle-age acne, and have tried many things, but this made NO DIFFERENCE WHATSOEVER in my skin.  </li>
            <li>St.Ives has other great products that leave your face cleansed and great.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, fresh, clean smell and makes the skin feel cool and nice.</li>
            <li>It cleans my skin, smells delicious, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>Overall I thought this was a very good cleanser to use.</li>
            <li>started using this product and started seeing very good results within several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wow i cant believe how great this product is.</li>
            <li>I bought this cleanser after running out of my Biore Pore Unclogging scrub since I wanted to try something new and after reading so many good things about St. Ives I decided to give it a go.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle on the skin and the scent is mild and amazing!</li>
            <li>This must be the best facial wash product in the market at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>For less than $10 each, thats an awesome deal.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great little cleanser that&#x27;s inexpensive and effective.</li>
            <li>The wash is gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System Brush, 1-Count]]</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li>but so far does a really good job cleaning my face.</li>
            <li>No, it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but this face wash is really good for maintaining clean, clear skin.</li>
            <li>My pores looked huge and my skin just didn&#x27;t seem clean.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day, in the morning and before bedtime, and I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s helped my acne significantly</li>
            <li>However, it does clean the skin -- which is what you would expect from anything that calls itself a cleanser.</li>
            <li>My pores and skin look clean again.</li>
            <li>B00K4PLC30 Sweet Almond Oil - Molivera Organics 16 oz.]]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a good cleanser, since I use some products that could possibly make my skin breakout (sunscreen, for example).</li>
            <li>Another good tip, I have for you who is suffering from acne is to use a facial sponge.</li>
            <li>Love this product is gently in my face .</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel super clean and keep pimples and redness at bay.</li>
            <li>It seems effective on acne-prone skin, but I don&#x27;t have that problem and my skin&#x27;s sensitive</li>
            <li>Other than that, it smells great and leaves my face feeling clean.</li>
            <li>But this smells good, I love the green tea in it and it does help with my acne.</li>
            <li>I did have some mild dryness when I first started using this product, but I would use two pumps before (which was just too much, you don&#x27;t need more than one);</li>
            <li>This is definitly good for moderate acne and helps keep acne at bay when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>St. Ive&#x27;s scores a perfect 10 in my book with their new Green Tea Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>The green tea cleanser is great.</li>
            <li>and I liked how my face felt - clean, but it was EXTREMELY DRY after washing.</li>
            <li>If you use a salicylic acid wash and a BP cream together and give it a good chance to work, you should end up with clearer skin, especially with this gentle redness reducing face wash.  </li>
            <li>This makes my face feel so fresh without drying it out.  </li>
            <li>I use it twice per day and am loving my new clear skin!  </li>
            <li>and they were right.  </li>
            <li>on my face instead of a cream moisturizer - it is much lighter and more natural and does not clog up my pores.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty nice, although my face does feel quite dry after using it.</li>
            <li>My skin is unpredictable, sometimes it&#x27;s dry, sometimes it&#x27;s oily and sometimes its perfect.  </li>
            <li>I feel as if this could be an effective product for those with acne, such as myself, but this product in particular just didn&#x27;t do it for me.  </li>
            <li>The first couple of times I washed my face with this</li>
            <li>I personally have found that benzoyl peroxide works better on my skin than salacylic acid</li>
            <li>So gentle on my skin!</li>
            <li>Love this facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I love how this product deep cleans and purifies the skin.</li>
            <li>Washes off my waterproof makeup at the first cleanse..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also has salicylic which treats acne breakouts, leaving my skin looking clear &amp; feeling smooth..</li>
            <li>but this product is really works for me!</li>
            <li>Salicylic acid is really good for cleaning out dead skin cells and improving skin cell cycle.  </li>
            <li>A %2.5 cream might work too for more sensitive skin, but mine is pretty sensitive and can handle it once a day.  </li>
            <li>The green tea cleanser is great for a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Dermatologists say to only use a DIME size drop of Salicylic Acid (people have a tendency to complain that a product did not work and its my theory that they have used too much which overloads their face with chemicals and starts drying up their skin then creates breakouts for more</li>
            <li>It really dryed my skin out (and I have pretty oily skin...)</li>
            <li>The whole thing is with an acne cleanser like this you MUST wash your face FIRST with a cream cleanser or something that will take the dirt off otherwise you will just be rubbing the dirt and oil into your face.</li>
            <li>My skin looks really good and no more breakouts.</li>
            <li>It washes off very easily too which for some reason when I use other products I feel like I still have a film on my face (yuck).  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I heard it was better for acne on back and shoulders than normal acne cleansers</li>
            <li>However, I really LOVE the scent; it smells like really sweet green tea.  </li>
            <li>Good price and last a really long time to finish.</li>
            <li>My skins always feel fresh and clear!</li>
            <li>My skin even started to break out and it also made my face look really washed out and worn.</li>
            <li>I tried switching in between this product and their olive oil cleanser, but really, there was no need.  </li>
            <li>I really really tried to like this product.</li>
            <li>It could just be my skin, but who can really say?</li>
            <li>once I decreased the amount I used, my skin was happy.    </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have any gripes about this product.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I saw results in one week, which is fast when you take into account how your skin works.  </li>
            <li>P.S., I would recommend the pump version; so much easier and practical.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say if it made a difference in treating/preventing acne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another important product in my routine is a facial toner.</li>
            <li>so I cant really weigh in.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have any complaints about the product, but the packaging is another story.</li>
            <li>This cleanser has really resolved that issue though.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It also really does reduce redness.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and this product, when used with a light daily moisturizer with SPF, keeps my face from turning greasy as the day goes on.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle   </li>
            <li>It is cruelty free   and contains no parabens     The only con:  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I really like this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Salicylic acid works for me in a leave-on treatment, but this really didn&#x27;t do anything it promised.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying this.</li>
            <li>The absolute lack of care.</li>
            <li>I thought, okay just a little pimple, nothing to worry about right?</li>
            <li>Not to say it doesn&#x27;t work for other people, because i&#x27;m sure it does.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend trying this product - it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li>Smells great too, not overpowering and my skin isn&#x27;t dry or tight after.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Salicylic Acid does an effective job cleaning your pores after a long day outside where all the dust and dirt would accumulate in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would still strongly recommend to  those who have oily, acne prone skin and want something that doesn&#x27;t dry their skin out.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a little bit more intense than I need.</li>
            <li>It does the job of washing off grease, make up, and dirt, and it is truly mild enough.</li>
            <li>This particular cleanser cleans my face and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Outstanding product (small in size) Use this clearly for facial blemishes can be a clear advantage in maintaining a healthy complexion.</li>
            <li>My skin is normal to combination and quite acne prone</li>
            <li>I would have just really LOVED if this did more for my skin :(</li>
            <li>and I LOVE Green Tea</li>
            <li>I wish I new about this product in high school.</li>
            <li>I have a normal face (in terms of oiliness) and usually no acne.</li>
            <li>(I live in Florida).  </li>
            <li>However, I decided to begin trying other natural product that I could easily access at the store if I happened to run out.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product, and purchase many other items from St. Ives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The condition of my skin improved drastically, and I would have never believed it would be possible with such cheap products.</li>
            <li>B00K7HVHYE HC3 - Extremely potent triple action 10% Vitamin C serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a powerful Superfruit Anti-Oxidant complex!]]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually not one to complain about a product, but this one just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>, I have used the Apricot Scrub many times in the past, but this was a scent I have not seen before</li>
            <li>I actually slather a bit on my t-zone (where I get my breakouts) while I wait for the hot water to reach my faucet and then rinse off.  </li>
            <li>I am completely floored by this product!  </li>
            <li>It is general yet cleans very well.</li>
            <li>I LOVE St Ives green tea face wash!</li>
            <li>My skin is prone to breakouts and is super sensitive to harsh products, so I have to be very selective about the products I use.  </li>
            <li>My skin is always glowing after I use this product, and feels so clean without making my face red or dry.</li>
            <li>Her face stays mostly clear.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping it would clear up my skin</li>
            <li>(I use only the brush, not the cleanser that comes in the kit) and it has really helped minimize the size and appearance of the pores and blackheads on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li>They have Dr. Sponge made specifically for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to work just as well.</li>
            <li>No harsh smells.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old daughter loves it.</li>
            <li>I did not buy this face wash hoping for a miracle to my acne issues but rather to use it as part of a combination of products that has completely cleared my face.  </li>
            <li>My face feels soft after using it even before I put on my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and i started breaking out like a 14 year old.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>A few days later I was so in love</li>
            <li>I have extremely oily skin, and I&#x27;ve been through almost every drugstore facial cleanser available.</li>
            <li>It rinses off completely, leaving my skin feeling completely clean but not stripped and dried out.  </li>
            <li>which also made a positive difference in appearance and radiance of my skin, and finally, when I am done, I just put a tiny dab of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This is the only face wash that keeps my 16 year old daughter&#x27;s face clear!</li>
            <li>First time using it, it left my face completely dry to the point where it felt super tight.</li>
            <li>It was the closest product I could find, as far as ingredients and such, to my old cleanser.  </li>
            <li>i come from a family of very oily faces and this is the only product i can trust to properly cleanse my face!</li>
            <li>Originally, I bought a small, travel size of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Hard to fine in the store, don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li>I am a 24 yr old female who has very sensitive combo skin with moderate acne.  </li>
            <li>Not just small zits, but huge red ones all over my forehead.</li>
            <li>The key to my clear skin has been using a %5 benzoyl peroxide cream.  </li>
            <li>Nearly everything has 2% salicylic acid, so they do the same thing to your skin - either that ingredient helps you or it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>, I purchased a 6 Oz tube of the scrub on Amazon and saw this cleanser in the same scent and decided to purchase it also and completely change my skin regiment.    </li>
            <li>People with really sensitive skin should buy a product that has a smaller percentage of Salicylic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I barely need toner and moisturizer when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped clear up my skin and be less oily.</li>
            <li>The salicylic acid cannot work unless it is applied to a CLEAN face and massaged for at least 1 minute.</li>
            <li>I also read once that in order for the active ingredients in a facewashe to really work for acne</li>
            <li>it only took about a week to see results and my skin is really clear and not red!  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t really clear up existing acne but rather help prevent future breakouts and heal current blemishes over time.      </li>
            <li>Anyone looking at a review of a facial cleanser know how these companies like Neutrogena and Johnson &amp; Johnson are constantly coming out with these \\&quot;new\\&quot; facial cleansers that claim to once and for all clear up your problematic skin... and</li>
            <li>Long story short, this facewash is so gentle that I can actually complete this process without any burning or other side effects.  </li>
            <li>It is a little drying, so you need to use a gentle moisturizer to keep your skin from drying out and getting flaky, which will negate the effects of the salicylic acid by clogging your pores all over again.       </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser twice a day for about 3 months now and this is one of the best cleansers I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>

            <li> happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, in my opinion this is a great product that has delivered results.</li>
            <li> LOL  </li>
            <li> i use it when i shower in the morning and before bed and my skin feels great.  </li>
            <li> Smells great too.</li>
            <li> Amazing scent!</li>
            <li> It is non-drying, and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> While this product has a pleasant smell, it did not bring me any miracles.  </li>
            <li> it felt really good</li>
            <li> It smells good, is not tested on animals, has no animal by products in it and cleans well.</li>
            <li> Loved this product but it has been discontinued by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> It does a great job helping to keep my skin blemishs to a minimum, and I love the scent and astringency.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try!</li>
            <li> Love it and it smells so nice!</li>
            <li> love this face wash!</li>
            <li> The lather is cooling and it smells nice, not like medicine or menthol.  </li>
            <li> Very gentel and works great!</li>
            <li> And remember to follow up with a good face friendly moisturizer and non-clogging makeup.     </li>
            <li> It has some great natural ingredients in it, and I love that there are no parabens!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been able to find it in more and more stores.</li>
            <li> The more I used this product, the more I started to break out.</li>
            <li> I also LOVE how the product isn&#x27;t tested on animals.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Like most people who love St.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> So, make sure you use moisturizer after you use the product - preferably at night because your skin can \\&quot;heal.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This will make you break out more.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this face wash.</li>
            <li> The scent is so dreamy, i love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to most fragrances</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.</li>
            <li> It made me breakout more.</li>
            <li> I just wish St.Ives would develop an equally awesome daily lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash</li>
            <li> I love St. Ives products.  </li>
            <li> This is beyond fantastic!</li>
            <li> i do love st ives products</li>
            <li> but this one just seemed to make my face &amp; irritate it more than anything</li>
            <li> Works okay definitely better face washes out there.</li>
            <li> I have middle-age acne, and have tried many things, but this made NO DIFFERENCE WHATSOEVER in my skin.  </li>
            <li> St.Ives has other great products that leave your face cleansed and great.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant, fresh, clean smell and makes the skin feel cool and nice.</li>
            <li> It cleans my skin, smells delicious, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> Overall I thought this was a very good cleanser to use.</li>
            <li> started using this product and started seeing very good results within several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wow i cant believe how great this product is.</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser after running out of my Biore Pore Unclogging scrub since I wanted to try something new and after reading so many good things about St. Ives I decided to give it a go.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle on the skin and the scent is mild and amazing!</li>
            <li> This must be the best facial wash product in the market at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> For less than $10 each, thats an awesome deal.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great little cleanser that&#x27;s inexpensive and effective.</li>
            <li> The wash is gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System Brush, 1-Count]]</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> but so far does a really good job cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> No, it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but this face wash is really good for maintaining clean, clear skin.</li>
            <li> My pores looked huge and my skin just didn&#x27;t seem clean.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day, in the morning and before bedtime, and I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s helped my acne significantly</li>
            <li> However, it does clean the skin -- which is what you would expect from anything that calls itself a cleanser.</li>
            <li> My pores and skin look clean again.</li>
            <li> B00K4PLC30 Sweet Almond Oil - Molivera Organics 16 oz.]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a good cleanser, since I use some products that could possibly make my skin breakout (sunscreen, for example).</li>
            <li> Another good tip, I have for you who is suffering from acne is to use a facial sponge.</li>
            <li> Love this product is gently in my face .</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel super clean and keep pimples and redness at bay.</li>
            <li> It seems effective on acne-prone skin, but I don&#x27;t have that problem and my skin&#x27;s sensitive</li>
            <li> Other than that, it smells great and leaves my face feeling clean.</li>
            <li> But this smells good, I love the green tea in it and it does help with my acne.</li>
            <li> I did have some mild dryness when I first started using this product, but I would use two pumps before (which was just too much, you don&#x27;t need more than one);</li>
            <li> This is definitly good for moderate acne and helps keep acne at bay when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> St. Ive&#x27;s scores a perfect 10 in my book with their new Green Tea Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> The green tea cleanser is great.</li>
            <li> and I liked how my face felt - clean, but it was EXTREMELY DRY after washing.</li>
            <li> If you use a salicylic acid wash and a BP cream together and give it a good chance to work, you should end up with clearer skin, especially with this gentle redness reducing face wash.  </li>
            <li> This makes my face feel so fresh without drying it out.  </li>
            <li> I use it twice per day and am loving my new clear skin!  </li>
            <li> and they were right.  </li>
            <li> on my face instead of a cream moisturizer - it is much lighter and more natural and does not clog up my pores.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty nice, although my face does feel quite dry after using it.</li>
            <li> My skin is unpredictable, sometimes it&#x27;s dry, sometimes it&#x27;s oily and sometimes its perfect.  </li>
            <li> I feel as if this could be an effective product for those with acne, such as myself, but this product in particular just didn&#x27;t do it for me.  </li>
            <li> The first couple of times I washed my face with this</li>
            <li> I personally have found that benzoyl peroxide works better on my skin than salacylic acid</li>
            <li> So gentle on my skin!</li>
            <li> Love this facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I love how this product deep cleans and purifies the skin.</li>
            <li> Washes off my waterproof makeup at the first cleanse..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also has salicylic which treats acne breakouts, leaving my skin looking clear &amp; feeling smooth..</li>
            <li> but this product is really works for me!</li>
            <li> Salicylic acid is really good for cleaning out dead skin cells and improving skin cell cycle.  </li>
            <li> A %2.5 cream might work too for more sensitive skin, but mine is pretty sensitive and can handle it once a day.  </li>
            <li> The green tea cleanser is great for a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Dermatologists say to only use a DIME size drop of Salicylic Acid (people have a tendency to complain that a product did not work and its my theory that they have used too much which overloads their face with chemicals and starts drying up their skin then creates breakouts for more</li>
            <li> It really dryed my skin out (and I have pretty oily skin...)</li>
            <li> The whole thing is with an acne cleanser like this you MUST wash your face FIRST with a cream cleanser or something that will take the dirt off otherwise you will just be rubbing the dirt and oil into your face.</li>
            <li> My skin looks really good and no more breakouts.</li>
            <li> It washes off very easily too which for some reason when I use other products I feel like I still have a film on my face (yuck).  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I heard it was better for acne on back and shoulders than normal acne cleansers</li>
            <li> However, I really LOVE the scent; it smells like really sweet green tea.  </li>
            <li> Good price and last a really long time to finish.</li>
            <li> My skins always feel fresh and clear!</li>
            <li> My skin even started to break out and it also made my face look really washed out and worn.</li>
            <li> I tried switching in between this product and their olive oil cleanser, but really, there was no need.  </li>
            <li> I really really tried to like this product.</li>
            <li> It could just be my skin, but who can really say?</li>
            <li> once I decreased the amount I used, my skin was happy.    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any gripes about this product.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> I saw results in one week, which is fast when you take into account how your skin works.  </li>
            <li> P.S., I would recommend the pump version; so much easier and practical.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say if it made a difference in treating/preventing acne.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another important product in my routine is a facial toner.</li>
            <li> so I cant really weigh in.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any complaints about the product, but the packaging is another story.</li>
            <li> This cleanser has really resolved that issue though.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> It also really does reduce redness.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this product, when used with a light daily moisturizer with SPF, keeps my face from turning greasy as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle   </li>
            <li> It is cruelty free   and contains no parabens     The only con:  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Salicylic acid works for me in a leave-on treatment, but this really didn&#x27;t do anything it promised.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for carrying this.</li>
            <li> The absolute lack of care.</li>
            <li> I thought, okay just a little pimple, nothing to worry about right?</li>
            <li> Not to say it doesn&#x27;t work for other people, because i&#x27;m sure it does.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend trying this product - it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li> Smells great too, not overpowering and my skin isn&#x27;t dry or tight after.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Salicylic Acid does an effective job cleaning your pores after a long day outside where all the dust and dirt would accumulate in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would still strongly recommend to  those who have oily, acne prone skin and want something that doesn&#x27;t dry their skin out.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little bit more intense than I need.</li>
            <li> It does the job of washing off grease, make up, and dirt, and it is truly mild enough.</li>
            <li> This particular cleanser cleans my face and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Outstanding product (small in size) Use this clearly for facial blemishes can be a clear advantage in maintaining a healthy complexion.</li>
            <li> My skin is normal to combination and quite acne prone</li>
            <li> I would have just really LOVED if this did more for my skin :(</li>
            <li> and I LOVE Green Tea</li>
            <li> I wish I new about this product in high school.</li>
            <li> I have a normal face (in terms of oiliness) and usually no acne.</li>
            <li> (I live in Florida).  </li>
            <li> However, I decided to begin trying other natural product that I could easily access at the store if I happened to run out.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product, and purchase many other items from St. Ives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The condition of my skin improved drastically, and I would have never believed it would be possible with such cheap products.</li>
            <li> B00K7HVHYE HC3 - Extremely potent triple action 10% Vitamin C serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a powerful Superfruit Anti-Oxidant complex!]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not one to complain about a product, but this one just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> , I have used the Apricot Scrub many times in the past, but this was a scent I have not seen before</li>
            <li> I actually slather a bit on my t-zone (where I get my breakouts) while I wait for the hot water to reach my faucet and then rinse off.  </li>
            <li> I am completely floored by this product!  </li>
            <li> It is general yet cleans very well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE St Ives green tea face wash!</li>
            <li> My skin is prone to breakouts and is super sensitive to harsh products, so I have to be very selective about the products I use.  </li>
            <li> My skin is always glowing after I use this product, and feels so clean without making my face red or dry.</li>
            <li> Her face stays mostly clear.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would clear up my skin</li>
            <li> (I use only the brush, not the cleanser that comes in the kit) and it has really helped minimize the size and appearance of the pores and blackheads on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> They have Dr. Sponge made specifically for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to work just as well.</li>
            <li> No harsh smells.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this face wash hoping for a miracle to my acne issues but rather to use it as part of a combination of products that has completely cleared my face.  </li>
            <li> My face feels soft after using it even before I put on my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and i started breaking out like a 14 year old.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> A few days later I was so in love</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin, and I&#x27;ve been through almost every drugstore facial cleanser available.</li>
            <li> It rinses off completely, leaving my skin feeling completely clean but not stripped and dried out.  </li>
            <li> which also made a positive difference in appearance and radiance of my skin, and finally, when I am done, I just put a tiny dab of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This is the only face wash that keeps my 16 year old daughter&#x27;s face clear!</li>
            <li> First time using it, it left my face completely dry to the point where it felt super tight.</li>
            <li> It was the closest product I could find, as far as ingredients and such, to my old cleanser.  </li>
            <li> i come from a family of very oily faces and this is the only product i can trust to properly cleanse my face!</li>
            <li> Originally, I bought a small, travel size of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Hard to fine in the store, don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li> I am a 24 yr old female who has very sensitive combo skin with moderate acne.  </li>
            <li> Not just small zits, but huge red ones all over my forehead.</li>
            <li> The key to my clear skin has been using a %5 benzoyl peroxide cream.  </li>
            <li> Nearly everything has 2% salicylic acid, so they do the same thing to your skin - either that ingredient helps you or it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> , I purchased a 6 Oz tube of the scrub on Amazon and saw this cleanser in the same scent and decided to purchase it also and completely change my skin regiment.    </li>
            <li> People with really sensitive skin should buy a product that has a smaller percentage of Salicylic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I barely need toner and moisturizer when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> It has really helped clear up my skin and be less oily.</li>
            <li> The salicylic acid cannot work unless it is applied to a CLEAN face and massaged for at least 1 minute.</li>
            <li> I also read once that in order for the active ingredients in a facewashe to really work for acne</li>
            <li> it only took about a week to see results and my skin is really clear and not red!  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t really clear up existing acne but rather help prevent future breakouts and heal current blemishes over time.      </li>
            <li> Anyone looking at a review of a facial cleanser know how these companies like Neutrogena and Johnson &amp; Johnson are constantly coming out with these \\&quot;new\\&quot; facial cleansers that claim to once and for all clear up your problematic skin... and</li>
            <li> Long story short, this facewash is so gentle that I can actually complete this process without any burning or other side effects.  </li>
            <li> It is a little drying, so you need to use a gentle moisturizer to keep your skin from drying out and getting flaky, which will negate the effects of the salicylic acid by clogging your pores all over again.       </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even finish half the bottle, I changed back to the Biore scrub and my face returned back to normal.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, This product did the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even eat properly due to the fact that the area around my lips were super dry and tight.</li>
            <li> took a lot of other precautions to clear up my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have an oily T zone and sensitive skin and a lot of other products make me break out, but not this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I did notice when I use this along with green tea scrub made my St. Ives, my skin can be tight, but the tightness is not felt because I quickly add moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am almost out of both the cleanser and the scrub now and will be purchasing a new set, but both lasted me almost half a year.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way, while on a road trip, it leaked in my toiletries bag making a huge, soapy mess.</li>
            <li> I have used it for as long as 3 bottles last.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One or two weeks later after cleansing my face with this product twice a day left my face completely dry (which never happens), so dry that it was starting to peel around the nose and on the corners of my mouth leaving redness everywhere.</li>
            <li> So few products live up to their expectation.  </li>
            <li> In the modern era of catchy product packaging and marketing strategies I feel a little overwhelmed walking down the skincare aisle in the drug store.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I use two pumps in the palm of my wet hands, and later it up on my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time and I won&#x27;t make that mistake again.</li>
            <li> , my skin was soft and I could feel the salicylic acid working since it left my face feeling a little tight which I thought was normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my skin will be dry so the moisturizer will help prevent breakouts and work as a shield against dirt and grime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They either make me break out, dry my skin out to the point that it flakes off, or makes my skin even oiler.</li>
            <li> do admit that this is a bit overdrying for my dry skin type, but I moisturize my skin with vitamin E oil and CeraVe moisturizer for dry skin.</li>
            <li> but if you have dry skin like me, you might need to moisten up after washing with this.</li>
            <li> and my face is mix dry and oily on the t zone</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much for my acne, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t make it worse.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t really have as much of a problem with little spots deciding to show up randomly like I did before.     </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent but if you expect a green tea smell you will be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> happy with this product. will be ordering it again</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser after running out of my Biore Pore Unclogging scrub since I wanted to try something new and after reading so many good things about St. Ives I decided to give it a go. My skin is normal to combination and quite acne prone so i figured that the salicylic acid and green tea would do wonders for me but I was wrong. The first couple of times I washed my face with this it felt really good, my skin was soft and I could feel the salicylic acid working since it left my face feeling a little tight which I thought was normal.&lt;br /&gt;One or two weeks later after cleansing my face with this product twice a day left my face completely dry (which never happens), so dry that it was starting to peel around the nose and on the corners of my mouth leaving redness everywhere. My skin even started to break out and it also made my face look really washed out and worn. I couldn&#x27;t even finish half the bottle, I changed back to the Biore scrub and my face returned back to normal. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> While this product has a pleasant smell, it did not bring me any miracles.  My skin is still broken out, my husbands breakouts got worse, and it is a drying product.  I feel as though almost every face wash is the same at this point and I feel discouraged wasting money.  Nearly everything has 2% salicylic acid, so they do the same thing to your skin - either that ingredient helps you or it doesn&#x27;t.  This did not thrill me.</li>
            <li> St. Ives products have always been some of my favorites.  The green tea cleanser is now the only face wash I use (besides exfoliating weekly).  The wash is gentle and effective.  My skin is unpredictable, sometimes it&#x27;s dry, sometimes it&#x27;s oily and sometimes its perfect.  The Green Tea helps balance my skin and keeps it predictable.  I use it every other day (because I&#x27;m lazy) and it works.  I tried switching in between this product and their olive oil cleanser, but really, there was no need.  I thought the two would be similar, but they are NOT.  So, I&#x27;ve stuck to this one and I&#x27;ve had no problems.  It lasts a long time and I&#x27;ve been able to find it in more and more stores.</li>
            <li> Great product. This is definitly good for moderate acne and helps keep acne at bay when I first started using it. But because my acne got immune to this cleanser it stopped working after I used about half of the bottle. Overall I thought this was a very good cleanser to use.</li>
            <li> I really really tried to like this product. I used it all the way through. I gave it plenty of chances. It just didn&#x27;t work out. Not to say it doesn&#x27;t work for other people, because i&#x27;m sure it does. For me however, the results were terrible. I bought this product solely for the purpose of cleaning my face and to prevent acne. I don&#x27;t usually have acne... Just a pimple every now and then. This product changed that. As soon as I used this product a pimple popped up. I thought, okay just a little pimple, nothing to worry about right? Wrong. The more I used this product, the more I started to break out. It&#x27;s not too bad, but it is still something I&#x27;m not used to. I now have pimple marks that I am working to get rid of. It could just be my skin, but who can really say? I&#x27;m usually not one to complain about a product, but this one just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I feel as if this could be an effective product for those with acne, such as myself, but this product in particular just didn&#x27;t do it for me.  It really dryed my skin out (and I have pretty oily skin...) and my breakouts were showing no signs of disappearing after weeks of using this product.  I personally have found that benzoyl peroxide works better on my skin than salacylic acid so for those out there who thinks this cleanser doesn&#x27;t do anything for your acne, I would recommend getting a product with benzoyl peroxide! However, I really LOVE the scent; it smells like really sweet green tea.  I also LOVE how the product isn&#x27;t tested on animals.  I would have just really LOVED if this did more for my skin :(</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this face wash! Originally, I bought a small, travel size of [[ASIN:B00K3YFW9M St. Ives Blackhead Clearing Green Tea Scrub, 6 Oz.]] at Walmart just to give it a try. Like most people who love St.Ives products, I have used the Apricot Scrub many times in the past, but this was a scent I have not seen before and I LOVE Green Tea everything, so had to try it out and I am so glad I did. A few days later I was so in love, I purchased a 6 Oz tube of the scrub on Amazon and saw this cleanser in the same scent and decided to purchase it also and completely change my skin regiment.    Just a little bit of this product goes a long way. I use one small pump of the cleanser once a day usually in the evenings to remove the daily dirt and makeup off my face. I am almost out of both the cleanser and the scrub now and will be purchasing a new set, but both lasted me almost half a year. For less than $10 each, thats an awesome deal.    I have an oily T zone and sensitive skin and a lot of other products make me break out, but not this cleanser. It is so gentle on the skin and the scent is mild and amazing! My skin is always glowing after I use this product, and feels so clean without making my face red or dry. I did have some mild dryness when I first started using this product, but I would use two pumps before (which was just too much, you don&#x27;t need more than one); once I decreased the amount I used, my skin was happy.    The condition of my skin improved drastically, and I would have never believed it would be possible with such cheap products. I used to spend A LOT of money on skin care products and expensive moisturizes - none ever helped. So I gave up and figured if I can&#x27;t make it better with expensive cleansers, why bother spending money on them.     Now, my regiment is as follows and works for me:  In the morning I use the [[ASIN:B00K3YFW9M St. Ives Blackhead Clearing Green Tea Scrub, 6 Oz.]]. Every other day I use the scrub together with the [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System Brush, 1-Count]] (I use only the brush, not the cleanser that comes in the kit) and it has really helped minimize the size and appearance of the pores and blackheads on my nose and cheeks. Instead of moisturizer I apply [[ASIN:B001FYZAWS Elta MD UV Shield SPF 45 Oil-Free 7 oz.]] which helps my skin stay protected from the harmful UV rays all day long without clogging my pores or running down my face when it&#x27;s humid (I live in Florida).  In the evening I use this cleanser and then apply a thin layer of [[ASIN:B00K7HVHYE HC3 - Extremely potent triple action 10% Vitamin C serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a powerful Superfruit Anti-Oxidant complex!]] which also made a positive difference in appearance and radiance of my skin, and finally, when I am done, I just put a tiny dab of [[ASIN:B00K4PLC30 Sweet Almond Oil - Molivera Organics 16 oz.]] on my face instead of a cream moisturizer - it is much lighter and more natural and does not clog up my pores.  This regiment has done a world of difference for my face, and I hope if someone decides to give it a try - it will help you as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser twice a day for about 3 months now and this is one of the best cleansers I&#x27;ve ever used.  My skin is prone to breakouts and is super sensitive to harsh products, so I have to be very selective about the products I use.  I also read once that in order for the active ingredients in a facewashe to really work for acne, you need to leave it on for 2 minutes.  I actually slather a bit on my t-zone (where I get my breakouts) while I wait for the hot water to reach my faucet and then rinse off.  Long story short, this facewash is so gentle that I can actually complete this process without any burning or other side effects.  And while it hasn&#x27;t totally reversed my breakouts, I&#x27;ve noticed I get acne a lot less than I used to and the pimples go away a lot faster.  I would definitely recommend trying this product - it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the lookout for a good cleanser, since I use some products that could possibly make my skin breakout (sunscreen, for example). When I saw this, I was a little bit nervous since I hadn&#x27;t read any reviews for it, but I thought \\&quot;What the heck! I like St Ives, so let&#x27;s give it a shot!\\&quot;    I&#x27;m very glad I did!    The green tea cleanser is great. It has a pleasant, fresh, clean smell and makes the skin feel cool and nice. I use it twice a day, in the morning and before bedtime, and I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s helped my acne significantly, I don&#x27;t really have as much of a problem with little spots deciding to show up randomly like I did before.     I don&#x27;t really have any gripes about this product. It&#x27;s a great little cleanser that&#x27;s inexpensive and effective.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have ever written a review for a product on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here its goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my research from several dermatologists online. They have instructed people with acne to use Salicylic Acid for their acne. People with really sensitive skin should buy a product that has a smaller percentage of Salicylic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to take their advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to Walmart in the Health and Beauty section and found several products with Salicylic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;St. Ives stuck out to me because it has 2% Salicylic Acid and green tea oil which has antioxidants that would even further benefit my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product and started seeing very good results within several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a lot of other precautions to clear up my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salicylic Acid does an effective job cleaning your pores after a long day outside where all the dust and dirt would accumulate in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Change my bed sheets every week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Dermatologists say to only use a DIME size drop of Salicylic Acid (people have a tendency to complain that a product did not work and its my theory that they have used too much which overloads their face with chemicals and starts drying up their skin then creates breakouts for more acne.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Use a towel only for your face (Change every week)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) After cleansing I use Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion because I know that after I get rid of the Sebum(Oils on my skin) my skin will be dry so the moisturizer will help prevent breakouts and work as a shield against dirt and grime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, in my opinion this is a great product that has delivered results.</li>
            <li> I have a normal face (in terms of oiliness) and usually no acne. I used this product last night and I liked how my face felt - clean, but it was EXTREMELY DRY after washing. So, make sure you use moisturizer after you use the product - preferably at night because your skin can \\&quot;heal.\\&quot; I use moisturizer every time I wash my face with soap/scrub/cleanser. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I like this face wash and use it all the time. It smells good, is not tested on animals, has no animal by products in it and cleans well. The whole thing is with an acne cleanser like this you MUST wash your face FIRST with a cream cleanser or something that will take the dirt off otherwise you will just be rubbing the dirt and oil into your face. This will make you break out more. The salicylic acid cannot work unless it is applied to a CLEAN face and massaged for at least 1 minute.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this face wash. I have extremely oily skin, and I&#x27;ve been through almost every drugstore facial cleanser available. They either make me break out, dry my skin out to the point that it flakes off, or makes my skin even oiler. This is the perfect cleanser. It cleans my skin, smells delicious, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. It doesn&#x27;t do much for my acne, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t make it worse. I&#x27;ll continue to use this.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but am not impressed with the shipping.  Got it on time,  but a bunch of it leaked out and made everything else sticky.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser ever! Smells great! I don;t think they sell it in stores anymore, because I can&#x27;t find it anywhere!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty nice, although my face does feel quite dry after using it. Other than that, it smells great and leaves my face feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Anyone looking at a review of a facial cleanser know how these companies like Neutrogena and Johnson &amp; Johnson are constantly coming out with these \\&quot;new\\&quot; facial cleansers that claim to once and for all clear up your problematic skin... and St. Ive&#x27;s is no exception.  In the modern era of catchy product packaging and marketing strategies I feel a little overwhelmed walking down the skincare aisle in the drug store.  So few products live up to their expectation.  But with it&#x27;s simple transparent bottle and white label St. Ive&#x27;s scores a perfect 10 in my book with their new Green Tea Cleanser.  I have very oily skin and I&#x27;ve been battling acne since I was 12, now I&#x27;m 28.  I&#x27;ve been using the Green Tea Cleanser for 2 months, and I haven&#x27;t had a single break out since.  Not one single breakout!  I am completely floored by this product!  I don&#x27;t know what the difference is between this product and others, but it seems like \\&quot;they finally got it right!\\&quot;  I use two pumps in the palm of my wet hands, and later it up on my face.  The lather is cooling and it smells nice, not like medicine or menthol.  It rinses off completely, leaving my skin feeling completely clean but not stripped and dried out.  I barely need toner and moisturizer when I&#x27;m done.  I use it twice per day and am loving my new clear skin!  I saw results in one week, which is fast when you take into account how your skin works.  I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try!</li>
            <li> Wonderful cleanser! I have used it for as long as 3 bottles last. I am not planning to change brands, although I am not a loyal fan of St. Ives. The green tea cleanser is great for a sensitive skin. If you are someone who used to have a lot of blemishes and acne, and you used overabundant amount of pimple control harsh cremes and cleansers, you should consider using this. It does the job of washing off grease, make up, and dirt, and it is truly mild enough. It will not over-dry your face.   P.S., I would recommend the pump version; so much easier and practical.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this &amp; loves it. It makes her skin soft &amp; helps clear up the few blimishes she has.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this face wash was the pump. It has a pleasant scent but if you expect a green tea smell you will be disappointed. I&#x27;ve barely used the bottle and had to quit because of the excessive drying of my skin. A few days after I stopped using this product my dry skin ceased. Can&#x27;t really say if it made a difference in treating/preventing acne.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I heard it was better for acne on back and shoulders than normal acne cleansers and they were right.  Love it and it smells so nice!</li>
            <li> Not even 2 weeks ago I was in Ulta looking for a facial cleanser with green tea. The store associates were dumb-founded, flabbergasted . . . they had never heard of such a thing. Then I search my beloved Amazon and bingo!, here it is. I have horrible pms acne so the salicylic acid in this is a plus. Ive used it 3 days now. It cleans well without over drying my face. The scent is so dreamy, i love it.</li>
            <li> For some reason, no local drugstores or supermarkets sell this. It does a great job helping to keep my skin blemishs to a minimum, and I love the scent and astringency.</li>
            <li> This product helped to eliminate the prospect of an eyelid procedure to remove unsightly and uncomfortable fatty cysts.  Been using it for over five years and it&#x27;s gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> I had acne and I did not know what to do already. When I discovered this product, I without any second thoughts got it and it is a acne clearer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do admit that this is a bit overdrying for my dry skin type, but I moisturize my skin with vitamin E oil and CeraVe moisturizer for dry skin. I did notice when I use this along with green tea scrub made my St. Ives, my skin can be tight, but the tightness is not felt because I quickly add moisturizer. Another good tip, I have for you who is suffering from acne is to use a facial sponge. They have Dr. Sponge made specifically for sensitive skin. It made a big difference. It did not irritate my skin and make me break out more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another important product in my routine is a facial toner. I use the one made my OZ Naturals, it made a big difference to my skin. The days when I forget to use it. I wake up and I get a pimple here and there, but once I use a toner, everything is resolved!</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself because I misread the label.  I thought this would take care of facial redness.  Turns out it for pimples!  LOL  Gave it to my son he hasnt said anything one way or the other on the product so I cant really weigh in.</li>
            <li> So gentle on my skin!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this does not work for me.  It seemed like it did in the beginning but I think it may be too drying for my skin.  My husband likes it though.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my regular Neutrogena cleanser was discontinued. It was the closest product I could find, as far as ingredients and such, to my old cleanser.  So far it seems to work just as well. I&#x27;m very happy with the product. It cleans my skin well without over drying.  Blackheads are reduced, as well as pimples.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any complaints about the product, but the packaging is another story. The product leaks out even when the nozzle is turned to the &amp;#34;closed&amp;#34; position. I learned the hard way, while on a road trip, it leaked in my toiletries bag making a huge, soapy mess. I know next time to put it in a travel container.</li>
            <li> Love this facial cleanser.  Have used it for years and is difficult to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> I used to go out of my way to order this product online, since it&#x27;s discontinued in the stores. It was the only thing I would use on my skin because it appeared to be the only thing that worked. However, I decided to begin trying other natural product that I could easily access at the store if I happened to run out. So, I no longer use it.&lt;br /&gt;I would still strongly recommend to  those who have oily, acne prone skin and want something that doesn&#x27;t dry their skin out.</li>
            <li> i come from a family of very oily faces and this is the only product i can trust to properly cleanse my face!</li>
            <li> Good price and last a really long time to finish.</li>
            <li> This really helps to balance out my uneven skin. Some spots on my face are dry and other spots are oily and it&#x27;s always been frustrating. This cleanser has really resolved that issue though. I really like it. I&#x27;m allergic to most fragrances so I&#x27;m always a bit worried when I buy something online before I can smell it but this doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies at all. I&#x27;m going to continue to buy this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Very gentel and works great! No harsh smells.</li>
            <li> wow i cant believe how great this product is. i have been using it for about a month.  it only took about a week to see results and my skin is really clear and not red!  i use it when i shower in the morning and before bed and my skin feels great.  it also moisturizes too.  thanks st. ives</li>
            <li> This is a very good cleaner.. but if you have dry skin like me, you might need to moisten up after washing with this.</li>
            <li> Love this product is gently in my face . Im latin and my face is mix dry and oily on the t zone but so far does a really good job cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old daughter loves it. Hard to fine in the store, don&#x27;t know why. Her face stays mostly clear. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> This is the only face wash that keeps my 16 year old daughter&#x27;s face clear! She uses the face scrub once a week too. Great prices on these as well! Amazing scent!</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. It is general yet cleans very well. It also really does reduce redness. I wish I new about this product in high school.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product (small in size) Use this clearly for facial blemishes can be a clear advantage in maintaining a healthy complexion.</li>
            <li> It made me breakout more.</li>
            <li> I LOVE St Ives green tea face wash! (I bought 5 bottles because it performs so awesome!) It has really helped clear up my skin and be less oily. It is non-drying, and smells amazing! It has some great natural ingredients in it, and I love that there are no parabens! And how can you beat the price!?!!? St Ives performs just as well as brands that are 5x the price. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> No, it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but this face wash is really good for maintaining clean, clear skin. I have combination skin and this product, when used with a light daily moisturizer with SPF, keeps my face from turning greasy as the day goes on. I usually have blotchy skin but since I&#x27;ve been using St.Ives Green Tea Face Wash, my skin tone has corrected. No more red blotches! I also use the Green Tea Exfoliator once or twice a week to slough off any dead skin. It&#x27;s a great system! I just wish St.Ives would develop an equally awesome daily lotion. All of their current lotions seem too gloppy and thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this face wash!</li>
            <li> I am a 24 yr old female who has very sensitive combo skin with moderate acne.  I did not buy this face wash hoping for a miracle to my acne issues but rather to use it as part of a combination of products that has completely cleared my face.  Salicylic acid is really good for cleaning out dead skin cells and improving skin cell cycle.  It will help refresh your face and prevent blockages that can lead to acne.  It won&#x27;t really clear up existing acne but rather help prevent future breakouts and heal current blemishes over time.      I love this face wash because...  It is so gentle   The green tea in it really does help to reduce inflammation and redness  It has no exfoliation beads that can irritate skin and worsen acne    It is cruelty free   and contains no parabens     The only con:  It is a little drying, so you need to use a gentle moisturizer to keep your skin from drying out and getting flaky, which will negate the effects of the salicylic acid by clogging your pores all over again.       As I said before, I use this as part of an acne regimen that mimics those found in proactiv or any of those expensive regimens.    The key to my clear skin has been using a %5 benzoyl peroxide cream.  A %2.5 cream might work too for more sensitive skin, but mine is pretty sensitive and can handle it once a day.  Benzoyl Peroxide works by introducing oxygen into your pores which kills the anaerobic P. acnes bacteria which causes acne.  If you use a salicylic acid wash and a BP cream together and give it a good chance to work, you should end up with clearer skin, especially with this gentle redness reducing face wash.  And remember to follow up with a good face friendly moisturizer and non-clogging makeup.     I&#x27;m not a professional but this is just stuff I&#x27;ve discovered along my journey that works for me.  I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> My son is 16 and dealing with a few pimples.  This cleanser cleared up his face in just a few days.  The difference was almost instant.  And it smells GREAT!  I&#x27;m definitely buying this again.</li>
            <li> i like st.ives products. i was using the apricot scrub and needed a gentler cleanser and wanted to try this one. It makes my face feel super clean and keep pimples and redness at bay.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to being doing much in regards to prevention or healing of acne and the blemishes it leaves behind for my combination skin. However, it does clean the skin -- which is what you would expect from anything that calls itself a cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love St. Ives products.  This particular cleanser cleans my face and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  My face feels soft after using it even before I put on my moisturizer. I will definitely be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I love how this product deep cleans and purifies the skin. Washes off my waterproof makeup at the first cleanse.. It&#x27;s also has salicylic which treats acne breakouts, leaving my skin looking clear &amp; feeling smooth.. I&#x27;m cautious about the ingredients with all the artificial colors and fragrance I hope it don&#x27;t harm my skin.</li>
            <li> Smells like green apples</li>
            <li> This is beyond fantastic! It&#x27;s hard to find this in stock in stores near me so I was soooo happy Amazon had it!  This makes my face feel so fresh without drying it out.  It washes off very easily too which for some reason when I use other products I feel like I still have a film on my face (yuck).  I have very oily skin but this helps instantly get rid of the excess oil and dirt.  I use a St. Ives cream after and I have definitely seen an improvement in my skin&#x27;s discoloration.</li>
            <li> This is no longer sold in stores and is one of the few facial cleansers that my face doesn&#x27;t overreact to (no drying out and no pimples).&lt;br /&gt;I will miss it when it&#x27;s gone....</li>
            <li> i do love st ives products but this one just seemed to make my face &amp; irritate it more than anything, i also do not care for the scent..</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would clear up my skin and it does. Of course I have other things in my routine and I use a facial sonic cleanser. But this smells good, I love the green tea in it and it does help with my acne. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Loved this product but it has been discontinued by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> St.Ives has other great products that leave your face cleansed and great. On the other hand, This product did the complete opposite. First time using it, it left my face completely dry to the point where it felt super tight. I couldn&#x27;t even eat properly due to the fact that the area around my lips were super dry and tight. To make matters worse, I started breaking out like never before. Not just small zits, but huge red ones all over my forehead. This product took me back to my youth days when i was going through puberty. I am 24 and i started breaking out like a 14 year old. I have read previous reviews about people complaining and getting the same reactions i received when using this. I said what the hek and gave it a shot. And boy i was wrong!!! I am still of a fan of St.Ives, but certainly not of this product. TWO THUMBS DOWN.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this product for a while and noticed a visible difference in my skin. My pores looked huge and my skin just didn&#x27;t seem clean. The bottle lasts a long time and I won&#x27;t make that mistake again. My pores and skin look clean again. It also improves the tone. I integrate several St. Ives products with my pricier ones.</li>
            <li> This seems to be the only inexpensive facial cleanser product that is actually working for me. Smells great too, not overpowering and my skin isn&#x27;t dry or tight after.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser. It deep cleans without stripping the skin. I follow with the St. Ives exfoliating pads. My skin looks really good and no more breakouts.</li>
            <li> It seems effective on acne-prone skin, but I don&#x27;t have that problem and my skin&#x27;s sensitive so it&#x27;s a little bit more intense than I need.My boyfriend has acne know, so I gave it to him and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Works okay definitely better face washes out there.</li>
            <li> Too bad they are discontinuing the item.</li>
            <li> This must be the best facial wash product in the market at a very reasonable price. Unfortunately, I cannot find it at my local stores (thank goodness for Amazon). I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin but this product is really works for me! My skins always feel fresh and clear! Thanks</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product, and purchase many other items from St. Ives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I cannot begin to describe the horrible smell from it.  Maybe it&#x27;s the green tea?  I NEVER have a problem with a product&#x27;s scent, even when that is an issue for others, but this makes me nauseous, it&#x27;s so bad &amp; strong.  That alone is reason enough for me not to use it.  Maybe it won&#x27;t bother you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It never seemed to work for me.  I have middle-age acne, and have tried many things, but this made NO DIFFERENCE WHATSOEVER in my skin.  It wasn&#x27;t bad, it wasn&#x27;t good--just smelly!  I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s particularly drying, and if the scent doesn&#x27;t bother you, than at the very least it is an inexpensive gel-like cleanser--not bad.  Salicylic acid works for me in a leave-on treatment, but this really didn&#x27;t do anything it promised.  Sadly, it&#x27;s in the trash.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter loves this. I was looking for this in all the pharmacies and stores and only found it on Amazon. Thanks for carrying this. I will keep ordering more !!!!</li>
            <li> I receive this product today,and i receive a blemish control, not what i wanted.</li>
            <li> Completely disappointed with the state of my package. The absolute lack of care. The St. Ives green tea was already opened and made a complete mess in the box. There wasn&#x27;t any plastic covering to prevent this.</li>
