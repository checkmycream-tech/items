            <li>Excellent product.  </li>

            <li>But this is perfect if you&#x27;re on the go and have a lot of hair!</li>
            <li>The results are great.</li>
            <li>A mix between Oi Oil and something like a gel; great before styling product for curly or unruly hair.</li>
            <li>It kind of tames frizz, but it&#x27;s just not that great.  </li>
            <li>Exceptional hair care product.</li>

            <li>I get great curl definition that&#x27;s not heavy, sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li>and I have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>i stocked up: it is a light water-soluble liquid that gives just a tad of hold and shine to make fine hair manageable and</li>
            <li>light to apply and helps keep the curls curled and</li>
            <li>Just smooth this through and put your hair in a braid or bun...</li>
            <li>It really goes on nicely, leaves no residue on my hair, and is clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>Great for my sometimes frizzy, always wavy, long hair.  </li>

            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, but in general Davines stuff is excellent quality and above.</li>
            <li>we will never know, but it really gives my fine hair a &#x27;grip&#x27; and still feels clean.</li>
            <li>Recommend it for anyone who does not like to use too much products in their hair.</li>
            <li>Ok, so basically i got this to make my hair have the wet wattery hair head feel,</li>
            <li>I only used it a few times and went back to using the Davines Woinder Wax which is the best product for my hair from them.</li>
            <li>My Hair is very dry and frizzy specially on certain days and this is a great product to tame it.</li>

            <li>I am African-American with natural hair.</li>
            <li>The way that I use the product is applying it after placing a little Davines Love conditioner on wet hair then putting the oil non oil on and letting it air dry.</li>
            <li>If your hair is thick and in need of moisture Davines has Plenty other products that will work better.</li>
            <li>I just dab a little bit of it on my hair before using the straight iron.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It kind of tames frizz, but it&#x27;s just not that great.  I got it because I heard it was weightless and I have fine hair.  I actually prefer a product I was already using, Redken Extreme Anti-Snap leave-in treatment for distressed hair.  Unfortunately, I have to rotate products, otherwise I&#x27;d use the Redken all the time.</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Very light to apply and helps keep the curls curled and not frizzed.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I will be passing this one on to my husband. He has thinner hair. If your hair is thick and in need of moisture Davines has Plenty other products that will work better. Smells decent tho.</li>
            <li> Think of it like the much needed everyday moisturizer for your hair.My Hair is very dry and frizzy specially on certain days and this is a great product to tame it. It is very easy to use. You do not have to use a lot of it. The results are great. I just dab a little bit of it on my hair before using the straight iron. Recommend it for anyone who does not like to use too much products in their hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  My curly perm stays nice all day.</li>
            <li> Ok, so basically i got this to make my hair have the wet wattery hair head feel, whatever but it made my hair greasy. I only used it a few times and went back to using the Davines Woinder Wax which is the best product for my hair from them. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, but in general Davines stuff is excellent quality and above. If you can find the Davines toothpaste that stuff is the best too. ok bye!</li>
            <li> was told by stylist that this will no longer be made so i stocked up: it is a light water-soluble liquid that gives just a tad of hold and shine to make fine hair manageable and semi-stylable: i looove this product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It controls my frizz.  It lasts forever (just a dab will do ya).  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair all stiff and artificial-looking.  Great for my sometimes frizzy, always wavy, long hair.  I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is the stuff!  Plus, I think the name is cute :)</li>
            <li> how does it work? we will never know, but it really gives my fine hair a &#x27;grip&#x27; and still feels clean. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> A mix between Oi Oil and something like a gel; great before styling product for curly or unruly hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> Exceptional hair care product.</li>
            <li> I just wish it smelled fruity or something.... But this is perfect if you&#x27;re on the go and have a lot of hair! Just smooth this through and put your hair in a braid or bun... 3 hours later you will have some nice wave!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this years ago and I still love it. It is not heavy feeling at all. Love it</li>
            <li> Used to buy this at a salon in Ottawa.  Found it on line which is so much better cause I live out west</li>
            <li> There is only 3/4 bottle of oil. I don&#x27;t know whether it is supposed to be like this or not. But I won&#x27;t buy it here again.</li>
            <li> I Love this product. It works amazing. It&#x27;s better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s non greasy &amp; it keeps the curl all day. I wish Salons would realize this products amazing worth.</li>

            <li> This product was found by my daughter and shared with me.  I find it fabulous!  Will continue to use it.  It really goes on nicely, leaves no residue on my hair, and is clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> Those of us with fine and limp hair need help and this product is very helpful.  I hope when I need more it&#x27;s available!</li>
