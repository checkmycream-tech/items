            <li>Nice colors, but</li>
            <li>Well is also good to consider that you gotta buy more stuff</li>
            <li>:) (I did a good research before buying this)</li>
            <li>/&gt;the colors are nice though, well.</li>
            <li>colors have great pigmentation.. very affordable!!</li>
            <li>Nice set for the price great Xmas or bday gift or giant stocking stuffer :) would buy again!</li>

            <li>Save your money and invest in better.</li>
            <li>They came in great conditions, very well packed.</li>
            <li>Love this pallete..</li>
            <li>When I opened it the mirror broke off and was sitting on top of the shadows.</li>
            <li>I love the variety of colors.  </li>
            <li>I always wear neutral colors and this is the perfect way to change things up without having to buy a lot of different eye shadows.</li>
            <li>and she fell in love with this it .</li>
            <li>I love this eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li>It did me great wonders and it was very affordable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with how the colors didn&#x27;t get messed up although the mirror was chipped and had fallen off once I opened my package which didn&#x27;t please me</li>
            <li>They really don&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; name but amazing stuff!</li>
            <li>Although I love the variations of color, they come out way light....</li>
            <li>Once I cleaned it out though it was fine.</li>
            <li>The colors are smooth and stay on.</li>
            <li>I love all the shades that came in the palette, the application is smooth when brushes are used, the color is even and holds very well.</li>
            <li>there was also a large lump on the top which must have been a manufacturing problem.</li>
            <li>Love the color, they are very nature.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve purchased a $3 palette from a department store and had more pigment and better lasting than this.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I first got my package</li>
            <li>Most of the colors in this palette are so similar it&#x27;s like getting twenty colors instead of 88.</li>
            <li>but you have to use a lot of the product to get the exact color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice palette but just not very pigmented.</li>
            <li>but when I opened it first thing, the mirror fell out.</li>
            <li>The palette doesn&#x27;t close very securely so you should probably be careful if you travel with it or just don&#x27;t travel with it at all.</li>
            <li>No broken shadows but</li>
            <li>The mirror fell off when I opened it and landed straight on my foot.</li>
            <li>This is much smaller than it appears and the colors are very light when applied and don&#x27;t stay on long</li>
            <li>so you dont pay for shipping, however the other brands request up to $50 to get free shipp.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t advertise what you can&#x27;t live up to.</li>
            <li>What I really love most about is that it came with the hard black shiny case and not the old one.</li>
            <li>If you prefer rich, quality colors splurge on something a bit more expensive</li>
            <li>The palette as a whole is a lot smaller than what it appears.</li>
            <li>Wore for a couple hours before realizing it was almost completely worn off my eyelids (I don&#x27;t use a primer, so this is probably why)</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price.</li>
            <li>No harm done but this was poorly put together and honestly a scam.</li>
            <li>Barely pigmented at all and flakes on my cheek when applying.</li>
            <li>Many other colors were out of their places and the entire inside was a mess.</li>
            <li>Love it, although when I received it it was broken.</li>
            <li>The shadows are exactly the same as the other brands that are also from China.</li>

            <li> I was scared to even open the pallet at first, but when I did one of the colors was broken and all over the place.</li>

            <li> Other than that I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in the fact that two of the shades in the palette came broken and crumbling, so the only blue I had and one of the rich, caramel browns are only partially there now.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend because she likes the dark color</li>
            <li> I would recommend slightly wetting your brush before applying the product.</li>
            <li> The shadows are buttery but not super pigmented.</li>
            <li> Then I noticed a few if the shades popped out too.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t show up very well and when it was delivered the mirror was broken off and a few eyeshadow a were broken.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors were crushed due how POORLY it was packed.</li>
            <li> However, the colors are not potent.</li>
            <li> Came in filthy and broken...not worth a refund.</li>
            <li> I had 6 colors that were broken and it made a mess everywhere will not purchase ever again</li>
            <li> the colors are not very good, and the mirror came shattered all over the place, it also came without three colors, not very happy</li>
            <li> I received this eyeshadow pallet broken &amp; missing eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Not a good powder, color does not match after applied</li>
            <li> Some of them were broken inside ,the mirror was broken and some s***ty colors blah.never again</li>
            <li> When I opened it one of the colors had broken and got all over me.</li>
            <li> Then when I opened it the broken eyeshadow was all over inside.</li>
            <li> The packaging was torn, the mirror was broken, one of the two eye shadow brush holders was broken, and two of the eye shadows were completely broken.</li>
            <li> Broken items :&#x27;( waste money</li>
            <li> too bad the pigmentation is so bad.</li>

            <li> I like that there is a wide selection of colors and it has a wide mirror. However, the colors are not potent. I would recommend slightly wetting your brush before applying the product. Some of the colors were crushed due how POORLY it was packed. I guess you get what you paid for, but it doesn&#x27;t make any excuse on presentation. I would never buy from them again.</li>
            <li> They really don&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; name but amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> This is much smaller than it appears and the colors are very light when applied and don&#x27;t stay on long I recommend the eyes lips and face eyeshadow pallet it&#x27;s 100% better.</li>
            <li> Most of the colors in this palette are so similar it&#x27;s like getting twenty colors instead of 88. The shadows are buttery but not super pigmented. I had to use my fingers for most of these to get the most impact on colors. I prefer to use brushes so I wasn&#x27;t very satisfied with this. The palette as a whole is a lot smaller than what it appears. The palette doesn&#x27;t close very securely so you should probably be careful if you travel with it or just don&#x27;t travel with it at all. I would recommend it to a beginner using makeup or somebody that&#x27;s not so picky about pigmentation. If you prefer rich, quality colors splurge on something a bit more expensive</li>
            <li> Although I love the variations of color, they come out way light....Wetting a brush before applique can definitely enhance the color.</li>
            <li> When I received my package, there was powder all over the inside. I was scared to even open the pallet at first, but when I did one of the colors was broken and all over the place. Other than that I have no complaints. Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Broken items :&#x27;( waste money</li>
            <li> I had 6 colors that were broken and it made a mess everywhere will not purchase ever again</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected date. No broken shadows but the mirror was off when I opened it.  Barely pigmented at all and flakes on my cheek when applying. Wore for a couple hours before realizing it was almost completely worn off my eyelids (I don&#x27;t use a primer, so this is probably why) i&#x27;ve purchased a $3 palette from a department store and had more pigment and better lasting than this.</li>
            <li> The colors are great but you have to use a lot of the product to get the exact color. It&#x27;s a nice palette but just not very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this palette. The colors are pigmented. They are matte as well. The only problem with this was one of the shadows were missing and one shadow was cracked when the package arrived.</li>
            <li> Some of them were broken inside ,the mirror was broken and some s***ty colors blah.never again</li>
            <li> The packaging was torn, the mirror was broken, one of the two eye shadow brush holders was broken, and two of the eye shadows were completely broken.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with this. Nice colors, but too bad the pigmentation is so bad. I would not recommend this if you want quality. Save your money and invest in better.</li>
            <li> Love the color, they are very nature.</li>
            <li> the colors are not very good, and the mirror came shattered all over the place, it also came without three colors, not very happy</li>
            <li> Came Broken, colors that were not broken were not very pigmented.</li>
            <li> Came in filthy and broken...not worth a refund.</li>
            <li> They came in great conditions, very well packed. The shadows are exactly the same as the other brands that are also from China. What I really love most about is that it came with the hard black shiny case and not the old one. For 10 bucks I think I did a great purchase. Well is also good to consider that you gotta buy more stuff so you dont pay for shipping, however the other brands request up to $50 to get free shipp. Anyway, I am happy with the eyeshadows, just what I was expecting. :) (I did a good research before buying this)</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I first got my package but when I opened it first thing, the mirror fell out. Then I noticed a few if the shades popped out too. Then a lot of the shadows were coming out of their tin. I won&#x27;t let one experience stop me from trying it again but I&#x27;m definitely dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Not a good powder, color does not match after applied</li>
            <li> Love this pallete.. colors have great pigmentation.. very affordable!!</li>
            <li> When I opened it the mirror broke off and was sitting on top of the shadows. The shadows are not pigmented at all ... you have to keep putting on coats after coats of the shadow... I did a swatch of the 2 darkest colors and I had to apply it like 4 times just to get the result I shown in the pic.</li>
            <li> When I opened it one of the colors had broken and got all over me. there was also a large lump on the top which must have been a manufacturing problem. Then when I opened it the broken eyeshadow was all over inside. Many other colors were out of their places and the entire inside was a mess. Once I cleaned it out though it was fine.</li>
            <li> Best ever love these color</li>
            <li> I love the variety of colors.  I always wear neutral colors and this is the perfect way to change things up without having to buy a lot of different eye shadows.</li>
            <li> In Perfect condition and I loved it.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t show up very well and when it was delivered the mirror was broken off and a few eyeshadow a were broken.</li>
            <li> I love the product, the quality of the shadow is excellent. I love all the shades that came in the palette, the application is smooth when brushes are used, the color is even and holds very well. I was a little disappointed in the fact that two of the shades in the palette came broken and crumbling, so the only blue I had and one of the rich, caramel browns are only partially there now. *tear&lt;br /&gt;Despite the crumbling product, I still recommend this product, shipment has nothing to do with quality, and for all I know, this could have been that one in a million chance that it would happen. Beautiful colors, beautiful hold.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend because she likes the dark color and she fell in love with this it .</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow palette. It did me great wonders and it was very affordable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with how the colors didn&#x27;t get messed up although the mirror was chipped and had fallen off once I opened my package which didn&#x27;t please me so I give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Horrible. The colors on the palette do mo match what I views and ordered. I want my money back. The mirror fell off when I opened it and landed straight on my foot. No harm done but this was poorly put together and honestly a scam. Don&#x27;t advertise what you can&#x27;t live up to. I will never order this again and don&#x27;t recommend it either</li>
            <li> I received this eyeshadow pallet broken &amp; missing eyeshadow. the mirror fell off as soon as I opened it.&lt;br /&gt;the colors are nice though, well. the ones I do have.</li>
            <li> Nice gift for my mom, beautiful colors. Gets good wear with primer. Nice set for the price great Xmas or bday gift or giant stocking stuffer :) would buy again!</li>
            <li> Love it, although when I received it it was broken. They replaced it.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the quality for the price. There are a great choice of colors. The colors are smooth and stay on. Will definitely buy again!</li>
