            <li>Thank you &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>The Nexxus Phyto Organics Chromolife Colour Locks Conditioner is wonderful and works great on my thin hair.  </li>
            <li>it has an overly strong,  perfume-y  aroma and liners on my hair.  </li>
            <li>This product was recommended by my hair stylist for my color and keratin treated hair because it is sulfite free and reduces sun fading damage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love what this does for my curly hair and love that I can buy such a big size at a great price.</li>
            <li>also use the same shampoo and believe that the price point was the best possible.  </li>
            <li>Love this conditioner, especially when I can buy it at a reduced price and shipping is free; can&#x27;t get this kind of deal at the local beauty store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved this product for awhile and because of that also purchased some of their other phyto organics products.  </li>
            <li>This particular product does not have the SLS in it, so I&#x27;ll continue to enjoy the year&#x27;s supply I just purchased.  </li>
            <li>(pure)</li>
            <li>Such a great everyday shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really want to try something else.</li>
            <li>Overall it doesn&#x27;t compare to my old color love.</li>
            <li>Phyto Organics is why I loved nexxus before they changed the other products to meet a larger market.  </li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with this conditioner; it lasts a long time, and works as well as any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have not found a salon in the area I live that carries</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and it seemed to make my hair brittle.  </li>
            <li>it is a natural product.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft but the texture of the conditioner itself feels waxy when you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li>Nice hair product just expensive</li>

            <li> Nice hair product just expensive</li>
            <li> After seeing that another phyto organics product has sodium laryl sulfate (sls) in it (not good), that makes me distrust the whole phyto organics brand of Nexxus.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few conditioners that does not weigh down my hair and make it flat.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell when it&#x27;s actually washed out.</li>
            <li> It has botanicals, does not weigh hair down at all.  </li>
            <li> I think the companies should realize that a little bit of regulation in the cosmetic industry would help guide them and not hurt thier bottom line.  </li>
            <li> I usually end up using it along with another conditioner so that it balances itself out.</li>
            <li> I saved at least $10 + tax by buying from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not real impressed.</li>
            <li> Btw, my hair is thin and I color it quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement for the very expensive purple container hair conditioner</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like it.  I have naturally curly hair and it seemed to make my hair brittle.  I guess I need something with more of a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have used this conditioner for 4 years, and it is the best I have ever used.  Does not strip the color.</li>
            <li> This product is a bit greasy. Btw, my hair is thin and I color it quite a bit. I usually end up using it along with another conditioner so that it balances itself out. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d reorder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this product for awhile and because of that also purchased some of their other phyto organics products.

This particular product does not have the SLS in it, so I&#x27;ll continue to enjoy the year&#x27;s supply I just purchased.  But the seed of distrust in the product has been planted in my mind.</li>
            <li> Phyto Organics is why I loved nexxus before they changed the other products to meet a larger market.  Such a great everyday shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few conditioners that does not weigh down my hair and make it flat.  The saloon where I use to buy this conditioner no longer carries it so I was happy to find it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see where it has kept my color longer than before.</li>
            <li> I love this product it is a great moisturizing conditioner for colored hair. Light weight and smells great it is a natural product. I great buy. This is one best light weigh conditioner for colored hair on the market.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this conditioner; it lasts a long time, and works as well as any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my hair stylist for my color and keratin treated hair because it is sulfite free and reduces sun fading damage.&lt;br /&gt;I also use the same shampoo and believe that the price point was the best possible.  I have not found a salon in the area I live that carries&lt;br /&gt;the liter size so ordering from this site was efficient and expedient!</li>
            <li> UPDATE: The photo showing is not the 33.8 oz, which comes in a big pump container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent conditioner that my hair stylist recommends. I have a lot of highlights, and this and the matching shampoo keep my hair getting me compliments. I saved at least $10 + tax by buying from Amazon. And I know my stylist was already giving me a good deal on a size she had to special order for me. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I  am not a fan of the smell.  it has an overly strong,  perfume-y  aroma and liners on my hair.  gives me a headache. I stopped  using it so I  can&#x27;t speak to how well the color saving formula works.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It great for my color-treated hair.  You do not have to use alot.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner, especially when I can buy it at a reduced price and shipping is free; can&#x27;t get this kind of deal at the local beauty store.</li>
            <li> What can I say? Some hair conditioners don&#x27;t work, but this one does the job! It has botanicals, does not weigh hair down at all.  I was looking for a replacement for the very expensive purple container hair conditioner (pure) I do believe this is the one!</li>
            <li> Love what this does for my curly hair and love that I can buy such a big size at a great price.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I was expecting. My hair feels soft but the texture of the conditioner itself feels waxy when you&#x27;re using it. It&#x27;s hard to tell when it&#x27;s actually washed out. Overall it doesn&#x27;t compare to my old color love. Just wanted to find something different and switch it up. Not real impressed. Really want to try something else.</li>
            <li> Nice hair product just expensive</li>
            <li> Great service.... Perfect Price.  The Nexxus Phyto Organics Chromolife Colour Locks Conditioner is wonderful and works great on my thin hair.  I will definitely order again. Thank you &#x3D;)</li>
