            <li>I fell on shoulder and required physical therapy, the therapist had me working a pulley system to be able to get my arm above my head.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been sitting in a chair, facing the opposite direction, only using the pulls as far as is safe for my recent surgery but the stretching helps ease the pain</li>
            <li>The over-the-door exercise pulley set is exactly as described and was about half the price of local suppliers, even with shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using my pulley a few times daily to keep my shoulder muscles from becoming stiff and increasing my range of motion.</li>

            <li> Exactly as advertised. This is a must have for anyone with shoulder problems or even to avoid shoulder problems such as rotator cuff problems.</li>
            <li> Helped me get through my physical therapy from rotator cuff repair surgery with flying colors.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0002DMK8K Over Door Exercise Pulley Set - Portable exercise device that helps strengthen upper body.    Easy to assemble and exactly what I need. I fell on shoulder and required physical therapy, the therapist had me working a pulley system to be able to get my arm above my head.

            <li> Works great for my frozen shoulder. I.would recommend this for sure. Its having therapy at home and own your time.</li>
            <li> Not professional grade, but does the trick.  I really like it!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my mother. She has to have a chair to sit to use this and we had to alter it a bit for her disability. But it works very well to help with the flexibility and stretch of her arms. .</li>
            <li> Works fine for returning function to my left arm after nerve surgery and the price was very affordable.&lt;br /&gt;would recommend.</li>

            <li> Works great for shoulder range of motion.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one because the smaller pulley set never shipped and I needed it to do my rehab for my surgery and sholder manipulation at home inbetween PT days.  I like the one with only one pulley better... but this works, not big and cumbersome</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the pulley set was reasonably priced, well constructed, and worked like the one I had used in rehab.</li>
            <li> pulley wheels are plastic -- not metal&lt;br /&gt;easily replaceable from hardware store&lt;br /&gt;bracket and frame well made&lt;br /&gt;okay for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m continually amazed at how quickly Amazon gets my orders to me. The over-the-door exercise pulley set is exactly as described and was about half the price of local suppliers, even with shipping. We use it to enhance range of motion and strengthen shoulder muscles. I passed your name along to our physical therapist for her other clients.   Thanks,</li>
            <li> I had rotator cuff surgery last month &amp; this little gadget has been a God send.  My shoulder tends to become stiff from inactivity which in turn causes a lot of pain so I&#x27;ve been sitting in a chair, facing the opposite direction, only using the pulls as far as is safe for my recent surgery but the stretching helps ease the pain &amp; I&#x27;m gaining my mobility back, weightlessly.  I&#x27;d suggest this to anyone with shoulder problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A recent update&lt;br /&gt;Now about 2 mths out from my shoulder surgery, I&#x27;m doing remarkably well and my doctor was astonished at my post op appt with the progress I&#x27;ve made with my shoulder before even beginning any formal physical therapy. I&#x27;m still using my pulley a few times daily to keep my shoulder muscles from becoming stiff and increasing my range of motion. This is definitely one of the very best investments I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li> This is a really strong,sturdy piece of equipment. Great for the price! I think that it is made of sturdy steel instead of aluminum.</li>
            <li> Great pulley system for the cost.  This can easily be used in a door and is great for rehab after shoulder surgery.</li>
            <li> Worked perfect for my shoulder recovery</li>
