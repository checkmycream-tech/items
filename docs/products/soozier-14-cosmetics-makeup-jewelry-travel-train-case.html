            <li>They loved it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good makeup or jewelry case for the price.</li>
            <li>My daughter-in-law loved this case.  </li>
            <li>I suppose for the money it is a good deal.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice, but trimming fell off the bottom side within a week of receiving it.</li>
            <li>This is perfect and holds so much.</li>
            <li>Daughter is now able to keep all her things in one place.</li>
            <li>besides the fact that my kids use this as a stepping stool in my bathroom, I love it.</li>
            <li>I love all the space and sections.</li>
            <li>I was able to get all my make-up organized and visible.</li>
            <li>I received this product and it was mis aligned and the interior was becoming unglued.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re easy on your things it might do the trick.  </li>
            <li>The trays fold in and out verry smoothly and holds everything she has.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s already not closing smoothly.</li>
            <li>I fit all my makeup into the size box.  </li>
            <li>It does fit all my makeup</li>
            <li>be somewhat careful when moving the parts about and closing the case.&lt;br /&gt;Good price:  pretty good case for the price.</li>
            <li>the size is good but the material is not very good</li>
            <li>Very functional for beads.</li>
            <li>Very spacefull.</li>
            <li>Really neat.</li>
            <li>It is very roomy with lots of&lt;br /&gt;compartments</li>
            <li>Still if nothing spills and its not lugged around too much</li>
            <li>the drawers seem to be little more than cardboard and glued paper.  </li>
            <li>other then that, very much enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit heavier than I expected but overall; I love it.</li>
            <li>like the various pull-out drawers...very convenient and relatively easy to use:  I prefer the case to be a little deeper, but this is a serviceable</li>
            <li>Despite the big overall case it does not hold as much as you would think.</li>
            <li>the only downside was when I first got it, it smelled super weird on the inside.</li>

            <li> However the closures are poorly constructed and there is not tongue to snap into the lock before securing it.  </li>

            <li> Daughter is now able to keep all her things in one place.</li>
            <li> This item was bought as a gift for someone who makes jewelry.  They loved it.  Very functional for beads.</li>
            <li> just what my daughter had be begging for at a verry resionable price. The trays fold in and out verry smoothly and holds everything she has.</li>
            <li> besides the fact that my kids use this as a stepping stool in my bathroom, I love it. it has lots of storage for my make up. the only downside was when I first got it, it smelled super weird on the inside. other then that, very much enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I think this will be durable.  It is plenty wide, but the bottom compartment dividers prevent putting in anything wide or long.</li>
            <li> I was supposed to get it in 13 days, but it got here 2 days after the purchase. Very spacefull. The inside as well. Really neat. Just perfect if youre a make up freak. üòäüòäüòäüòçüôå‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üëåüëåüëç</li>
            <li> Made a great gift for my sister&lt;br /&gt;Has plenty compartments</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good makeup or jewelry case for the price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice, but trimming fell off the bottom side within a week of receiving it.</li>
            <li> I love all the space and sections. However, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t want to close correctly. I&#x27;m worried that it will eventually not close since I just bought it and it&#x27;s already not closing smoothly. It&#x27;s a bit heavier than I expected but overall; I love it.</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law loved this case.  It is very roomy with lots of&lt;br /&gt;compartments for all her make-up and her brushes.</li>
            <li> I needed a train case for cosmetics for work backstage at a ballet.&lt;br /&gt;I like the various pull-out drawers...very convenient and relatively easy to use:  I prefer the case to be a little deeper, but this is a serviceable case.&lt;br /&gt;What I did not like?  I think it&#x27;s a bit flimsy.....be somewhat careful when moving the parts about and closing the case.&lt;br /&gt;Good price:  pretty good case for the price.</li>
            <li> I received this product and it was mis aligned and the interior was becoming unglued. Despite the big overall case it does not hold as much as you would think.</li>
            <li> The exterior looks great after a month of the purchase the glue was coming out. Not of good quality extremely disappointed!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a smaller train case. This is perfect and holds so much. It arrived in time for vacation. It was the perfect accessory. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was able to get all my make-up organized and visible. It holds quite a bit and looks like an accent piece in the bathroom when all closed up.</li>
            <li> the size is good but the material is not very good</li>
            <li> I fit all my makeup into the size box.  I now have everything at hand in one place convenient to my makeup table.  I suppose for the money it is a good deal.  However the closures are poorly constructed and there is not tongue to snap into the lock before securing it.  the drawers seem to be little more than cardboard and glued paper.  Still if nothing spills and its not lugged around too much and you&#x27;re easy on your things it might do the trick.  It does fit all my makeup</li>
