            <li>The best brow powder ever-</li>
            <li>This brow powder is the best.  </li>
            <li>Good price also!</li>
            <li>So glad to find on line I ordered 3!  Came timely!</li>
            <li>The product is good though.</li>
            <li>blends well and good</li>
            <li>very good eye brow powder, color was a bit too light for me.but</li>
            <li>power.i believe color will be great on people with brown or light brown eyebrows</li>
            <li>Gives nice definition without looking like pencil.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cheap and works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>best color for me, hard to find in retail stores, great price too!!!</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>They love it.</li>
            <li>this taupe has more &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; in it, a lighter auburn color.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Much better than a pencil.</li>
            <li>This is easy to apply and it stays on all day and evening.</li>
            <li>Works just fine.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth, and stays on.  </li>
            <li>I got some at a drug store for cheap and couldn&#x27;t find a replacement.  </li>
            <li>After, I use a brow brush to smooth out.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the natural look this powder gives, and the brush is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I have a fair compexion, my hair goes between golden blonde and light red, and this particular color always looks good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found another that works better and looks as natural.</li>
            <li>I really like the idea of the brush on eyebrow powder but as stated in a few of the reviews this taupe is more reddish than it is brown which I was hoping more for the brown.  </li>
            <li>Awesome product I just got the wrong color</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT product for filling in brows subtly.  </li>
            <li>This particular power color is just right for the dual purposes of an eyebrow enhancer and as a contour shadow.</li>
            <li>I use a different brush with a longer handle, but when traveling I&#x27;ve used the one that comes with the powder and it works just fine--- really just a preference.</li>
            <li>Thus is the only item I have been able to find that will complete the task for me at hand.</li>
            <li>MY only complaint - and the only reason I gave the product four stars instead of five, is that the awesome little brush is easy to lose, because there is no compartment in the powder compact to store it in.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised to see how red/auburn colored the taupe</li>
            <li>Sadly - it&#x27;s no longer in any of my local stores!  </li>
            <li>The only problem with it is the color,it is more chestnut than taupe or blond and is too dark for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I have never found anything that looks so natural.</li>
            <li>but it does last long and has a very matte finish to it.</li>

            <li> , that are very thin and light-</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t leave my house without eyebrows, so this product has been proven to withstand heavy exercising and the sweat that comes along with it, long overnight flights, and even the occasional nap.  </li>
            <li> I can share this with and I just have to still use my dark brown pencil</li>
            <li> some til I find my dark brown powder.</li>

            <li> This particular power color is just right for the dual purposes of an eyebrow enhancer and as a contour shadow.</li>
            <li> The only problem with it is the color,it is more chestnut than taupe or blond and is too dark for my eyebrows. But it works well as eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I really like the idea of the brush on eyebrow powder but as stated in a few of the reviews this taupe is more reddish than it is brown which I was hoping more for the brown.  The product is good though. I have a friend or two I can share this with and I just have to still use my dark brown pencil some til I find my dark brown powder.</li>
            <li> I had been using this product for a few years, and then the stores stopped carrying it.  I didn&#x27;t know what to do.  I found it on this site and ordered the 3 pack.  I love it.  It goes on so smooth, and stays on.  Please don&#x27;t ever stop selling this product.</li>
            <li> Thus is the only item I have been able to find that will complete the task for me at hand.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year. I have never found anything that looks so natural. My friends often comment on my brows. I bought this 3 pack to give to 3 of my friends. They love it.</li>
            <li> This is easy to apply and it stays on all day and evening.I will continue to buy the product.thank you.</li>
            <li> The one I had previously was a darker taupe - this taupe has more &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; in it, a lighter auburn color.  It works okay if I mix it with a darker brown.</li>
            <li> The best brow powder ever- I&#x27;ve never found another that works better and looks as natural. I use a different brush with a longer handle, but when traveling I&#x27;ve used the one that comes with the powder and it works just fine--- really just a preference.</li>
            <li> This is a value product which I have used for years.  You cannot beat the value and it stays on your brows all day long.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years and recommend it to all of my friends... gives a softer line than a pencil.</li>
            <li> Works just fine.I like the color and ease of application. I ordered three so that i will always have backup.</li>
            <li> very good eye brow powder, color was a bit too light for me.but blends well and good staying power.i believe color will be great on people with brown or light brown eyebrows</li>
            <li> Love it.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years on my eyebrows, that are very thin and light- almost invisible :(&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t leave my house without eyebrows, so this product has been proven to withstand heavy exercising and the sweat that comes along with it, long overnight flights, and even the occasional nap.  It doesn&#x27;t run, does&#x27;t rub off (even at the dentist&#x27;s chair), and can be applied with ease.</li>
            <li> best color for me, hard to find in retail stores, great price too!!!</li>
            <li> I got some at a drug store for cheap and couldn&#x27;t find a replacement.  This is a GREAT product for filling in brows subtly.  Much better than a pencil.</li>
            <li> This brow powder is the best.  It&#x27;s super cheap and works wonderfully.  Water resistant, but not waterproof.  The color &amp;#34;Taupe&amp;#34; is sort of a medium brown / auburn-ish color.  I have a fair compexion, my hair goes between golden blonde and light red, and this particular color always looks good.  Do yourself a favor though, and buy a proper brow brush.</li>
            <li> I have bought this several times over the years.  I absolutely love the natural look this powder gives, and the brush is fantastic.  MY only complaint - and the only reason I gave the product four stars instead of five, is that the awesome little brush is easy to lose, because there is no compartment in the powder compact to store it in.  I wish they would change this design.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time for my eyebrows to make them look red like my hair is now . . AND to hide my grey between salon appts. Sadly - it&#x27;s no longer in any of my local stores!  So glad to find on line I ordered 3!  Came timely!</li>
            <li> Have to use a lot of the powder for it to actually show.</li>
            <li> Yeah. Package of 3 arrived!</li>
            <li> Gives nice definition without looking like pencil.  I wet my slanted brush a tiny bit then fill in brows.  After, I use a brow brush to smooth out.  This evens out the application and removes any excess.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to see how red/auburn colored the taupe was.  I am very disappointed because the product itself is very good but not what I was looking for in color.  Also, their is no way to store the brush with the container.  I wish Ardell would come out with a non-red/auburn eyebrow powder.</li>
            <li> Awesome product I just got the wrong color but it does last long and has a very matte finish to it. Will be buying again but in the correct color</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this brand everywhere so when I found it in a 3-pack, I jumped to it. Good price also!</li>
