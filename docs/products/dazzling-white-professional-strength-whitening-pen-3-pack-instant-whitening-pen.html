            <li>Much whiter teeth on the first use and even better each time!</li>
            <li>Whitening is not dramatic but you will notice a difference for sure.</li>
            <li>This product came right away!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, better product than I was expecting</li>
            <li>It gives a clearer tone to your teeth, it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>The taste is not bad.</li>
            <li>It is a very good deal for a three pack, usually this is the retail price for just one whitening pen.  </li>
            <li>As my subject line reads, these whitening pens work great for the price.</li>
            <li>It works great, whitens teeth in a few hours and lasts a couple days, then it needs to be reapplied</li>
            <li>Quality good, product as expected</li>
            <li>I went to my dentist to get a partial on the bottom, and a full denture on the top.  </li>
            <li>My dentist asked me to pick a color, and I chose one that was two shades lighter than my real teeth thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t be noticeable--it was!  </li>
            <li>Just paint it on, leave for 10 minutes and you&#x27;ll see a difference within the first use.</li>
            <li>I actually like it better than the ones you leave on all night.</li>
            <li>That was FAST shipping!</li>
            <li>This absolutely works!</li>
            <li>For the money the gel works okay when the pen functions properly.  </li>
            <li>Used consistently it works well.</li>
            <li>I have used a few times and seems to be good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think i saw much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I used this product, and still do, because it really worked.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really whiten my teeth</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much difference after using over and over again....</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery.</li>
            <li>thanks a lot</li>
            <li>i buy this all the time an it really works</li>
            <li>thank you so much for this product .</li>
            <li>This remarkable little whitener not only whitens your teeth, but freshens your breath as well.</li>
            <li>When I used this the very first time I was very surprised to see how much whiter my teeth were after only the first use, and became whiter and whiter every time I used.</li>
            <li>It works as well or better than my previous one.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend getting a whitening tray to prevent ingesting it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a week, twice a day, and so far really have not seen any drastic change to the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li>and you want to give your teeth a quick clear tone, but it&#x27;s temporary and as I said it causes sensibility if used on a daily basis</li>
            <li>After regular use, my teeth starting hurting and becoming sensitive but it does work!</li>
            <li>It arrived way faster than the other products I ordered with Amazon free shipping (some items haven&#x27;t even been shipped</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>If I use it too frequently (more than once daily) it does irritate my lips and cause mild tooth sensitivity, but I only use it daily or less often.</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I have used it and we can see clearly a difference.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really use it religiously though.</li>
            <li>If you want fast results, this is definitely not the thing.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>crazy.this pen is so soft and for the price</li>
            <li>im surprised that it even works on that</li>
            <li>I like this type of whitener because my teeth are so sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping in the near future this will do the trick.</li>
            <li>only used once so far, but already saw a difference.</li>
            <li>but I am wondering if more expensive pen would work better or at least, not leak?</li>
            <li>Of all the &amp;#34;least&amp;#34; expensive products out in the market today, I can honestly say this does work.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the whitening gel is breaking down the plastic or seal material after sitting around while the first one was used?  </li>
            <li>Had to throw away the second pen before it was completely used up and may have to do the same with the third.</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s effectiveness at whitening teeth over a long period of time yet though!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like holding my mouth for minutes in place to let something dry on them.</li>
            <li> But will bump up already white teeth to have a slightly brightened appearance.  </li>
            <li> and I had absolutely no problems with this product.</li>
            <li> I think I will call my dentist and ask for some suggestions of other options.</li>
            <li> The one problem is that it does not fully dry on my teeth like it is supposed to after twenty to thirty seconds.(I don&#x27;t put a heavy coating on my teeth either)I</li>
            <li> i use everyday</li>
            <li> Great.....really works, for s small price</li>
            <li> My teeth are not dazzling.</li>
            <li> They are slightly improved but the products performance was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money!!!</li>
            <li> and it was a little irritating without it but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I think the item is bad every time I put it on with the few times</li>
            <li> its a hassle to put on, ohh and it tastes weird..</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it three stars is that one of the three pens leaked badly.</li>
            <li> terribly leave the gum sore not worth the price of returning very disappointed</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the way they came and the performance.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Teeth are definitely whiter after two weeks of use! Tastes fine and super easy to apply. Great product.</li>
            <li> My teeth are not dazzling. They are slightly improved but the products performance was a disappointment. I think I will call my dentist and ask for some suggestions of other options.</li>
            <li> After regular use, my teeth starting hurting and becoming sensitive but it does work!</li>
            <li> Great for touch ups! This did whiten my teeth!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work and you could buy at the dollar store</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think i saw much of a difference. I didn&#x27;t really use it religiously though. If you want fast results, this is definitely not the thing.</li>
            <li> just great my teeth looking better every day</li>
            <li> Quality good, product as expected</li>
            <li> Now I have Pearly Whites!.. This stuff works wonders</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize you can buy the same thing at the dollar store for a buck. Seems to work somewhat though.</li>
            <li> The whitening pen I was using was discontinued, and I chose this one to try.  It works as well or better than my previous one.  While my teeth will never be that beautiful paper white that I envy, Dazzling White keeps them the best they could possibly be considering my coffee and iced tea consumption.  I use daily in the morning.</li>
            <li> Pens were neatly packaged but were leaking upon opening them. Very disappointed with the way they came and the performance.</li>
            <li> I think the item is bad every time I put it on with the few times I tried it it stings terribly leave the gum sore not worth the price of returning very disappointed</li>
            <li> I went to my dentist to get a partial on the bottom, and a full denture on the top.  My dentist asked me to pick a color, and I chose one that was two shades lighter than my real teeth thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t be noticeable--it was!  I used this product, and still do, because it really worked.  My dentist was impressed, too!  Two shades lighter in one use, and it is so easy to use.  It does need to be used regularly to keep them the shade you want, but it truly works!</li>
            <li> My favorite over the counter whitening product. Better than the strips and just more convenient. Just paint it on, leave for 10 minutes and you&#x27;ll see a difference within the first use.</li>
            <li> It is like many others on the market.  I just don&#x27;t find these very effective at whitening my teeth.  It could be that I don&#x27;t use them every day.  The taste is not bad.</li>
            <li> Help whiten teeth with a quick refresh on teeth while out and about!  Not the wonder working product some claim.  But will bump up already white teeth to have a slightly brightened appearance.  No need to rinse, it dissolves into your teeth.</li>
            <li> When I used this the very first time I was very surprised to see how much whiter my teeth were after only the first use, and became whiter and whiter every time I used. I actually like it better than the ones you leave on all night. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product. I have been forgetting to use this since I got my wisdom teeth out and didn&#x27;t want to hurt my gums more. Even after I have forgotten to use but I will start!. I have used a few times and seems to be good. I did not have petroleum jelly which it says to use optional and it was a little irritating without it but not too bad.Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s effectiveness at whitening teeth over a long period of time yet though! I like that it comes in a pack of three!</li>
            <li> its a hassle to put on, ohh and it tastes weird.. its a no go for me. i dont think it works</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, better product than I was expecting</li>
            <li> These ones are just peroxide gel. They don&#x27;t really whiten my teeth but i can&#x27;t complain. it was cheap. (:</li>
            <li> It gives a clearer tone to your teeth, it&#x27;s true. But it also causes sensibility with constant use. I stopped using it for that reason, it works if you have an important event like a wedding or a date and you want to give your teeth a quick clear tone, but it&#x27;s temporary and as I said it causes sensibility if used on a daily basis</li>
            <li> Not user friendly and a pain in the ***. Didn&#x27;t see much difference after using over and over again....KEEP LOOKING, BETTER PRODUCTS AVAILABLE...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Waste of my money!!!</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery. Great Product!</li>
            <li> Great product and company.</li>

            <li> Did not work well for me.</li>
            <li> Feb.28.2013:Wow! That was FAST shipping! I ordered yesterday with Regular shipping at NO charge and I now have it! So that&#x27;s 4 stars! It arrived way faster than the other products I ordered with Amazon free shipping (some items haven&#x27;t even been shipped yet!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now about to use the product so I will update this review at a later date. It says on the package that it can whiten teeth 4 shades in 1 week, so let&#x27;s see after a week.</li>
            <li> This absolutely works! I have extremely sensitive teeth and I had absolutely no problems with this product. Much whiter teeth on the first use and even better each time!</li>
            <li> Im using twice a day for 10min each time.and my family can see the diference already.i like taking care of my teeth this product is wonderfull.better that crest woithening stip that i bought with almost60bucks from walmart and it hurts a lot like crazy.this pen is so soft and for the price its just waw i got three pen for .80 cents .wth thanks a lot</li>
            <li> For the money the gel works okay when the pen functions properly.  Pen one worked great.  But pens two and three started leaking after a couple of uses.  Perhaps the whitening gel is breaking down the plastic or seal material after sitting around while the first one was used?  Had to throw away the second pen before it was completely used up and may have to do the same with the third.</li>
            <li> As my subject line reads, these whitening pens work great for the price. There are a lot of teeth whitening products on the market, but most are rather costly. You can&#x27;t beat this deal!</li>
            <li> only used once so far, but already saw a difference. great buy!</li>
            <li> Great price, decent product. These are so easy to take in my purse for whenever I might need them. I&#x27;ll buy them whenever they are available.</li>
            <li> Great.....really works, for s small price</li>
            <li> Very good product for touching up your teeth.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  I was looking for an instant teeth whitening tool, and this came up.  It is a wonderful product for a great price.  Who doesn&#x27;t love a deal?  I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> i buy this all the time an it really works i use everyday an its making my teeth whiter every time i use it its like magic i have gingivitis an its almost fully gone im surprised that it even works on that thank you so much for this product .</li>
            <li> Of all the &amp;#34;least&amp;#34; expensive products out in the market today, I can honestly say this does work.  Both my husband and I have used it and we can see clearly a difference.  Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> This product came right away! It works great, whitens teeth in a few hours and lasts a couple days, then it needs to be reapplied</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both used these. I didn&#x27;t like holding my mouth for minutes in place to let something dry on them. Its like painting/white out onto them.</li>
            <li> This product does help to whiten my teeth, somewhat.It is a very good deal for a three pack, usually this is the retail price for just one whitening pen.  The one problem is that it does not fully dry on my teeth like it is supposed to after twenty to thirty seconds.(I don&#x27;t put a heavy coating on my teeth either)I would highly recommend getting a whitening tray to prevent ingesting it.</li>
            <li> Works great for touch up whitening jobs. If I use it too frequently (more than once daily) it does irritate my lips and cause mild tooth sensitivity, but I only use it daily or less often.</li>
            <li> I would like to start out by saying that If your teeth is white this might be the product for you&lt;br /&gt;As for me I havn&#x27;t seen a change of color in my teeth witch is yellow.</li>
            <li> I dont notice a huge effect on whitening.</li>
            <li> I like this type of whitener because my teeth are so sensitive.  Used consistently it works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a coffee drinker--one cup a day. Gel works for a day or two, then needs to be reapplied. Whitening is not dramatic but you will notice a difference for sure. The reason I gave it three stars is that one of the three pens leaked badly. Ok for the money but I am wondering if more expensive pen would work better or at least, not leak?</li>
            <li> This remarkable little whitener not only whitens your teeth, but freshens your breath as well. I carry one in my purse and also have one in my desk. I just love cleaning while teaching my students. Love, Love, Love it.</li>
            <li> Package arrived as promised.  However, the product DOES NOT WORK.  I am not too upset I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work but it would have been a nice surprise.</li>
