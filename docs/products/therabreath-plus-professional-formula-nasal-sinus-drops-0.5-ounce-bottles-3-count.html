            <li>The Nasal-Sinus drops aren&#x27;t effective for me and cause acid reflux / heartburn.</li>
            <li>Finally, it is nice being able to sleep and breathe through my nose.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what I had and these drops were great for that.</li>
            <li>I love my boyfriend dearly and we have been together for 2 years</li>

            <li>It is just okay.</li>
            <li>I was expecting better results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Return and Refund went easily with Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate.</li>
            <li>It is the best I have ever used, and with so much sinus trouble I have tried most all of them.</li>
            <li>Product came quickly and works as advertized.</li>

            <li>I really appreciate this fact.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much from saving me from embarrassment</li>
            <li>Wife used and it worked better than anything she had tried previously.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this no use it with the mouth wash each morning and evening.</li>
            <li>It leaves my nose feeling clean and clear, but as far as breath improvement, I feel fine leaving these drops out of my hygiene routine occasionally and just using the other Therabreath products.</li>
            <li>Feels a bit refreshing at first but only for a few mins.</li>
            <li>Professional Formula Fresh Breath Oral Rinse - Extra Strength...</li>
            <li>I obviously don&#x27;t know if my results were rare or more common, but wanted to share my experience and suggest users be mindful.</li>
            <li>They said the formula is the exact same as the spray was.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several weeks and don&#x27;t notice as much of a difference with this product compared to the Therabreath toothpaste or mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I wanted sinus action, not breath action.</li>
            <li>how recent I just brushed my teeth, with these drops they really work and cut into the odor that is caused by sinus drainage</li>
            <li>To explain the title of my review, this product hasn&#x27;t changed my morning breath, or breath in general at all.</li>
            <li>The drops clear that one spot in the back of my throat</li>
            <li>It works very effectively, the bad breath emanating from my nostrils stopped almost 2 days after using Dr. Katz therabreath plus.</li>
            <li>My wife is the one most impacted by my breath, so I first tried a couple drops in each nostril one morning, the peak time for bad breath.</li>

            <li> He would brush his teeth several times a day with no change, we tried the dry mouth tooth paste and mouth wash with no luck.</li>
            <li> Finally I realized dry mouth may not be the issue</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if these are helpful for breath or not, but they keep my sinuses from being too dry at night, and may reduce snoring.</li>
            <li> Cursed with life-long sinus drainage, I spent years trying to cover up offensive breath with washes, toothpastes, mints and sprays.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my body has changed over the last few years; I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I used these for only a few days and had to stop due to pervasive nose bleeding.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on the off-chance that whatever was causing my sore throats is the same thing that causes other people bad breath, and I guess I was right.</li>
            <li> When I got it, and really read it, I realized I had the wrong product for what I needed.</li>
            <li> complaint is that it does drip a little in the back of throat once you #sniff it in</li>
            <li> slight dripage ( which is temporary )</li>
            <li> Used it a few times.</li>
            <li> and I will probably buy this again in a few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll preface my review by saying I&#x27;ve been suffering from nasal drip and congestion since I broke my nose 7 years ago, however just in the past few months I&#x27;ve been having sore throats every morning, causing me to get maybe 4 hours a sleep per night, tops.</li>
            <li> but he had serious breath issues due to allergies</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for a long while, only thing that has killed the bad breath caused by post nasal drip on my tonsils.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work as well for bad breath and it completely dries the skin over the nostrils and the skin peels.  </li>
            <li> Or some results at least.</li>
            <li> Effects diminished upon late usage.</li>
            <li> Now it just sits at home with all the other products I ordered to try to fight bad breath.</li>
            <li> These drops have changed our lives, after just a few uses his bad breath was gone.</li>
            <li> I also still have infrequent battles with tonsiloliths (a nasty little annoyance nobody should ever have to deal with); so this product failed to do what it advertised.</li>
            <li> I suffered from indoor allergies after moving to the west coast, I tried all kinds of over the counter sinus and allergy products, and even got an expensive air purifier but nothing helped except for these drops!  </li>
            <li> If you have sinusitis or a bad breath problem, this can help both...</li>
            <li> Eliminates bad breath from tonsil stones AND the tonsil stones.</li>
            <li> My sinuses drain all the time, which causes me to have bad breath no matter</li>
            <li> I know I surfer from bad Breath</li>
            <li> My dentist&#x27;s blog recommended these nasal drops for bad breath stemming from post nasal drip.</li>
            <li> Got rid of bad breath caused my sinus drainage almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Therabreath spray for sinus-nasal bad breath.  </li>
            <li> Looks bad.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have any of the nasty drowsy side effects of allergy sprays/pills and they work like a charm.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product came quickly and works as advertized.</li>
            <li> Good stuff!  Its pricey, but with proper brushing, flossing, and rinsing, this works wonders.</li>
            <li> It works well for my post nasal issues.</li>
            <li> If you have sinusitis or a bad breath problem, this can help both... def recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several weeks and don&#x27;t notice as much of a difference with this product compared to the Therabreath toothpaste or mouthwash. It leaves my nose feeling clean and clear, but as far as breath improvement, I feel fine leaving these drops out of my hygiene routine occasionally and just using the other Therabreath products.</li>
            <li> I love my boyfriend dearly and we have been together for 2 years but he had serious breath issues due to allergies and I had to find a solution. He would brush his teeth several times a day with no change, we tried the dry mouth tooth paste and mouth wash with no luck. Finally I realized dry mouth may not be the issue and it may be coming from his sinus passages, so I figured we would give the drops a whirl. These drops have changed our lives, after just a few uses his bad breath was gone. He uses them every morning and is good to go for the day! Thank you Dr.Katz!</li>
            <li> Eliminates bad breath from tonsil stones AND the tonsil stones. Used for several years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obviously effection at first,but it gonna no avail as longer as use.</li>
            <li> My sinuses drain all the time, which causes me to have bad breath no matter how recent I just brushed my teeth, with these drops they really work and cut into the odor that is caused by sinus drainage, I must have this product and I feel so much more confident about my breath when I use this product</li>
            <li> Felt more confident after use. Used to stop bb possibly coming from sinuses. Used after i brushed and rinsed. Sinuses felt fresher. Wish it was cheaper, would buy again.</li>
            <li> I Love I know I surfer from bad Breath so I buy different products, This is Amazing !!!</li>
            <li> It clears my nose better than any prescription drug  I have ever used.  Finally, it is nice being able to sleep and breathe through my nose.</li>
            <li> Used it a few times. It is just okay. I didn&#x27;t notice it helping anything. Still had same issues as before I ordered it. Now it just sits at home with all the other products I ordered to try to fight bad breath. Found out it was my medication, so I stopped taking it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll preface my review by saying I&#x27;ve been suffering from nasal drip and congestion since I broke my nose 7 years ago, however just in the past few months I&#x27;ve been having sore throats every morning, causing me to get maybe 4 hours a sleep per night, tops. After much research I found that the sore throats are caused by nasal drip.    I bought this product on the off-chance that whatever was causing my sore throats is the same thing that causes other people bad breath, and I guess I was right. I&#x27;ve not had a sore throat since the first night I used this product 2 weeks ago.    To explain the title of my review, this product hasn&#x27;t changed my morning breath, or breath in general at all. I also still have infrequent battles with tonsiloliths (a nasty little annoyance nobody should ever have to deal with); so this product failed to do what it advertised. However, in the end, it did what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> I use nose drops before bed to breathe without problems but this product does not work. Even if you use a lot of the product just does not work</li>
            <li> I was expecting better results. Or some results at least. Feels a bit refreshing at first but only for a few mins.</li>
            <li> Works well especially in the mornings for sinus drainage.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product - really worked for our son, when nothing else did!</li>
            <li> I must be one of the \\&quot;lucky\\&quot; ones when it comes to this product. Cursed with life-long sinus drainage, I spent years trying to cover up offensive breath with washes, toothpastes, mints and sprays. My wife is the one most impacted by my breath, so I first tried a couple drops in each nostril one morning, the peak time for bad breath. Within seconds she reported a complete 100% change for the better. Over the years since, this product continues to give me instant results throughout the day. Now both of us use products from Dr. Katz.</li>
            <li> I suffered from indoor allergies after moving to the west coast, I tried all kinds of over the counter sinus and allergy products, and even got an expensive air purifier but nothing helped except for these drops!  They don&#x27;t have any of the nasty drowsy side effects of allergy sprays/pills and they work like a charm.  I can finally breath out both sides of my nose. THANK YOU</li>
            <li> The name of this product was misleading to me. I wanted sinus action, not breath action. When I got it, and really read it, I realized I had the wrong product for what I needed. I don&#x27;t know why the manufacturer emphasizes &amp;#34;Nasal-Sinus&amp;#34; in the name of the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Return and Refund went easily with Amazon. I really appreciate this fact.</li>
            <li> My dentist&#x27;s blog recommended these nasal drops for bad breath stemming from post nasal drip. That&#x27;s exactly what I had and these drops were great for that. The drops clear that one spot in the back of my throat I couldn&#x27;t reach with gargling or with a neti pot. Thus the 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to Dr. Katz&#x27;s claim that this is &amp;#34;great for tonsiloliths,&amp;#34; as I don&#x27;t have tonsil stones.</li>
            <li> I use this before squirting my Flonase (allergy med) in my nostrils - it clears out my nose so that I can actually breathe in the medicine. Love it!</li>
            <li> This seems to work in removing the stentch of post nasal drippage from alergies. My son and I use this product in combination with TheraBreath PLUS Professional Formula Fresh Breath Oral Rinse - Extra Strength...We are both happy with the results.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all.</li>
            <li> I used these for only a few days and had to stop due to pervasive nose bleeding. I obviously don&#x27;t know if my results were rare or more common, but wanted to share my experience and suggest users be mindful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for a long while, only thing that has killed the bad breath caused by post nasal drip on my tonsils.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if these are helpful for breath or not, but they keep my sinuses from being too dry at night, and may reduce snoring.</li>
            <li> Wife used and it worked better than anything she had tried previously. Effects diminished upon late usage.</li>
            <li> This product has helped with post nasal drainage. It is easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate. I believe it has helped my reflux problem as well, as it has probiotics in it. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that it does drip a little in the back of throat once you #sniff it in **slight dripage ( which is temporary )</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference</li>
            <li> I have used this before and I think it works well for my sinuses and I will probably buy this again in a few months.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims. Got rid of bad breath caused my sinus drainage almost immediately. Highly recommend this no use it with the mouth wash each morning and evening.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Therabreath spray for sinus-nasal bad breath.  That worked well and it got discontinued.  This product doesn&#x27;t work as well for bad breath and it completely dries the skin over the nostrils and the skin peels.  Looks bad.  Also the skin sometimes turns red in the nostril area.  I emailed Therabreath and they replied, but without any good suggestions.  They said the formula is the exact same as the spray was.  Perhaps my body has changed over the last few years; I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> It works very effectively, the bad breath emanating from my nostrils stopped almost 2 days after using Dr. Katz therabreath plus. Thanks so much from saving me from embarrassment</li>
            <li> It is the best I have ever used, and with so much sinus trouble I have tried most all of them.</li>
            <li> The Nasal-Sinus drops aren&#x27;t effective for me and cause acid reflux / heartburn.</li>
    </ol>
