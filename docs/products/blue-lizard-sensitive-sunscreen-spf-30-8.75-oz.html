            <li>Very effective sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It is also very effective without making you look like a ghost, as some products with zinc can do and it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The latest and greatest formula is paraben-free, chemical-free, and fragrance-free.</li>
            <li>We have so many skin allergies and issues and this product has been great for the kids and ourselves!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, but won&#x27;t do you a lick of good if you&#x27;re putting it on your kids before they get in a pool.</li>
            <li>That said, I have tried many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; mineral sunscreens in my quest to find the best.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best and we&#x27;ve tried many.</li>

            <li>This is probably the best, most effective sunscreen on the market.  </li>
            <li>I feel good about putting it on my children and myself.</li>
            <li>good stuff, but</li>
            <li>My fair skinned husband didn&#x27;t burn once while in Hawaii.</li>
            <li>Sun exposure &#x3D; good for you.</li>
            <li>Being redheaded and fair complected</li>
            <li>I needed something good.</li>
            <li>This gives you a good guage on whether to seek shade for a bit the brighter the bottle turns.</li>
            <li>Good upf.</li>
            <li>I have to use good sun block for the prevention of skin cancer.</li>
            <li>Also does a good job protecting against windburn.</li>
            <li>We are all fair skinned and never come away from a beach vacation without a burn, after using this product all that has changed.</li>

            <li>This stuff is really good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good way of reminding: &amp;#34;the sun is out!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>She used it and loved it.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it for the fairest of fair skin types.</li>
            <li>Switched to Badger after reading good things about them.  </li>
            <li>My kids felt good</li>
            <li>Believe all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>This stuff works and I&#x27;m as fair skinned as can be.</li>
            <li>It was originally recommended by my dermatologist as the best sunscreen</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and burn easily.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, and I like that it&#x27;s easy to see where you&#x27;re applying it, and it rubs in well.  </li>
            <li>I burn so easy since I am very fair skinned.  </li>

            <li>And we love it!  </li>
            <li>and it prevented sunburn after many hours (and reapplications as stated on bottle)!</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and runs in great.  </li>
            <li>It was amazing when it was cloudy yet</li>

            <li>love the product and shipping was good for this item too</li>

            <li>Best of all though it really does work.</li>
            <li>This sunblock is the best that I&#x27;ve found for my fair &amp; sensitive skinned boys.</li>

            <li>Perfect for my sensitive skin and purfume sensitivity!</li>
            <li>Very water resistant, no allergy issues, and very good sun protection.  </li>
            <li>Its ingredients are rated well, and so far it seems to do a perfect job of keeping sunburns away.</li>
            <li>Even as sensitive as our grandson&#x27;s skin is, there was no reaction to this lotion which provided excellent protection!</li>
            <li>It kind of just sits on top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done a lot of research and tried many sunscreens including Babyganics, Honest Co., California Baby, Badger...</li>
            <li>and it honestly works better then</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!</li>

            <li>my kids love how it changes color in the sun (the bottle)</li>
            <li>Toddler doesn&#x27;t like it, but she doesn&#x27;t like anything that requires her to be still for more than a millisecond.</li>
            <li>This one finally fit the bill!  </li>
            <li>With sunscreens we have two more choices.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still important to wear sunscreen on cloudy days!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It does turn your skin a bit white but it is awesome!</li>
            <li>I love the outdoors</li>
            <li>No nasty chemicals!</li>
            <li>I bought five different kinds of suncreen to find the best on the market without retinyl palmitate.</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen...</li>
            <li>Doctor says this brand is better than anything put out by US companies.  </li>
            <li>front to start and still have plenty of each of the ingredients to make loads more.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The Face is much better.</li>
            <li>But we were in the Bahamas for the week in June, spending most of the time in the water and at the beach and never got burned.</li>
            <li>I researched a ton on EWG&#x27;s 2015 Guide to Sunscreens website and on Amazon poring through various reviews to purchase the best sunblock.</li>
            <li>Glad I tested this product out at home before using it in the Caribbean.</li>
            <li>No parabens, no nasty harmful chemicals and no smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell like sun screen</li>
            <li>once you try it and love it, get the gallon jug--way cheaper per gallon.</li>
            <li>Interesting coincidence.</li>
            <li>and it feels like you are not wearing sunscreen unlike most feel greasy and makes you want to wash your hands after apply.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>for the longest time, I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena&#x27;s beach defense sunscreen Until I read the EWG report, and then I fell in love with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Excellent sun protection for red headed toddler in Texas!  </li>
            <li>We used this on our recent trip to Hawaii, and it worked great!</li>
            <li>Most of them either reacted with my skin by stinging my face or not preventing sunburn.</li>
            <li>I actually use this every day living in Florida and is the best stuff ever!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t shake the heated bottle before you pop the top, it guarantees spewage.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>family is pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>My mom will also be ordering and I will be ordering more.  </li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen - such great quality!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t mind and it is so much better than an aerosol can.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it&#x27;s expiration date is</li>
            <li>I know how important it is to prevent them from BIRTH!  </li>
            <li>and I will be even happier :)</li>
            <li>more could you want?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more concerned with getting a sunscreen on my kids that I know doesn&#x27;t give them a rash</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>(that seems to be my kids&#x27; favorite part).</li>
            <li>ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions.</li>
            <li>The more zinc, the more protection</li>
            <li>but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that I purchase and add to VCO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue</li>
            <li>The more zinc, the more protection</li>
            <li>but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that I purchase and add to VCO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue</li>
            <li>Very happy with product, ordered second one to keep at home.</li>

            <li>I love this sunscreen, and so do my kids.</li>
            <li>so glad he did.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a couple years now and it seems to do a good job of being natural for the most part while still providing good sun protection.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Sure it can look pasty, but it rubs in nicely (and my skin happens to be very fair, so it&#x27;s not much of a problem anyway).</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, very smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does take a while to get it rubbed in, but it is so worth it!!</li>
            <li>Now more than ever it is important to make sure that she never has a sunburn.  </li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and generally will go to great lengths to avoid using sunblock, because it often stings the skin, and needs frequent re-application.  </li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned, and suffered from sunburns my entire childhood.  </li>
            <li>Great protection for our son that has Eczema and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This stuff is great for sensitive skin as well and will not clog your pores.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m quite happy with this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Great sunblock for the kids&#x27; sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Great sunscreen for sensitive skin as it does not burn or cause itchy skin.</li>
            <li>This seller offered a good price and shipping was fast.</li>

            <li>The lotion went on easily and no smell.</li>

            <li>This is absolutely THE best sunscreen for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, but takes a bit of rubbing to disappears.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and does not leave a greasy film.</li>
            <li>/&gt;arrived very quickly and wrapped up well</li>
            <li>For YEARS I have searched for an eco-friendly sunscreen that 1) works, 2) spreads on easily and evenly, 3)</li>
            <li>and I burn easily, this kept me from burning.</li>
            <li>Make sure you clean your skin because it does leave a residue.</li>
            <li>This is fairly easy to rub in and worked well for us on the beach and pool but you must reapply often.</li>
            <li>Worked flawlessly in strong tropical sun.</li>
            <li>Having a child with extremely sensitive skin (and food allergies), this sunscreen is amazing!</li>
            <li>For skin tones that may burn at first and then tan the product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is the best made, hand down.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best sunscreen for kids and adults.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, works very well, and is a safe product for my family!</li>
            <li>I assumed because it has zinc oxide, it would be fine for pool/beach time.  </li>
            <li>Finally a good natural sunscreen!</li>
            <li>The bottle turns blue when exposed to UV light - so you have a great indicator reminding you the rays are out even when it&#x27;s cloudy.</li>
            <li>Two huge thumbs up from me and my family.</li>
            <li>One drop does a huge body area</li>
            <li>I feel liked I&#x27;ve been lied to my whole</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It gives life and light to our world.</li>
            <li>I have a boy in my care that has a rare form of albinoism and I re-apply every 45 minutes just to be safe.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic  sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This sunBLOCK is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It spreads smoothly.</li>
            <li>It is not water proof but great for outside play.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product everyday this summer - and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Fantastic sunscreen</li>
            <li>Let alone the product works great, takes a tad longer rubbing in because of white tint, but that eventually goes away.</li>
            <li>Easy to use andS clean.  </li>
            <li>Silky and smooth,</li>
            <li>sun burn free.</li>
            <li>Truly fragrance free</li>
            <li>It is so effective and the whole family, from my toddler to the adults, can use the same sunscreen knowing its safe and the most effective sunscreen I&#x27;ve found on the market.</li>
            <li>This stuff is good no allergic reaction so far.  </li>
            <li>skin has stayed fair and healthy in a Southern California climate with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>My 12 year old is extremely fair and always burns, never tans.</li>
            <li>Now granted I don&#x27;t recommend you do this experiment yourself - but having been the reluctant guinea pig, I can truly attest that it is ok for &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27;!!!  :)</li>
            <li>Blue Lizard is light and not greasy, has a very light but pleasant scent (which disappears quickly).  </li>
            <li>I use this mainly on my face and it gives it a nice glow under makeup.  </li>
            <li>I am VERY faired skin and burn very easy.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite sunscreen!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen so far this spring/summer, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>It is not lightweight or suitable for use on faces, but a real pro for the body.</li>
            <li>works very well for sensitive skin, good for children, I saw this being sold at my Dermatologist&#x27;s office for quite a bit more.</li>
            <li>But blue lizard is more potent so I will take looking chalky!</li>
            <li>THE HIGHER THE ZINC, THE MORE PROTECTION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc</li>
            <li>This stuff works great and for a long time!  </li>
            <li>The need to reapply is not as often as most sunscreens, mainly face and shoulders where it gets rubbed off easily.</li>
            <li>excellent broad spectrum physical barrier sunscreen free of chemicals</li>
            <li>This is a great product for kids and free from all the junk in other children&#x27;s sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Good product, we don&#x27;t get itchy skin like most other sun screens.</li>
            <li>How many stories have you heard where someone gets burned the first day of a fun beach vacation.</li>
            <li>Even a winter day can be bright enough for sunscreen!</li>
            <li>sunscreen is effective for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no scientist, but I hear these are good ingredients to have for ultimate protection.</li>
            <li>and she recommended getting whichever one was cheaper at the time because they are both equally good and equally sensitive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had never heard of the brand before that, but if it&#x27;s good enough for a skin cancer specialist at Hopkins, it&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li>I have been plagued with skin cancer for a number of years now and was looking for a good physical sunscreen that was affordable.  </li>
            <li>Love this product &amp; highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>Love that zinc oxide that is transparent and very recommended by our dermatogist.</li>
            <li>Those who mind having a chalky zombie-esque complexion may take issue with how Blue Lizzard applies, while those who are simply seeking really good sun protection, should be pretty darn happy.</li>
            <li>Rub it in good if you don&#x27;t want a white cast, but I happen to like that look.</li>
            <li>I have eczema prone sensitive skinned children who get rashes from their own sweat, but they can use this without any irritation.</li>
            <li>It provides full coverage.</li>
            <li>I used this sunscreen on a recent trip to Italy and I loved it.</li>
            <li>I live in the southwest where it is very sunny and have quite fair skin.</li>
            <li>A good organic 3oz 18% zinc mix should not cost more than $13 and for less when on sale.</li>
            <li>A good organic 3oz 18% zinc mix should not cost more than $13 and for less when on sale.</li>
            <li>A good organic 3oz 18% zinc mix should not cost more than $13 and for less when on sale.</li>
            <li>First batch was super easy and about a $30 up</li>
            <li>This product came out tops during my research and I was excited when it also absorbed well into the skin without looking like Casper the Ghost.</li>
            <li>My two kids ages 5 and 6 have very fair sensitive skin, and this sunscreen is only one have found that doesn&#x27;t burn on contact.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for serious sun areas, like Florida and Hawaii</li>
            <li>Works very well and seems to be good for their sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It spreads evenly and quickly.</li>
            <li>It comes out of the bottle quickly, but I like that.  </li>
            <li>Again, San Francisco &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; is mild.</li>
            <li>If I leave the bottle in my swim bag (under the sun) for more than 10 minutes, when I pop the top to open the bottle the sunscreen &amp;#34;explodes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Great product, the kids really like how the bottle turns blue.</li>
            <li>Blue Lizard, when applied properly and according to the package recommendations, is the best sunscreen I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>, it sometimes makes your skin (or clothes) more white than most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>The very first time the kids</li>
            <li>no unpleasant odors</li>
            <li>Great product, small {but important} flaw.</li>
            <li>I have a slight allergy to the sun and even at 30 this does a great job of protecting me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a long of different sunscreens through the years and this is the best.  </li>
            <li>plus the bottle that changes color in the sun is way super fun.</li>
            <li>Hot!</li>
            <li>Will absolutely buy again!!</li>
            <li>and I guess it washes away more easily than Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li>A little sidelight - my kids think the UV color changing bottle is great</li>
            <li>My husband has very fair skin, and I am very sensitive to other sunscreen lotions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used quite a few of these type of sunblocks and this one works great.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and the white color fades after a minute.</li>
            <li>Many reviewers said they used this on beach vacations, but those reviews are old.</li>
            <li>I rarely use lotion on my body.</li>
            <li>It is worth it.  </li>
            <li>a product worth</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s well worth the money in my opinion based on one thing</li>
            <li>I am allergic to almost all over-the-counter sun screen products and many of the products supposedly designed for sensitive skins.  </li>
            <li>I trust it completely, and it&#x27;s now paraben free!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricy but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>and though you have to rub the blue lizard in pretty good I honestly think it protects better then any of my sunscreens used in the past.  </li>
            <li>I love that this is all natural.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and many products</li>
            <li>Bottle is fun too.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite natural suncreens.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>And I was so surprised and truly relieved that when the product said &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; it really was &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;!!!!  </li>
            <li>Not thick &amp; sticky, easily applied.</li>
            <li>It absorbs pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>After tons of research on the EWG and trying numerous brands, we have found the perfect blend of &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; (high ratings on the EWG website) and usability (rubs in well and does not stay white).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works best if you apply it to dry skin, let it dry before going out in the sun, reapply as needed.</li>
            <li>the good news is that the rest of our family did not burn and the product worked extremely well.</li>
            <li>Right ingredients according to my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t squeeze the bottle and the amount will be right.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it would be all right if you just wanted to lounge by the pool with a mister cooling you off...but not for any strenuous exercise.</li>
            <li>Very easy to put on compared to others of the same type.</li>
            <li>This is the only one that applies easily and protects well, while also not being filled with harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, soaks in quickly and does not irritate her sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>After searching high and low for a good sunscreen with a low EWG.org/skindeep safety rating and safe ingredients, I settled on this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I only just recently learned that studies say chemical sunscreens get into your bloodstream, which isn&#x27;t great for kids, pregnant women, and nursing mothers (or anyone really).</li>
            <li>Blue Lizzard Australian Sunscreen is the most effective sunscreen I have ever used with a very high saftey level.</li>
            <li>Does not take very much to cover.</li>
            <li>It does take a little effort to get it rubbed in good</li>
            <li>We have used this for a month now and while I thought it was great at first, but we found out the hard way that it is not waterproof.  </li>
            <li>Blue Lizard was listed on the safe side of the chart.</li>
            <li>Blue Lizard is ranked as one of the top sunscreens by the Environmental Working Group (EWG).</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s a top sunscreen, color me interested (or blue).</li>
            <li>No weird smell.</li>
            <li>I love Blue Lizard sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>We love Blue Lizard!</li>
            <li>This is my first summer trying this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>and I purchased the first bottle at their office.</li>
            <li>Used this for the first time during our trip to Jamaica.</li>
            <li>But if you prefer no chemicals, but are willing to use them on occasion (e.g., all day at the beach) then you may want to try the sport version as well.r</li>
            <li>But if you prefer no chemicals, but are willing to use them on occasion (e.g., all day at the beach) then you may want to try the sport version as well.</li>
            <li>One bottle for the whole family!</li>
            <li>I also love that the bottle turns blue in UV Rays.</li>
            <li>First lets get the EWG rating out of the way.</li>
            <li>well worth it as it appears to work very well.</li>
            <li>Kind of an iridescent grey, no matter how much I rubbed it in.</li>
            <li>Finally, environmental working group (ewg.org) gives it a safe rating.</li>
            <li>to work (wish it was higher SPF; I like to put it on my kids before school and not worry about their teachers forgetting to reapply).&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad we went with Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a safe alternative to chemical sunscreens, I can&#x27;t recommend BL enough.</li>
            <li>It is the first sunscreen that I can use on my face and it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Love that the bottle turns blue when exposed to uv Rays.</li>
            <li>I have dermatitis that &amp;#34;blooms&amp;#34; from many different products.  </li>
            <li>Currently this is my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Product also stays on pretty well in pools, lakes, etc.</li>
            <li>We have always made sure our kids were properly protected when going out in the sun.  </li>
            <li>I love Blue Lizard sunscreen because it&#x27;s not greasy, there are no chemicals, and it works!&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>is not sturdy and not too hot to hold.</li>
            <li>daughter also loves that the bottle turns blue in the sun :)</li>
            <li>Has a low ZO, not 30+ SPF at all, has too many ingredients, non are organic, non are certified, no percentage of ingredient...</li>
            <li>You do have to rub a bit more to get it to disappear, but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li>The bottle lasted us about a year, which is good because we use it nearly everyday in the summer and as needed the rest of year.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fair skinned, freckled, non-tanning redhead and this is what I use (I use the face type everyday for my face).</li>
            <li>Works good, not too heavy and rubs in well (for a zinc based product)</li>
            <li>as most spf does... Really rub in before you go out into the sun and use a small amount and spread evenly so it can absord quickly!!</li>
            <li>I had never heard of Blue Lizard but ordered it after reading so many positive reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It goes on more easily than other sunscreens with high zinc &amp; titanium percentage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way more waterproof than most competitors and seems to last forever, I never burn as long as I remember to use it.  </li>
            <li>A friend told me the baby one in the pink bottle avoids this issue, but I&#x27;m happy enough with this product.</li>
            <li>Hard to apply but the best product out there when it comes to protecting and no bad chemicals as the other stuff.</li>
            <li>Besides that, you can watch the bottle turn blue in the sun...very cool!</li>
            <li>My skin usually can&#x27;t handle daily sunscreen usage, but this guy is so mild and gentle that my skin is holding up great.</li>
            <li>My only gripe is the lotion comes out very quickly...</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t leave the skin white and the bottle changes color when you&#x27;re in the sun.</li>
            <li>It works, it&#x27;s easy to apply (goes on white, but fades after a while), and it&#x27;s not too oily.</li>
            <li>After getting to our vacation destination, I noticed in fine print on the bottle that it says under &amp;#34;Directions&amp;#34; on its back label:  &amp;#34;Use a water resistant sunscreen if swimming or sweating.&amp;#34; THIS ISN&#x27;T WATER RESISTANT!  </li>
            <li>With constant reapplication it works fine.  </li>
            <li>Zinc is one of the best things for sunscreen because instead blocking and absorbing rays like typical sunscreen, zinc actually reflects the rays back away from the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It even works on a cloudy day, which surprised my little ones - a good reminder that they need to wear sunscreen even when they can&#x27;t see the sun.</li>
            <li>comes in a large enough volume that is useful to use with two kids who are outside most of the day all summer, 4)</li>
            <li>Where has this been my whole life?</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.lowest price on the planet.</li>
            <li>The issue comes when we overindulge and get too much of it.</li>
            <li>After ruining a bunch of white shirts with the cheap spray lotions for my kids, I switched to this.  </li>
            <li>It goes on really well.</li>
            <li>Even my husband commented that is went on really well compared to the Badger.</li>
            <li>It stays on very well and lasts.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>bottle turns blue in sunlight to remind you your in uv light</li>
            <li>And it was very peculiar b/c</li>
            <li>He actually wants to use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This stuff really keeps the sun off</li>
            <li>Works very well to block the sun without adding harmful cancer causing chemicals to your day.</li>
            <li>someone else wants it.</li>
            <li>It stays on very well.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this seller!</li>
            <li>Works very well and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>You should err on the side of putting on too much otherwise you may get burnt.</li>
            <li>This worked really well.  </li>
            <li>Works really well but takes some effort to rub in.  </li>
            <li>Item as described Fast Shipping  A+++++</li>
            <li>This is really a 6 star sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
            <li>Very Water Resistant&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very Water Resistant&lt;br</li>
            <li>This sunscreen work really well</li>
            <li>and then gently wipe the excess off.</li>
            <li>but the product itself once on works really well...</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>love blue lizard;  delivery was seamless</li>
            <li>Just remember that you probably won&#x27;t be able to get rid of the white sheen completely.</li>
            <li>How did it go wrong with so many nice reviews all over the internet?</li>
            <li>This is one of few I can use and it is effective.  </li>
            <li>Gives good protection for kids and doesn&#x27;t have any of those harsh chemicals and works well for my sensitive skin kids.</li>
            <li>Everything else I have tried, they will complain that it burns on contact with the most sensitive areas like their cheeks and neck,except blue lizard.  </li>
            <li>Goes on thick, especially with hair (good luck getting it to go on smooth of you</li>
            <li>This sunscreen provides good coverage, but it&#x27;s so thick</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and stays on a LONG time.</li>
            <li>We normally use thinkbaby/thinksport for our child, but have been using this for ourselves and this seems easier to put on!</li>
            <li>Besides, the blue bottle is fun!</li>
            <li>Better than any other sunscreen I have used.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, I get better protection than from any other sunscreent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many other lotions and have paid a ton of money for them.</li>
            <li>A bonus is that if one rubs it in a bit more than your usual petrol based block it doesn&#x27;t make you look pasty white like a lot of zinc bases healthy blocks.</li>
            <li>I have used many other sunscreens and he would still burn.</li>
            <li>Really cool how the bottle becomes blue when UV light is present.  </li>
            <li>Ignore old reviews you come across saying otherwise because the new formula is safe and Blue Lizard has made sensitivity a priority.</li>
            <li>The lotion goes on nice, does not feel thick and sticky, does not make me feel hot.</li>
            <li>Blue Lizard&#x27;s ingredients vary so much from their Face mix to the Original mix to the Baby mix since they offer more additives, less zinc with noticeable price fluctuation.</li>
            <li>Blue Lizard&#x27;s ingredients vary so much from their Face mix to the Original mix to the Baby mix since they offer more additives, less zinc with noticeable price fluctuation.</li>

            <li>It does not stain clothes, is very effective because we have yet to get sunburns, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>For that reason, when I purchase a sunscreen mix, I need the same formula as I use when I make my own organic sunscreen mix since it only requires few ingredients but for more protection like my nose, I bump the zinc.</li>

            <li>It went on smoothly and dried fairly quickly for a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>After much research, I choose this sunscreen based on many factors including: EWG&#x27;s rating, previous consumer&#x27;s reviews, price, and ease of purchase.</li>
            <li>Lower your price and make it more affordable to the average folk</li>
            <li>It is a white bottle with a blue lid and blue writing (sound familiar!).  </li>
            <li>My sensitive skin does fine with this sunscreen, but it gives a ghoulish look with the white cast.</li>
            <li>I love that this sunscreen has less chemicals.</li>
            <li>Without sunscreen I&#x27;d be burned after 15 minutes in the sun, but applying Blue Lizard to my face and body just once will have me safely protected from the sun for the entire day.</li>
            <li>I found this to work great but be thick enough</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is a great sunscreen, very water resistant (which does make it difficult to wash off), feels a bit tacky when it is on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that the bottle turns blue when UV is present.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t mess up my nail polish like most sunscreens do</li>
            <li>At our high altitude where we have a lot sunny days, it is a necessity.</li>
            <li>This brand came highly recommended by my children&#x27;s pediatrician.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I found this lotion through it&#x27;s high ranking on EWG&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my child to take with her to high elevation in Arizona.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>We have tried everything and this highly rated sunscreen protects us from the sun through all our beach activities.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it  contains zinc oxide and is very skin sensitive.</li>
            <li>Works great not too expensive.</li>
            <li>You must blend in the sunblock well into your skin as not to leave any white streaks but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Just back from a tour of Utah&#x27;s national parks and monuments - hot and very sunny</li>
            <li>Normal drugstore sunscreens caused rashes and spots on her face and body.</li>
            <li>Used the entire bottle during the summer and am very pleased with the performance during my exposure to the sun everyday.</li>
            <li>Pretty good, but expensive sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Be sure to apply it to your skin when it&#x27;s dry, as stated on the back of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Because it is a mineral sunscreen it does leave a white film on the skin and makes you look a bit ghost like, but the product is effective, particularly if you use a fairly heavy layer.  </li>
            <li>You only need a tiny amount and it covers really well and doesn&#x27;t leave a white reside as most mineral sunscreens do.</li>
            <li>The inactive ingredients are extensive in Blue Lizard, check their Internet site but more importantly compare the cost of any sunscreen to better brands with hardly any ingredients except few organic and a very high amount of zinc like 18% zinc not 5% or 10% zinc.</li>

            <li>Before, DD was coming home from summer swim camp with new freckles every day,  but now I apply this in the morning, and the freckles have stopped.</li>
            <li>I live in the Bay Area, so it&#x27;s not a tropical sun.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Am looking for a new titanium dioxide/zinc oxide sunscreen to try.</li>
            <li>It is easy to rub in (or easier than other natural sunscreens we&#x27;ve tried).  </li>
            <li>but it comes out of the container too fast, wasting product and making a mess; maybe that is to make sure you use enough once you wipe it off the floor.</li>
            <li>I was expecting the skin on that very sensitive part of my body to start to sting or burn....</li>
            <li>My daughter has eczema and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My toddler daughter has very sensitive skin and her dermatologist recommended it.</li>
            <li>Our girls have very sensitive skin and a friend recommended this.</li>
            <li>I think its definitely worth the money and so much better than all the other junk we were using previously</li>
            <li>My son actually called me a yeti the first time I used this sunscreen since I did look like a snow monster.</li>
            <li>bought this to compare with other &#x27;safe&#x27; rated sunscreens and this one doesn&#x27;t leave all the white zinc all over and is not sticky or tacky!</li>
            <li>Goes on white when first applied but eventually this clears up as it is smoothed on.</li>
            <li>It goes on thick and will leave a white sheen if you don&#x27;t rub it in good, but my two, ages 12 &amp; 9, had no trouble applying it and getting it rubbed in.  </li>
            <li>Easy on skin, no smell, not greasy, no or little harmful chemicals for skin and environment.</li>
            <li>ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is our new sunscreen going forward for our littlest ones (2 years old) to us as parents.  </li>
            <li>Our baby has very sensitive skin, and has eczema flare ups at near nothing.</li>
            <li>importantly, my very very sensitive skin 2 year old has NO problems with it at all.  </li>
            <li>My daughter uses the sensitive formula because she has very sensitive</li>
            <li>I do this out of the goodness of my heart so other people who like to research products before they buy have a true understanding of how a product works.th not a lot of effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do this out of the goodness of my heart so other people who like to research products before they buy have a true understanding of how a product works.</li>
            <li>and my skin was clear with not a lot of effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the Blue Lizard sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If anything, my skin feels soft.</li>
            <li>The bottle turning blue is a really neat feature that reminds you</li>
            <li>And I would like to attest to the fact that it is really &#x27;sensitive&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Difference between &amp;#34;Baby&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34;: I called the company to find out whether I should get the &amp;#34;baby or sensitive&amp;#34; formula for my 2 year old twins</li>
            <li>My kids are now almost 5 years old and we are still using this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t want to avoid the sun completely.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This lotion was recommended by the Dr for our 8 month old grandson when we went to the Caribbean.</li>
            <li>We were playing in the sprinkler in the backyard and this must have completely washed off.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m african-american and have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Is this old stock?</li>
            <li>I wore it while on a early morning hike in July</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin and had no breakouts or irritation on my face or body using this.</li>
            <li>I can even use this on my face which is particularly sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Some of their lines are water resistant but the sensitive version eschews the chemical that adds the resistance.  </li>
            <li>then you can add another dab or two to protect the sensitive area from sun exposure.</li>
            <li>I use it on myself &amp; on my 15 month old daughtet</li>
            <li>Compared to most sunscreens, this one has the least amount of toxins in it.</li>
            <li>A blue eyed Irish girl doesn&#x27;t have a chance in the tropics in June, but Blue Lizard kept me sunburn free.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my 3 year old as well</li>
            <li>We use the sensitive version.</li>
            <li>Bottle changes color in the sun like an old GI</li>
            <li>Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts.</li>
            <li>Lizard Sensitive</li>
            <li>Lizard Sensitive</li>
            <li>I am extremely sensitive both to the sun and to skin care products and Blue Lizard Sensitive works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>Once we were having so much fun outside, I forgot, and realized over an hour later.  </li>
            <li>You get a big bottle, but you waste more than needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also love how this product feels on my skin - it&#x27;s thick and moisturizing, takes some rubbing to get it to blend in.</li>
            <li>how quickly it changes color in full sun and even inside a car behind the UV-coated glass.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it is quite thick and takes a while to rub in, but other than that, it is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a light skinned African american and when I used this I looked really strange.  </li>
            <li>Other than those rare instances, I have not had a sunburn since I started using this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s white and goes on white, BUT, with a little extra effort, it will disappear into your skin nicely so you won&#x27;t look like a vaudeville comedian from the &#x27;30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Anyway about the product, I have been using Blue Lizard for a long time and like it very much and it suits my child sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Great for sun protection but very difficult to rub into your skin.</li>
            <li>(forgive my spelling but it is just as hard to say) and again I only bought my first one at the spa and all future bottle bought on Amazon with fabulous spelling and Amazon Prime</li>
            <li>It is not super greasy like most other brands I tried.</li>
            <li>The ingredient list is not perfectly pure, but I&#x27;m okay with a little compromise.</li>
            <li>I tried some of the Blue Lizard sunscreens and this was my least favorite.  </li>
            <li>It is the only thing I use on my 4 yr old with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Easily applied (not as thick as some zinc screens).</li>
            <li>my dermatologist recommended it for its broad protection.  </li>
            <li>It is more expensive than other brands, but so worth it!  </li>
            <li>But the major downside for me was the itching.  </li>
            <li>I like the idea of using zinc oxide instead of the other chemicals for a sunscreen, but unfortunately it is not overly water or sweat proof (the bottle even states so), which limits its use.  </li>
            <li>There are no harmful chemicals in it, as there are with major brands like Coppertone, Neutrogena, Banana Boat, Trader Joe&#x27;s, etc.</li>
            <li>Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Protection</li>
            <li>Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Protection&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>/&gt;It IS more expensive, and it does make your skin white, but I see this as a positive</li>
            <li>My dermatologist highly recommends the Blue Lizard sunscreen products and I have used them for several years now.  </li>
            <li>To be clear, it will take a lot of work to get this rubbed in, and even then you will have a white sheen to you.</li>
            <li>Goes on white but then turns clear after a bit.  </li>
            <li>Goes on white, so you can see where it has been applied, and dries clear.  </li>
            <li>This is only product I can use because of sensitive skin problems.</li>
            <li>So if you are anti-chemical and want only natural ingredients, stick with the baby/sensitive versions.  </li>
            <li>So if you are anti-chemical and want only natural ingredients, stick with the baby/sensitive versions.  </li>
            <li>Blue Lizard Sensitive Skin has won out in the end.</li>
            <li>Blue lizard SPF 30 sensitive has a rating of 1.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t completely rub in like a spray on sunscreen or regular lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently using it on myself (sensitive skin/ rosecea) and</li>
            <li>but apparently  it washed off in the water soon after application.  </li>
            <li>Bottle seems to last all summer for our 2 year old.</li>
            <li>Especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Did not provide as much protection as I expected.</li>
            <li>It is very white and takes effort to rub completely in, but that helps identify missed areas so</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the easiest by half stuff to apply nearly akin to pure zinc oxide it takes a lot of rubbing to get it</li>
            <li>Now granted, I wiped it off as quickly as I could - but the sunscreen is water-resistent, so it is hard to really completely remove it.  </li>
            <li>I live in Mexico and use Blue Lizard regularly.</li>
            <li>Used Blue Lizard Sensitive in FL for long beach days (yes very frequently reapplied for reasons - see below) for our kids</li>
            <li>My skin is dry to combo, and loves the moisturizing quality of this sunscreen, BUT I think this product could potentially be a bit much if you have oily skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is slightly greasy at first</li>
            <li>Got sunburned the first time because we didn&#x27;t reapply every half an hour.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen rubs in so much easier than other zinc oxide creams.</li>
            <li>Lasts much longer than the other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>What the other reviewers don&#x27;t say is that this stuff is really greasy.  </li>
            <li>Once winter is over it doesn&#x27;t take long for my sensitive skin to get burned!</li>
            <li>damaging sun rays with our Facial Blue Lizard and normal Blue Lizard for our arms and legs.</li>
            <li>It is definitely thick and takes some work to spread, but it is worth it to keep out those UV&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>This is worth the money as it doesn&#x27;t have all the bad chemicals that most sunscreen has but, even if you don&#x27;t care about that, it works so well.</li>
            <li>But, for regular daily use, I have to use something clear that wears well under make up.</li>
            <li>and I would definitely order it again and recommend this product for anyone going on vacation with very white sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you put Blue Lizard Sensitive on your face and go swimming (or sweat into your eyes), your eyes will burn until the next day.  </li>
            <li>My kids hate sunscreen in general...who doesn&#x27;t, but my whole family agreed this was a good choice.</li>
            <li>active ingredients are Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide, which are high quality minerals for broad spectrum UVA and UVB skin protection.</li>
            <li>The first few times my kids burned because I was used to getting a longer time from the sprays but wanted something healthier for their skin.</li>
            <li>but it absorbes right away and doesn&#x27;t leave an excessive oil.</li>
            <li>So it doesn&#x27;t feel like bare skin, but it&#x27;s not much different than regular sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With a high level of cancer in my genes, including skin cancer, I am very careful with the products I use and their effectiveness.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended I try Blue Lizard because I was enraged over one of my daycare babies getting too much sun after a half hour or so in somewhat indirect sunlight.  </li>
            <li>Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks.</li>
            <li>I have burned on various brands both super expensive and reasonable.  </li>
            <li>It went on clear, didn&#x27;t sting, and lasted longer than expected-- applied only twice a day, and no sunburn!</li>

            <li> Very effective sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It is also very effective without making you look like a ghost, as some products with zinc can do and it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The latest and greatest formula is paraben-free, chemical-free, and fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> We have so many skin allergies and issues and this product has been great for the kids and ourselves!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, but won&#x27;t do you a lick of good if you&#x27;re putting it on your kids before they get in a pool.</li>
            <li> That said, I have tried many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; mineral sunscreens in my quest to find the best.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best and we&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li> This was the best sunscreen we tried out of many.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve tried many &amp; found this one to be the best</li>
            <li> This product gets a great rating on EWG, so you know it is good for you.  </li>
            <li> This is probably the best, most effective sunscreen on the market.  </li>
            <li> I feel good about putting it on my children and myself.</li>
            <li> good stuff, but</li>
            <li> My fair skinned husband didn&#x27;t burn once while in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> Sun exposure &#x3D; good for you.</li>
            <li> Being redheaded and fair complected</li>
            <li> I needed something good.</li>
            <li> This gives you a good guage on whether to seek shade for a bit the brighter the bottle turns.</li>
            <li> Good upf.</li>
            <li> I have to use good sun block for the prevention of skin cancer.</li>
            <li> Also does a good job protecting against windburn.</li>
            <li> We are all fair skinned and never come away from a beach vacation without a burn, after using this product all that has changed.</li>
            <li> I find this sunscreen does not irritate her skin and gives her good protection.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m extremely fair skinned</li>
            <li> I purchase this every year for my fair, freckled, ginger son.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good way of reminding: &amp;#34;the sun is out!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> She used it and loved it.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it for the fairest of fair skin types.</li>
            <li> Switched to Badger after reading good things about them.  </li>
            <li> My kids felt good</li>
            <li> Believe all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> This stuff works and I&#x27;m as fair skinned as can be.</li>
            <li> It was originally recommended by my dermatologist as the best sunscreen</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and burn easily.  </li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, and I like that it&#x27;s easy to see where you&#x27;re applying it, and it rubs in well.  </li>
            <li> I burn so easy since I am very fair skinned.  </li>

            <li> And we love it!  </li>
            <li> and it prevented sunburn after many hours (and reapplications as stated on bottle)!</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and runs in great.  </li>
            <li> It was amazing when it was cloudy yet</li>

            <li> My daughters did not complain about any kind of sweat run-off either.</li>
            <li> I am now trying my hand at making my own sunscreen.</li>
            <li> love the product and shipping was good for this item too</li>
            <li> Kind of reminds me of Eucerin cream - texture-wise -</li>
            <li> Best of all though it really does work.</li>
            <li> This sunblock is the best that I&#x27;ve found for my fair &amp; sensitive skinned boys.</li>

            <li> Perfect for my sensitive skin and purfume sensitivity!</li>
            <li> Very water resistant, no allergy issues, and very good sun protection.  </li>
            <li> Its ingredients are rated well, and so far it seems to do a perfect job of keeping sunburns away.</li>
            <li> Even as sensitive as our grandson&#x27;s skin is, there was no reaction to this lotion which provided excellent protection!</li>
            <li> It kind of just sits on top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a lot of research and tried many sunscreens including Babyganics, Honest Co., California Baby, Badger...</li>
            <li> and it honestly works better then</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!</li>

            <li> We love this.</li>
            <li> my kids love how it changes color in the sun (the bottle)</li>
            <li> Toddler doesn&#x27;t like it, but she doesn&#x27;t like anything that requires her to be still for more than a millisecond.</li>
            <li> This one finally fit the bill!  </li>
            <li> With sunscreens we have two more choices.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still important to wear sunscreen on cloudy days!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It does turn your skin a bit white but it is awesome!</li>
            <li> I love the outdoors</li>
            <li> No nasty chemicals!</li>
            <li> I bought five different kinds of suncreen to find the best on the market without retinyl palmitate.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen...</li>
            <li> Doctor says this brand is better than anything put out by US companies.  </li>
            <li> front to start and still have plenty of each of the ingredients to make loads more.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The Face is much better.</li>
            <li> But we were in the Bahamas for the week in June, spending most of the time in the water and at the beach and never got burned.</li>
            <li> I researched a ton on EWG&#x27;s 2015 Guide to Sunscreens website and on Amazon poring through various reviews to purchase the best sunblock.</li>
            <li> Glad I tested this product out at home before using it in the Caribbean.</li>
            <li> No parabens, no nasty harmful chemicals and no smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell like sun screen</li>
            <li> once you try it and love it, get the gallon jug--way cheaper per gallon.</li>
            <li> Interesting coincidence.</li>
            <li> and it feels like you are not wearing sunscreen unlike most feel greasy and makes you want to wash your hands after apply.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> for the longest time, I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena&#x27;s beach defense sunscreen Until I read the EWG report, and then I fell in love with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Excellent sun protection for red headed toddler in Texas!  </li>
            <li> We used this on our recent trip to Hawaii, and it worked great!</li>
            <li> Most of them either reacted with my skin by stinging my face or not preventing sunburn.</li>
            <li> I actually use this every day living in Florida and is the best stuff ever!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t shake the heated bottle before you pop the top, it guarantees spewage.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> family is pleased with this product.</li>

            <li> Love this sunscreen - such great quality!  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t mind and it is so much better than an aerosol can.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it&#x27;s expiration date is</li>
            <li> I know how important it is to prevent them from BIRTH!  </li>
            <li> and I will be even happier :)</li>
            <li> more could you want?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more concerned with getting a sunscreen on my kids that I know doesn&#x27;t give them a rash</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> (that seems to be my kids&#x27; favorite part).</li>
            <li> ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> The more zinc, the more protection</li>
            <li> but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that I purchase and add to VCO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue</li>
            <li> The more zinc, the more protection</li>
            <li> but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that I purchase and add to VCO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue</li>

            <li> so glad he did.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a couple years now and it seems to do a good job of being natural for the most part while still providing good sun protection.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Sure it can look pasty, but it rubs in nicely (and my skin happens to be very fair, so it&#x27;s not much of a problem anyway).</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, very smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does take a while to get it rubbed in, but it is so worth it!!</li>
            <li> Now more than ever it is important to make sure that she never has a sunburn.  </li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned and generally will go to great lengths to avoid using sunblock, because it often stings the skin, and needs frequent re-application.  </li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned, and suffered from sunburns my entire childhood.  </li>

            <li> It is so effective and the whole family, from my toddler to the adults, can use the same sunscreen knowing its safe and the most effective sunscreen I&#x27;ve found on the market.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good no allergic reaction so far.  </li>
            <li> skin has stayed fair and healthy in a Southern California climate with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old is extremely fair and always burns, never tans.</li>
            <li> Now granted I don&#x27;t recommend you do this experiment yourself - but having been the reluctant guinea pig, I can truly attest that it is ok for &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27;!!!  :)</li>
            <li> Blue Lizard is light and not greasy, has a very light but pleasant scent (which disappears quickly).  </li>
            <li> I use this mainly on my face and it gives it a nice glow under makeup.  </li>
            <li> I am VERY faired skin and burn very easy.  </li>
            <li> This is my new favorite sunscreen!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen so far this spring/summer, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> It is not lightweight or suitable for use on faces, but a real pro for the body.</li>
            <li> works very well for sensitive skin, good for children, I saw this being sold at my Dermatologist&#x27;s office for quite a bit more.</li>
            <li> But blue lizard is more potent so I will take looking chalky!</li>
            <li> THE HIGHER THE ZINC, THE MORE PROTECTION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and for a long time!  </li>
            <li> The need to reapply is not as often as most sunscreens, mainly face and shoulders where it gets rubbed off easily.</li>
            <li> excellent broad spectrum physical barrier sunscreen free of chemicals</li>
            <li> This is a great product for kids and free from all the junk in other children&#x27;s sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Good product, we don&#x27;t get itchy skin like most other sun screens.</li>
            <li> How many stories have you heard where someone gets burned the first day of a fun beach vacation.</li>
            <li> Even a winter day can be bright enough for sunscreen!</li>
            <li> sunscreen is effective for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no scientist, but I hear these are good ingredients to have for ultimate protection.</li>
            <li> and she recommended getting whichever one was cheaper at the time because they are both equally good and equally sensitive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had never heard of the brand before that, but if it&#x27;s good enough for a skin cancer specialist at Hopkins, it&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with skin cancer for a number of years now and was looking for a good physical sunscreen that was affordable.  </li>
            <li> Love this product &amp; highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> Love that zinc oxide that is transparent and very recommended by our dermatogist.</li>
            <li> Those who mind having a chalky zombie-esque complexion may take issue with how Blue Lizzard applies, while those who are simply seeking really good sun protection, should be pretty darn happy.</li>
            <li> Rub it in good if you don&#x27;t want a white cast, but I happen to like that look.</li>
            <li> I have eczema prone sensitive skinned children who get rashes from their own sweat, but they can use this without any irritation.</li>
            <li> It provides full coverage.</li>
            <li> I used this sunscreen on a recent trip to Italy and I loved it.</li>
            <li> I live in the southwest where it is very sunny and have quite fair skin.</li>
            <li> A good organic 3oz 18% zinc mix should not cost more than $13 and for less when on sale.</li>
            <li> A good organic 3oz 18% zinc mix should not cost more than $13 and for less when on sale.</li>
            <li> A good organic 3oz 18% zinc mix should not cost more than $13 and for less when on sale.</li>
            <li> First batch was super easy and about a $30 up</li>
            <li> This product came out tops during my research and I was excited when it also absorbed well into the skin without looking like Casper the Ghost.</li>
            <li> My two kids ages 5 and 6 have very fair sensitive skin, and this sunscreen is only one have found that doesn&#x27;t burn on contact.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for serious sun areas, like Florida and Hawaii</li>
            <li> Works very well and seems to be good for their sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It spreads evenly and quickly.</li>
            <li> It comes out of the bottle quickly, but I like that.  </li>
            <li> Again, San Francisco &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; is mild.</li>
            <li> If I leave the bottle in my swim bag (under the sun) for more than 10 minutes, when I pop the top to open the bottle the sunscreen &amp;#34;explodes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great product, the kids really like how the bottle turns blue.</li>
            <li> Blue Lizard, when applied properly and according to the package recommendations, is the best sunscreen I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> , it sometimes makes your skin (or clothes) more white than most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> The very first time the kids</li>
            <li> no unpleasant odors</li>
            <li> Great product, small {but important} flaw.</li>
            <li> I have a slight allergy to the sun and even at 30 this does a great job of protecting me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a long of different sunscreens through the years and this is the best.  </li>
            <li> plus the bottle that changes color in the sun is way super fun.</li>
            <li> Hot!</li>
            <li> Will absolutely buy again!!</li>
            <li> and I guess it washes away more easily than Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li> A little sidelight - my kids think the UV color changing bottle is great</li>
            <li> My husband has very fair skin, and I am very sensitive to other sunscreen lotions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few of these type of sunblocks and this one works great.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice and the white color fades after a minute.</li>
            <li> Many reviewers said they used this on beach vacations, but those reviews are old.</li>
            <li> I rarely use lotion on my body.</li>
            <li> It is worth it.  </li>
            <li> a product worth</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s well worth the money in my opinion based on one thing</li>
            <li> I am allergic to almost all over-the-counter sun screen products and many of the products supposedly designed for sensitive skins.  </li>
            <li> I trust it completely, and it&#x27;s now paraben free!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricy but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> and though you have to rub the blue lizard in pretty good I honestly think it protects better then any of my sunscreens used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I love that this is all natural.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and many products</li>
            <li> Bottle is fun too.  </li>
            <li> One of my favorite natural suncreens.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> And I was so surprised and truly relieved that when the product said &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; it really was &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;!!!!  </li>
            <li> Not thick &amp; sticky, easily applied.</li>
            <li> It absorbs pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> After tons of research on the EWG and trying numerous brands, we have found the perfect blend of &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; (high ratings on the EWG website) and usability (rubs in well and does not stay white).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works best if you apply it to dry skin, let it dry before going out in the sun, reapply as needed.</li>
            <li> the good news is that the rest of our family did not burn and the product worked extremely well.</li>
            <li> Right ingredients according to my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t squeeze the bottle and the amount will be right.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it would be all right if you just wanted to lounge by the pool with a mister cooling you off...but not for any strenuous exercise.</li>
            <li> Very easy to put on compared to others of the same type.</li>
            <li> This is the only one that applies easily and protects well, while also not being filled with harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, soaks in quickly and does not irritate her sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> After searching high and low for a good sunscreen with a low EWG.org/skindeep safety rating and safe ingredients, I settled on this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I only just recently learned that studies say chemical sunscreens get into your bloodstream, which isn&#x27;t great for kids, pregnant women, and nursing mothers (or anyone really).</li>
            <li> Blue Lizzard Australian Sunscreen is the most effective sunscreen I have ever used with a very high saftey level.</li>
            <li> Does not take very much to cover.</li>
            <li> It does take a little effort to get it rubbed in good</li>
            <li> We have used this for a month now and while I thought it was great at first, but we found out the hard way that it is not waterproof.  </li>
            <li> Blue Lizard was listed on the safe side of the chart.</li>
            <li> Blue Lizard is ranked as one of the top sunscreens by the Environmental Working Group (EWG).</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s a top sunscreen, color me interested (or blue).</li>
            <li> No weird smell.</li>
            <li> I love Blue Lizard sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> We love Blue Lizard!</li>
            <li> This is my first summer trying this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> and I purchased the first bottle at their office.</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time during our trip to Jamaica.</li>
            <li> But if you prefer no chemicals, but are willing to use them on occasion (e.g., all day at the beach) then you may want to try the sport version as well.r</li>
            <li> But if you prefer no chemicals, but are willing to use them on occasion (e.g., all day at the beach) then you may want to try the sport version as well.</li>
            <li> One bottle for the whole family!</li>
            <li> I also love that the bottle turns blue in UV Rays.</li>
            <li> First lets get the EWG rating out of the way.</li>
            <li> well worth it as it appears to work very well.</li>
            <li> Kind of an iridescent grey, no matter how much I rubbed it in.</li>
            <li> Finally, environmental working group (ewg.org) gives it a safe rating.</li>
            <li> to work (wish it was higher SPF; I like to put it on my kids before school and not worry about their teachers forgetting to reapply).&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad we went with Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a safe alternative to chemical sunscreens, I can&#x27;t recommend BL enough.</li>
            <li> It is the first sunscreen that I can use on my face and it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Love that the bottle turns blue when exposed to uv Rays.</li>
            <li> I have dermatitis that &amp;#34;blooms&amp;#34; from many different products.  </li>
            <li> Currently this is my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Product also stays on pretty well in pools, lakes, etc.</li>
            <li> We have always made sure our kids were properly protected when going out in the sun.  </li>
            <li> I love Blue Lizard sunscreen because it&#x27;s not greasy, there are no chemicals, and it works!&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> is not sturdy and not too hot to hold.</li>
            <li> daughter also loves that the bottle turns blue in the sun :)</li>
            <li> Has a low ZO, not 30+ SPF at all, has too many ingredients, non are organic, non are certified, no percentage of ingredient...</li>
            <li> You do have to rub a bit more to get it to disappear, but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasted us about a year, which is good because we use it nearly everyday in the summer and as needed the rest of year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair skinned, freckled, non-tanning redhead and this is what I use (I use the face type everyday for my face).</li>
            <li> Works good, not too heavy and rubs in well (for a zinc based product)</li>
            <li> as most spf does... Really rub in before you go out into the sun and use a small amount and spread evenly so it can absord quickly!!</li>
            <li> I had never heard of Blue Lizard but ordered it after reading so many positive reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It goes on more easily than other sunscreens with high zinc &amp; titanium percentage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way more waterproof than most competitors and seems to last forever, I never burn as long as I remember to use it.  </li>
            <li> A friend told me the baby one in the pink bottle avoids this issue, but I&#x27;m happy enough with this product.</li>
            <li> Hard to apply but the best product out there when it comes to protecting and no bad chemicals as the other stuff.</li>
            <li> Besides that, you can watch the bottle turn blue in the sun...very cool!</li>
            <li> My skin usually can&#x27;t handle daily sunscreen usage, but this guy is so mild and gentle that my skin is holding up great.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is the lotion comes out very quickly...</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t leave the skin white and the bottle changes color when you&#x27;re in the sun.</li>
            <li> It works, it&#x27;s easy to apply (goes on white, but fades after a while), and it&#x27;s not too oily.</li>
            <li> After getting to our vacation destination, I noticed in fine print on the bottle that it says under &amp;#34;Directions&amp;#34; on its back label:  &amp;#34;Use a water resistant sunscreen if swimming or sweating.&amp;#34; THIS ISN&#x27;T WATER RESISTANT!  </li>
            <li> With constant reapplication it works fine.  </li>
            <li> Zinc is one of the best things for sunscreen because instead blocking and absorbing rays like typical sunscreen, zinc actually reflects the rays back away from the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It even works on a cloudy day, which surprised my little ones - a good reminder that they need to wear sunscreen even when they can&#x27;t see the sun.</li>
            <li> comes in a large enough volume that is useful to use with two kids who are outside most of the day all summer, 4)</li>
            <li> Where has this been my whole life?</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.lowest price on the planet.</li>
            <li> The issue comes when we overindulge and get too much of it.</li>
            <li> After ruining a bunch of white shirts with the cheap spray lotions for my kids, I switched to this.  </li>
            <li> It goes on really well.</li>
            <li> Even my husband commented that is went on really well compared to the Badger.</li>
            <li> It stays on very well and lasts.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> bottle turns blue in sunlight to remind you your in uv light</li>
            <li> And it was very peculiar b/c</li>
            <li> He actually wants to use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This stuff really keeps the sun off</li>
            <li> Works very well to block the sun without adding harmful cancer causing chemicals to your day.</li>
            <li> someone else wants it.</li>
            <li> It stays on very well.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this seller!</li>
            <li> Works very well and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> You should err on the side of putting on too much otherwise you may get burnt.</li>
            <li> This worked really well.  </li>
            <li> Works really well but takes some effort to rub in.  </li>
            <li> Item as described Fast Shipping  A+++++</li>
            <li> This is really a 6 star sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
            <li> Very Water Resistant&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very Water Resistant&lt;br</li>
            <li> This sunscreen work really well</li>
            <li> and then gently wipe the excess off.</li>
            <li> but the product itself once on works really well...</li>
            <li> Arrived fast.</li>
            <li> love blue lizard;  delivery was seamless</li>
            <li> Just remember that you probably won&#x27;t be able to get rid of the white sheen completely.</li>
            <li> How did it go wrong with so many nice reviews all over the internet?</li>
            <li> This is one of few I can use and it is effective.  </li>
            <li> Gives good protection for kids and doesn&#x27;t have any of those harsh chemicals and works well for my sensitive skin kids.</li>
            <li> Everything else I have tried, they will complain that it burns on contact with the most sensitive areas like their cheeks and neck,except blue lizard.  </li>
            <li> Goes on thick, especially with hair (good luck getting it to go on smooth of you</li>
            <li> This sunscreen provides good coverage, but it&#x27;s so thick</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and stays on a LONG time.</li>
            <li> We normally use thinkbaby/thinksport for our child, but have been using this for ourselves and this seems easier to put on!</li>
            <li> Besides, the blue bottle is fun!</li>
            <li> Better than any other sunscreen I have used.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, I get better protection than from any other sunscreent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many other lotions and have paid a ton of money for them.</li>
            <li> A bonus is that if one rubs it in a bit more than your usual petrol based block it doesn&#x27;t make you look pasty white like a lot of zinc bases healthy blocks.</li>
            <li> I have used many other sunscreens and he would still burn.</li>
            <li> Really cool how the bottle becomes blue when UV light is present.  </li>
            <li> Ignore old reviews you come across saying otherwise because the new formula is safe and Blue Lizard has made sensitivity a priority.</li>
            <li> The lotion goes on nice, does not feel thick and sticky, does not make me feel hot.</li>
            <li> Blue Lizard&#x27;s ingredients vary so much from their Face mix to the Original mix to the Baby mix since they offer more additives, less zinc with noticeable price fluctuation.</li>
            <li> Blue Lizard&#x27;s ingredients vary so much from their Face mix to the Original mix to the Baby mix since they offer more additives, less zinc with noticeable price fluctuation.</li>

            <li> It does not stain clothes, is very effective because we have yet to get sunburns, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> For that reason, when I purchase a sunscreen mix, I need the same formula as I use when I make my own organic sunscreen mix since it only requires few ingredients but for more protection like my nose, I bump the zinc.</li>
            <li> For that reason, when I purchase a sunscreen mix, I need the same formula as I use when I make my own organic sunscreen mix since it only requires few ingredients but for more protection like my nose, I bump the zinc.</li>
            <li> It went on smoothly and dried fairly quickly for a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> After much research, I choose this sunscreen based on many factors including: EWG&#x27;s rating, previous consumer&#x27;s reviews, price, and ease of purchase.</li>
            <li> Lower your price and make it more affordable to the average folk</li>
            <li> It is a white bottle with a blue lid and blue writing (sound familiar!).  </li>
            <li> My sensitive skin does fine with this sunscreen, but it gives a ghoulish look with the white cast.</li>
            <li> I love that this sunscreen has less chemicals.</li>
            <li> Without sunscreen I&#x27;d be burned after 15 minutes in the sun, but applying Blue Lizard to my face and body just once will have me safely protected from the sun for the entire day.</li>
            <li> I found this to work great but be thick enough</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is a great sunscreen, very water resistant (which does make it difficult to wash off), feels a bit tacky when it is on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that the bottle turns blue when UV is present.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t mess up my nail polish like most sunscreens do</li>
            <li> At our high altitude where we have a lot sunny days, it is a necessity.</li>
            <li> This brand came highly recommended by my children&#x27;s pediatrician.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I found this lotion through it&#x27;s high ranking on EWG&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my child to take with her to high elevation in Arizona.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> We have tried everything and this highly rated sunscreen protects us from the sun through all our beach activities.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it  contains zinc oxide and is very skin sensitive.</li>
            <li> Works great not too expensive.</li>
            <li> You must blend in the sunblock well into your skin as not to leave any white streaks but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Just back from a tour of Utah&#x27;s national parks and monuments - hot and very sunny</li>
            <li> Normal drugstore sunscreens caused rashes and spots on her face and body.</li>
            <li> Used the entire bottle during the summer and am very pleased with the performance during my exposure to the sun everyday.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, but expensive sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Be sure to apply it to your skin when it&#x27;s dry, as stated on the back of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Because it is a mineral sunscreen it does leave a white film on the skin and makes you look a bit ghost like, but the product is effective, particularly if you use a fairly heavy layer.  </li>
            <li> You only need a tiny amount and it covers really well and doesn&#x27;t leave a white reside as most mineral sunscreens do.</li>
            <li> The inactive ingredients are extensive in Blue Lizard, check their Internet site but more importantly compare the cost of any sunscreen to better brands with hardly any ingredients except few organic and a very high amount of zinc like 18% zinc not 5% or 10% zinc.</li>

            <li> Before, DD was coming home from summer swim camp with new freckles every day,  but now I apply this in the morning, and the freckles have stopped.</li>
            <li> I live in the Bay Area, so it&#x27;s not a tropical sun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Am looking for a new titanium dioxide/zinc oxide sunscreen to try.</li>
            <li> It is easy to rub in (or easier than other natural sunscreens we&#x27;ve tried).  </li>
            <li> but it comes out of the container too fast, wasting product and making a mess; maybe that is to make sure you use enough once you wipe it off the floor.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the skin on that very sensitive part of my body to start to sting or burn....</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My toddler daughter has very sensitive skin and her dermatologist recommended it.</li>
            <li> Our girls have very sensitive skin and a friend recommended this.</li>
            <li> I think its definitely worth the money and so much better than all the other junk we were using previously</li>
            <li> My son actually called me a yeti the first time I used this sunscreen since I did look like a snow monster.</li>
            <li> bought this to compare with other &#x27;safe&#x27; rated sunscreens and this one doesn&#x27;t leave all the white zinc all over and is not sticky or tacky!</li>
            <li> Goes on white when first applied but eventually this clears up as it is smoothed on.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick and will leave a white sheen if you don&#x27;t rub it in good, but my two, ages 12 &amp; 9, had no trouble applying it and getting it rubbed in.  </li>
            <li> Easy on skin, no smell, not greasy, no or little harmful chemicals for skin and environment.</li>
            <li> ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is our new sunscreen going forward for our littlest ones (2 years old) to us as parents.  </li>
            <li> Our baby has very sensitive skin, and has eczema flare ups at near nothing.</li>
            <li> importantly, my very very sensitive skin 2 year old has NO problems with it at all.  </li>
            <li> My daughter uses the sensitive formula because she has very sensitive</li>
            <li> I do this out of the goodness of my heart so other people who like to research products before they buy have a true understanding of how a product works.th not a lot of effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do this out of the goodness of my heart so other people who like to research products before they buy have a true understanding of how a product works.</li>
            <li> and my skin was clear with not a lot of effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the Blue Lizard sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If anything, my skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> The bottle turning blue is a really neat feature that reminds you</li>
            <li> And I would like to attest to the fact that it is really &#x27;sensitive&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Difference between &amp;#34;Baby&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34;: I called the company to find out whether I should get the &amp;#34;baby or sensitive&amp;#34; formula for my 2 year old twins</li>
            <li> My kids are now almost 5 years old and we are still using this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t want to avoid the sun completely.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This lotion was recommended by the Dr for our 8 month old grandson when we went to the Caribbean.</li>
            <li> We were playing in the sprinkler in the backyard and this must have completely washed off.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m african-american and have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Is this old stock?</li>
            <li> I wore it while on a early morning hike in July</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin and had no breakouts or irritation on my face or body using this.</li>
            <li> I can even use this on my face which is particularly sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Some of their lines are water resistant but the sensitive version eschews the chemical that adds the resistance.  </li>
            <li> then you can add another dab or two to protect the sensitive area from sun exposure.</li>
            <li> I use it on myself &amp; on my 15 month old daughtet</li>
            <li> Compared to most sunscreens, this one has the least amount of toxins in it.</li>
            <li> A blue eyed Irish girl doesn&#x27;t have a chance in the tropics in June, but Blue Lizard kept me sunburn free.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my 3 year old as well</li>
            <li> We use the sensitive version.</li>
            <li> Bottle changes color in the sun like an old GI</li>
            <li> Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts.</li>
            <li> Lizard Sensitive</li>
            <li> Lizard Sensitive</li>
            <li> I am extremely sensitive both to the sun and to skin care products and Blue Lizard Sensitive works very well for me.  </li>
            <li> Once we were having so much fun outside, I forgot, and realized over an hour later.  </li>
            <li> You get a big bottle, but you waste more than needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also love how this product feels on my skin - it&#x27;s thick and moisturizing, takes some rubbing to get it to blend in.</li>
            <li> how quickly it changes color in full sun and even inside a car behind the UV-coated glass.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it is quite thick and takes a while to rub in, but other than that, it is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a light skinned African american and when I used this I looked really strange.  </li>
            <li> Other than those rare instances, I have not had a sunburn since I started using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s white and goes on white, BUT, with a little extra effort, it will disappear into your skin nicely so you won&#x27;t look like a vaudeville comedian from the &#x27;30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Anyway about the product, I have been using Blue Lizard for a long time and like it very much and it suits my child sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Great for sun protection but very difficult to rub into your skin.</li>
            <li> (forgive my spelling but it is just as hard to say) and again I only bought my first one at the spa and all future bottle bought on Amazon with fabulous spelling and Amazon Prime</li>
            <li> It is not super greasy like most other brands I tried.</li>
            <li> The ingredient list is not perfectly pure, but I&#x27;m okay with a little compromise.</li>
            <li> I tried some of the Blue Lizard sunscreens and this was my least favorite.  </li>
            <li> It is the only thing I use on my 4 yr old with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Easily applied (not as thick as some zinc screens).</li>
            <li> my dermatologist recommended it for its broad protection.  </li>
            <li> It is more expensive than other brands, but so worth it!  </li>
            <li> But the major downside for me was the itching.  </li>
            <li> I like the idea of using zinc oxide instead of the other chemicals for a sunscreen, but unfortunately it is not overly water or sweat proof (the bottle even states so), which limits its use.  </li>
            <li> There are no harmful chemicals in it, as there are with major brands like Coppertone, Neutrogena, Banana Boat, Trader Joe&#x27;s, etc.</li>
            <li> Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Protection</li>
            <li> Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Protection&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> /&gt;It IS more expensive, and it does make your skin white, but I see this as a positive</li>
            <li> My dermatologist highly recommends the Blue Lizard sunscreen products and I have used them for several years now.  </li>
            <li> To be clear, it will take a lot of work to get this rubbed in, and even then you will have a white sheen to you.</li>
            <li> Goes on white but then turns clear after a bit.  </li>
            <li> Goes on white, so you can see where it has been applied, and dries clear.  </li>
            <li> This is only product I can use because of sensitive skin problems.</li>
            <li> So if you are anti-chemical and want only natural ingredients, stick with the baby/sensitive versions.  </li>
            <li> So if you are anti-chemical and want only natural ingredients, stick with the baby/sensitive versions.  </li>
            <li> Blue Lizard Sensitive Skin has won out in the end.</li>
            <li> Blue lizard SPF 30 sensitive has a rating of 1.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t completely rub in like a spray on sunscreen or regular lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using it on myself (sensitive skin/ rosecea) and</li>
            <li> but apparently  it washed off in the water soon after application.  </li>
            <li> Bottle seems to last all summer for our 2 year old.</li>
            <li> Especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Did not provide as much protection as I expected.</li>
            <li> It is very white and takes effort to rub completely in, but that helps identify missed areas so</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the easiest by half stuff to apply nearly akin to pure zinc oxide it takes a lot of rubbing to get it</li>
            <li> Now granted, I wiped it off as quickly as I could - but the sunscreen is water-resistent, so it is hard to really completely remove it.  </li>
            <li> I live in Mexico and use Blue Lizard regularly.</li>
            <li> Used Blue Lizard Sensitive in FL for long beach days (yes very frequently reapplied for reasons - see below) for our kids</li>
            <li> My skin is dry to combo, and loves the moisturizing quality of this sunscreen, BUT I think this product could potentially be a bit much if you have oily skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is slightly greasy at first</li>
            <li> Got sunburned the first time because we didn&#x27;t reapply every half an hour.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen rubs in so much easier than other zinc oxide creams.</li>
            <li> Lasts much longer than the other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> What the other reviewers don&#x27;t say is that this stuff is really greasy.  </li>
            <li> Once winter is over it doesn&#x27;t take long for my sensitive skin to get burned!</li>
            <li> damaging sun rays with our Facial Blue Lizard and normal Blue Lizard for our arms and legs.</li>
            <li> It is definitely thick and takes some work to spread, but it is worth it to keep out those UV&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> This is worth the money as it doesn&#x27;t have all the bad chemicals that most sunscreen has but, even if you don&#x27;t care about that, it works so well.</li>
            <li> But, for regular daily use, I have to use something clear that wears well under make up.</li>
            <li> and I would definitely order it again and recommend this product for anyone going on vacation with very white sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you put Blue Lizard Sensitive on your face and go swimming (or sweat into your eyes), your eyes will burn until the next day.  </li>
            <li> My kids hate sunscreen in general...who doesn&#x27;t, but my whole family agreed this was a good choice.</li>
            <li> active ingredients are Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide, which are high quality minerals for broad spectrum UVA and UVB skin protection.</li>
            <li> The first few times my kids burned because I was used to getting a longer time from the sprays but wanted something healthier for their skin.</li>
            <li> but it absorbes right away and doesn&#x27;t leave an excessive oil.</li>
            <li> So it doesn&#x27;t feel like bare skin, but it&#x27;s not much different than regular sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With a high level of cancer in my genes, including skin cancer, I am very careful with the products I use and their effectiveness.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended I try Blue Lizard because I was enraged over one of my daycare babies getting too much sun after a half hour or so in somewhat indirect sunlight.  </li>
            <li> Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks.</li>
            <li> I have burned on various brands both super expensive and reasonable.  </li>
            <li> It went on clear, didn&#x27;t sting, and lasted longer than expected-- applied only twice a day, and no sunburn!</li>
            <li> because this cream is so thick, just squeeze one drop on your finger and apply to your face in circular motion until it doesn&#x27;t appear white and gets absorbed all over the area</li>
            <li> This stuff is thick , and you need time to rub it in, but it&#x27;s worth it for the coverage.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is thick and harder to rub in than most other sunscreens but it doesn&#x27;t feel gross or sticky, and never runs into my eyes.  </li>
            <li> This one worked the best and isn&#x27;t terrible in terms rubbing in to avoid white streaks (apparently a universal problem with the oxide sunblocks, but a minor consideration next to doing the actual sun-blocking job).</li>
            <li> A touch pricey but slightly cheaper on the amazon site vs. buying directly from Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li> There was a question asked about whether this has non-nano particles in it, and while I usually share this concern and try to buy sunscreens that are non-nano, searching for one that will not irritate my children&#x27;s skin takes too much trial and error time.</li>
            <li> last a long time and cant beat the price</li>
            <li> After heavy research concerning chemical sunscreens versus physical sunscreens, we made the decision to switch completely to the physical sunscreens for safety concerns.</li>
            <li> It lasts once it&#x27;s on, and the only times I&#x27;ve gotten a minor burn while using it is if I missed a spot or forgot to reapply.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve resolved to use it only on the adults that will be staying dry.</li>
            <li> Only use if you will stay dry on land.</li>
            <li> I got this for a recent vacation, where long sleeves and long pants were not a viable option.</li>
            <li> The only other low level toxin sunscreens are some of the sunscreens made specifically for infants.</li>
            <li> What sets this apart from other sunscreens is that it actually rubs in without leaving white all over you.</li>
            <li> Still a better alternative to the sunscreens with dangerous chemicals.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy, just moisture enriched and protected from sunburn.</li>
            <li> I use the sensitive/baby on days when we are out in the sun, but not direct sun all day long</li>
            <li> I use the sensitive/baby on days when we are out in the sun, but not direct sun all day long</li>
            <li> It looks faintly white and if you are tanned it almost makes your skin look pink.</li>
            <li> I will probably keep using this brand as long as I can get my hands on it.</li>
            <li> It works and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> We sometimes reapplied after a long time swimming, but not always.  </li>
            <li> No one would have even guessed we&#x27;d spent a week in the FL sun, AND we probably had about a half of a bottle left, so we&#x27;ll have plenty to last our entire Summer!</li>
            <li> As with all zinc oxide products, it also leaves a slight white hue on you once applied, but it is not obvious unless you know about it.</li>
            <li> Even though this is more expensive on the front-end, we saved money in the ling run because we would only have to reapply one other time per day (we might not have even needed that), so we used WAY less than the bottles and bottles of sunscreen</li>
            <li> Blue lizard feels like any other sun product I have used except that it has a bit of a waxy feel to it.</li>
            <li> This is the biggest difference between blue lizard and other mineral sunblocks.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this sunscreen and a bunch of other similar brands as she&#x27;s on a minimalist ingredient kick.  </li>
            <li> The bottle changes from it&#x27;s usual white to blue when there are UV rays present.  </li>
            <li> I do have dry skin.</li>
            <li> However this is just not easy enough to apply for me to use it daily, ice relegated it to my dive bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it ever rubs completely clear on the skin</li>
            <li> It goes on a bit white, so I simply apply small quantities and rub in as needed.</li>
            <li> I use generous amounts of sunscreen half an hour before I swim open water with my swim club once a week from 10:30am-11:30am.</li>
            <li> if you rub the sunscreen thoroughly into your skin, it leaves a shiny, slightly greasy white sheen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the ingredient, but I was getting itchy from regular sunscreen last summer.</li>
            <li> so why apply anything that has less protection to different part of the body.</li>

            <li> so why apply anything that has less protection to different part of the body.</li>
            <li> But it won&#x27;t be a white streaky mess.  </li>
            <li> DO a little research and you&#x27;ll find that not only does this sunscreen work</li>
            <li> And the sport version is much &amp;#34;runnier&amp;#34; (the sensitive/baby versions are very thick and takes a moment to rub in)</li>
            <li> And the sport version is much &amp;#34;runnier&amp;#34; (the sensitive/baby versions are very thick and takes a moment to rub in)</li>
            <li> This is possibly due to the fact that, previously, i wasn&#x27;t applying the sunscreen often enough.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that it leaves the skin chalky white even after I rub it in well.  </li>
            <li> it is much too difficult to apply unless you want to walk around with a white face</li>
            <li> Was not impressed, too much work for having to re apply constantly.</li>
            <li> It is meant to last longer on the skin, even when swimming or sweating heavily (their website says 240 minutes in whirlpool water).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m outside all day everyday</li>
            <li> no burn expected in Cozumel</li>
            <li> This summer we have spent a lot of time in the sun and nobody has burned.</li>
            <li> Did not provide the protection I expected</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it if you need a heavy duty sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Despite putting it on thickly and working it in, I have noticeable color (tanning) on my arms after being outside for several hours.  </li>
            <li> In the past I have found that only a titanium and/or zinc oxide based sunscreen prevented the spots from darkening, When my previous sunscreen became unavailable I tested every titanium and/or zinc oxide based sunscreen on Amazon that looked like it had potential.  </li>
            <li> Also, the baby formula is exactly the same as this one, and is less expensive at this point in time).</li>
            <li> Leaves you with that white, pale look on your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are other sunblocks that are physical sunblocks only, but this is the cheapest I&#x27;ve found, least smelly, and easiest to apply.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is cost -- but it&#x27;s in line with other similar products.</li>
            <li> Goes on runny and is not waterproof and my kids live in the pool so this was not a good purchase.  </li>
            <li> However, 45 minutes in the late-afternoon 4:00pm sun at the pool had my kids completely darkened--not burnt, but seriously browned.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and applies on thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hefty price tag, but you a little goes a long way.  </li>

            <li> It lasts a long time, even after sweating and swimming a little.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> does not feel greasy, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals of other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> As you have read from other reviews, this sunscreen is recommended by dermatologists and people swear by this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> do you have to reapply it every other minute?  </li>
            <li> Son had sensitivity to sunlight due to a medicine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But, after having a horrible experience going the cheap route using Sun Bum Moisturizing Sunscreen Lotion on my 2 year old (horrid, red flaming rash for weeks), I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It rubs in extremely well.</li>
            <li> Other brands I&#x27;ve bought make me feel like I&#x27;m wearing saran wrap - ugh.</li>
            <li> Not sure I can blame Blue Lizard about my increasing, unwanted tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always burn in the summer if I&#x27;m out in the sun even when reapplying every hour or so with other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> like some other brands do.  </li>
            <li> Since I wasn&#x27;t swimming, I had to come home and shower before I could sit on furniture due to the greasiness.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had skin cancer in the past, so protection is obviously crucial to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had reactions to other sb&#x27;s but not bl.</li>
            <li> I had melanoma and am very careful.</li>
            <li> Really protects you BUT toooo thick and hard to spread.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a reason why sunscreen companies do not provide any images of the labeling since that will disclose the active and inactive ingredients.</li>

            <li> it truly works because I immediately noticed my dark spots faded within the first week so noticeable that it&#x27;s not even a guessing game no more.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is the extreme whiteness it provides once applied.</li>
            <li> In the summer heat, my sweat and this product don&#x27;t go together well - which is hard for my daily routine of biking to work in 85-90 F.</li>
            <li> We never got a sun burn and in a way it was sad to see that we didn&#x27;t get much color.</li>
            <li> only complaint it that this product is not sweat-resistant as well.</li>
            <li> You may have trouble rubbing it into wet skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Starts white and thick on skin.</li>
            <li> The product is thick and white but if you continue to rub then it will fully disappear.  </li>
            <li> I go out and plop down on a lounge chair from 10-1.</li>
            <li> The particular brand was a bit less expensive than the other mineral based sunscreens.</li>
            <li> My son knows what I mean when I tell him we&#x27;re putting his lotion on to go outside.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to rub in versus the Cology lotion I have that is the same infredients.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick and a little white</li>
            <li> A little seems to go a long way due to how thick it is.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly, no issues.</li>
            <li> So one morning, before my coffee and half asleep, I accidentally used this sunscreen where it is NOT supposed to be used -</li>
            <li> This product goes on with a slight sheen to the skin.</li>
            <li> If my sunscreen is not adequate my face gets...spotty.  </li>
            <li> I am slightly tanned</li>
            <li> I hate the nasty oily feeling sunscreens give me, but this one is the best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> I use this when I am going to be in the sun in harsh environments and it has never let me down.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes it does absorb and your skin looks less yeti-like.</li>
            <li> This was a bit scary to me as I was very young.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but</li>
            <li> Was disappointed to see that the bottle has a yellow, aged look and am wondering how old it is.</li>
            <li> a little bit greasy though...</li>
            <li> The photo shows how little has been used in about a month with generous amounts and multiples times.</li>
            <li> When my 5 year old came back from the beach with a sunburn, I was shocked.  </li>
            <li> It can seem a bit heavy going on, but will soon disappear.</li>
            <li> sweating heavily (their website says 240 minutes in whirlpool water).  </li>
            <li> After a recent battle with melanoma it was time to up my sunscreen game.</li>
            <li> We used this everyday for a week on our baby while at the beach, and had no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Have used a few times.  </li>
            <li> Get in and out of the pool a few times.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t feel I wasted the money.</li>
            <li> we can be out there for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Goes on heavy</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anytime I was going to the pool or beach for a few hours+</li>
            <li> It took a few days to stop, despite steroid creams.  </li>
            <li> My kids have never been less sun damaged!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone who has read and is concerned about the crazy things sunscreens do.</li>
            <li> I recommend putting it on at least a half hour before going out</li>
            <li> A little hard to rub in, but protected us well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick and shiny but does the trick and blocks all UVA/UVB rays.  </li>
            <li> Goes on well and has very little scent.  </li>
            <li> Makes your face and skin white so expect some ribbing from your friends and weird looks from strangers.  </li>
            <li> and she used this for herself and her small child.</li>
            <li> but it was a thick and messy and made me look like Casper</li>
            <li> I just soaped up as usual and scrubbed with a washcloth</li>
            <li> If you think this is just another slick name sunscreen with fancy marketing words, think again.</li>
            <li> we usually go through on a vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have thick arm hair or haven&#x27;t shaved in a few days).</li>
            <li> any of the chemical based ones of the past.  </li>
            <li> Over 15 years ago, my Dermatologist removed a small brown spot from my skin and diagnosed me with basal cell carcinoma.  </li>
            <li> That being said, our youngest had a small brown mole on the bottom of her foot from birth.  </li>
            <li> Bought this product because the usual sunscreens caused my face to breakout.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> Some people complain that mineral sunblock is hard to remove.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too greasy, and goes on easily on hard to cover areas like my chest.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in a store, so I always buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been educated the hard way from the harmful effects of the sun, so</li>
            <li> BUT HARD TO FIND ANYWHERE BUT HERE.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to get off afterward.</li>
            <li> Protects well, but hard to apply on children.</li>
            <li> at least I hope so.</li>
            <li> to at least not look like you are walking around looking like a pasty mime, the kids both</li>
            <li> At least, I&#x27;ll assume it is.</li>
            <li> these reasons aren&#x27;t enough, my husband suffers from a sort of sun allergy.  </li>
            <li> One complaint I have seen is its chalky looking.</li>
            <li> I reapplied at least once a day, twice if we were out longer.</li>
            <li> It stays on well and lacks dangerous chemicals, but you will want a 2nd type of lotion for your face, not this stuff.</li>
            <li> Slowly build up our tolerance to sun exposure, or use a product like this to block those rays that can cause burns.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick.</li>
            <li> its thick</li>
            <li> I like how thick the lotion is  </li>
            <li> Goes on thick, but blends well.</li>
            <li> its a bit thick and gets som gettin used to</li>
            <li> I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t full of harmful chemicals and nasty additives.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention the price is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> If you are serious about sun protection, this is the product you need.</li>
            <li> Wish it was less expensive...</li>
            <li> In fact, on the last day I did a bad job of reapplying</li>
            <li> My arms are really bad and the lotion blends in and doesn&#x27;t leave white spots all over my arms.</li>
            <li> A lot of the products made here have chemicals that are not good for the skin.</li>
            <li> It is very thick - remember to shake the bottle well</li>
            <li> - it goes on very thick</li>
            <li> Very Thick.</li>
            <li> I find it works very well and protects me from that evil shiny ball in the sky, the sun.  </li>
            <li> kid has acne (and taking Accutane) and everything he has tried makes things worse.</li>
            <li> While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t burning or as bad as other sunscreens</li>
            <li> Prevents burns but is very thick and difficult to rub in.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it also seems rather expensive.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to apply and rub in.</li>
            <li> I was not really impressed.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to rub in</li>
            <li> Waterproof to the point where somewhat difficult to wash off.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> so they aren&#x27;t fake blasted reviews)</li>
            <li> Sweat like crazy in the 90+ degree sun.</li>
            <li> i bought this after a horrible sunburn incident this summer due to that stupid spray sunscreen.</li>
            <li> But it is very difficult to rub in.  </li>
            <li> That may be why I was so tired and accidentally used the wrong product!!!)  </li>
            <li> Sunburn &#x3D; bad for you.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the bad news...</li>
            <li> have to say how disappointed I have been with &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> BECAUSE THE IDIOT THOUGHT THERE WERE TWO BEING SHIPPED BASED ON THE PICTURE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hate it because of that</li>
            <li> I hate wearing sunscreen</li>
            <li> I have Melanaoma Stage IV and knowing when I should wear sunscreen, since I hate to wear it, helps me out.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed!</li>
            <li> The sun is not an evil fireball of death in the sky.</li>
            <li> And was in indirect sunlight - ended up with a horrible burn on my neck shoulders and arms.</li>
            <li> The sunblock didn&#x27;t block the sun and gave me a horrible skin rash which required a trip to the doctor for a steroid shot.</li>
            <li> worst cream everrrrrrr!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had never heard of this brand until I did some research on sunscreens. Some brands that are in the drug stores have chemical ingredients that can actually harm the skin when exposed to the sun. Blue Lizard was listed on the safe side of the chart. I spend a lot of time at the jersey shore in the summer &amp; this is my go to product for the body. It can seem a bit heavy going on, but will soon disappear. Also, once on the skin, it doesn&#x27;t have a scent. I&#x27;ve converted family &amp; guests who visit me at the beach.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen. I recomend it to anyone that needs protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> Finally a sunscreen I can wear!&lt;br /&gt;Goodbye wearing that hat every second&lt;br /&gt;when I&#x27;m outside.</li>
            <li> Once winter is over it doesn&#x27;t take long for my sensitive skin to get burned! I&#x27;ve recently turned to Blue Lizard, which is dermatologist recommended and hereby Big Red recommended too. Blue Lizard is ranked as one of the top sunscreens by the Environmental Working Group (EWG). If it&#x27;s a top sunscreen, color me interested (or blue). The stuff isn&#x27;t blue, don&#x27;t worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latest and greatest formula is paraben-free, chemical-free, and fragrance-free. Ignore old reviews you come across saying otherwise because the new formula is safe and Blue Lizard has made sensitivity a priority. Blue Lizard&#x27;s mission is to educate about the dangers of sun exposure and skin cancer prevention. Transparent about their products, they list every ingredient and provide the best resources to help consumers understand what makes an effective sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is effective for my sensitive skin. Without sunscreen I&#x27;d be burned after 15 minutes in the sun, but applying Blue Lizard to my face and body just once will have me safely protected from the sun for the entire day. It doesn&#x27;t itch or feel greasy. If anything, my skin feels soft. Be sure to apply it to your skin when it&#x27;s dry, as stated on the back of the bottle. You may have trouble rubbing it into wet skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredients are Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide, which are high quality minerals for broad spectrum UVA and UVB skin protection. I&#x27;m no scientist, but I hear these are good ingredients to have for ultimate protection. Hey, if dermatologists recommend it then I&#x27;m on board.</li>
            <li> This is the good stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and again it was recommended from my Aesthesiolgist  (forgive my spelling but it is just as hard to say) and again I only bought my first one at the spa and all future bottle bought on Amazon with fabulous spelling and Amazon Prime</li>
            <li> Great protection for our son that has Eczema and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Great stuff. We love this. my kids love how it changes color in the sun (the bottle) Goes on easy and stays on a LONG time. I think its definitely worth the money and so much better than all the other junk we were using previously</li>
            <li> Great product - recommended by dermatologists and it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals of other sunscreens.  I feel good about putting it on my children and myself.</li>
            <li> good stuff, but it stays whitish on your skin .. and if you sweat it gets white again</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is excellent. My fair skinned husband didn&#x27;t burn once while in Hawaii. No weird smell. It went on smoothly and dried fairly quickly for a sunscreen. When in the face it doesn&#x27;t break you out.</li>
            <li> Where has this been my whole life? Why have I been using Coppertone and Banana Boat when this existed, doesn&#x27;t smell, and doesn&#x27;t use chemical sunscreens? I only just recently learned that studies say chemical sunscreens get into your bloodstream, which isn&#x27;t great for kids, pregnant women, and nursing mothers (or anyone really). I feel liked I&#x27;ve been lied to my whole life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It IS more expensive, and it does make your skin white, but I see this as a positive so I know I&#x27;ve applied it evenly, and the white goes away  anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel the need to issue a public service announcement about this sunblock, but for now I&#x27;ll just submit this review. There are other sunblocks that are physical sunblocks only, but this is the cheapest I&#x27;ve found, least smelly, and easiest to apply. Toddler doesn&#x27;t like it, but she doesn&#x27;t like anything that requires her to be still for more than a millisecond.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Right ingredients according to my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t count the number of sunscreens I tried before finding one that wouldn&#x27;t give me a rash after a weekend of use.  This one finally fit the bill!  It went on easy, didn&#x27;t feel oily or sticky, and didn&#x27;t wash off in the pool.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly.  Lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy, just moisture enriched and protected from sunburn.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.lowest price on the planet. Have used this product for years. Keep this SELLER,I will reordering again.This is only product I can use because of sensitive skin problems.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a ton of misinformation out there. The sun is not an evil fireball of death in the sky. It gives life and light to our world. The issue comes when we overindulge and get too much of it. Sun exposure &#x3D; good for you. Sunburn &#x3D; bad for you. How many stories have you heard where someone gets burned the first day of a fun beach vacation. Oops. We have two choices. Slowly build up our tolerance to sun exposure, or use a product like this to block those rays that can cause burns. With sunscreens we have two more choices. A chemical barrier that can leech into your body and wreak havoc with your system. Or a physical sunblock like this with very low risk ingredients that uses zinc and titanium to bock the sun. I&#x27;ve used quite a few of these type of sunblocks and this one works great. The zinc and titanium are microscopic particles which ensures you avoid the &amp;#34;mime&amp;#34; look. Besides, the bottle turns blue in UV rays...how cool is that?!?</li>
            <li> I love Blue Lizard sunscreen.  My pediatrician recommended it years ago, and it is the only thing I use on my kids. They have never been burned while wearing it. Delivered quickly, no issues.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and for a long time!  Very easy to put on compared to others of the same type. I have very fair skin and burn easily.  This is my new favorite sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Non greasy. No odor. Perfect for my sensitive skin and purfume sensitivity!</li>
            <li> broke out in a rash the second time i used it.</li>
            <li> We love Blue Lizard! We have so many skin allergies and issues and this product has been great for the kids and ourselves! We&#x27;ve been using it for several years!! Note: During application if you get it on clothing or towels it does leave a white residue but it comes out in the wash.</li>
            <li> I am VERY faired skin and burn very easy.  This product works great!!!</li>
            <li> Recomended by our pediatric dermatologist! Works very well and seems to be good for their sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a couple of weeks so take this review for what it&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say how disappointed I have been with &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sun screens.  I have burned on various brands both super expensive and reasonable.  A friend recommended I try Blue Lizard because I was enraged over one of my daycare babies getting too much sun after a half hour or so in somewhat indirect sunlight.  Well, I am elated over this stuff.  I have a boy in my care that has a rare form of albinoism and I re-apply every 45 minutes just to be safe.  Once we were having so much fun outside, I forgot, and realized over an hour later.  Guess what?  He wasn&#x27;t a touch red at all....no burn!  I was very happy.  It&#x27;s a hefty price tag, but you a little goes a long way.  I would and will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is my first summer trying this sunscreen. Its ingredients are rated well, and so far it seems to do a perfect job of keeping sunburns away. The bottle turning blue is a really neat feature that reminds you it&#x27;s still important to wear sunscreen on cloudy days! It&#x27;s really easy to put on too. We normally use thinkbaby/thinksport for our child, but have been using this for ourselves and this seems easier to put on!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is so effective and the whole family, from my toddler to the adults, can use the same sunscreen knowing its safe and the most effective sunscreen I&#x27;ve found on the market. It was originally recommended by my dermatologist as the best sunscreen and I purchased the first bottle at their office. The bottle lasted us about a year, which is good because we use it nearly everyday in the summer and as needed the rest of year.</li>
            <li> Not at all waterproof!!!! So disappointed!</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time during our trip to Jamaica. We never got a sun burn and in a way it was sad to see that we didn&#x27;t get much color. Then again, no burnt bits and no worries, this product is awesome. We purchase this and the one for the face, good stuff!</li>
            <li> great product....sent quicky</li>
            <li> After searching high and low for a good sunscreen with a low EWG.org/skindeep safety rating and safe ingredients, I settled on this sunscreen. After getting to our vacation destination, I noticed in fine print on the bottle that it says under &amp;#34;Directions&amp;#34; on its back label:  &amp;#34;Use a water resistant sunscreen if swimming or sweating.&amp;#34; THIS ISN&#x27;T WATER RESISTANT!  Use it with caution. It&#x27;s a great product, but won&#x27;t do you a lick of good if you&#x27;re putting it on your kids before they get in a pool. We&#x27;ve resolved to use it only on the adults that will be staying dry. Great product, small {but important} flaw.</li>
            <li> So far so good! Goes on white but will blend in with rubbing. I have used this on my child&#x27;s face and my own as well and no issues. And it lasts a while too on the skin.</li>
            <li> As you have read from other reviews, this sunscreen is recommended by dermatologists and people swear by this sunscreen.  I wanted to add some information regarding the difference between the &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Baby&amp;#34; sunscreens.  And I would like to attest to the fact that it is really &#x27;sensitive&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what happened:&lt;br /&gt;I use a product called Balneol (to prevent hemorrhoids - awesome stuff by the way).  It is a white bottle with a blue lid and blue writing (sound familiar!).  So one morning, before my coffee and half asleep, I accidentally used this sunscreen where it is NOT supposed to be used - because the sun NEVER, EVER shines there!  I was expecting the skin on that very sensitive part of my body to start to sting or burn.... but it didn&#x27;t!  Now granted, I wiped it off as quickly as I could - but the sunscreen is water-resistent, so it is hard to really completely remove it.  And I was so surprised and truly relieved that when the product said &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; it really was &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34;!!!!  Now granted I don&#x27;t recommend you do this experiment yourself - but having been the reluctant guinea pig, I can truly attest that it is ok for &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27;!!!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Difference between &amp;#34;Baby&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34;: I called the company to find out whether I should get the &amp;#34;baby or sensitive&amp;#34; formula for my 2 year old twins (oh, did I mention twins?  That may be why I was so tired and accidentally used the wrong product!!!)  The person I spoke to said that the two products are really very similar and she recommended getting whichever one was cheaper at the time because they are both equally good and equally sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that you may benefit from my mistake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS/Update from May 2017: My kids are now almost 5 years old and we are still using this sunscreen.  However Blue Lizard has another version called &amp;#34;Sport&amp;#34;.  It is meant to last longer on the skin, even when swimming or sweating heavily (their website says 240 minutes in whirlpool water).  The sport version does have chemicals (e.g., parabens) whereas the sensitive/baby does not.  And the sport version is much &amp;#34;runnier&amp;#34; (the sensitive/baby versions are very thick and takes a moment to rub in) whereas the sport version rubs in very quickly and easily.  I end up using both.  I use the sensitive/baby on days when we are out in the sun, but not direct sun all day long (e.g., going to a park).  And I use the sport version when we are going to the beach or hanging out all day at a pool.  So if you are anti-chemical and want only natural ingredients, stick with the baby/sensitive versions.  But if you prefer no chemicals, but are willing to use them on occasion (e.g., all day at the beach) then you may want to try the sport version as well.r sweating heavily (their website says 240 minutes in whirlpool water).

            <li> this is the best sunscreen that we used in thailand after a derm recommended it. It does turn your skin a bit white but it is awesome!</li>
            <li> I try to use mineral-based sunscreens as often as possible because I believe they are safer and healthier.  Also, the chemical kinds sometimes make my skin break out. That said, I have tried many &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; mineral sunscreens in my quest to find the best.  Blue Lizard Sensitive Skin has won out in the end. It is not super greasy like most other brands I tried. The ingredient list is not perfectly pure, but I&#x27;m okay with a little compromise. This absorbs, but does leave a white tint. Because of the white tint, I won&#x27;t wear this as a regular daily sunscreen for when I&#x27;m meeting friends for lunch or where I expect pictures to be taken. However, I do wear it when I go hiking or walking at the park every weekend. The white tint doesn&#x27;t bother me when I&#x27;m about to spend an hour or two in nature or by the pool. But, for regular daily use, I have to use something clear that wears well under make up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Blue Lizard for a while now and it has truly been the best sunscreen for my skin. I use it in Miami and I don&#x27;t get burned. Plus the price was excellent. I saw a review that said they only got 1 bottle. I got 2</li>
            <li> excellent broad spectrum physical barrier sunscreen free of chemicals</li>
            <li> I love this!  After ruining a bunch of white shirts with the cheap spray lotions for my kids, I switched to this.  It does not stain clothes, is very effective because we have yet to get sunburns, and a little goes a long way.  This is our new sunscreen going forward for our littlest ones (2 years old) to us as parents.  One bottle for the whole family!</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I buy for my fair-skinned family. It&#x27;s expensive, but worth the price.</li>
            <li> Makes your face and skin white so expect some ribbing from your friends and weird looks from strangers.  I guess it works to block the sun though.</li>
            <li> last a long time and cant beat the price</li>
            <li> The only sunscreen my family uses. I&#x27;m a fair skinned, freckled, non-tanning redhead and this is what I use (I use the face type everyday for my face). I have never been burnt using this, and I use it sparingly. I have two sons (5 and 7) and they have also never been burnt using this. It goes on nice and the white color fades after a minute. Doesn&#x27;t smell and doesn&#x27;t contain parabens. I had to go to a skin cancer specialist at Johns Hopkins and have something surgically removed from my foot a couple years ago, I was talking with one of the doctors about sunscreen and she used this for herself and her small child. Had never heard of the brand before that, but if it&#x27;s good enough for a skin cancer specialist at Hopkins, it&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li> After a recent battle with melanoma it was time to up my sunscreen game. Being redheaded and fair complected I needed something good. This stuff is AWESOME! I love the outdoors so I don&#x27;t want to avoid the sun completely. I also love that the bottle turns blue in UV Rays. This gives you a good guage on whether to seek shade for a bit the brighter the bottle turns. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Very white but rubs in.  Protect well and nice to be free of nasty chemicals...at least I hope so.</li>
            <li> Our baby has very sensitive skin, and has eczema flare ups at near nothing. Blue Lizard was recommended by our pediatrician. We used this everyday for a week on our baby while at the beach, and had no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Have used a few times.  Good upf. Starts white and thick on skin. Works in easily to almost unnoticeable film. Makes my skIn moist and healthier.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a natural sunscreen. Works good, not too heavy and rubs in well (for a zinc based product)</li>
            <li> Product delivered quickly!! Love this sunscreen!! No nasty chemicals!</li>
            <li> I have to use good sun block for the prevention of skin cancer. At our high altitude where we have a lot sunny days, it is a necessity. This is the best made, hand down. A lot of the products made here have chemicals that are not good for the skin. This is a physical sunblock, not chemical.</li>
            <li> I bought five different kinds of suncreen to find the best on the market without retinyl palmitate. This was it by a landslide. Besides, the blue bottle is fun!</li>
            <li> Purchased 6/8/15 and took it to Hawaii for vacation. Big mistake. The formula has changed, It Is NOT Waterproof. Many reviewers said they used this on beach vacations, but those reviews are old. Please read current reviews only and understand the bottle does not have the words &amp;#34;80 minutes water resistant&amp;#34;, so it is not water resistant at all. Only use if you will stay dry on land.</li>
            <li> This lotion was recommended by the Dr for our 8 month old grandson when we went to the Caribbean. The lotion went on easily and no smell. Another great feature is the bottle actually turns blue based on the intensity of the sun so you knew when it apply and reminded you to reapply. It was amazing when it was cloudy yet the bottle turning blue told us the lotion was still needed for protection. Even as sensitive as our grandson&#x27;s skin is, there was no reaction to this lotion which provided excellent protection!</li>
            <li> First lets get the EWG rating out of the way. Blue lizard SPF 30 sensitive has a rating of 1.  1!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work?  Ya. Better than any other sunscreen I have used.  This includes all the brand names like coppertone or banana boat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But do you have to reapply it every other minute?  No. I am Caucasian but I have skin that tans easily. I will still burn though with prolonged exposure. I recently purchased blue lizard for a Florida vacation. I put the sunblock on about 10 minutes before going out. I go out and plop down on a lounge chair from 10-1. Get in and out of the pool a few times. Sweat like crazy in the 90+ degree sun. Go inside and take a nap. Reapply sunblock and go back out from 4-8 and sweat, swim, and lay in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you look like a ghost or does this stuff rub in?  I did not have a problem with it leaving a white tint on my skin. It won&#x27;t completely rub in like a spray on sunscreen or regular lotion. But it won&#x27;t be a white streaky mess.  I tried a badger sunscreen before blue lizard and stopped using it because not only did it not work but it was a thick and messy and made me look like Casper the chubby ghost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it feel on your skin?  I will tell you that I don&#x27;t like wearing anything on my skin. I don&#x27;t wear makeup. I rarely use lotion on my body. I tolerate the sunblock because I don&#x27;t want to burn. Blue lizard feels like any other sun product I have used except that it has a bit of a waxy feel to it. So it doesn&#x27;t feel like bare skin, but it&#x27;s not much different than regular sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you have to spread it on with a putty knife?  NO!  This is the biggest difference between blue lizard and other mineral sunblocks. It goes on really well. It spreads evenly and quickly. Even my husband commented that is went on really well compared to the Badger. Some people complain that mineral sunblock is hard to remove. I just soaped up as usual and scrubbed with a washcloth and my skin was clear with not a lot of effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it smell like hippies?  No. It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything. Odor free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to blue lizard&#x27;s website this product is NOT tested on animals. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last words on blue lizard.&lt;br /&gt;I still got a tan but didn&#x27;t burn. I didn&#x27;t run around looking like a streaky ghost. I didn&#x27;t have to soak my body in chemicals in order to keep from burning. Will buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in no way associated with blue lizard and was not asked to review this product. I do this out of the goodness of my heart so other people who like to research products before they buy have a true understanding of how a product works.th not a lot of effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it smell like hippies?  No. It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything. Odor free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to blue lizard&#x27;s website this product is NOT tested on animals.

            <li> A friend recommended this to me based on her dermatologist/oncologist telling her it was the best out there.  (Her husband has had treatment for melanoma.)  The very first time the kids and I used it, we ALL got a sunburn.  We were playing in the sprinkler in the backyard and this must have completely washed off.  4 red heads in one family, I consider myself an expert at applying sunscreen and being cautious. I&#x27;ll be tucking the bottle away and using in the winter months just so I don&#x27;t feel I wasted the money.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen...my dermatologist recommended it for its broad protection.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but well worth it as it appears to work very well.</li>
            <li> Very effective sunscreen. Also does a good job protecting against windburn.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist is happy with the protection Blue Lizard gives my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a light skinned African american and when I used this I looked really strange.  Kind of an iridescent grey, no matter how much I rubbed it in.</li>
            <li> Great protection from the sun. I&#x27;m currently using it on myself (sensitive skin/ rosecea) and my two daughters for when I take them to their weekend soccer games...we can be out there for a few hours. My daughters did not complain about any kind of sweat run-off either. It goes on a bit white, so I simply apply small quantities and rub in as needed. This brand came highly recommended by my children&#x27;s pediatrician.</li>
            <li> Great for sun protection but very difficult to rub into your skin. It kind of just sits on top.</li>
            <li> Fantastic  sunscreen. Worked flawlessly in strong tropical sun. Goes on with a white cast but fades within 10 minutes to your skin color. Believe the reviews. We are converts!</li>
            <li> Dermatoligist recommended.  Doctor says this brand is better than anything put out by US companies.  It has to do with contents and their preparation technique.  Use it every day.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen was recommended by my pediatrician, and I tried it from a sample she had before I bought it. You only need a tiny amount and it covers really well and doesn&#x27;t leave a white reside as most mineral sunscreens do. It&#x27;s the best and we&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m african-american and have extremely sensitive skin. Every time i travel to the caribbean, i burn and look like a lobster even when i apply sunscreen. This is possibly due to the fact that, previously, i wasn&#x27;t applying the sunscreen often enough. I recently went on a cruise and was determined not to burn! i slathered on this stuff before i went out in the sun and reapplied every couple of hours and after swimming( i even burn on areas covered by my bathing suit). i think this is key no matter what brand of sunscreen you use. the only time i got burned was when i forgot to apply it.  Apparently, blue lizard is the gold standard of sunscreens. if it works for me, it should work for anybody.</li>
            <li> We have used this for a month now and while I thought it was great at first, but we found out the hard way that it is not waterproof.  I assumed because it has zinc oxide, it would be fine for pool/beach time.  When my 5 year old came back from the beach with a sunburn, I was shocked.  The sunscreen was put on diligently every 90 minutes but apparently  it washed off in the water soon after application.  I wanted to like it, it didn&#x27;t irritate my kids&#x27; eyes when it was put on the face.  However, check the bottle and check the description - not waterproof. Beware with the pool use.</li>
            <li> I have very very very sensitive skin and this sunblock worked GREAT! The same as a $35.00 sunblock I used to buy at Sephora. You must blend in the sunblock well into your skin as not to leave any white streaks but totally worth it. 2 days back to back in the sun and no sun burn.</li>
            <li> I am a very fair skinned red head who burns easily. I tried this because I wanted to remove toxic chemicals from my daily use and wanted an alternative to &amp;#34;Coppertone&amp;#34;. The particular brand was a bit less expensive than the other mineral based sunscreens. I still burned with this brand.  I applied it liberally and repeated every 2 hours or so. I still burned! I am now trying my hand at making my own sunscreen. First batch was super easy and about a $30 up front to start and still have plenty of each of the ingredients to make loads more. I got my info off the web and products from Amazon. I think I will pursue this route instead. Still LOVE Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen. I like the fact that it  contains zinc oxide and is very skin sensitive. It stays on very well and lasts. I also use the blue lizard face sunscreen and use it under my foundation.</li>
            <li> Goes on runny and is not waterproof and my kids live in the pool so this was not a good purchase.  Not to mention the price is ridiculous.  I&#x27;ll be sticking with Babyganics from now on.</li>
            <li> Great for my sun-sensitive family on our trip to Panama</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product. This is my second order. Excellent sun coverage. Goes on heavy but it very comfortable. I use it for  training for triathlons. No problems with sweat</li>
            <li> This product goes on with a slight sheen to the skin. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, instead the sheen is helpful to determine where you already applied the sunscreen. It goes on more easily than other sunscreens with high zinc &amp; titanium percentage. It is also very effective without making you look like a ghost, as some products with zinc can do and it&#x27;s cheaper. Finally, environmental working group (ewg.org) gives it a safe rating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m outside all day everyday and I can definitely tell a difference in the redness of my face when I don&#x27;t apply this product. It&#x27;s thick. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have a slight allergy to the sun and even at 30 this does a great job of protecting me.  I’ll always use this product.</li>
            <li> I tried some of the Blue Lizard sunscreens and this was my least favorite.  The consistency was too liquid and the zinc oxide left me white, like a Japanese Geisha.  The Face is much better.</li>
            <li> Son had sensitivity to sunlight due to a medicine. This was the best sunscreen we tried out of many.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. I work outside and have Irish skin.  This stuff is thick and harder to rub in than most other sunscreens but it doesn&#x27;t feel gross or sticky, and never runs into my eyes.  It&#x27;s way more waterproof than most competitors and seems to last forever, I never burn as long as I remember to use it.  A little seems to go a long way due to how thick it is. Its thickness can be a touch problematic on hairier arms and legs.  Zinc and titanium are the only ingredients you should see in a quality sunblock.</li>
            <li> love blue lizard;  delivery was seamless</li>
            <li> One of the best sunscreens</li>
            <li> This stuff is good no allergic reaction so far.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I wish this wasn&#x27;t SOOO expensive.&lt;br /&gt;But, after having a horrible experience going the cheap route using Sun Bum Moisturizing Sunscreen Lotion on my 2 year old (horrid, red flaming rash for weeks), I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is applies easily and isn&#x27;t oily.&lt;br /&gt;No smell&lt;br /&gt;Seems to work (wish it was higher SPF; I like to put it on my kids before school and not worry about their teachers forgetting to reapply).&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, my very very sensitive skin 2 year old has NO problems with it at all.  Phew!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Tends to leave a white hue but you won&#x27;t get burnt with this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with skin cancer for a number of years now and was looking for a good physical sunscreen that was affordable.  Blue Lizard gave me both.  It goes on almost like paint and fades after wearing it for awhile.  I find it works very well and protects me from that evil shiny ball in the sky, the sun.  If you are looking for a solid performing sunscreen then Blue Lizard gets my vote.  My next purchase will be the Sport variety since it is waterproof.</li>
            <li> great sunscreen, my derm recommended iget this. its thick so you can see where you are putting it. bottle turns blue in sunlight to remind you your in uv light</li>
            <li> no burn expected in Cozumel</li>
            <li> Yes, it is pricey compared to the chemical sunscreens, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the performance! After heavy research concerning chemical sunscreens versus physical sunscreens, we made the decision to switch completely to the physical sunscreens for safety concerns. I&#x27;m glad we went with Blue Lizard. To be clear, it will take a lot of work to get this rubbed in, and even then you will have a white sheen to you. But we were in the Bahamas for the week in June, spending most of the time in the water and at the beach and never got burned. Never got red. In fact, on the last day I did a bad job of reapplying just so I could get a tan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a safe alternative to chemical sunscreens, I can&#x27;t recommend BL enough. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, but it goes on easy. Just remember that you probably won&#x27;t be able to get rid of the white sheen completely.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this lotion works great ! I like how thick the lotion is  and I feel it protects against sunburn.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen because it has a great score in the EWG list.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 wks and I love it! It doesn&#x27;t leave a whitish skin if u rub it well.  It is worth it.  The delivery was excellent, fast and a great package.  Try it!</li>
            <li> Was disappointed to see that the bottle has a yellow, aged look and am wondering how old it is. Is this old stock? I know that sunscreen products lose effectiveness with extended shelf life. Don&#x27;t think I would order from this source again.</li>
            <li> Best sunblock I have ever used</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I can use without breaking out in hives. It is odorless but it is greasy. It works great but it is not water or sweat proof at all! I wore it while on a early morning hike in July and my skin was streak in white. I recommend putting it on at least a half hour before going out so it has time to absorb into the skin. If you do that you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
            <li> I live in the southwest where it is very sunny and have quite fair skin. If my sunscreen is not adequate my face gets...spotty.  Some are freckles, some are age or hormone related, all darken in the sun.  I find these spots unsightly but also figure they are an indicator that  some UV is getting through even if there is no tanning or burning.  In the past I have found that only a titanium and/or zinc oxide based sunscreen prevented the spots from darkening, When my previous sunscreen became unavailable I tested every titanium and/or zinc oxide based sunscreen on Amazon that looked like it had potential.  This one worked the best and isn&#x27;t terrible in terms rubbing in to avoid white streaks (apparently a universal problem with the oxide sunblocks, but a minor consideration next to doing the actual sun-blocking job).</li>
            <li> I researched a ton on EWG&#x27;s 2015 Guide to Sunscreens website and on Amazon poring through various reviews to purchase the best sunblock. In my opinion, the best sunblock is one with the highest UVA/UVB protection that poses the lowest health risk. This product came out tops during my research and I was excited when it also absorbed well into the skin without looking like Casper the Ghost. However, 45 minutes in the late-afternoon 4:00pm sun at the pool had my kids completely darkened--not burnt, but seriously browned. How did it go wrong with so many nice reviews all over the internet? And it was very peculiar b/c the effect of how the exposed skin became darkened seemed like this product acted like a tanning lotion! I was so upset. Glad I tested this product out at home before using it in the Caribbean. Sadly, I have to go back to the toxic brands for now until I can find a healthier yet better deflecting yet less-toxic sunblock.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  My husband is having problems with being in the sun, and this product was recommended by a friend.  Blue Lizard is light and not greasy, has a very light but pleasant scent (which disappears quickly).  Besides that, you can watch the bottle turn blue in the sun...very cool!</li>
            <li> not greasy at all, and works for hours</li>
            <li> Exceptional sunscreen! This was suggested by my dermatologist. I used this daily while on a beach trip to Puerto Rico. I spread it all over like a moisturizer. It rubs in extremely well. No blaring white residue like similar sunscreens that contain physical sun barriers. After 7 days in a bikini on the beach...not one sunburn or redness for that matter! It is the only thing I use on my 4 yr old with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you think this is just another slick name sunscreen with fancy marketing words, think again. This sunBLOCK is fantastic. It&#x27;s white and goes on white, BUT, with a little extra effort, it will disappear into your skin nicely so you won&#x27;t look like a vaudeville comedian from the &#x27;30&#x27;s. Has zinc and titanium dioxide, the two that you want in a sunBLOCK. This stuff is great for sensitive skin as well and will not clog your pores. No parabens, no nasty harmful chemicals and no smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kid has acne (and taking Accutane) and everything he has tried makes things worse. THIS stuff however does not irritate or bother his skin. He actually wants to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT HAS 64 REVIEWS WITH 53 FIVE STARS, 8 FOUR STARS, 2 THREE STARS AND ONLY 1 ONE STAR BECAUSE THE IDIOT THOUGHT THERE WERE TWO BEING SHIPPED BASED ON THE PICTURE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If nothing else, the above figure of 95% four and five stars (AND from scattered dates so they aren&#x27;t fake blasted reviews) should tell you&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a product worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well worth the money in my opinion based on one thing and one thing only: it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen rubs in so much easier than other zinc oxide creams.</li>
            <li> This is a very good sunscreen product. It doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes &amp; provides great protection!  The bottle turns blue when exposed to UV light - so you have a great indicator reminding you the rays are out even when it&#x27;s cloudy.</li>
            <li> This is worth the money as it doesn&#x27;t have all the bad chemicals that most sunscreen has but, even if you don&#x27;t care about that, it works so well. It goes on thick and a little white but it absorbes right away and doesn&#x27;t leave an excessive oil. It is the first sunscreen that I can use on my face and it doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out. It doesn&#x27;t mess up my nail polish like most sunscreens do and it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes if you are in the water. Love this sunscreen!!!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist highly recommends the Blue Lizard sunscreen products and I have used them for several years now.  In my opinion, I get better protection than from any other sunscreent.</li>
            <li> Works great if you plan on being at the beach all day. Long lasting and applies on thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 8-10 different &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; sunscreens. This is the only one that applies easily and protects well, while also not being filled with harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen out there! We are all fair skinned and never come away from a beach vacation without a burn, after using this product all that has changed. The best part was being able to reapply on the face &amp; under the eyes on the kids without it stinging !  Not a sun burn to be seen after a week in the ocean and on the beach in sunny Florida. Love this product &amp; highly recommend!  ( No matter the product, one has to reapply regularly!</li>
            <li> I only buy this sunscreen for my daughter who has multiple food and contact allergies and eczema.  It is the only thing we have found that does not irritate her skin or cause her to welp up with hives.  It is more expensive than other brands, but so worth it!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I went to Mexico for a week and bought this to bring along because it has zinc. Zinc is one of the best things for sunscreen because instead blocking and absorbing rays like typical sunscreen, zinc actually reflects the rays back away from the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anytime I was going to the pool or beach for a few hours+ I&#x27;d put this stuff on and head over. It lasted 3-4 hours not going into the water. If I went in the water it would last about 2 hours. Some folks say this stuff doesn&#x27;t show as white on you, but it does. It looks faintly white and if you are tanned it almost makes your skin look pink. I have somewhat sensitive skin and had no breakouts or irritation on my face or body using this. After a week in Mexico, I was not slightly burned at all, but had a great tan that has lasted about a month and counting! I will continue buying this brand for the summer. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Having a child with extremely sensitive skin (and food allergies), this sunscreen is amazing! We have had no breakout issues or any sunburns</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I have ever used because it is the first one I have ever used that does not break out my skin from head to toe.  I can even use this on my face which is particularly sensitive.  I like that there is no scent at all.  It is very thick - remember to shake the bottle well and if you work on specific areas at a time you can rub it all in without having a white film on your skin.  Prevented sun burn throughout my recent week at the beach.</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema and very sensitive skin. I find this sunscreen does not irritate her skin and gives her good protection.</li>
            <li> Just back from a tour of Utah&#x27;s national parks and monuments - hot and very sunny but we were well protected from&lt;br /&gt;the damaging sun rays with our Facial Blue Lizard and normal Blue Lizard for our arms and legs. No burn or tan. Love that zinc oxide that is transparent and very recommended by our dermatogist.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. We are a family who is in the water constantly when on beach vacations. We would put it on, then go into the water for hours, and when we came out, we could see the water still beading up on our skin. None of us got burned when using this. Yes, it does take a while to get it rubbed in, but it is so worth it!! Even though this is more expensive on the front-end, we saved money in the ling run because we would only have to reapply one other time per day (we might not have even needed that), so we used WAY less than the bottles and bottles of sunscreen we usually go through on a vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist recommended this, and it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Will never use another sunscreen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen so far this spring/summer, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  I have very fair skin, and I like that it&#x27;s easy to see where you&#x27;re applying it, and it rubs in well.  Wore it for a 5-hour flea market outing, and reapplied only once...no sunburn!  I will definitely be re-ordering this one.</li>
            <li> Just used this on a vacation to Florida. Not one of my family got sunburned and my one son who has Eczema seemed to do well with this lotion. I would recommend. I&#x27;ve purchased many other lotions and have paid a ton of money for them. I will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for kids and free from all the junk in other children&#x27;s sunscreens. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff really keeps the sun off I would have given it five stars but it comes out of the container too fast, wasting product and making a mess; maybe that is to make sure you use enough once you wipe it off the floor. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> the only suntan lotion that doesnt give my son a rash. easy to wash off my hands after application too which is a definite benefit. we use this exclusively and have been very happy</li>
            <li> love the product and shipping was good for this item too</li>
            <li> My wife bought this sunscreen and a bunch of other similar brands as she&#x27;s on a minimalist ingredient kick.  Used Blue Lizard Sensitive in FL for long beach days (yes very frequently reapplied for reasons - see below) for our kids and yes it does work to block/reduce the sun&#x27;s rays so that&#x27;s not in question however there are some substantial downsides that the husband/father (me) doesn&#x27;t like.  1) it&#x27;s not the easiest by half stuff to apply nearly akin to pure zinc oxide it takes a lot of rubbing to get it to at least not look like you are walking around looking like a pasty mime, the kids both hate it because of that; 2) it&#x27;s not water proof or even water resistant.  Some of their lines are water resistant but the sensitive version eschews the chemical that adds the resistance.  Which means you have to reapply every time you go in the water.  Which means if you plan on spending any substantial time swimming playing in the surf/water/pool you may be exposed to sun burn.  Oh, and it also seems rather expensive.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to almost all over-the-counter sun screen products and many of the products supposedly designed for sensitive skins.  This is one of few I can use and it is effective.  The only complaint is that it leaves the skin chalky white even after I rub it in well.  The effectiveness also only lasts about a year.</li>
            <li> Works very well to block the sun without adding harmful cancer causing chemicals to your day. A bonus is that if one rubs it in a bit more than your usual petrol based block it doesn&#x27;t make you look pasty white like a lot of zinc bases healthy blocks. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> A quality product and my wife heartily supports it.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t smell like sun screen</li>
            <li> The only sunscreen we ever use as a family. Great coverage and best ingredients. My only gripe is the lotion comes out very quickly...just don&#x27;t squeeze the bottle and the amount will be right.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I have used on my children in 4 years. I apply it once liberally before sun exposure and then only have to reapply touch ups on the sunburn prone areas (nose, shoulders, etc.) every couple of hours while in the sun. My kids swim constantly and this keeps them protected.</li>
            <li> I found this to work great but be thick enough it&#x27;s difficult to apply and rub in. I&#x27;m not sure it ever rubs completely clear on the skin but I&#x27;m extremely fair skinned so it&#x27;s not a big worry for me. However this is just not easy enough to apply for me to use it daily, ice relegated it to my dive bag.</li>
            <li> If you are serious about sun protection, this is the product you need. Nothing but physical blockers titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. Sure it can look pasty, but it rubs in nicely (and my skin happens to be very fair, so it&#x27;s not much of a problem anyway). It spreads smoothly. It lasts once it&#x27;s on, and the only times I&#x27;ve gotten a minor burn while using it is if I missed a spot or forgot to reapply. Other than those rare instances, I have not had a sunburn since I started using this. I trust it completely, and it&#x27;s now paraben free! Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has stayed fair and healthy in a Southern California climate with this sunscreen. Excellent product (tip: once you try it and love it, get the gallon jug--way cheaper per gallon. Also, the baby formula is exactly the same as this one, and is less expensive at this point in time). Get it and your skin will thank you!</li>
            <li> I had never heard of Blue Lizard but ordered it after reading so many positive reviews on Amazon. Two days after I ordered Blue Lizard I walked into my dermatologist&#x27;s office and they had brochures in the waiting room recommending Blue Lizard to their patients. Interesting coincidence.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen ever -</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen.  Gives good protection for kids and doesn&#x27;t have any of those harsh chemicals and works well for my sensitive skin kids.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen around!! its very light and it feels like you are not wearing sunscreen unlike most feel greasy and makes you want to wash your hands after apply. It is not water proof but great for outside play.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. EWG rating #1. Not thick &amp; sticky, easily applied. A touch pricey but slightly cheaper on the amazon site vs. buying directly from Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li> This is the best!!! I purchase this every year for my fair, freckled, ginger son. It is the only thing that I have ever used that works on him. I have used many other sunscreens and he would still burn. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product everyday this summer - and it&#x27;s great! My skin usually can&#x27;t handle daily sunscreen usage, but this guy is so mild and gentle that my skin is holding up great. I also love how this product feels on my skin - it&#x27;s thick and moisturizing, takes some rubbing to get it to blend in. Kind of reminds me of Eucerin cream - texture-wise - but without the lasting weightiness. My skin is dry to combo, and loves the moisturizing quality of this sunscreen, BUT I think this product could potentially be a bit much if you have oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint it that this product is not sweat-resistant as well. In the summer heat, my sweat and this product don&#x27;t go together well - which is hard for my daily routine of biking to work in 85-90 F. So, if you&#x27;re planning on sweating at all I recommend trying the sport sunscreen or the baby sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Works well. It goes on white, so you know if you are covered. My son actually called me a yeti the first time I used this sunscreen since I did look like a snow monster. After a few minutes it does absorb and your skin looks less yeti-like. Best of all though it really does work. I burn in something like 10 minutes, and this sunscreen works for me.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Can&#x27;t find it locally and alwayss order on line.  Have a friend hooked, too.  Great for lots of sun exposure, i.e. motorcycles, swimming, gardening, etc.</li>
            <li> Great protection for all ages ... Rubs in and disappears. Have used it for years, was recommended by our dermatologist</li>
            <li> for the longest time, I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena&#x27;s beach defense sunscreen Until I read the EWG report, and then I fell in love with this sunscreen. however I have to say the moment I touched and smelled it, I was like... desitin?! (or any of those diaper rash soothing cr&amp;egrave;me for babies) it truly works because I immediately noticed my dark spots faded within the first week so noticeable that it&#x27;s not even a guessing game no more.  because this cream is so thick, just squeeze one drop on your finger and apply to your face in circular motion until it doesn&#x27;t appear white and gets absorbed all over the area then you can add another dab or two to protect the sensitive area from sun exposure.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen.  It does take a little effort to get it rubbed in good so it doesn&#x27;t look white on the skin, however, once applied it lasts several hours and keeps you from burning.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff over others.  It&#x27;s not too greasy, and goes on easily on hard to cover areas like my chest.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this. I hate wearing sunscreen but I don&#x27;t mind this - it goes on very thick but after a minute you don&#x27;t feel it there. Other brands I&#x27;ve bought make me feel like I&#x27;m wearing saran wrap - ugh. I will probably keep using this brand as long as I can get my hands on it.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely THE best sunscreen for sensitive skin. It goes on nicely, does not clog my pores, and best of all - doesn&#x27;t sting, burn or irritate my face or skin.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m quite happy with this sunscreen.  It was on the recommended list from my dermatologist, and it also was listed as one of the best sunscreens from the EWG - rating of 1.  Yes, it is something that you have to &amp;#34;work in&amp;#34; a bit, but if it&#x27;s not harming my skin, I don&#x27;t mind!  A little sidelight - my kids think the UV color changing bottle is great - they always want to check the bottle outside to see if they need to wear sunscreen!  The bottle changes from it&#x27;s usual white to blue when there are UV rays present.  It even works on a cloudy day, which surprised my little ones - a good reminder that they need to wear sunscreen even when they can&#x27;t see the sun.</li>
            <li> Excellent sun protection for red headed toddler in Texas!  Goes on smoothly, soaks in quickly and does not irritate her sensitive skin.  She has eczema but no problems with this product.  Lasts much longer than the other products I&#x27;ve tried.  Before, DD was coming home from summer swim camp with new freckles every day,  but now I apply this in the morning, and the freckles have stopped. Great stuff</li>
            <li> We used this on our recent trip to Hawaii, and it worked great! After tons of research on the EWG and trying numerous brands, we have found the perfect blend of &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; (high ratings on the EWG website) and usability (rubs in well and does not stay white). My kids hate sunscreen in general...who doesn&#x27;t, but my whole family agreed this was a good choice.</li>
            <li> The best ever!!! My kids don&#x27;t mind wearing it and I feel great knowing they&#x27;re covered and protected.</li>
            <li> I found this lotion through it&#x27;s high ranking on EWG&#x27;s website. And we love it!  Goes on easily and runs in great.  Love that the bottle turns blue when exposed to uv Rays.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen was amazing and I would definitely order it again and recommend this product for anyone going on vacation with very white sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have dermatitis that &amp;#34;blooms&amp;#34; from many different products.  This sunscreen is a great sunscreen, very water resistant (which does make it difficult to wash off), feels a bit tacky when it is on my skin.  But the major downside for me was the itching.  I itched all over.  It took a few days to stop, despite steroid creams.  I have now put the nearly-full bottle in the guest room in case someone else wants it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for me...it&#x27;s very greasy and heavy and I swear it is what caused me to get heat rash by blocking my pores and not allowing my sweat to be released while I was hiking.  Perhaps it would be all right if you just wanted to lounge by the pool with a mister cooling you off...but not for any strenuous exercise.</li>
            <li> the bottle turns she exposed to UV rays.  It stays on very well.  Used on the beach for a week and none of us burned</li>
            <li> My two kids ages 5 and 6 have very fair sensitive skin, and this sunscreen is only one have found that doesn&#x27;t burn on contact. Everything else I have tried, they will complain that it burns on contact with the most sensitive areas like their cheeks and neck,except blue lizard.  This summer we have spent a lot of time in the sun and nobody has burned. This stuff is thick , and you need time to rub it in, but it&#x27;s worth it for the coverage.  I have a bottle in each car, the pool bag and each bathroom. It&#x27;s pricy but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good.  I haven&#x27;t gotten a sunburn since getting it.  My dermatologist recommends sunscreen with either titanium or zinc oxide, and this stuff has them both.  And the bottle turns blue in the presence of UV.  It&#x27;s a good way of reminding: &amp;#34;the sun is out!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen a lot.  It goes on easy, but takes a bit of rubbing to disappears.  It comes out of the bottle quickly, but I like that.  My kids occasionally complain that it stings their eyes.  A friend told me the baby one in the pink bottle avoids this issue, but I&#x27;m happy enough with this product.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for serious sun areas, like Florida and Hawaii (where I&#x27;ve used it.)  It lasts through swimming and provides unbeatable sun block.  It is not lightweight or suitable for use on faces, but a real pro for the body.</li>
            <li> I love that this sunscreen has less chemicals. It is hard to find in a store, so I always buy it on Amazon. I also like that the bottle turns blue.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a sunburn in 7 years. I had melanoma and am very careful. I used this sunscreen 1 time. And was in indirect sunlight - ended up with a horrible burn on my neck shoulders and arms.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and seller! Would highly recommend this seller!</li>
            <li> After having skin cancer removed from my chest, my dermatologist recommended this brand of sun block. I use it on myself &amp; on my 15 month old daughtet</li>
            <li> I like the lotion and it protects well.  But it is very difficult to rub in.  Very Thick.</li>
            <li> Blue Lizzard Australian Sunscreen is the most effective sunscreen I have ever used with a very high saftey level. Compared to most sunscreens, this one has the least amount of toxins in it. The only other low level toxin sunscreens are some of the sunscreens made specifically for infants. I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and have not burned once. With a high level of cancer in my genes, including skin cancer, I am very careful with the products I use and their effectiveness.</li>
            <li> the best sunscreen you could ever buy, this was recommended by my daughters doctor because she has sensitive and very fair skin.  I have ben using this for several years and she has never had a sunburn yet.  And we do beach vacations 2x year and also swimming. The need to reapply is not as often as most sunscreens, mainly face and shoulders where it gets rubbed off easily.</li>
            <li> Works great not too expensive. Bottle seems to last all summer for our 2 year old.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Does not take very much to cover.</li>
            <li> I was not really impressed. It was difficult to rub in and I didn&#x27;t like the feel of it.</li>
            <li> Came on time. Like this brand.</li>
            <li> Fantastic sunscreen - I&#x27;ve tried many &amp; found this one to be the best</li>
            <li> it is much too difficult to apply unless you want to walk around with a white face</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen on the market. Especially if you have sensitive skin. I have tried every brand on the market, including some from the dermatologist office. Most of them either reacted with my skin by stinging my face or not preventing sunburn. I actually use this every day living in Florida and is the best stuff ever! A little goes a long way. This is the only stuff I use on myself and my children.</li>
            <li> excellent product. a little bit greasy though... when u apply it on your face and then use your phone to make a call, u will find white stains on ur phone screen.</li>
            <li> Works well at protecting from the sun.  Goes on thick, especially with hair (good luck getting it to go on smooth of you have thick arm hair or haven&#x27;t shaved in a few days).</li>
            <li> The sunscreen may be working to block the UVB/UVA rays. At least, I&#x27;ll assume it is. However, I&#x27;m tanning exponentially -- and I don&#x27;t want the tan. I use generous amounts of sunscreen half an hour before I swim open water with my swim club once a week from 10:30am-11:30am. Prime tanning hours, I know. But that&#x27;s the schedule. I live in the Bay Area, so it&#x27;s not a tropical sun. I do have Pacific Island heritage, so I am prone to tanning. Not sure I can blame Blue Lizard about my increasing, unwanted tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can subtract stars from is the packaging. The bottle doesn&#x27;t like heat. Again, San Francisco &amp;#34;heat&amp;#34; is mild. If I leave the bottle in my swim bag (under the sun) for more than 10 minutes, when I pop the top to open the bottle the sunscreen &amp;#34;explodes&amp;#34;. Gobs spew out everywhere. Every time the bottle is heated, it happens. Don&#x27;t shake the heated bottle before you pop the top, it guarantees spewage. And it&#x27;s zinc oxide so it stains (until you wash it off). I don&#x27;t expose the bottle to the sun, because it explicitly says don&#x27;t do it. But it doesn&#x27;t like heat either. You get a big bottle, but you waste more than needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you rub the sunscreen thoroughly into your skin, it leaves a shiny, slightly greasy white sheen. This doesn&#x27;t bother me because I&#x27;m about to swim and don&#x27;t care what I look like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am looking for a new titanium dioxide/zinc oxide sunscreen to try.</li>
            <li> The sunblock didn&#x27;t block the sun and gave me a horrible skin rash which required a trip to the doctor for a steroid shot.</li>
            <li> My toddler daughter has very sensitive skin and her dermatologist recommended it. Normal drugstore sunscreens caused rashes and spots on her face and body. This is great product and all the skin problems disappeared.</li>
            <li> Love it. It works and lasts a long time. Good value.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful.  A blue eyed Irish girl doesn&#x27;t have a chance in the tropics in June, but Blue Lizard kept me sunburn free.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my child to take with her to high elevation in Arizona. Hot! She used it and loved it. Easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t leave the skin white and the bottle changes color when you&#x27;re in the sun. Will buy again for myself too!</li>
            <li> The Blue Lizard was recommended to me by my dermatologist, who also sees my girls. We all have different skin tones. My 12 year old is extremely fair and always burns, never tans. I used this on her daily on our recent trip to Mexico. She still burned.....that&#x27;s the bad news...the good news is that the rest of our family did not burn and the product worked extremely well. For skin tones that may burn at first and then tan the product is amazing. I would not recommend it for the fairest of fair skin types.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen!  DO a little research and you&#x27;ll find that not only does this sunscreen work well but it also is low toxicity.</li>
            <li> Will keep you from burning...just remember to wash it off vigorously.  Or you may wear it awhile...Dermatologist recommended.</li>
            <li> Great product, the kids really like how the bottle turns blue.</li>
            <li> My son has skin allergies. This is the only sunscreen that both works and doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin. We keep it in the emergency kit in the van at all times. Even a winter day can be bright enough for sunscreen! Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The best one I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;My family is pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of using zinc oxide instead of the other chemicals for a sunscreen, but unfortunately it is not overly water or sweat proof (the bottle even states so), which limits its use.  As with all zinc oxide products, it also leaves a slight white hue on you once applied, but it is not obvious unless you know about it.</li>
            <li> Currently this is my favorite sunscreen. I have been using it for a couple years now and it seems to do a good job of being natural for the most part while still providing good sun protection. Those who mind having a chalky zombie-esque complexion may take issue with how Blue Lizzard applies, while those who are simply seeking really good sun protection, should be pretty darn happy.</li>
            <li> works very well for sensitive skin, good for children, I saw this being sold at my Dermatologist&#x27;s office for quite a bit more.</li>
            <li> Helped us in the sunshine of Kenya and Tanzania!</li>
            <li> I had read that it takes a bit of rubbing to spread and get rid of the white but that was an understatement; it works but it is not water resistant and you walk around looking white. Was not impressed, too much work for having to re apply constantly.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite natural sunscreen. There are no harmful chemicals in it, as there are with major brands like Coppertone, Neutrogena, Banana Boat, Trader Joe&#x27;s, etc. What sets this apart from other sunscreens is that it actually rubs in without leaving white all over you. It lasts a long time, even after sweating and swimming a little. I use this when I am going to be in the sun in harsh environments and it has never let me down. I even use it on my face, no problem.</li>
            <li> Love this.  I love the fact that the bottle turns blue when UV is present.  I have Melanaoma Stage IV and knowing when I should wear sunscreen, since I hate to wear it, helps me out.  It gives me peace of mind.  I used it on my 3 year old as well and she has not had any skin reaction to it.  I ordered two bottles.  My mom will also be ordering and I will be ordering more.  This is given the highest rating on a melanoma website group I belong to.</li>
            <li> This sunblock is the best that I&#x27;ve found for my fair &amp; sensitive skinned boys. Goes on thick, but blends well. Great protection.</li>
            <li> Works very well and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a lot of research and tried many sunscreens including Babyganics, Honest Co., California Baby, Badger... This is the winner! Goes on easily, works very well, and is a safe product for my family! Rates excellent on EWG.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly on my face and it gives it a nice glow under makeup.  Rub it in good if you don&#x27;t want a white cast, but I happen to like that look.</li>
            <li> Used the entire bottle during the summer and am very pleased with the performance during my exposure to the sun everyday. Will definitely use again for protection.</li>
            <li> My sons react to regular retail brands-rash, sores, hotspots. With this sunscreen, we have not had any skin issue and have used the product for over a year now. Product also stays on pretty well in pools, lakes, etc.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen for adults and kids. I always burn in the summer if I&#x27;m out in the sun even when reapplying every hour or so with other sunscreens. This has not been a problem with this one. The only downside is that it is quite thick and takes a while to rub in, but other than that, it is great.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  I have had both basal cell and squamous cell cancer removed from my face.  The product is thick and white but if you continue to rub then it will fully disappear.  I put it on and by the time I get dressed it has soaked into my skin enough that I can put my foundation on without any problems.  It is slightly greasy at first but my skin seems to absorb it and handle it well.  I do have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen - such great quality!  It is definitely thick and takes some work to spread, but it is worth it to keep out those UV&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and it honestly works better then any of the chemical based ones of the past.  I use sunscreen all the time as I am a Ginger and though you have to rub the blue lizard in pretty good I honestly think it protects better then any of my sunscreens used in the past.  Two huge thumbs up from me and my family.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve used for my son. It is easy to apply and does not leave a greasy film. My son knows what I mean when I tell him we&#x27;re putting his lotion on to go outside. He doesn&#x27;t mind and it is so much better than an aerosol can. Definitely recommend and will buy again. I also love the fact that it&#x27;s expiration date is 2 years bs 1.  The photo shows how little has been used in about a month with generous amounts and multiples times.</li>
            <li> Did not provide as much protection as I expected. You should err on the side of putting on too much otherwise you may get burnt. If your skin is not distinctly white then you don&#x27;t have enough applied!</li>
            <li> Prevents burns but is very thick and difficult to rub in.</li>
            <li> I used this 2 years ago.  Switched to Badger after reading good things about them.  I am back to Blue Lizard after several sunburns while using Badger (And yes I did reapply after 2 hours as well as after swimming).  Problem with Badger is that I spend hours at a time in the surf and I guess it washes away more easily than Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li> This worked really well.  It didn&#x27;t sting when we put it on our faces.  Even my nephew who has eczema all over his face didn&#x27;t complain about stinging nor did it cause a rash on his face afterwards.  However, you do have to reapply every hour or so if you are constantly in the water.</li>
            <li> Over 15 years ago, my Dermatologist removed a small brown spot from my skin and diagnosed me with basal cell carcinoma.  This was a bit scary to me as I was very young.  I am very fair skinned, and suffered from sunburns my entire childhood.  On the advice of that doctor, my family has been using Blue Lizard sunscreen products now for almost 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My parents generation didn&#x27;t believe in using sunscreen.  I have been educated the hard way from the harmful effects of the sun, so I know how important it is to prevent them from BIRTH!  We have always made sure our kids were properly protected when going out in the sun.  That being said, our youngest had a small brown mole on the bottom of her foot from birth.  At age 5, the dermatologist began measuring the mole and said eventually it would have to be removed with surgery.  At age 8, we went ahead and had it taken off.  Now more than ever it is important to make sure that she never has a sunburn.  Blue Lizard, when applied properly and according to the package recommendations, is the best sunscreen I have ever used.  My daughter uses the sensitive formula because she has very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If these reasons aren&#x27;t enough, my husband suffers from a sort of sun allergy.  The ONLY sunscreen that keeps him from itching after sun exposure is Blue Lizard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works best if you apply it to dry skin, let it dry before going out in the sun, reapply as needed.</li>
            <li> Hard to apply but the best product out there when it comes to protecting and no bad chemicals as the other stuff.</li>
            <li> I love that this is all natural. It&#x27;s a little hard to rub in versus the Cology lotion I have that is the same infredients. But blue lizard is more potent so I will take looking chalky!</li>
            <li> Hands down the best sunscreen for kids and adults. It doesn&#x27;t wash off and it works, unlike the sprays. This seller offered a good price and shipping was fast. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Works really well but takes some effort to rub in.  We prefer the Vanicream SPF 50.</li>
            <li> bought this to compare with other &#x27;safe&#x27; rated sunscreens and this one doesn&#x27;t leave all the white zinc all over and is not sticky or tacky! I have to say this is the best one I have tried in years! will stop buying the others and go with Blue lizard form here on out!</li>
            <li> Great coverage. Goes on white but then turns clear after a bit.  I put it on my face every morning.</li>
            <li> Item as described Fast Shipping  A+++++</li>
            <li> Great product. Our girls have very sensitive skin and a friend recommended this. All mineral no chemicals no scent. Now we use nothing else. We use the sensitive version.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and deserves 5 stars, except that it&#x27;s NOT WATERPROOF/SWEATPROOF! When do you need sunscreen when you won&#x27;t be in the water or sweating? Not too often for me anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it sometimes makes your skin (or clothes) more white than most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Great no burns and no skin reaction!!  My kids felt good and I felt great knowing I wasn&#x27;t lathering toxins all over them.  Lower your price and make it more affordable to the average folk and I will be even happier :)</li>
            <li> This is amazing. What a great product! I use this every day since I&#x27;m outside working on a Navy range in the blistering sun and it&#x27;s the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. Won&#x27;t be buying anything else from now on.</li>
            <li> Wife does not like it, comes off</li>
            <li> Did not provide the protection I expected</li>
            <li> This worked every bit as well as the Blue Lizard&#x27;s face product. I am very fair skinned and generally will go to great lengths to avoid using sunblock, because it often stings the skin, and needs frequent re-application.  I got this for a recent vacation, where long sleeves and long pants were not a viable option. It went on clear, didn&#x27;t sting, and lasted longer than expected-- applied only twice a day, and no sunburn! I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. Waterproof to the point where somewhat difficult to wash off.</li>
            <li> This product gets a great rating on EWG, so you know it is good for you.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (or my kids) like some other brands do.  It absorbs pretty quickly.  Really cool how the bottle becomes blue when UV light is present.  Wish it was less expensive...</li>
            <li> I love Blue Lizard sunscreen because it&#x27;s not greasy, there are no chemicals, and it works!&lt;br /&gt;What more could you want?</li>
            <li> I live in Mexico and use Blue Lizard regularly.</li>
            <li> They show two bottles but you only get one.  It is very good sunblock but with two in the image both showing the front of the bottle.  It is misleading. If this was an error and somone corrects it I will update the review. Otherwise, I would consider this in your selection and price comparison.</li>
            <li> The bottle changes color which seems to help take my son&#x27;s mind off of the fact that he&#x27;s going to be smothered in the stuff.  No longer gives me problems about putting on sunscreen.  Let alone the product works great, takes a tad longer rubbing in because of white tint, but that eventually goes away.</li>
            <li> This is really a 6 star sunscreen. I have eczema prone sensitive skinned children who get rashes from their own sweat, but they can use this without any irritation. Believe all the good reviews. There was a question asked about whether this has non-nano particles in it, and while I usually share this concern and try to buy sunscreens that are non-nano, searching for one that will not irritate my children&#x27;s skin takes too much trial and error time. And the summer is already almost here. I&#x27;m more concerned with getting a sunscreen on my kids that I know doesn&#x27;t give them a rash and that I know keeps them from getting burned, so I&#x27;m sticking with this one this year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the ingredient, but I was getting itchy from regular sunscreen last summer. A boat captain recommended this, and after researching it, I decided to try it. Great decision to start off the summer! I go paddleboarding for hours in the Florida sun, and not only have not gotten itchy, but also haven&#x27;t been sunburnt while using this product.</li>
            <li> MY FAV TO USE ON MY KIDS. BUT HARD TO FIND ANYWHERE BUT HERE. IT IS THE BEST SUNSCREEN.</li>
            <li> A little hard to rub in, but protected us well. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Leaves white marks if not applied properly but the stuff works. Would definitely recommend for summer usage&lt;br /&gt;Never used it on face though</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. I feel protected from the sun when wearing Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li> I think Amazon should change the picture advertised for this product from this seller because when I saw it I assumed I was going to get 2 bottles. It is only ONE 8.75 ounce bottle. So it would be cheaper to get (2) 5 ounce bottle somewhere else. My fault for not contacting the seller to clarify it. Anyway about the product, I have been using Blue Lizard for a long time and like it very much and it suits my child sensitive skin so I give it five stars.</li>
            <li> I really like the Blue Lizard sensitive skin. The lotion goes on nice, does not feel thick and sticky, does not make me feel hot. My arms are really bad and the lotion blends in and doesn&#x27;t leave white spots all over my arms. I can&#x27;t go outside without sunscreen. Also the bottle turning blue is neat, I was on my covered porch and the bottle started to turn blue. So you need sunscreen all the time even when you think you are in the shade.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my doctor and works great.  It&#x27;s a little thick and shiny but does the trick and blocks all UVA/UVB rays.  I have sensitive skin and many products give me problems, but I have no problems with Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li> This is the this tea tumbler I bought and I&#x27;m pleased with the product.  Easy to use andS clean.  Keeps tea warm for up to couple hours and glass is not sturdy and not too hot to hold.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Finally a good natural sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Bought this product because the usual sunscreens caused my face to breakout.&lt;br /&gt;No such problem with this sunscreen. Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> works great and was suggested by my dermatologist.  Bottle is fun too.  It goes a long way.  One drop does a huge body area</li>
            <li> No sunscreen that I have used comes close to the &amp;#34;gentleness&amp;#34; to Blue Lizard.&lt;br /&gt;I have rosacea yet Blue Lizard does not inflame or irritate my face. It provides full coverage. It blocks out all harmful effects of the sun. No fragrance. Silky and smooth,</li>
            <li> I used this on myself and two kids on a recent beach trip to FL.  I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t full of harmful chemicals and nasty additives.  I used the EWG site and Amazon reviews for my research. We were spending 7 hours a day on the beach, gulf or in the pool, in peak sun hours.  Not ONCE did we get sunburned!  We always applied it up in the condo before we left.  It goes on thick and will leave a white sheen if you don&#x27;t rub it in good, but my two, ages 12 &amp; 9, had no trouble applying it and getting it rubbed in.  We used in on our faces too. We sometimes reapplied after a long time swimming, but not always.  When we got back from our trip, our &amp;#34;tans&amp;#34; were non existent. No one would have even guessed we&#x27;d spent a week in the FL sun, AND we probably had about a half of a bottle left, so we&#x27;ll have plenty to last our entire Summer!</li>
            <li> A great product. Easy on skin, no smell, not greasy, no or little harmful chemicals for skin and environment. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Awesome Sunscreen!  Stays on even when swimming and sweating!  No breakouts.</li>
            <li> Excellent sunscreen. I hate the nasty oily feeling sunscreens give me, but this one is the best I&#x27;ve used so far. I went swimming with it, and still came back from my trip sun burn free.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, but expensive sunscreen. Bottle changes color in the sun like an old GI Joe I had as a kid.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a family member with an aluminum sensitivity, since aluminum is in almost every sunscreen and lotion. It works really well but it takes a while to massage it into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UV-sensitive bottle is a nice touch; it&#x27;s amazing how quickly it changes color in full sun and even inside a car behind the UV-coated glass.</li>
            <li> Only sunscreen we use for our kids.</li>
            <li> Has done a great job protecting my family from the sun!!  Will absolutely buy again!!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite natural suncreens. Easily applied (not as thick as some zinc screens). This provided my fair skinned family with great coverage on vacation in Alabama and south Carolina (no burns! )&lt;br /&gt;My daughter also loves that the bottle turns blue in the sun :)</li>
            <li> As a beach house owner, we (family of 4) are in the sun constantly all summer.  When we are not at the beach house, we are on a beach somewhere else.  This sunscreen is a winner.  It is very white and takes effort to rub completely in, but that helps identify missed areas so, if what you want is sun protection, this is it.  We have tried everything and this highly rated sunscreen protects us from the sun through all our beach activities.  My kids have never been less sun damaged!</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen that my kids love.  It is easy to rub in (or easier than other natural sunscreens we&#x27;ve tried).  Truly fragrance free (that seems to be my kids&#x27; favorite part). Only complaint is cost -- but it&#x27;s in line with other similar products.</li>
            <li> You must reapply....often.  Goes on well and has very little scent.  Got sunburned the first time because we didn&#x27;t reapply every half an hour.  With constant reapplication it works fine.  Still a better alternative to the sunscreens with dangerous chemicals.</li>
            <li> worst cream everrrrrrr!!!!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen provides good coverage, but it&#x27;s so thick it&#x27;s hard to get off afterward. I feel greasy even after a shower.</li>
            <li> great product and I&#x27;ve tried a lot&lt;br /&gt;absorbs easily&lt;br /&gt;non perfumey&lt;br /&gt;softens skin&lt;br /&gt;arrived very quickly and wrapped up well&lt;br /&gt;will purchase again from this retailer!</li>
            <li> Protects well, but hard to apply on children.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it for months. It works, it&#x27;s easy to apply (goes on white, but fades after a while), and it&#x27;s not too oily. Oh, and it has little/neutral odor.</li>
            <li> Great product. Expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Rubs in well and does it&#x27;s job to block sun all day even after swimming.</li>
            <li> Has a low ZO, not 30+ SPF at all, has too many ingredients, non are organic, non are certified, no percentage of ingredient...

THE HIGHER THE ZINC, THE MORE PROTECTION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions. Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make my own sunscreen as well as I purchase sunscreen for times when I do not have time to make any since I need to surf. For that reason, when I purchase a sunscreen mix, I need the same formula as I use when I make my own organic sunscreen mix since it only requires few ingredients but for more protection like my nose, I bump the zinc. Zinc is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection. The more zinc, the more protection but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that I purchase and add to VCO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Lizard Baby&lt;br /&gt;- 10% Zinc Oxide; 5% Titanium Dioxide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Lizard Face&lt;br /&gt;- 8% Zinc Oxide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Lizard Sensitive&lt;br /&gt;- 10% Zinc Oxide; 5% Titanium Dioxide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Lizard Sport&lt;br /&gt;- 6% Zinc Oxide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue Lizard Regular&lt;br /&gt;- 6% Zinc Oxide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a reason why sunscreen companies do not provide any images of the labeling since that will disclose the active and inactive ingredients.

Blue Lizard&#x27;s ingredients vary so much from their Face mix to the Original mix to the Baby mix since they offer more additives, less zinc with noticeable price fluctuation. Cancer does not differentiate face skin or leg skin, it is all the same so why apply anything that has less protection to different part of the body.

            <li> does not feel greasy, a little goes a long way. no unpleasant odors</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, very smooth and not greasy. My 3 year all kids are using it for 3 weeks now at summer camp (one of my boys has a very fair skin) and no burns. Very happy with product, ordered second one to keep at home.</li>
            <li> Great sunblock for the kids&#x27; sensitive skin.  Would like to receive a rebate/coupon toward our next purchase.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen work really well and it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t cause skin irritation on my kiddos.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, fast service</li>
            <li> It does not leave skin as white as most spf does... Really rub in before you go out into the sun and use a small amount and spread evenly so it can absord quickly!!</li>
            <li> This is the best sun screen I have found. I play a lot of golf so I get a lot of sun. I am slightly tanned so it&#x27;s doing its job.  Here is a suggestion for applying. Put a lot of it on, wait about 10 min. and then gently wipe the excess off. One complaint I have seen is its chalky looking. This takes care of that problem plus you get the protection needed.</li>
            <li> BEST sunscreen ever!  stays on even after swimming in the ocean and it is safe for coral reefs and wildlife.  I wont buy anything else.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen.  For YEARS I have searched for an eco-friendly sunscreen that 1) works, 2) spreads on easily and evenly, 3) comes in a large enough volume that is useful to use with two kids who are outside most of the day all summer, 4) doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.  FINALLY I&#x27;ve found one.  I love this sunscreen, and so do my kids.</li>
            <li> I burn so easy since I am very fair skinned.  This sunscreen worked so well..I would recommend it to everyone!!</li>
            <li> its a bit thick and gets som gettin used to but the product itself once on works really well... i would get it again bt you hve to learn to apply it</li>
            <li> After much research, I choose this sunscreen based on many factors including: EWG&#x27;s rating, previous consumer&#x27;s reviews, price, and ease of purchase. This product has exceeded all expectations I have of it. I would highly recommend to anyone who has read and is concerned about the crazy things sunscreens do. Also, this sunscreen is the easiest to apply and rub in that I&#x27;ve seen with any &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; sunscreen (there is some grease and whiteness, but just keep spreading) and it prevented sunburn after many hours (and reapplications as stated on bottle)!</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen for sensitive skin as it does not burn or cause itchy skin. Just a little bit goes a long way. Goes on white when first applied but eventually this clears up as it is smoothed on. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This worked great on our vacation in the USVI. You do have to rub a bit more to get it to disappear, but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. I&#x27;m a redhead and I burn easily, this kept me from burning. I reapplied at least once a day, twice if we were out longer. I still freckle--but no burn.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I have ever used.  My dermatologist recommended this product.  I.m so glad he did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a long of different sunscreens through the years and this is the best.  Goes on white, so you can see where it has been applied, and dries clear.  Very water resistant, no allergy issues, and very good sun protection.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast. No hassles.</li>
            <li> What the other reviewers don&#x27;t say is that this stuff is really greasy.  I put it on to go to the park, not to swim.  Any dust kicked up sticks to your skin.  Despite putting it on thickly and working it in, I have noticeable color (tanning) on my arms after being outside for several hours.  I didn&#x27;t expect that with this type of sunblock.  Since I wasn&#x27;t swimming, I had to come home and shower before I could sit on furniture due to the greasiness.  I will keep it around to see how it does if I do go swimming this year.</li>
            <li> Promptly shipped and great stuff</li>
            <li> Make sure you clean your skin because it does leave a residue.</li>
            <li> This stuff works but you&#x27;ll have a hell of a time rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had skin cancer in the past, so protection is obviously crucial to me. I used this sunscreen on a recent trip to Italy and I loved it. It served me well and I plan to purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good product, we don&#x27;t get itchy skin like most other sun screens.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best, most effective sunscreen on the market.  I am extremely sensitive both to the sun and to skin care products and Blue Lizard Sensitive works very well for me.  Because it is a mineral sunscreen it does leave a white film on the skin and makes you look a bit ghost like, but the product is effective, particularly if you use a fairly heavy layer.  I would definitely recommend it if you need a heavy duty sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  Totally blocks out burning rays of the sun.</li>
            <li> Do not use on your Face! - If you put Blue Lizard Sensitive on your face and go swimming (or sweat into your eyes), your eyes will burn until the next day.  It stays on well and lacks dangerous chemicals, but you will want a 2nd type of lotion for your face, not this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is fairly easy to rub in and worked well for us on the beach and pool but you must reapply often. The first few times my kids burned because I was used to getting a longer time from the sprays but wanted something healthier for their skin.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin does fine with this sunscreen, but it gives a ghoulish look with the white cast.</li>
            <li> This stuff works and I&#x27;m as fair skinned as can be. Only negative is the extreme whiteness it provides once applied.</li>
            <li> Really protects you BUT toooo thick and hard to spread. Leaves you with that white, pale look on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;But I guess that is what makes it excellent for children.</li>
            <li> omg, best ever sunscreen. i&#x27;m fair and freckly and this stuff does the trick! i bought this after a horrible sunburn incident this summer due to that stupid spray sunscreen. i was out on the lake all weekend and i fried! after getting the blue lizard sunscreen, i haven&#x27;t burned since! plus the bottle that changes color in the sun is way super fun. i will never use anything else again!</li>
            <li> This is the best sb I&#x27;ve tried.  It keeps its consistency til the end of the bottle.  I&#x27;ve had reactions to other sb&#x27;s but not bl.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist and seems to work well. My only letdown was that he told me it didn&#x27;t hurt his eyes when applied, but it did. It wasn&#x27;t burning or as bad as other sunscreens but I guess nothing is totally unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen ever!  My husband has very fair skin, and I am very sensitive to other sunscreen lotions. this is the only lotion we use and never burn.  Wish they sold it stores!</li>
            <li> It worked great on my sailing trip and the UV indicator on the bottle was a helpful reminder to reapply!</li>
