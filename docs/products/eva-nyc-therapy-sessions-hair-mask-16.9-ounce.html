            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I used to love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, but when it arrived-</li>
            <li>I love 3 minute miracle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had way better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve homemade way better.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and the smell is not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Good hair mask leaves your hair feeling soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and quick too!</li>
            <li>but the tub is a huge amount.</li>
            <li>Great product and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>Great product, especially if you&#x27;re dying your hair or have color treated hair.</li>
            <li>I originally tried it through a subscription makeup company like birchbox &amp; ipsy.  </li>
            <li>and I dye it BRIGHT red</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to see that this product was thicker than a deluxe tub of Crisco.</li>
            <li>hair looks good because I have always tried to take care of it, but it is still dry to the touch</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft I couldn&#x27;t even stop touching it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy</li>
            <li>Worth the money and shipping to the UK.</li>
            <li>I normally have very gone greasy hair and conditioner just makes it more greasy</li>
            <li>I first heard of this product when I got a sample in my Ipsy bag.</li>
            <li>I would give it a higher rating if the product didn&#x27;t leak all over the bag it was shipped in.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this!</li>
            <li>i first tried eva nyc therapy sessions hair mask when i received it in my ipsy bag</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair (literally) silky smooth and soft for days.  </li>
            <li>My hair is ALWAYS dry, and it&#x27;s super fine, so frizzy flyaways and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural curly girl and its hard for me to find great products that moisturize my hair and don&#x27;t have offending smells.</li>
            <li>And with just ONE use!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even leave it on for a whole night, just an afternoon, maybe 2 or 3 hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have natural, 4a hair and this deep conditioner is just &#x27;ok&#x27;.</li>
            <li>This stuff left my hair feeling soft, smooth, and oh-so-fabulous after just the first use.</li>
            <li>sometimes, lots of split ends, etc!&lt;br /&gt;After dying it last month (full head)</li>
            <li>but why pay more when you could pay significantly less?</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Tried the sample and it is fantastic and so inexpensive compared to other products.  </li>
            <li>I live in the desert.</li>
            <li>My hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down and I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>I just notice healthier hair overall when I use this consistently.</li>
            <li>I do not remember my hair being so soft like this before!</li>
            <li>only downside was that my order was received without any kind of plastic seal inside or outside the container, so you could just twist it open and there was nothing protecting the product, which I thought was really strange and maybe unsanitary(?).</li>
            <li>Ive tried a million and one deep conditioners but this one instantly made my hair silky and smooth the second i applied it.</li>
            <li>hair is naturally curly and has been suffering all sorts of &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>If you leave it on all night once a night every week your hair will be soft and silky and become a lot</li>
            <li>My hair has been very dry and it got straw-like right after my shower</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair shiny, super soft and makes 98% of my flyaways and frizz lay down.</li>
            <li>only thing is that on Amazon I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s only available for around $25.00, when at Ulta and other stores its normal price is around $15.00.</li>
            <li>I felt that it was drier than normal and in definitely need of some shock therapy, so I finally decided to use this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have dry natural 3c/4a hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or what, but it isn&#x27;t nearly as good as the last jar that I got from Ulta.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d say this tub will last at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> the jar had leaked and was a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> let tem you a little about my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but seriously don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>

            <li> I found this product through ipsy bags and like the quality of this product - it smells AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside was that my order was received without any kind of plastic seal inside or outside the container, so you could just twist it open and there was nothing protecting the product, which I thought was really strange and maybe unsanitary(?).</li>

            <li> Great conditioner! Great smell!</li>
            <li> I used to love this product. I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or what, but it isn&#x27;t nearly as good as the last jar that I got from Ulta. The product doesn&#x27;t seem as thick or leave my hair feeling silky.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Worth the money and shipping to the UK. Amazing hair mask and conditioner. I normally have very gone greasy hair and conditioner just makes it more greasy but this is amazing</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this in an Ipsy bag once and ever since then I had to have this product on hand ALL THE TIME.  I went and bought the 16.9oz tub of it and I love it.  It smells amazing and makes my hair feel great.  Its like a spa for your hair.  Id recommend this product to anyone on a budget but wants to feel like they&#x27;ve done something expensive for themselves.</li>
            <li> This product smells so good! I&#x27;m a natural curly girl and its hard for me to find great products that moisturize my hair and don&#x27;t have offending smells. This is that kind of product!</li>
            <li> Good hair mask leaves your hair feeling soft and healthy. This is especially great for color-treated hair. Amazon is one of the only carriers of this product I think. Thanks for this!</li>
            <li> works as advertised...thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this product, but when it arrived- the jar had leaked and was a sticky mess. I&#x27;m not sure how much product I lost.</li>
            <li> Received a sample in a recent Sephora purchase and after just that one use I was hooked! My hair has been very dry and it got straw-like right after my shower and this was after conditioning.  I love 3 minute miracle but it wasn&#x27;t getting it done for me.  After this new treatment and after I had towel dried my hair my hair still felt soft and it smelled wonderful! My hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down and I have fine hair. This hair mask is more expensive than drugstore but the tub is a huge amount. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;d say this tub will last at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> one of the best products ive used on my hair. it leaves my hair shiny, super soft and makes 98% of my flyaways and frizz lay down. i first tried eva nyc therapy sessions hair mask when i received it in my ipsy bag and ive been using it every other shower since then. i highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Tried the sample and it is fantastic and so inexpensive compared to other products.  Leaves my hair (literally) silky smooth and soft for days.  I cannot get enough of this.  A little goes a LONG way!</li>
            <li> Alright, so I&#x27;m going to be up front. I live in the desert. My hair is ALWAYS dry, and it&#x27;s super fine, so frizzy flyaways and I are friends. This stuff left my hair feeling soft, smooth, and oh-so-fabulous after just the first use. I definitely will keep this on hand, and make it a part of my routine! Thumbs WAY Up!</li>
            <li> I have natural, 4a hair and this deep conditioner is just &#x27;ok&#x27;. I&#x27;ve had way better. I&#x27;ve homemade way better. I saw a vlogger use this but seriously don&#x27;t waste your money. This product sits on your hair, never penetrating it when using heat. And it left my hair frizzy. Nope.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
