            <li>No matter how flawless the application is, if the coloring is off, it just does not look right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I am beyond impressed with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It stays on all day and my skin looks flawless.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and use the Ivory which covered everything (even freckles!)</li>
            <li>and this foundation was a perfect match for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always wondered how my Hollywood friends always looked so flawlessly made up</li>

            <li>I am very fair with rosy undertones to my skin.</li>
            <li>Read those instructions since it will make your life with this product incredibly easier.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this, feel beautiful when I do, and not mind the cost.</li>
            <li>for those who don&#x27;t need to be on-camera, I think the benefits of having a flawless or nearly flawless looking complexion that doesn&#x27;t scream \\&quot;make-up!\\&quot; would make this system a worthwhile investment over time.</li>
            <li>Very smooth application.....feels like you are not wearing any makeup!!</li>
            <li>It provides great coverage, giving me flawless-looking skin.</li>

            <li>It really is a great thing for a makeup artist or just an enthusiast.</li>
            <li>used this with a variety of primers and found that Guerlain pearl toned primer and Lorac Aquaprime primer seemed to work the best on most skin types.  </li>

            <li>The prognosis is that it was \\&quot;okay\\&quot; and not as good as she had hoped.</li>
            <li>I have been using them both and am delighted with the look as well as the feel.  </li>
            <li>B009OY8GK4 TEMPTU AIRbrush Makeup System 2.0 and Signature Starter Kit, Fair]]</li>
            <li>This is good to use for just a spot or whatever.</li>
            <li>It does a good job, but somehow for me - it just take a longer time.</li>
            <li>I want good coverage but not a \\&quot;mask\\&quot; and I felt I got that with the Temptu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have done a sample test and loved the results and don&#x27;t feel like I would want to run from filming to a sink to wash my mask</li>
            <li>but for those special occasions I&#x27;ve always wanted my face to look perfect like those women&#x27;s faces look in the Sephora catalog - you know...not a pore, not a blemish, and the dewy moist look.</li>
            <li>in all, as an experienced makeup artists, I love the concept and application process of the Temptu makeup system.  </li>
            <li>in all, as an experienced makeup artists, I love the concept and application process of the Temptu makeup system.  </li>
            <li>Right now I find that it works best in a pinch but going forward</li>
            <li>Love everything about it!</li>
            <li>I love the product!</li>
            <li>But this is great for a special night out.. or for when you know there&#x27;ll be photos!</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>But, if you suffer from this you are already use to eye drops and the need to just keep them handy.</li>
            <li>More sanitary, of course, but breathing all that sprayed makeup can&#x27;t be good for you.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;beige.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system itself was very easy to put together.</li>
            <li>In all cases, the Airbrush makeup kit is very easy to use and almost fool</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and if I could I would give it MORE than five stars!</li>
            <li>Maybe im not using it as efficiently as other experienced makeup artists, but i dont see this giving me that flawless movie star look unless i apply like 3 layers of this stuff.</li>
            <li>If I could mix my own foundation or if it came in more of a variety of skin tones, this set would be almost perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I could mix my own foundation or if it came in more of a variety of skin tones, this set would be almost perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also a Light 003 in this, but I tried the Porcelain 001 (called Fair here)</li>
            <li>/&gt;This took forever to build up a nice, even coverage--NOT three minutes, unless you&#x27;re starting with practically flawless skin and need the merest daub of coverage.  </li>
            <li>I have really liked using this TEMPTU system because it helps me build enough coverage to look basically flawless on camera</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even do the top part of my nose or between my eyebrows because it was killing my eyes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This will probably be better for women who use a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li>Some people may love it, but my wife didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The lighter the pressure, the better.  </li>
            <li>It just felt more moist.</li>
            <li>It eventually just fades away like magic.</li>
            <li>It has a good variety of colors, you can blend different colors, if you can&#x27;t find a perfect match to your skin, it feels great on  your skin, and most importantly, you don&#x27;t have to be a professional to use it.</li>
            <li>The foundation pod is then snapped on with a push button on the side and the trigger on top controls the flow of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That may change as I use it more and become more experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin that is more on the dryer side</li>
            <li>blend the colors for a better match.</li>
            <li>I reminds me a lot of my favorite day to day Clinique foundation that was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I can see that there are many more possibilities than just saving time.</li>
            <li>I am going to need more practice</li>
            <li>I love how my face looks after I apply foundation using the Temptu</li>
            <li>I love makeup, so I was very excited to try this</li>
            <li>She said the makeup went on very lightly and it was fairly easy to keep adding layers.</li>
            <li>This makes the wand very light but also easy to break.</li>
            <li>It feels a lot lighter on my face too, but my face stays looking flawless all day long.</li>
            <li>If you want fine / even coverage, you have to layer and layer and layer a very light spray.</li>
            <li>camera does pick up on the airbrushed look and the pictures taken after airbrushing look much more natural so it can be great for evening wear</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s important to follow the instructions and hold the tip 6 inches or more away from the face.</li>
            <li>In the summer, Light Medium 005 may be OK when I have a bit of a</li>

            <li>kit is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to assemble, just attach the tubing and the power supply</li>
            <li>It was so easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the Temptu airbrush system is easy to use if you maintain it well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as easy as it appears when you watch the videos.</li>
            <li>I also found that you can easily pop them in and out to mix colors.  </li>
            <li>Once I read through, this airbrush was super easy to use and very light.</li>
            <li>Maybe not every day but for sure for special occasions.</li>
            <li>She liked that the system is easy to just pick up and use the first time.</li>
            <li>The results provided by this greatly mirror a natural tone, so I don&#x27;t really feel like I am losing any innate pizzazz - perhaps the greatest plus of using this on a regular day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll do fine.  </li>
            <li>It came off fine with remover, or even face</li>

            <li>mist is so fine,</li>
            <li>When I went out at night, I did use powder to set it, but I think the finish is fine with out it.  </li>
            <li>This thing is amazing.is fine with out it.  </li>
            <li>My beautiful wife only needs a little bit to look her best, so this turned out to be not for her.</li>
            <li>I went back to look at the videos and could tell that none of the happy, smiling models even had the machine turned on.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, it comes out light, so you can layer on the color.</li>
            <li>The makeup is so light it feels like I am not wearing any</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using primer before applying this makeup is important in my opinion, as it helps with even application.</li>
            <li>The instructions are clear and precise with good illustrations.</li>
            <li>what so ever, but offers really good coverage in one or two passes.</li>
            <li>and I have seen a lot of exceptional professional airbrush makeup work.</li>
            <li>She and her friend quickly mastered how to use it and found spray went on evenly and easily.</li>
            <li>It was super easy to set up and use.</li>
            <li>The wide variety of blush, tanner, highlight, and foundation colors offered make it fun to use, and great on many skin tones.  </li>

            <li>I was so excited to receive this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted an airbrush makeup systems, so I was beyond excited to be getting this one.</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased a water based makeup airbrush and decided to return it and give the silicon based makeup a try because I have oily skin and wanted longer wear.</li>
            <li>I am very fussy about foundations (most of which I don&#x27;t like) and this kit seems to work well if used lightly and sparingly.ting.  </li>
            <li>I am very fussy about foundations (most of which I don&#x27;t like) and this kit seems to work well if used lightly and sparingly.</li>
            <li>You can also order directly from the manufacturer for a custom color but the Ivory was such a perfect one</li>
            <li>It is a large up-front purchase, but it ends up being a better value over time.</li>
            <li>and I also close my mouth when I&#x27;m working right around it, but the mist really is so fine that when I have accidentally shot myself in the eye, it hasn&#x27;t even hurt or anything.</li>
            <li>liked it so much that after just the first session, I purchased a blush pod.  </li>
            <li>I took some time to review the Temptu Airbrush Makeup System Starter Kit in Fair because I wanted to test out this system on myself and on others which have different makeup needs.  </li>
            <li>If you want good coverage in one or two passes with this Temptu airbrush, you have to crank up the flow which makes the droplets bigger and the coverage look glopey and cakey.</li>
            <li>I did not find the final result to be superior to liquid foundations applied with fingertips and sponges.</li>
            <li>kit contained the airbrush system itself, an instructional DVD, and 6 different shades of oil-free makeup: Porcelain, Almond, Warm Ivory, Warm Beige, Natural, and Beige.</li>
            <li>This kit is a great compromise between the top level airbrush makeup artists equipment and a simpler version for day to day use by those who need to have professional makeup with minimal work and interaction.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If we could even mix our own shades or be able to purchase other colors, it would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If we could even mix our own shades or be able to purchase other colors, it would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I watched a ton of tutorials for this system while waiting for mine to arrive and felt pretty comfortable trying it out the minute it came to the door.</li>
            <li>I have watched professional makeup artists use airbrush makeup, the spray is very fine with no glopiness</li>
            <li>The world of airbrushed makeup is totally new to me, but I can&#x27;t think of a better system to start with if this describes you also.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is I have chronic dry-eye and this will definitely dry the eyeballs out even more.</li>
            <li>It has a bit of a smell, but it&#x27;s a pretty clean smell and goes away after it dries, from my experience.</li>
            <li>While it looked fine, there was nothing different about it that I&#x27;d want to spend $200 and add MORE time to my beauty routine every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After selecting the right shade for my skin tone, I started using it to apply foundation - the very first time it took me 30 mins since I have to cover a couple of blemishes.  </li>
            <li>there is of course, a fine line between just right and too much when it comes to make up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Manual - The instruction manual has some great tips and a few practice pages to help control the precision of the flow.</li>
            <li>But I decided to try this out for fun.</li>
            <li>Admittedly this was fun to try even when I screwed up here and there.</li>
            <li>I may have to get my own vanity area next though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is important to match the shade correctly, as some shades can look right but go on really chalky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The instructions come with practice sheets so you can get it right there before you try it on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to receive this product - after trying out all the foundations in Macys and Nordstorm and the Mineral kits - I really wanted to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The droplets are not as fine or as consistent as those produced by a professional airbrush.</li>
            <li>The unique design of the brush fits your hand much like a pencil and you can quickly cover your skin with the light and long wearing make up that came with the kit.  </li>
            <li>I am not a graceful person, so I was a bit intimidated by the system at first.  </li>
            <li>At first I decided to work with one of the darker colors since I knew it would show up well</li>
            <li>Which isn&#x27;t exactly what I was in the market for.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t unusable, but some of the pods definitely sprayed better than others.</li>
            <li>First off -</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a light in most makeup such as Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>but this seems like a great little system so far.</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of the Temptu, which didn&#x27;t take long, I was able to achieve close to what I&#x27;d see in a Sephora catalog, as close as one can get if you&#x27;re in your mid-40&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and the feel of this product</li>
            <li>probably isn&#x27;t for you, but there is certainly a market and it probably serves that demographic well.</li>
            <li>A definite must have for the lady that has to look good for long periods of time without looking like you have too much makeup on.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know which shade to select, and the shade selector on the site didn&#x27;t help much, as it isn&#x27;t very descriptive.  </li>
            <li>and I was ready to start.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what she is talking</li>
            <li>I have used a cream my whole life before this.</li>
            <li>The Temptu airbrush makeup system did not take much time to set up.</li>
            <li>There is a lot of temptation to bring it closer or too apply too much pressure on the trigger but that produces a chalky look.</li>
            <li>I have very acne prone skin</li>
            <li>The colors are also very forgiving so</li>
            <li>It really does stick to your skin and it doesn&#x27;t wear off,  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise I really like this product.</li>
            <li>thought at first that this would take me much longer to use than traditional makeup, but once I got the hang of the wand, I could quickly cover everything within two minutes.  </li>
            <li>It sent a steady, very lite mist out onto my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad but nothing I want to put up with on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>many cases, I could make it work on various skin tones, but it still had a bit of a yellow appearance no matter what I did in a lot of cases.  </li>
            <li>many cases, I could make it work on various skin tones, but it still had a bit of a yellow appearance no matter what I did in a lot of cases.  </li>
            <li>If barely applied, it can work, but in most cases, I found it to be a tough match on most skin tones-</li>
            <li>Practice will help to determine the right amount for your skin especially if it does not need too much coverage</li>
            <li>it is, if your skin tone falls in the range of what is offered in foundation colors, I highly recommend you try it.  </li>
            <li>it is, if your skin tone falls in the range of what is offered in foundation colors, I highly recommend you try it.  </li>
            <li>Even though I had read the description before choosing it I didnt&#x27; expect it to be as high quality as it is.</li>
            <li>A little trigger on top of the wand allows you to control the amount of product released.  </li>
            <li>She appreciated the natural feel of it on her face.</li>
            <li>Light coverage might be possible in 3 minutes (if you don&#x27;t have any marks or blemishes to conceal), but if you have uneven skin tone or blemishes, expect to spend about 15-20 minutes applying foundation in \\&quot;light, even layers\\&quot; to achieve an evenly applied effect.</li>
            <li>im pretty much going back to liquid foundation than this time consuming machine.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure that yo use round swirling motions when applying the makeup to the face.  </li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t waste the appropriately colored product on my practice</li>
            <li>I just matched my normal foundation with the closest one in the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note about the makeup</li>
            <li>the final result worth it?</li>
            <li>I have to question if it is worth 20 mins of my time or use a regular foundation in about 3-5 mins.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to plug in the makeup pods and use them, as long as you make sure that the little plug is taken out correctly and replaced immediately after use, then you will find that foundation, blush or whatever you are using will not dry out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(highlighter is really good), but the blush is too dramatic.</li>
            <li>not necessarily because this is faster in and of itself but because I don&#x27;t have to drag out and then store away as many products...</li>
            <li>She was very surprised by how well the makeup stayed</li>
            <li>For $200, she was quite excited to try this out, especially with the amount of time this could potentially save her in the morning when she applies her makeup for work.</li>
            <li>When I presented it to her to try out, she was moderately hopeful that she would like it better than other foundations that she has tried.</li>
            <li>If it really only took 3 minutes, I would be willing to get through it, but I don&#x27;t have 20 minutes just for foundation.</li>
            <li>normal days, I still rarely use the air make-up because I find a brief dusting of mineral make-up is nice enough for casual public outings (I&#x27;m looking at you grocery store), but I look forward to the opportunity to break it out for a party or business function as I experimented with a lighter application from the TEMPTU pods and found it to look a lot more natural than regular make-up.</li>
            <li>The instructions were extremely clear as well.</li>
            <li>Also, you must keep the noxzzles and things clear-</li>
            <li>It only took a handful of tries before I felt comfortable using this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit too much of a hassle for me to worry about using this daily, as I like to just brush on and go.</li>
            <li>yet it makes it so that you will look natural and not overly made</li>
            <li>she disliked:&lt;br /&gt;Airbrushing anywhere near her eyes.</li>
            <li>Space is an issue in my old house.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for natural makeup look this</li>
            <li>This system is also so much easier than the water based systems because of the pods, there is no need for constant cleaning.</li>
            <li>Though I have never been a professional makeup artist, I have been a professional photographer</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this airbrush system does not perform or produce results like a professional system.</li>
            <li>You may also need to clean the tip of the pod with a Q-tip if you don&#x27;t use it for a few days and the tip gets clogged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend this system.</li>
            <li>She said it made her eyes feel a little dry, but she was also creeped out by the idea of a fine mist of foundation on her eyes.</li>
            <li>if u dont have a steady hand the blush can look weird and is pretty dark, suggest the knob should be almost the highest setting which spreads it more.</li>
            <li>I also like (and personally use) Temptu products and have seen them used regularly by professional make up</li>
            <li>The stacking of these shades would get me back to a natural skin color while providing contouring effects.</li>
            <li>Next, I kept learning and refining the process and finally I am able to get it down to about 20 minutes and nothing less than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you have oily skin, this might or might not work as well on you, but if you have normal or dry skin, it should work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>The foundation also has a funny smell that I don&#x27;t like and also slightly irritates my skin.</li>

            <li>Even the first time out, I didn&#x27;t make a mess.  </li>
            <li>First, there was no sound (the unit is noisy), they barely blinked, and their skin wasn&#x27;t moving where the air was hitting</li>
            <li>Once in a while it matches, but in many cases, it was just a bit too yellow which is frustrating.  </li>
            <li>The compressor isn&#x27;t loud at all, but it does make it vibrate around just a little bit on my counter top, so I suggest putting it away from the edge, or at least keeping a watch on it when it&#x27;s running.</li>
            <li>the air comes out SO forcefully that I could barely keep my eyes open.  </li>
            <li>When I get to a blemish on my face I pull the trigger back a little further and move in a circular motion right over the blemish.</li>
            <li>On older clients, the makeup does not settle into the creases or lines unless you apply too intensely with too thick of an application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The low pressure of the trigger allows for a very natural look with minimal makeup and</li>
            <li>I was really worried about this breaking my face out because I&#x27;m very acne prone, but after a few weeks of using it, I&#x27;ve actually had less acne</li>
            <li>It did apply the makeup evenly, but it had her putting on a little too much</li>
            <li>follow the directions included in the little booklet, and in no time your pod is attached and you are ready to start.  </li>

            <li> I will continue to use this, feel beautiful when I do, and not mind the cost.</li>
            <li> for those who don&#x27;t need to be on-camera, I think the benefits of having a flawless or nearly flawless looking complexion that doesn&#x27;t scream \\&quot;make-up!\\&quot; would make this system a worthwhile investment over time.</li>
            <li> Very smooth application.....feels like you are not wearing any makeup!!</li>

            <li> used this with a variety of primers and found that Guerlain pearl toned primer and Lorac Aquaprime primer seemed to work the best on most skin types.  </li>

            <li> This is good to use for just a spot or whatever.</li>
            <li> It does a good job, but somehow for me - it just take a longer time.</li>
            <li> I want good coverage but not a \\&quot;mask\\&quot; and I felt I got that with the Temptu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have done a sample test and loved the results and don&#x27;t feel like I would want to run from filming to a sink to wash my mask</li>
            <li> but for those special occasions I&#x27;ve always wanted my face to look perfect like those women&#x27;s faces look in the Sephora catalog - you know...not a pore, not a blemish, and the dewy moist look.</li>
            <li> in all, as an experienced makeup artists, I love the concept and application process of the Temptu makeup system.  </li>
            <li> in all, as an experienced makeup artists, I love the concept and application process of the Temptu makeup system.  </li>
            <li> Right now I find that it works best in a pinch but going forward</li>
            <li> Love everything about it!</li>
            <li> I love the product!</li>
            <li> But this is great for a special night out.. or for when you know there&#x27;ll be photos!</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> But, if you suffer from this you are already use to eye drops and the need to just keep them handy.</li>
            <li> More sanitary, of course, but breathing all that sprayed makeup can&#x27;t be good for you.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;beige.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system itself was very easy to put together.</li>
            <li> In all cases, the Airbrush makeup kit is very easy to use and almost fool</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and if I could I would give it MORE than five stars!</li>
            <li> Maybe im not using it as efficiently as other experienced makeup artists, but i dont see this giving me that flawless movie star look unless i apply like 3 layers of this stuff.</li>
            <li> If I could mix my own foundation or if it came in more of a variety of skin tones, this set would be almost perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I could mix my own foundation or if it came in more of a variety of skin tones, this set would be almost perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a Light 003 in this, but I tried the Porcelain 001 (called Fair here)</li>
            <li> /&gt;This took forever to build up a nice, even coverage--NOT three minutes, unless you&#x27;re starting with practically flawless skin and need the merest daub of coverage.  </li>
            <li> I have really liked using this TEMPTU system because it helps me build enough coverage to look basically flawless on camera</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even do the top part of my nose or between my eyebrows because it was killing my eyes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This will probably be better for women who use a lot of makeup.</li>
            <li> Some people may love it, but my wife didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The lighter the pressure, the better.  </li>
            <li> It just felt more moist.</li>
            <li> It eventually just fades away like magic.</li>
            <li> It has a good variety of colors, you can blend different colors, if you can&#x27;t find a perfect match to your skin, it feels great on  your skin, and most importantly, you don&#x27;t have to be a professional to use it.</li>
            <li> The foundation pod is then snapped on with a push button on the side and the trigger on top controls the flow of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That may change as I use it more and become more experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is more on the dryer side</li>

            <li> I reminds me a lot of my favorite day to day Clinique foundation that was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I can see that there are many more possibilities than just saving time.</li>
            <li> I am going to need more practice</li>
            <li> I love how my face looks after I apply foundation using the Temptu</li>
            <li> I love makeup, so I was very excited to try this</li>
            <li> She said the makeup went on very lightly and it was fairly easy to keep adding layers.</li>
            <li> This makes the wand very light but also easy to break.</li>
            <li> It feels a lot lighter on my face too, but my face stays looking flawless all day long.</li>
            <li> If you want fine / even coverage, you have to layer and layer and layer a very light spray.</li>
            <li> camera does pick up on the airbrushed look and the pictures taken after airbrushing look much more natural so it can be great for evening wear</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s important to follow the instructions and hold the tip 6 inches or more away from the face.</li>

            <li> It was so easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the Temptu airbrush system is easy to use if you maintain it well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as easy as it appears when you watch the videos.</li>
            <li> I also found that you can easily pop them in and out to mix colors.  </li>
            <li> Once I read through, this airbrush was super easy to use and very light.</li>
            <li> Maybe not every day but for sure for special occasions.</li>
            <li> She liked that the system is easy to just pick up and use the first time.</li>
            <li> The results provided by this greatly mirror a natural tone, so I don&#x27;t really feel like I am losing any innate pizzazz - perhaps the greatest plus of using this on a regular day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll do fine.  </li>

            <li> My beautiful wife only needs a little bit to look her best, so this turned out to be not for her.</li>
            <li> I went back to look at the videos and could tell that none of the happy, smiling models even had the machine turned on.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully, it comes out light, so you can layer on the color.</li>
            <li> The makeup is so light it feels like I am not wearing any</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using primer before applying this makeup is important in my opinion, as it helps with even application.</li>
            <li> The instructions are clear and precise with good illustrations.</li>
            <li> what so ever, but offers really good coverage in one or two passes.</li>

            <li> It was super easy to set up and use.</li>

            <li> I was so excited to receive this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted an airbrush makeup systems, so I was beyond excited to be getting this one.</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased a water based makeup airbrush and decided to return it and give the silicon based makeup a try because I have oily skin and wanted longer wear.</li>
            <li> I am very fussy about foundations (most of which I don&#x27;t like) and this kit seems to work well if used lightly and sparingly.ting.  </li>
            <li> I am very fussy about foundations (most of which I don&#x27;t like) and this kit seems to work well if used lightly and sparingly.</li>
            <li> You can also order directly from the manufacturer for a custom color but the Ivory was such a perfect one</li>
            <li> It is a large up-front purchase, but it ends up being a better value over time.</li>
            <li> and I also close my mouth when I&#x27;m working right around it, but the mist really is so fine that when I have accidentally shot myself in the eye, it hasn&#x27;t even hurt or anything.</li>
            <li> liked it so much that after just the first session, I purchased a blush pod.  </li>
            <li> I took some time to review the Temptu Airbrush Makeup System Starter Kit in Fair because I wanted to test out this system on myself and on others which have different makeup needs.  </li>
            <li> If you want good coverage in one or two passes with this Temptu airbrush, you have to crank up the flow which makes the droplets bigger and the coverage look glopey and cakey.</li>
            <li> I did not find the final result to be superior to liquid foundations applied with fingertips and sponges.</li>
            <li> kit contained the airbrush system itself, an instructional DVD, and 6 different shades of oil-free makeup: Porcelain, Almond, Warm Ivory, Warm Beige, Natural, and Beige.</li>
            <li> This kit is a great compromise between the top level airbrush makeup artists equipment and a simpler version for day to day use by those who need to have professional makeup with minimal work and interaction.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If we could even mix our own shades or be able to purchase other colors, it would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If we could even mix our own shades or be able to purchase other colors, it would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I watched a ton of tutorials for this system while waiting for mine to arrive and felt pretty comfortable trying it out the minute it came to the door.</li>
            <li> I have watched professional makeup artists use airbrush makeup, the spray is very fine with no glopiness</li>
            <li> The world of airbrushed makeup is totally new to me, but I can&#x27;t think of a better system to start with if this describes you also.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is I have chronic dry-eye and this will definitely dry the eyeballs out even more.</li>
            <li> It has a bit of a smell, but it&#x27;s a pretty clean smell and goes away after it dries, from my experience.</li>
            <li> While it looked fine, there was nothing different about it that I&#x27;d want to spend $200 and add MORE time to my beauty routine every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After selecting the right shade for my skin tone, I started using it to apply foundation - the very first time it took me 30 mins since I have to cover a couple of blemishes.  </li>
            <li> there is of course, a fine line between just right and too much when it comes to make up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Manual - The instruction manual has some great tips and a few practice pages to help control the precision of the flow.</li>
            <li> But I decided to try this out for fun.</li>
            <li> Admittedly this was fun to try even when I screwed up here and there.</li>
            <li> I may have to get my own vanity area next though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is important to match the shade correctly, as some shades can look right but go on really chalky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The instructions come with practice sheets so you can get it right there before you try it on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to receive this product - after trying out all the foundations in Macys and Nordstorm and the Mineral kits - I really wanted to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The droplets are not as fine or as consistent as those produced by a professional airbrush.</li>
            <li> The unique design of the brush fits your hand much like a pencil and you can quickly cover your skin with the light and long wearing make up that came with the kit.  </li>
            <li> I am not a graceful person, so I was a bit intimidated by the system at first.  </li>
            <li> At first I decided to work with one of the darker colors since I knew it would show up well</li>
            <li> Which isn&#x27;t exactly what I was in the market for.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t unusable, but some of the pods definitely sprayed better than others.</li>
            <li> First off -</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a light in most makeup such as Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> but this seems like a great little system so far.</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of the Temptu, which didn&#x27;t take long, I was able to achieve close to what I&#x27;d see in a Sephora catalog, as close as one can get if you&#x27;re in your mid-40&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and the feel of this product</li>
            <li> probably isn&#x27;t for you, but there is certainly a market and it probably serves that demographic well.</li>
            <li> A definite must have for the lady that has to look good for long periods of time without looking like you have too much makeup on.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know which shade to select, and the shade selector on the site didn&#x27;t help much, as it isn&#x27;t very descriptive.  </li>
            <li> and I was ready to start.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what she is talking</li>
            <li> I have used a cream my whole life before this.</li>
            <li> The Temptu airbrush makeup system did not take much time to set up.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of temptation to bring it closer or too apply too much pressure on the trigger but that produces a chalky look.</li>
            <li> I have very acne prone skin</li>
            <li> The colors are also very forgiving so</li>
            <li> It really does stick to your skin and it doesn&#x27;t wear off,  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise I really like this product.</li>
            <li> thought at first that this would take me much longer to use than traditional makeup, but once I got the hang of the wand, I could quickly cover everything within two minutes.  </li>
            <li> It sent a steady, very lite mist out onto my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad but nothing I want to put up with on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> many cases, I could make it work on various skin tones, but it still had a bit of a yellow appearance no matter what I did in a lot of cases.  </li>
            <li> many cases, I could make it work on various skin tones, but it still had a bit of a yellow appearance no matter what I did in a lot of cases.  </li>
            <li> If barely applied, it can work, but in most cases, I found it to be a tough match on most skin tones-</li>
            <li> Practice will help to determine the right amount for your skin especially if it does not need too much coverage</li>
            <li> it is, if your skin tone falls in the range of what is offered in foundation colors, I highly recommend you try it.  </li>
            <li> it is, if your skin tone falls in the range of what is offered in foundation colors, I highly recommend you try it.  </li>
            <li> Even though I had read the description before choosing it I didnt&#x27; expect it to be as high quality as it is.</li>
            <li> A little trigger on top of the wand allows you to control the amount of product released.  </li>
            <li> She appreciated the natural feel of it on her face.</li>
            <li> Light coverage might be possible in 3 minutes (if you don&#x27;t have any marks or blemishes to conceal), but if you have uneven skin tone or blemishes, expect to spend about 15-20 minutes applying foundation in \\&quot;light, even layers\\&quot; to achieve an evenly applied effect.</li>
            <li> im pretty much going back to liquid foundation than this time consuming machine.</li>
            <li> Also, make sure that yo use round swirling motions when applying the makeup to the face.  </li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t waste the appropriately colored product on my practice</li>
            <li> I just matched my normal foundation with the closest one in the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note about the makeup</li>
            <li> the final result worth it?</li>
            <li> I have to question if it is worth 20 mins of my time or use a regular foundation in about 3-5 mins.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to plug in the makeup pods and use them, as long as you make sure that the little plug is taken out correctly and replaced immediately after use, then you will find that foundation, blush or whatever you are using will not dry out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (highlighter is really good), but the blush is too dramatic.</li>
            <li> not necessarily because this is faster in and of itself but because I don&#x27;t have to drag out and then store away as many products...</li>
            <li> She was very surprised by how well the makeup stayed</li>
            <li> For $200, she was quite excited to try this out, especially with the amount of time this could potentially save her in the morning when she applies her makeup for work.</li>
            <li> When I presented it to her to try out, she was moderately hopeful that she would like it better than other foundations that she has tried.</li>
            <li> If it really only took 3 minutes, I would be willing to get through it, but I don&#x27;t have 20 minutes just for foundation.</li>
            <li> normal days, I still rarely use the air make-up because I find a brief dusting of mineral make-up is nice enough for casual public outings (I&#x27;m looking at you grocery store), but I look forward to the opportunity to break it out for a party or business function as I experimented with a lighter application from the TEMPTU pods and found it to look a lot more natural than regular make-up.</li>
            <li> The instructions were extremely clear as well.</li>
            <li> Also, you must keep the noxzzles and things clear-</li>
            <li> It only took a handful of tries before I felt comfortable using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too much of a hassle for me to worry about using this daily, as I like to just brush on and go.</li>
            <li> yet it makes it so that you will look natural and not overly made</li>
            <li> she disliked:&lt;br /&gt;Airbrushing anywhere near her eyes.</li>
            <li> Space is an issue in my old house.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for natural makeup look this</li>
            <li> This system is also so much easier than the water based systems because of the pods, there is no need for constant cleaning.</li>
            <li> Though I have never been a professional makeup artist, I have been a professional photographer</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this airbrush system does not perform or produce results like a professional system.</li>
            <li> You may also need to clean the tip of the pod with a Q-tip if you don&#x27;t use it for a few days and the tip gets clogged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommend this system.</li>
            <li> She said it made her eyes feel a little dry, but she was also creeped out by the idea of a fine mist of foundation on her eyes.</li>
            <li> if u dont have a steady hand the blush can look weird and is pretty dark, suggest the knob should be almost the highest setting which spreads it more.</li>
            <li> I also like (and personally use) Temptu products and have seen them used regularly by professional make up</li>
            <li> The stacking of these shades would get me back to a natural skin color while providing contouring effects.</li>
            <li> Next, I kept learning and refining the process and finally I am able to get it down to about 20 minutes and nothing less than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you have oily skin, this might or might not work as well on you, but if you have normal or dry skin, it should work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you have oily skin, this might or might not work as well on you, but if you have normal or dry skin, it should work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The foundation also has a funny smell that I don&#x27;t like and also slightly irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> The foundation also has a funny smell that I don&#x27;t like and also slightly irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> Even the first time out, I didn&#x27;t make a mess.  </li>
            <li> First, there was no sound (the unit is noisy), they barely blinked, and their skin wasn&#x27;t moving where the air was hitting</li>
            <li> Once in a while it matches, but in many cases, it was just a bit too yellow which is frustrating.  </li>
            <li> The compressor isn&#x27;t loud at all, but it does make it vibrate around just a little bit on my counter top, so I suggest putting it away from the edge, or at least keeping a watch on it when it&#x27;s running.</li>
            <li> the air comes out SO forcefully that I could barely keep my eyes open.  </li>
            <li> When I get to a blemish on my face I pull the trigger back a little further and move in a circular motion right over the blemish.</li>
            <li> On older clients, the makeup does not settle into the creases or lines unless you apply too intensely with too thick of an application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The low pressure of the trigger allows for a very natural look with minimal makeup and</li>
            <li> I was really worried about this breaking my face out because I&#x27;m very acne prone, but after a few weeks of using it, I&#x27;ve actually had less acne</li>
            <li> It did apply the makeup evenly, but it had her putting on a little too much</li>
            <li> follow the directions included in the little booklet, and in no time your pod is attached and you are ready to start.  </li>
            <li> In the end if you use it correctly you save money on product and get a professional clean looking finish without looking fake.</li>
            <li> I frequently shoot video dialogues and instructionals for various YouTube channels and typically layer up make-up on these shoots in order to balance my skin tone and cover a few red places on my jawline created by older acne.</li>
            <li> Apparently she feels like foundation in general settles into little lines in her face and her \\&quot;oversized pores\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Definitely apply a moisturizer before you apply this makeup as it can dry out the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this didn&#x27;t dry my skin out further.</li>
            <li> Pods - Read the instructions on the foundation pods carefully as you have to open up a tiny rubber plug on the pod after taking off the chrome cap and might need to pull out the clear spring loaded plunger a few times to loosen it up to get the makeup flowing properly.</li>
            <li> I had a few start up hitches as makeup would not flow freely at first till I read the troubleshooting instructions and pulled the plunger a few times to get it flowing again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad but nothing I want to put up with on a daily basis.e foundation is expensive and the shades are limited.</li>
            <li> I am no makeup artist, so I stuck to the basic settings and pulled the trigger back about half way.</li>
            <li> I also have dry skin</li>
            <li> Since you aren&#x27;t using a make up sponge to apply, you will actually save money in the long run on product since you are using much less and not wasting anything.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t see why someone would want this, but on the other hand, I&#x27;m not ready to give up on it entirely.  </li>
            <li> I thought I needed and shook it, then pulled the little stopper out and pulled the plunger thing up and down a few times, which it suggested doing when you open a new foundation.</li>
            <li> Sad to say, exactly like my regular liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was the extra time involved with the compressor, over my usual routine.</li>
            <li> So, while my review is a little mixed, I would just say that this is not for everybody.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much of a learning curve; just keep moving the brush around</li>
            <li> and I had it up and running in only a few minutes without any issues at all.</li>
            <li> Even with one closed.</li>
            <li> Temptu provided me only a few foundation colors to try, no blush, no highlighter/glow.</li>
            <li> I hate to read instructions, but I did for this one after I couldn&#x27;t figure it out on my own.  </li>
            <li> When doing the same with mineral make-up (BareEscentuals), I would start with primer then brush on bronzer in select regions, then a slightly lighter than usual shade of make-up, then my regular shade, then the mineral veil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The key to using this kit is to use very little pressure on the trigger of the airbrush sprayer.  </li>
            <li> The kit comes with a short instructional DVD as well and wand, 4 make-up cartridges, practice sheets to get a feel for the coverage control, a small air-compressor, a power adaptor and tubing to connect the wand to the air-compressor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but like some other reviewers mentioned, there does seem to be rather a lot of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; in the air while using and this concerns me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do extreme close-ups) without my feeling like my face is caked.</li>
            <li> Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the pods have the tendency to dry out just a little.</li>
            <li> The learning curve is a little steep but not quite as steep as I expected.</li>
            <li> Despite the battle scars I carry with me, my unaffected skin has a natural glow to it that I hate covering up by applying traditional foundations to my entire face</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t just set this thing down and run out the door after a rushed morning of beautifying.</li>
            <li> Also, the idea of breathing a little of it also bothered her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance.</li>
            <li> She did have a little trouble knowing when to quit-</li>
            <li> In all cases, I have found that it does look airbrushed and there are not lines or uneven texture.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It appears that the makeup pods that were included were dried and wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I should add a little disclaimer here: she doesn&#x27;t usually wear foundation.</li>
            <li> work that one has to do with regular make-up to provide the results this system does takes time and would usually involve me applying a base, sometimes a face glow cream or BB cream, my actual foundation, concealer, highlighter, and a sealing powder.</li>
            <li> However, the foundation is expensive and the shades are limited.</li>
            <li> Temptu Makeup set has a problem which I can not seem to get around and which makes it frustrating to use.  </li>
            <li> The manual suggests depressing the trigger no more than halfway, and applying in a circular motion with the wand about 6 inches from your face.  </li>
            <li> I got this product for a daughter who is into the dramatic arts.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have tried and failed to apply anything from this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She found that without makeup remover, it was difficult to scrub this makeup off her face.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t complicated, but you must unhook the pod you are using and close</li>
            <li> I was afraid I&#x27;d shoot foundation in my eye, my mouth and up my nose</li>
            <li> makeup goes on very, very faintly.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product and the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is I have chronic dry-eye and this will definitely dry the eyeballs out even more. But, if you suffer from this you are already use to eye drops and the need to just keep them handy. This will not stop me from using it, just make some adjustments is all.</li>
            <li> Maybe im not using it as efficiently as other experienced makeup artists, but i dont see this giving me that flawless movie star look unless i apply like 3 layers of this stuff. and if u dont wait, it will look cakey. I&#x27;d rather use this for spot treatments than foundation. I just use the foundation and highlighter (highlighter is really good), but the blush is too dramatic. if u dont have a steady hand the blush can look weird and is pretty dark, suggest the knob should be almost the highest setting which spreads it more. im pretty much going back to liquid foundation than this time consuming machine.</li>
            <li> I love makeup, so I was very excited to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kit contained the airbrush system itself, an instructional DVD, and 6 different shades of oil-free makeup: Porcelain, Almond, Warm Ivory, Warm Beige, Natural, and Beige. There was no blush or highlighter, even though the description says they were included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched the DVD and the videos on the Temptu site before I began.  I didn&#x27;t know which shade to select, and the shade selector on the site didn&#x27;t help much, as it isn&#x27;t very descriptive.  I guessed I was \\&quot;beige.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system itself was very easy to put together. When turned on, the airbrush shoots a continuous stream of air.  You then pull back on the trigger to add makeup to the air. A \\&quot;mist of makeup,\\&quot; if you will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makeup goes on very, very faintly.  There&#x27;s not much of a learning curve; just keep moving the brush around and you&#x27;ll do fine.  Now here&#x27;s what they don&#x27;t tell you:  the air comes out SO forcefully that I could barely keep my eyes open.  No, I wasn&#x27;t shooting makeup into my eyes, but I was shooting air.  I couldn&#x27;t even do the top part of my nose or between my eyebrows because it was killing my eyes.  I went back to look at the videos and could tell that none of the happy, smiling models even had the machine turned on.  First, there was no sound (the unit is noisy), they barely blinked, and their skin wasn&#x27;t moving where the air was hitting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This took forever to build up a nice, even coverage--NOT three minutes, unless you&#x27;re starting with practically flawless skin and need the merest daub of coverage.  How did it look?  Sad to say, exactly like my regular liquid foundation. While it looked fine, there was nothing different about it that I&#x27;d want to spend $200 and add MORE time to my beauty routine every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t see why someone would want this, but on the other hand, I&#x27;m not ready to give up on it entirely.  I might buy the blush and highlighter tosee how they look.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my wife. For $200, she was quite excited to try this out, especially with the amount of time this could potentially save her in the morning when she applies her makeup for work. The prognosis is that it was \\&quot;okay\\&quot; and not as good as she had hoped. It did apply the makeup evenly, but it had her putting on a little too much makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will probably be better for women who use a lot of makeup. My beautiful wife only needs a little bit to look her best, so this turned out to be not for her. But she felt that others could benefit from something like this. So, while my review is a little mixed, I would just say that this is not for everybody. Some people may love it, but my wife didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I usually only wear Laura Geller powder foundation, as I don&#x27;t need a lot of coverage. But I decided to try this out for fun. It is fairly easy to use and get the hang of. I was a bit paranoid about getting color on my clothing, as you&#x27;re supposed to keep the airbrush 4-6 inches from your face. Thankfully, it comes out light, so you can layer on the color. It provides great coverage, giving me flawless-looking skin. It&#x27;s a bit too much of a hassle for me to worry about using this daily, as I like to just brush on and go. But this is great for a special night out.. or for when you know there&#x27;ll be photos!</li>
            <li> I took some time to review the Temptu Airbrush Makeup System Starter Kit in Fair because I wanted to test out this system on myself and on others which have different makeup needs.  This kit is a great compromise between the top level airbrush makeup artists equipment and a simpler version for day to day use by those who need to have professional makeup with minimal work and interaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this kit with all of the colors given in the kit as well as bronzer, blush, and self tanner.  In all cases, the Airbrush makeup kit is very easy to use and almost fool proof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to using this kit is to use very little pressure on the trigger of the airbrush sprayer.  The lighter the pressure, the better.  Also, make sure that yo use round swirling motions when applying the makeup to the face.  In all cases, I have found that it does look airbrushed and there are not lines or uneven texture.  On older clients, the makeup does not settle into the creases or lines unless you apply too intensely with too thick of an application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS KIT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit is easy to use.  It is easy to plug in the makeup pods and use them, as long as you make sure that the little plug is taken out correctly and replaced immediately after use, then you will find that foundation, blush or whatever you are using will not dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The low pressure of the trigger allows for a very natural look with minimal makeup and yet it makes it so that you will look natural and not overly made up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I DON&#x27;T LIKE ABOUT THIS SET&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Temptu Makeup set has a problem which I can not seem to get around and which makes it frustrating to use.  All of the foundations seem to be too yellow.  If barely applied, it can work, but in most cases, I found it to be a tough match on most skin tones- I used five different colors of foundation.  Once in a while it matches, but in many cases, it was just a bit too yellow which is frustrating.  No matter how flawless the application is, if the coloring is off, it just does not look right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL COMMENTS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, as an experienced makeup artists, I love the concept and application process of the Temptu makeup system.  The wide variety of blush, tanner, highlight, and foundation colors offered make it fun to use, and great on many skin tones.  The problem is that the foundation tones don&#x27;t seem to come in a big enough range of colors.  If we could even mix our own shades or be able to purchase other colors, it would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In many cases, I could make it work on various skin tones, but it still had a bit of a yellow appearance no matter what I did in a lot of cases.  Some people were happy with this, and others were not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily skin, this might or might not work as well on you, but if you have normal or dry skin, it should work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this with a variety of primers and found that Guerlain pearl toned primer and Lorac Aquaprime primer seemed to work the best on most skin types.  If I could mix my own foundation or if it came in more of a variety of skin tones, this set would be almost perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it is, if your skin tone falls in the range of what is offered in foundation colors, I highly recommend you try it.  I am very fussy about foundations (most of which I don&#x27;t like) and this kit seems to work well if used lightly and sparingly.ting.

            <li> Love everything about it! Very smooth application.....feels like you are not wearing any makeup!! I love the product! I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I can not express my surprise at how efficiently this product works. Even though I had read the description before choosing it I didnt&#x27; expect it to be as high quality as it is. I will continue to use this, feel beautiful when I do, and not mind the cost. In the end if you use it correctly you save money on product and get a professional clean looking finish without looking fake. A definite must have for the lady that has to look good for long periods of time without looking like you have too much makeup on.</li>
            <li> I am not a graceful person, so I was a bit intimidated by the system at first.  It was easy to assemble, just attach the tubing and the power supply and I was ready to start.  My system came with the \\&quot;fair\\&quot; foundation package.  At first I decided to work with one of the darker colors since I knew it would show up well and I wouldn&#x27;t waste the appropriately colored product on my practice attempts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just follow the directions included in the little booklet, and in no time your pod is attached and you are ready to start.  A little trigger on top of the wand allows you to control the amount of product released.  The manual suggests depressing the trigger no more than halfway, and applying in a circular motion with the wand about 6 inches from your face.  Even the first time out, I didn&#x27;t make a mess.  It took me just a minute or two to get the hang of it and to get even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much that after just the first session, I purchased a blush pod.  I have been using them both and am delighted with the look as well as the feel.  The makeup is so light it feels like I am not wearing any and the coverage is so even and matte that I don&#x27;t need powder.  I absolutely love it and if I could I would give it MORE than five stars!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this [[ASIN:B009OY8GK4 TEMPTU AIRbrush Makeup System 2.0 and Signature Starter Kit, Fair]] to experiment and learn the art of airbrush makeup.  Unfortunately I have tried and failed to apply anything from this.&lt;br /&gt;It appears that the makeup pods that were included were dried and wouldn&#x27;t work.  The compressor seems to be in working order and is blowing air, but no product.  I thought it was just me, and asked my husband to help.  He tried and the same thing happens, air blows with no makeup application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted an airbrush makeup systems, so I was beyond excited to be getting this one. I watched a ton of tutorials for this system while waiting for mine to arrive and felt pretty comfortable trying it out the minute it came to the door. It was so easy to use. The instructions were extremely clear as well. I took out the foundation color I thought I needed and shook it, then pulled the little stopper out and pulled the plunger thing up and down a few times, which it suggested doing when you open a new foundation. I slid the pod in and turned it on. I am no makeup artist, so I stuck to the basic settings and pulled the trigger back about half way. It sent a steady, very lite mist out onto my face. It has a bit of a smell, but it&#x27;s a pretty clean smell and goes away after it dries, from my experience. I have no issues with it getting in my eyes, mouth, or nose either. I close the eye I&#x27;m working on, only when I&#x27;m doing the eyelid and under eye and I also close my mouth when I&#x27;m working right around it, but the mist really is so fine that when I have accidentally shot myself in the eye, it hasn&#x27;t even hurt or anything. It just felt more moist. When I get to a blemish on my face I pull the trigger back a little further and move in a circular motion right over the blemish. It eventually just fades away like magic. I was really worried about this breaking my face out because I&#x27;m very acne prone, but after a few weeks of using it, I&#x27;ve actually had less acne then I get with my regular Clinique foundation. It feels a lot lighter on my face too, but my face stays looking flawless all day long. The compressor isn&#x27;t loud at all, but it does make it vibrate around just a little bit on my counter top, so I suggest putting it away from the edge, or at least keeping a watch on it when it&#x27;s running. Overall, I highly recommend this system. It has a good variety of colors, you can blend different colors, if you can&#x27;t find a perfect match to your skin, it feels great on  your skin, and most importantly, you don&#x27;t have to be a professional to use it. I&#x27;ve never used an airbrush system in my life and I had it up and running in only a few minutes without any issues at all.</li>
            <li> I passed this off to my wife. I should add a little disclaimer here: she doesn&#x27;t usually wear foundation. The kit that we received from Vine had the Makeup system 2.0 and foundation. When I presented it to her to try out, she was moderately hopeful that she would like it better than other foundations that she has tried. Apparently she feels like foundation in general settles into little lines in her face and her \\&quot;oversized pores\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t really know what she is talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She read through the provided materials and practiced briefly on the provided practice sheets. She liked that the system is easy to just pick up and use the first time. The instructions are clear and precise with good illustrations. The children were mesmerized as they watched mommy airbrush her face. She said the makeup went on very lightly and it was fairly easy to keep adding layers. She did have a little trouble knowing when to quit- there is of course, a fine line between just right and too much when it comes to make up. She appreciated the natural feel of it on her face. She was very surprised by how well the makeup stayed on- some stuff she has used will wipe off when you blow your nose or swipe chocolate kisses off your cheek. She found that without makeup remover, it was difficult to scrub this makeup off her face. It came off fine with remover, or even face soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things she disliked:&lt;br /&gt;Airbrushing anywhere near her eyes. Even with one closed. She said it made her eyes feel a little dry, but she was also creeped out by the idea of a fine mist of foundation on her eyes. Same sort of thing for her lips. Also, the idea of breathing a little of it also bothered her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance. You can&#x27;t just set this thing down and run out the door after a rushed morning of beautifying. It isn&#x27;t complicated, but you must unhook the pod you are using and close it up- otherwise it may leak all over your bathroom counter. Also, you must keep the noxzzles and things clear- although after having not cleaned it a time or too, hers still worked fine.- although after having not cleaned it a time or too, hers still worked fine.</li>
            <li> Admittedly this was fun to try even when I screwed up here and there. I have used a cream my whole life before this. It only took a handful of tries before I felt comfortable using this. Anybody with a girl child will have them looking at this thing like a dog to a bone. My niece is begging for it. It really is a great thing for a makeup artist or just an enthusiast. This is good to use for just a spot or whatever. I may have to get my own vanity area next though. Space is an issue in my old house.</li>
            <li> The Temptu airbrush makeup system did not take much time to set up. The compressor is plugged in and the tube wiring attached. The foundation pod is then snapped on with a push button on the side and the trigger on top controls the flow of makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foundation Pods - Read the instructions on the foundation pods carefully as you have to open up a tiny rubber plug on the pod after taking off the chrome cap and might need to pull out the clear spring loaded plunger a few times to loosen it up to get the makeup flowing properly. I had a few start up hitches as makeup would not flow freely at first till I read the troubleshooting instructions and pulled the plunger a few times to get it flowing again. You may also need to clean the tip of the pod with a Q-tip if you don&#x27;t use it for a few days and the tip gets clogged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to match the shade correctly, as some shades can look right but go on really chalky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manual - The instruction manual has some great tips and a few practice pages to help control the precision of the flow. They also give tips on how to give coverage for different face types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to follow the instructions and hold the tip 6 inches or more away from the face. There is a lot of temptation to bring it closer or too apply too much pressure on the trigger but that produces a chalky look. Practice will help to determine the right amount for your skin especially if it does not need too much coverage and you don&#x27;t use foundation normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using primer before applying this makeup is important in my opinion, as it helps with even application. Definitely apply a moisturizer before you apply this makeup as it can dry out the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The camera does pick up on the airbrushed look and the pictures taken after airbrushing look much more natural so it can be great for evening wear makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Temptu airbrush system is easy to use if you maintain it well. However, the foundation is expensive and the shades are limited. I have still not found one that matches my skin color perfectly. The foundation also has a funny smell that I don&#x27;t like and also slightly irritates my skin. It&#x27;s not bad but nothing I want to put up with on a daily basis.e foundation is expensive and the shades are limited. I have still not found one that matches my skin color perfectly.

            <li> This isn&#x27;t an item to be used in 20 minutes on your way out the door. It&#x27;s sort of an industrial strength makeup application system perhaps to be used before prom or a big event. Which isn&#x27;t exactly what I was in the market for. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the pods have the tendency to dry out just a little. It wasn&#x27;t unusable, but some of the pods definitely sprayed better than others. If you&#x27;re looking for natural makeup look this probably isn&#x27;t for you, but there is certainly a market and it probably serves that demographic well.</li>
            <li> I am beyond impressed with my purchase. I had originally purchased a water based makeup airbrush and decided to return it and give the silicon based makeup a try because I have oily skin and wanted longer wear. I have very acne prone skin and I have yet to break out once since wearing my temptu makeup. This system is also so much easier than the water based systems because of the pods, there is no need for constant cleaning. The colors are also very forgiving so finding a match is no problem. It stays on all day and my skin looks flawless. BUY IT YOU WONT REGRET IT!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve heard the saying \\&quot;practice makes perfect\\&quot;. That applies to the Temptu also. It&#x27;s not as easy as it appears when you watch the videos. I was afraid I&#x27;d shoot foundation in my eye, my mouth and up my nose (I didn&#x27;t!). The instructions come with practice sheets so you can get it right there before you try it on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most days I don&#x27;t wear foundation, only a BB cream -- but for those special occasions I&#x27;ve always wanted my face to look perfect like those women&#x27;s faces look in the Sephora catalog - you know...not a pore, not a blemish, and the dewy moist look. Once you get the hang of the Temptu, which didn&#x27;t take long, I was able to achieve close to what I&#x27;d see in a Sephora catalog, as close as one can get if you&#x27;re in your mid-40&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mist is so fine, it&#x27;s not like using a can of spray paint. You can build multiple layers if needed. I was able to cover a couple of faint age spots I have, and my freckles, and it felt like I wasn&#x27;t wearing foundation, it feels like it&#x27;s part of my skin. No cakey feeling. I also have dry skin and this didn&#x27;t dry my skin out further. (I applied Laura Geller Spackle Primer before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a light in most makeup such as Bare Minerals. I&#x27;m also a Light 003 in this, but I tried the Porcelain 001 (called Fair here) also and that worked for me. In the summer, Light Medium 005 may be OK when I have a bit of a tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was the extra time involved with the compressor, over my usual routine. That may change as I use it more and become more experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  I cannot comment on the blush or the highlighter/glow even those are listed as being included in this kit. Temptu provided me only a few foundation colors to try, no blush, no highlighter/glow.</li>
            <li> First off - I hate to read instructions, but I did for this one after I couldn&#x27;t figure it out on my own.  Do that.  Read those instructions since it will make your life with this product incredibly easier. Once I read through, this airbrush was super easy to use and very light. The unique design of the brush fits your hand much like a pencil and you can quickly cover your skin with the light and long wearing make up that came with the kit.  I have super sensitive skin and the feel of this product is on par with the most expensive brands like Chanel.  Since you aren&#x27;t using a make up sponge to apply, you will actually save money in the long run on product since you are using much less and not wasting anything.  I have very fair skin and use the Ivory which covered everything (even freckles!) with two sprays and NO concealer.  I have combination skin that is more on the dryer side and this foundation was a perfect match for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought at first that this would take me much longer to use than traditional makeup, but once I got the hang of the wand, I could quickly cover everything within two minutes.  I did leave everything set up so all I had to do was pop in the make up pod.  Those pods are a work of genius.  I also found that you can easily pop them in and out to mix colors.  I know during the summer, I have to switch to a bit darker foundation and I can custom blend the colors for a better match. You can also order directly from the manufacturer for a custom color but the Ivory was such a perfect one, I don&#x27;t know that will need to do that.  I just matched my normal foundation with the closest one in the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note about the makeup -- I had to start using cleanser wipes to get it off and then with a final wash. It really does stick to your skin and it doesn&#x27;t wear off,  I reminds me a lot of my favorite day to day Clinique foundation that was discontinued.  When I went out at night, I did use powder to set it, but I think the finish is fine with out it.  I always wondered how my Hollywood friends always looked so flawlessly made up and now I know.  This thing is amazing.is fine with out it.  I always wondered how my Hollywood friends always looked so flawlessly made up and now I know.  This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> Though I have never been a professional makeup artist, I have been a professional photographer and I have seen a lot of exceptional professional airbrush makeup work. I also like (and personally use) Temptu products and have seen them used regularly by professional make up artists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this airbrush system does not perform or produce results like a professional system. Nor it it possible to achieve coverage (face) in 3 minutes as Temptu claims. Light coverage might be possible in 3 minutes (if you don&#x27;t have any marks or blemishes to conceal), but if you have uneven skin tone or blemishes, expect to spend about 15-20 minutes applying foundation in \\&quot;light, even layers\\&quot; to achieve an evenly applied effect. All the while, you are breathing Temptu makeup \\&quot;vapor\\&quot; as you blow the product all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I have watched professional makeup artists use airbrush makeup, the spray is very fine with no glopiness what so ever, but offers really good coverage in one or two passes. This is not possible with this consumer grade Temptu system. The droplets are not as fine or as consistent as those produced by a professional airbrush. If you want good coverage in one or two passes with this Temptu airbrush, you have to crank up the flow which makes the droplets bigger and the coverage look glopey and cakey. If you want fine / even coverage, you have to layer and layer and layer a very light spray. It took me about 20 minutes of spraying (with breathing breaks away from the makeup vapor) to achieve this same look the pros get in 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the final result worth it? Frankly, no. I did not find the final result to be superior to liquid foundations applied with fingertips and sponges. More sanitary, of course, but breathing all that sprayed makeup can&#x27;t be good for you. If it really only took 3 minutes, I would be willing to get through it, but I don&#x27;t have 20 minutes just for foundation. I would not recommend this airbrush system, but I do like Temptu products in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading, I hope this review was helpful!do like Temptu products in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading, I hope this review was helpful!</li>
            <li> I got this product for a daughter who is into the dramatic arts. She and her friend quickly mastered how to use it and found spray went on evenly and easily. The kit comes with a short instructional DVD as well and wand, 4 make-up cartridges, practice sheets to get a feel for the coverage control, a small air-compressor, a power adaptor and tubing to connect the wand to the air-compressor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is that the wand, that holds the make-up cartridge is made from plastic. This makes the wand very light but also easy to break.</li>
            <li> The world of airbrushed makeup is totally new to me, but I can&#x27;t think of a better system to start with if this describes you also. The system could not be easier to set up and use. The learning curve is a little steep but not quite as steep as I expected. Right now I find that it works best in a pinch but going forward I can see that there are many more possibilities than just saving time. I am going to need more practice but this seems like a great little system so far.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to receive this product - after trying out all the foundations in Macys and Nordstorm and the Mineral kits - I really wanted to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After selecting the right shade for my skin tone, I started using it to apply foundation - the very first time it took me 30 mins since I have to cover a couple of blemishes.  Next, I kept learning and refining the process and finally I am able to get it down to about 20 minutes and nothing less than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have to question if it is worth 20 mins of my time or use a regular foundation in about 3-5 mins.  It does a good job, but somehow for me - it just take a longer time.</li>
            <li> I love how my face looks after I apply foundation using the Temptu but like some other reviewers mentioned, there does seem to be rather a lot of \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; in the air while using and this concerns me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise I really like this product. It was super easy to set up and use. I am very fair with rosy undertones to my skin. I have an age spot on the bridge of my nose but no acne or scars and I found this covered the age spot and yet I could still see a bit of rosy-ness and I prefer that. I want good coverage but not a \\&quot;mask\\&quot; and I felt I got that with the Temptu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using a fan to eliminate the \\&quot;aerosol\\&quot; effect of the make up that the Temptu was imparting while using it and this did help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this enough that I would continue to use it. Maybe not every day but for sure for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I frequently shoot video dialogues and instructionals for various YouTube channels and typically layer up make-up on these shoots in order to balance my skin tone and cover a few red places on my jawline created by older acne. It helps keep the focus on the content instead of me as an individual. I have really liked using this TEMPTU system because it helps me build enough coverage to look basically flawless on camera (Note: I don&#x27;t do extreme close-ups) without my feeling like my face is caked. I have done a sample test and loved the results and don&#x27;t feel like I would want to run from filming to a sink to wash my mask off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work that one has to do with regular make-up to provide the results this system does takes time and would usually involve me applying a base, sometimes a face glow cream or BB cream, my actual foundation, concealer, highlighter, and a sealing powder. When doing the same with mineral make-up (BareEscentuals), I would start with primer then brush on bronzer in select regions, then a slightly lighter than usual shade of make-up, then my regular shade, then the mineral veil. The stacking of these shades would get me back to a natural skin color while providing contouring effects. The TEMPTU takes the place of all of this for my video work, and that alone is a big timesaver....not necessarily because this is faster in and of itself but because I don&#x27;t have to drag out and then store away as many products...just my primer, this, and sometimes a sealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On normal days, I still rarely use the air make-up because I find a brief dusting of mineral make-up is nice enough for casual public outings (I&#x27;m looking at you grocery store), but I look forward to the opportunity to break it out for a party or business function as I experimented with a lighter application from the TEMPTU pods and found it to look a lot more natural than regular make-up. Despite the battle scars I carry with me, my unaffected skin has a natural glow to it that I hate covering up by applying traditional foundations to my entire face but there was no way around it. The results provided by this greatly mirror a natural tone, so I don&#x27;t really feel like I am losing any innate pizzazz - perhaps the greatest plus of using this on a regular day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even for those who don&#x27;t need to be on-camera, I think the benefits of having a flawless or nearly flawless looking complexion that doesn&#x27;t scream \\&quot;make-up!\\&quot; would make this system a worthwhile investment over time. It is a large up-front purchase, but it ends up being a better value over time.</li>
