            <li>It goes on smoothly and smells nice.</li>
            <li>I try to make sure and get it wiped off before getting dressed after tanning.</li>

            <li>Ive already noticed a difference in my legs and LOVE the results.</li>
            <li>so most bronzers tend to turn orange on my skin type.</li>
            <li>and it was okay.</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love Snooki?</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>hands down snooki has the best smelling leg lotion most stink!</li>
            <li>streaked If not applied perfectly evenly.. and does not dry very quickly</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take long to get a nice color going just make sure you rub it in good!</li>
            <li>this is so wonderful and it really works great really darkens your legs very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already got a pretty good color</li>
            <li>I am pretty fair and have been tanning for a month before trying this.</li>
            <li>This is worth the buy!!  </li>
            <li>And loved that it came to me super super fast!!!!</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and light and the bronzer does great at getting your legs nice and dark.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s smells kind of citrus-ey, which I&#x27;m also not crazy about.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li>Way better than Dark Sexy Legs or Hooker Legs!!!  </li>
            <li>Love the smile!</li>
            <li>I am not one that tans easily</li>
            <li>It does have a strong tanning lotion smell after tanning, though.</li>
            <li>Snooki Ultra Dark Leg Bronzer is the BEST!</li>
            <li>True love can conquer anything, I guess. )</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and truly slows down the growth of your leg hair.</li>
            <li>if you are reading, good luck in your new career!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did notice a SLIGHT decrease in hair growth as well, but nothing very impressive.</li>
            <li>Many many thanks!</li>
            <li>Stopped using it and legs feel fine.</li>
            <li>Followed by the Best Man (WHO WAS NOT A DOCTOR, BUT VERY HOT AND VERY SINGLE) who screamed if a doctor would come forward (THE DOCTOR WHO CAME FORWARD</li>
            <li>I would look fabulous after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>AND MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SILKY AND SMOOTH.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>I am extremely pale and have been trying to get the best tanning lotion to get me bronzed and colored</li>
            <li>My legs are much darker now!!!</li>
            <li>I have super fair skin naturally and thus gave me the richest color.</li>
            <li>Did not notice significant hair reduction.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li>I have not gotten to use it yet (waiting on my tanning eye protectors to be delivered), but I am excited to use it.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m excited to see</li>
            <li>i was really excited to use this</li>
            <li>The lotion smells delicious and it left my skin super soft!!</li>
            <li>Even put a little on my face while in the level 2 bed, and I&#x27;m more than happy with my results.</li>
            <li>I have to say&amp;#34; I really enjoyed this product and also with this product , you can actually use it all over your body, it really  is amazing.</li>
            <li>this product works good to help focus more on tanning up the legs their much harder for me to tan for some reason</li>
            <li>Love the smell 100% real and sealed...</li>
            <li>so I know it was true snooki product.</li>
            <li>No bad smell &amp; no streaking</li>
            <li>&amp; I DEF got good color on my legs, (whole body) but  esp legs &amp; was very happy about that because it seems like my legs always take 2x  as long 2 get dark.</li>
            <li>Loved it, but it could use a little more bronzer.</li>
            <li>The product resembles MILDLY tinted water.</li>
            <li>quickly (within three minutes) learned that .... WHAT THIS PRODUCT LACKS IN THE COLOR DEPARTMENT,  </li>
            <li>PACKED SUPER DUPER,</li>
            <li>And fades quick.</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair and it usually takes me awhile to get a tan.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also does tan your legs a very pretty shade, not an orange shade</li>
            <li>It works great as well my legs got dark.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a million products, most were the expensive top of the line products and this is by far the BEST one out there!!!</li>
            <li>always a nice dark tan guidette style :)</li>
            <li>You definitely get a huge bang for you buck with this product!!</li>
            <li>My only problem is that I didn&#x27;t buy more at the time!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to every lady!!!</li>
            <li>I did get super warm and sweated more than usual but definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t only get amazing color on my legs</li>
            <li>It does not give you the after tanning tanning bed smell which I love since you are not suppose to shower directly after tanning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it for the leg bronzing.</li>
            <li>far-  and love the scent and getting some tan look</li>
            <li>One tip, massage your legs until your skin has absorbed the lotion completely, or make sure to get all the lotion you will use at once because it can get slippery.</li>
            <li>super fast shipping !</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and leaves your skin very soft as well.</li>
            <li>Ok as a tanner this one is ok, the smell it pretty good, and does keep skin soft but my main draw for this lotion is after using it daily while tanning for only 5 days</li>
            <li>and now I barely shave my legs any more</li>
            <li>It smells soo good with no trace of that typical tan smell at all.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Snooki Ultra Dark Leg Bronzer is a pretty good lotion.</li>
            <li>Received this super fast with prime and tried it out about 6 hours ago.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m white with very fair skin and my legs are super dark from this stuff!</li>
            <li>but I am always looking for something that will reduce the time frame I have to shave and a little bronze is always good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always had a hard time getting my legs to tan and this works great.</li>
            <li>Very dark bronzer, and good tanner.</li>
            <li>Not so much!</li>
            <li>I have purchased this lotion many times and would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>so this helps target what I need and there aren&#x27;t many tanning products that address specific needs</li>
            <li>But this time I must!&lt;br /&gt;I used the lotion for the first time today and it can already see a difference on the skin tone of my legs.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I have been a sworn believer of Snooki&#x27;s tanning lotion since her first bottle.</li>
            <li>B&amp;#34;).....</li>
            <li>EXACTLY ONE HOUR BEFORE THE CEREMONY.</li>
            <li>I will have to order more this week, just to have extra</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this seller to anyone :)</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>A FEW MINUTES TO UNWRAP,WHICH IS GOOD, PLUS</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I did not test the product before the event, DUE TO THE BEYOND AMAZING REVIEWS.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this product and it really does help tan my legs much faster!</li>
            <li>34;ONLY SHE WAS ALLOWED TO CRY, AND HER TEARS WOULD BE HAPPY TEARS, NOT SAD TEARS, SO THOSE TEARS REALLY WOULD NOT COUNT FOR REAL CRYING</li>
            <li>, I want to be able to use it all summer long at  </li>
            <li>AS A ALL OVER TANNER,USED 1 TIME AND VERY NOTICEABLE, PRETTY TAN ALREADY , GOING FOR THE SELLER NOW,</li>
            <li>It did not turn me orange, it gave me a nice dark color.</li>
            <li>but it certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the leg hair growth inhibitors but my main concern was getting color&amp;it delivered!</li>
            <li>I really did notice less hair growth while using this product and it gave excellent color for this extremely pale girl.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend to not use it on your face tho since it&#x27;s so intense!</li>
            <li>My legs never tan very well</li>
            <li>; anyway, so that probably doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I have re ordered this product a number of times and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really make your legs tan, its just a bronzer</li>
            <li>It was ok, but didn&#x27;t do what I expected</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t really noticed the hair growth inhibitors doing much.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see the difference in hair growth, but I was also taking biotin vitamins at the time as well.</li>
            <li>but it really help with getting my legs darker without having to use a tingler.</li>
            <li>so &amp;#34;bland&amp;#34;, and far too complimentary. &amp;#34;caustic liquid from hell&amp;#34</li>
            <li>, I ask that any readers mentally replay that famously viral &amp;#34;YAAASSSS Lady Gaga!&amp;#34; clip.</li>
            <li>You really should look it up.</li>
            <li>You really should not</li>
            <li>you REALLY WERE here, snooki&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very picky with the products I use.</li>
            <li>, I can tell some difference in the hair growth on my legs already, my hair is thinner and doesn&#x27;t grow in as fast...</li>
            <li>The lotion arrived fast &amp; it had the seal on the container.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s product has helped keep my skin a summers glow on my legs plus the hair on my legs take a longer time to grow and much thinner.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging</li>
            <li>Had me very tan and glowingly...</li>
            <li>I was surprised to discover that SNOOKI, that lovable bouffant sporting oopma loompa, had sold her name (not to mention her reputation AND possible soul.</li>
            <li>Gives me better color than any other lotion ever has.</li>
            <li>I love the Snooki Black</li>
            <li>More beauty, less work.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this item as well as seller.</li>
            <li>- I am a highly educated woman.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>now is almost nov and still have some color  HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend</li>
            <li>I have had better results from the tingling lotion I use and a few cheaper brands bought at Walmart.</li>
            <li>they normally don&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion because I--like a lot of people I know--have most trouble with my legs tanning.</li>
            <li>My alabaster legs will TOTALLY appear long, lean, sexy and bronze.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product used for a few years</li>
            <li>, i do it every other day or every two days depending on how lazy  I am lol.</li>
            <li>Defiantly would recommend this to other pale people out there who are looking to get a nice color!</li>
            <li>Read all the reviews &amp; decided to try a new lotion.</li>
            <li>Just pre lotion your knees and ankles with non tanning lotion before you use if you have super dry skin and don&#x27;t want these areas to be darker.</li>
            <li>, I WILL BE BACK, FAST SHIPPING, GOT HERE FAST, GET YOU SOME,</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive.</li>
            <li>you really do get dark quick with it.  </li>
            <li>This really does decrease hair growth and is getting my legs super dark after just two weeks.</li>
            <li>CLEARLY!  </li>
            <li>and after you shower your legs feel so soft!</li>
            <li>The smell is okay :/</li>
            <li>but it usually wears off which I am really glad of.</li>
            <li>Snook Ultra Dark Leg Bronzer with Hair Growth Inhibitors really works !!!  </li>
            <li>Legs often need a little extra bronzer to tan them and this product  helps give them a natural golden rich color...plus it  inhibits hair growth</li>
            <li>I wanted to share those facts because SNOOKI, SNOOKI&#x27;S REALITY TELEVISION PROGRAM...and most of all, SNOOKI&#x27;S ULTRA DARK LEG BRONZER (from hell) are things that truly never cross MY mind.....</li>
            <li>did INTENSE self-tanner research online, because my skin simply had to look naturally orange for this blessed nuptial extravaganza.</li>
            <li>That did quite a bit of damage on my young mind, and I have dreaded the age of 29 for 21 years.</li>
            <li>(I had NOT noticed the hives, because I was too busy faux-smiling, fluffing skirts, and SOMEHOW blocking the pain of a rapidly developing, life threatening allergic reaction while dreaming of champagne.</li>
            <li>WOW I WISH THEY MADE THIS</li>
            <li>only two days thanks to amazons</li>
            <li>As far as this product stopping hair growth idk about that ..</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in the hair growth, but then again ive only been using this stuff for about a week now.</li>
            <li>it goes on evenly and looks natural.</li>
            <li>Snooki needs to make a lotion specifically for your face since she has one specifically for your legs because I am sure I am not the only person who has trouble tanning their face as well.</li>
            <li>I use it all over my body and get super dark..</li>
            <li>Noticeably tanner right after using it, but not too extreme.</li>
            <li>i use it on legs and arms, makes you super dark!</li>
            <li>I had been using DC Legs (both with a different tanner for the rest of me, either Lively or Coco) and picked up this one for its hair growth inhibitor properties.  </li>
            <li>SPECIFICALLY fast forward to he moment of silent prayer for the bride&#x27;s recently departed grandmother.</li>
            <li>but still it is not very dark as I was expecting -</li>
            <li>I generally like the product I use it on my legs and on my arms because my legs and arms don&#x27;t tan as well as the rest of my body</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell about the whole hair thing.</li>
            <li>I barely tan at all in the sun</li>
            <li>I explained that I was simply &amp;#34;expediting the prescribed drying time&amp;#34;, to avoid any &amp;#34;transfer of coloring to natural fibers&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>At THAT moment, the batty old minister quietly leaned over, covered his lapel microphone, and asked if I was allergic to my overflowing bouquet of gardenia and peony blossoms.</li>
            <li>I read some reviews and was skeptical about buying any tanning lotions on here from all the reviews of ppl saying it was all fake, my bottles came sealed and packaged very well, and work wonderful!</li>
            <li>I noticed I wasn&#x27;t having to shave half as much!</li>
            <li>The snooki Black Hot Bronzer, and the 70x</li>
            <li>It made my legs a little bit darker the first couple uses.</li>
            <li>(sadly, once again, VERY HOT and VERY NOT SINGLE) doctor put the puzzle pieces of blood tests together, and declared that the aforementioned &amp;#34;PRODUCT&amp;#34; was CLEARLY the reason for my massive allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Imagine the shame -- PURE SHAME, PEOPLE! -- of reading &amp;#34;SNOOKI SENT THIS WOMAN TO THE ER&amp;#34; on the hospital discharge papers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While heavily sedated, I had a dream about sending a postcard from Nantucket to MTV, with the following caption&lt;br</li>
            <li>However that Saturday was her FIRST DAY as a &amp;#34;REAL NURSE&amp;#34; since graduating in 2010, so I really can&#x27;t fault the poor girl.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to say if it&#x27;s helped slow down hair growth, but it got my legs super dark and the smell is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok bronzer but a little on the thick side.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Ive already noticed a difference in my legs and LOVE the results.</li>
            <li> so most bronzers tend to turn orange on my skin type.</li>
            <li> and it was okay.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love Snooki?</li>
            <li> It was okay.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> hands down snooki has the best smelling leg lotion most stink!</li>
            <li> streaked If not applied perfectly evenly.. and does not dry very quickly</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take long to get a nice color going just make sure you rub it in good!</li>
            <li> this is so wonderful and it really works great really darkens your legs very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already got a pretty good color</li>
            <li> I am pretty fair and have been tanning for a month before trying this.</li>
            <li> This is worth the buy!!  </li>
            <li> And loved that it came to me super super fast!!!!</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and light and the bronzer does great at getting your legs nice and dark.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s smells kind of citrus-ey, which I&#x27;m also not crazy about.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li> Way better than Dark Sexy Legs or Hooker Legs!!!  </li>
            <li> Love the smile!</li>
            <li> I am not one that tans easily</li>
            <li> It does have a strong tanning lotion smell after tanning, though.</li>
            <li> Snooki Ultra Dark Leg Bronzer is the BEST!</li>
            <li> True love can conquer anything, I guess. )</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and truly slows down the growth of your leg hair.</li>
            <li> if you are reading, good luck in your new career!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did notice a SLIGHT decrease in hair growth as well, but nothing very impressive.</li>
            <li> Many many thanks!</li>
            <li> Stopped using it and legs feel fine.</li>
            <li> Followed by the Best Man (WHO WAS NOT A DOCTOR, BUT VERY HOT AND VERY SINGLE) who screamed if a doctor would come forward (THE DOCTOR WHO CAME FORWARD</li>
            <li> I would look fabulous after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> AND MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SILKY AND SMOOTH.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly</li>
            <li> I am extremely pale and have been trying to get the best tanning lotion to get me bronzed and colored</li>
            <li> My legs are much darker now!!!</li>
            <li> I have super fair skin naturally and thus gave me the richest color.</li>
            <li> Did not notice significant hair reduction.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth it!</li>
            <li> I have not gotten to use it yet (waiting on my tanning eye protectors to be delivered), but I am excited to use it.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m excited to see</li>
            <li> i was really excited to use this</li>
            <li> The lotion smells delicious and it left my skin super soft!!</li>
            <li> Even put a little on my face while in the level 2 bed, and I&#x27;m more than happy with my results.</li>
            <li> I have to say&amp;#34; I really enjoyed this product and also with this product , you can actually use it all over your body, it really  is amazing.</li>
            <li> this product works good to help focus more on tanning up the legs their much harder for me to tan for some reason</li>
            <li> Love the smell 100% real and sealed...</li>
            <li> so I know it was true snooki product.</li>
            <li> No bad smell &amp; no streaking</li>
            <li> &amp; I DEF got good color on my legs, (whole body) but  esp legs &amp; was very happy about that because it seems like my legs always take 2x  as long 2 get dark.</li>
            <li> Loved it, but it could use a little more bronzer.</li>
            <li> The product resembles MILDLY tinted water.</li>
            <li> quickly (within three minutes) learned that .... WHAT THIS PRODUCT LACKS IN THE COLOR DEPARTMENT,  </li>
            <li> PACKED SUPER DUPER,</li>
            <li> And fades quick.</li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair and it usually takes me awhile to get a tan.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also does tan your legs a very pretty shade, not an orange shade</li>
            <li> It works great as well my legs got dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a million products, most were the expensive top of the line products and this is by far the BEST one out there!!!</li>
            <li> always a nice dark tan guidette style :)</li>
            <li> You definitely get a huge bang for you buck with this product!!</li>
            <li> My only problem is that I didn&#x27;t buy more at the time!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to every lady!!!</li>
            <li> I did get super warm and sweated more than usual but definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t only get amazing color on my legs</li>
            <li> It does not give you the after tanning tanning bed smell which I love since you are not suppose to shower directly after tanning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it for the leg bronzing.</li>
            <li> far-  and love the scent and getting some tan look</li>
            <li> One tip, massage your legs until your skin has absorbed the lotion completely, or make sure to get all the lotion you will use at once because it can get slippery.</li>
            <li> super fast shipping !</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and leaves your skin very soft as well.</li>
            <li> Ok as a tanner this one is ok, the smell it pretty good, and does keep skin soft but my main draw for this lotion is after using it daily while tanning for only 5 days</li>
            <li> and now I barely shave my legs any more</li>
            <li> It smells soo good with no trace of that typical tan smell at all.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Snooki Ultra Dark Leg Bronzer is a pretty good lotion.</li>
            <li> Received this super fast with prime and tried it out about 6 hours ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white with very fair skin and my legs are super dark from this stuff!</li>
            <li> but I am always looking for something that will reduce the time frame I have to shave and a little bronze is always good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always had a hard time getting my legs to tan and this works great.</li>
            <li> Very dark bronzer, and good tanner.</li>
            <li> Not so much!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this lotion many times and would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> so this helps target what I need and there aren&#x27;t many tanning products that address specific needs</li>
            <li> But this time I must!&lt;br /&gt;I used the lotion for the first time today and it can already see a difference on the skin tone of my legs.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I have been a sworn believer of Snooki&#x27;s tanning lotion since her first bottle.</li>
            <li> B&amp;#34;).....</li>
            <li> EXACTLY ONE HOUR BEFORE THE CEREMONY.</li>
            <li> I will have to order more this week, just to have extra</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this seller to anyone :)</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> A FEW MINUTES TO UNWRAP,WHICH IS GOOD, PLUS</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I did not test the product before the event, DUE TO THE BEYOND AMAZING REVIEWS.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this product and it really does help tan my legs much faster!</li>
            <li> 34;ONLY SHE WAS ALLOWED TO CRY, AND HER TEARS WOULD BE HAPPY TEARS, NOT SAD TEARS, SO THOSE TEARS REALLY WOULD NOT COUNT FOR REAL CRYING</li>
            <li> , I want to be able to use it all summer long at  </li>
            <li> AS A ALL OVER TANNER,USED 1 TIME AND VERY NOTICEABLE, PRETTY TAN ALREADY , GOING FOR THE SELLER NOW,</li>
            <li> It did not turn me orange, it gave me a nice dark color.</li>
            <li> but it certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the leg hair growth inhibitors but my main concern was getting color&amp;it delivered!</li>
            <li> I really did notice less hair growth while using this product and it gave excellent color for this extremely pale girl.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend to not use it on your face tho since it&#x27;s so intense!</li>
            <li> My legs never tan very well</li>
            <li> ; anyway, so that probably doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have re ordered this product a number of times and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really make your legs tan, its just a bronzer</li>
            <li> It was ok, but didn&#x27;t do what I expected</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t really noticed the hair growth inhibitors doing much.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see the difference in hair growth, but I was also taking biotin vitamins at the time as well.</li>
            <li> but it really help with getting my legs darker without having to use a tingler.</li>
            <li> so &amp;#34;bland&amp;#34;, and far too complimentary. &amp;#34;caustic liquid from hell&amp;#34</li>
            <li> , I ask that any readers mentally replay that famously viral &amp;#34;YAAASSSS Lady Gaga!&amp;#34; clip.</li>
            <li> You really should look it up.</li>
            <li> You really should not</li>
            <li> you REALLY WERE here, snooki&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very picky with the products I use.</li>
            <li> , I can tell some difference in the hair growth on my legs already, my hair is thinner and doesn&#x27;t grow in as fast...</li>
            <li> The lotion arrived fast &amp; it had the seal on the container.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s product has helped keep my skin a summers glow on my legs plus the hair on my legs take a longer time to grow and much thinner.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging</li>
            <li> Had me very tan and glowingly...</li>
            <li> I was surprised to discover that SNOOKI, that lovable bouffant sporting oopma loompa, had sold her name (not to mention her reputation AND possible soul.</li>
            <li> Gives me better color than any other lotion ever has.</li>
            <li> I love the Snooki Black</li>
            <li> More beauty, less work.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this item as well as seller.</li>
            <li> - I am a highly educated woman.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> now is almost nov and still have some color  HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend</li>
            <li> I have had better results from the tingling lotion I use and a few cheaper brands bought at Walmart.</li>
            <li> they normally don&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because I--like a lot of people I know--have most trouble with my legs tanning.</li>
            <li> My alabaster legs will TOTALLY appear long, lean, sexy and bronze.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this product used for a few years</li>
            <li> , i do it every other day or every two days depending on how lazy  I am lol.</li>
            <li> Defiantly would recommend this to other pale people out there who are looking to get a nice color!</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews &amp; decided to try a new lotion.</li>
            <li> Just pre lotion your knees and ankles with non tanning lotion before you use if you have super dry skin and don&#x27;t want these areas to be darker.</li>
            <li> , I WILL BE BACK, FAST SHIPPING, GOT HERE FAST, GET YOU SOME,</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive.</li>
            <li> you really do get dark quick with it.  </li>
            <li> This really does decrease hair growth and is getting my legs super dark after just two weeks.</li>
            <li> CLEARLY!  </li>
            <li> and after you shower your legs feel so soft!</li>
            <li> The smell is okay :/</li>
            <li> but it usually wears off which I am really glad of.</li>
            <li> Snook Ultra Dark Leg Bronzer with Hair Growth Inhibitors really works !!!  </li>
            <li> Legs often need a little extra bronzer to tan them and this product  helps give them a natural golden rich color...plus it  inhibits hair growth</li>
            <li> I wanted to share those facts because SNOOKI, SNOOKI&#x27;S REALITY TELEVISION PROGRAM...and most of all, SNOOKI&#x27;S ULTRA DARK LEG BRONZER (from hell) are things that truly never cross MY mind.....</li>
            <li> did INTENSE self-tanner research online, because my skin simply had to look naturally orange for this blessed nuptial extravaganza.</li>
            <li> That did quite a bit of damage on my young mind, and I have dreaded the age of 29 for 21 years.</li>
            <li> (I had NOT noticed the hives, because I was too busy faux-smiling, fluffing skirts, and SOMEHOW blocking the pain of a rapidly developing, life threatening allergic reaction while dreaming of champagne.</li>
            <li> WOW I WISH THEY MADE THIS</li>
            <li> only two days thanks to amazons</li>
            <li> As far as this product stopping hair growth idk about that ..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in the hair growth, but then again ive only been using this stuff for about a week now.</li>
            <li> it goes on evenly and looks natural.</li>
            <li> Snooki needs to make a lotion specifically for your face since she has one specifically for your legs because I am sure I am not the only person who has trouble tanning their face as well.</li>
            <li> I use it all over my body and get super dark..</li>
            <li> Noticeably tanner right after using it, but not too extreme.</li>
            <li> i use it on legs and arms, makes you super dark!</li>
            <li> I had been using DC Legs (both with a different tanner for the rest of me, either Lively or Coco) and picked up this one for its hair growth inhibitor properties.  </li>
            <li> SPECIFICALLY fast forward to he moment of silent prayer for the bride&#x27;s recently departed grandmother.</li>
            <li> but still it is not very dark as I was expecting -</li>
            <li> I generally like the product I use it on my legs and on my arms because my legs and arms don&#x27;t tan as well as the rest of my body</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell about the whole hair thing.</li>
            <li> I barely tan at all in the sun</li>
            <li> I explained that I was simply &amp;#34;expediting the prescribed drying time&amp;#34;, to avoid any &amp;#34;transfer of coloring to natural fibers&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> At THAT moment, the batty old minister quietly leaned over, covered his lapel microphone, and asked if I was allergic to my overflowing bouquet of gardenia and peony blossoms.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews and was skeptical about buying any tanning lotions on here from all the reviews of ppl saying it was all fake, my bottles came sealed and packaged very well, and work wonderful!</li>
            <li> I noticed I wasn&#x27;t having to shave half as much!</li>
            <li> The snooki Black Hot Bronzer, and the 70x</li>
            <li> It made my legs a little bit darker the first couple uses.</li>
            <li> (sadly, once again, VERY HOT and VERY NOT SINGLE) doctor put the puzzle pieces of blood tests together, and declared that the aforementioned &amp;#34;PRODUCT&amp;#34; was CLEARLY the reason for my massive allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Imagine the shame -- PURE SHAME, PEOPLE! -- of reading &amp;#34;SNOOKI SENT THIS WOMAN TO THE ER&amp;#34; on the hospital discharge papers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While heavily sedated, I had a dream about sending a postcard from Nantucket to MTV, with the following caption&lt;br</li>
            <li> However that Saturday was her FIRST DAY as a &amp;#34;REAL NURSE&amp;#34; since graduating in 2010, so I really can&#x27;t fault the poor girl.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to say if it&#x27;s helped slow down hair growth, but it got my legs super dark and the smell is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok bronzer but a little on the thick side.</li>
            <li> I am ALSO thoroughly petrified of premature aging due to excessive sun exposure, MOST LIKELY because I was an anxious only child, and my Mother would allow me to read Vogue at an early age.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been using it quite long enough to notice any &amp;#34;hair growth inhibitors&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time getting my legs and arms tanner, and this really gave me the boost.</li>
            <li> Not really seeing a big difference.</li>
            <li> but I used it all over to get a good base tan.</li>
            <li> , I was pale white and when I arrived I was SUPER DARK!!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried several other leg bronzer tanning creams.  </li>
            <li> The May 1989 issue beauty editor declared that age 29 is THE AGE of MASSIVE WRINKLE ONSET (amongst other things).</li>
            <li> I wish her other tanning lotions had the same scent.</li>
            <li> No different from any other leg bronzer .</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference within a few days with this product, I&#x27;ve used Australian Gold leg tanning lotion and never got the same results...</li>
            <li> it gives the nicest deep dark brown color.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so dark from it even though I&#x27;m Irish</li>
            <li> My hair is growing in thinner and only in little patches</li>
            <li> All her lotions smell the same to me so that was a little downfall</li>
            <li> It also seems to make the time between waxings just a tiny little bit longer, like maybe a week.</li>
            <li> WAS NOT VERY HOT BUT VERY SINGLE).</li>
            <li> I never really leave reviews for products.</li>
            <li> not very noticeable though.</li>
            <li> Occasionally I like to indoor tan due no free time during day.</li>
            <li> Ive used this lotion about 4 times now in 2 weeks and my legs are very dark, I havent really paid attention to slow down in hair growth as I shave every day anyway......</li>
            <li> Smells great and is DARK without being orange and awful tan looking</li>
            <li> Use it every other day in the tanning bed at the gym.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount of this lotion to give you the dark look you are looking for.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be dark for my Vegas trip</li>
            <li> My legs are as dark as the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> so you can go longer between shaving or waxing, helping your tan stay dark longer.</li>
            <li> The minister screamed, because his hearing aid was &amp;#34;very sensitive to shrill noises&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Please put down that</li>
            <li> br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked down at my legs, and then I screamed.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting tan and after the first use I noticed a dramatic difference.  </li>
            <li> (and I truly don&#x27;t mean to brag, because this is NOT worthy of bragging, but I lack only ONE IQ point for a lifetime MENSA membership)  </li>
            <li> Also use on spots that get white and are my hard to tan spots (like round my breasts)</li>
            <li> I got the Snookie black bronzer lotion for the rest of my body&amp; this Snookie Ultra Leg bronzer lotion.</li>
            <li> Slightly greasy formula and rubbed off on clothing/towels.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I AM a blonde, but that does not forgive such careless actions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;God must have crashed that ceremony, because the minister somehow noticed that my legs AND my palms were covered in massively angry red lumps that were larger than cookies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a Floridian in a career that requires me to wear suits and dress shoes, so the legs just can&#x27;t be hidden.  </li>
            <li> You get no real tan underneath :/</li>
            <li> I was writhing under the multi-faith chuppah,  apologizing profusely for crying from fear/shock/swelling of my airway....because the bride had previously screamed that &amp;#</li>
            <li> Made me extremely dark with just one use!</li>
            <li> The hair growth inhibitors seem to work a little</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive about ordering a tanning lotion online, but I received the tube and it was wrapped in plastic AND sealed (I had to rip foil off the opening).</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I have to shave everyday but when use the leg bronzer I can skip a day or two.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a rather pale Caucasian woman, in case you did not realize that.</li>
            <li> This bronzer makes my legs at least 2 shades darker than any other bronzer I have used.  </li>
            <li> NO girlfriend, you just need to buy some plain SOAP.</li>
            <li> Very odd.</li>
            <li> I usually put it on before going to the salon for this reason, because it will stain your hands.</li>
            <li> not sure why</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually go with bronzers for fear of orange streakiness but that was not an issue with this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked since I mainly bought it for tanning purposes and nothe growth inhibitor</li>
            <li> I am, and always have been, very pale.</li>
            <li> Not really good for pale skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hard to tan.</li>
            <li> always have a really really hard time getting my legs to tan</li>
            <li> And it does inhibit my leg hair regrowth by at least a day.</li>
            <li> had the pleasure of being stabbed with an epi-pen, while transported to the small island hospital, where I was again stabbed by the half - blind nursing student, as she tried to insert an IV.  </li>
            <li> I  MEAN TOOK ME</li>
            <li> I used this on the hard to tan areas like my legs, arms, and feet!</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion does all that it says it will do, I have a really hard time getting my legs to tan and this worked!</li>
            <li> Life is not great at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bad purchase from seller, lotion was expired and waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I just brushed him off, thinking that he was insane.</li>
            <li> and i was not impressed at all not buying again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about this</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this stuff, and I&#x27;ve been using it on my legs AND arms!  </li>
            <li> and then its gone. :(</li>
            <li> and I find that a lot of sprays and lotions either make me orange or smell like crap.</li>
            <li> I was shocked!</li>
            <li> Hysterically.</li>
            <li> Horrible itching and bumpy feeling legs after shaving.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I generally like the product I use it on my legs and on my arms because my legs and arms don&#x27;t tan as well as the rest of my body it can leave you orange streaked If not applied perfectly evenly.. and does not dry very quickly It gives you great color and smells really good but you do feel sticky afterwards I always wear shorts afterwards I don&#x27;t want that stuff on my clothes</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a a few weeks now and now I barely shave my legs any more, i do it every other day or every two days depending on how lazy  I am lol. I have to say&amp;#34; I really enjoyed this product and also with this product , you can actually use it all over your body, it really  is amazing. I loved it, and so will you.</li>
            <li> Hair Growth Inhibitors?? Not so much! It&#x27;s an ok bronzer but a little on the thick side. I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping &amp; good prices!!</li>
            <li> Nope.  Definitely, nope.</li>
            <li> Smells good but didn&#x27;t tan me at all, and I was OUT all sunny day</li>
            <li> Love this! Doesn&#x27;t take long to get a nice color going just make sure you rub it in good!</li>
            <li> This works great. My legs never tan very well and I noticed a difference after about 2 or 3 times with this product! I did notice a SLIGHT decrease in hair growth as well, but nothing very impressive. I doubt many people are buying this for the &amp;#34;hair growth inhibitors&amp;#34; anyway, so that probably doesn&#x27;t really matter. The bottom line is that it works well, I would tell others to buy it and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE it! I use it all over my body and get super dark.. I highly recommend to not use it on your face tho since it&#x27;s so intense!</li>
            <li> Best tanning brand I&#x27;ve tryed I will continue to order there products</li>
            <li> I have only used this lotion for 1 day since I just got it. It goes on smoothly and smells nice. It does not give you the after tanning tanning bed smell which I love since you are not suppose to shower directly after tanning. I will buy this product again. Snooki needs to make a lotion specifically for your face since she has one specifically for your legs because I am sure I am not the only person who has trouble tanning their face as well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! Snooki knows what she is doing!&#x27; I read some reviews and was skeptical about buying any tanning lotions on here from all the reviews of ppl saying it was all fake, my bottles came sealed and packaged very well, and work wonderful! I love my snooki tanning products and will not use anything else ever again!!!</li>
            <li> Great product shipping time :) love the lotion</li>
            <li> It was alright, kind of a sticky lotion, but it smelled good and got my tan going. I still have it</li>
            <li> Reasonable price. Speedy shipping. Smells great.</li>
            <li> I am not a Snooki fan by any means but I am always looking for something that will reduce the time frame I have to shave and a little bronze is always good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing. I was shocked! The color was actually nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product about 3x.  I can&#x27;t say that I have noticed any hair growth inhibitor but I think I would with continued use.  I used it on both legs and arms. If you have any noticeable arm hair, I would think that the growth inhibitor would be good. That&#x27;s why I used it on my arms.  As for a bronzer for pre-tanning, I think it works as well as others.  I&#x27;ve already got a pretty good color but it certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I like the results but don&#x27;t like the fact it stains your clothes after tanning.  I try to make sure and get it wiped off before getting dressed after tanning.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!! Loved it. I didn&#x27;t just limit to putting it on my legs but, used it all over my body!  This product is excellent. Great results. Definitely recommend getting this product.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!! It doesn&#x27;t make me orange it gives the nicest deep dark brown color. Just make sure after putting it on that you wipe it out from between your fingers before you get in the tanning bed!! I have purchased this lotion many times and would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Made me extremely dark with just one use! Feet, legs, arms and hands now blend with the rest of me and arent a lighter shade. Also use on spots that get white and are my hard to tan spots (like round my breasts)</li>
            <li> I love the Snooki Black but this doesnt work for me. I tried it on my arms also and it just seems like it washes off and then its gone. :(</li>
            <li> I have re ordered this product a number of times and I really like it.  Works very good.  Definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> The hair growth inhibitors seem to work a little but this bronzer is not putting color on my legs.  I have had better results from the tingling lotion I use and a few cheaper brands bought at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Smells great and adds an awesome bronze to your legs. WASH YOUR HANDS immediately after using it. I usually put it on before going to the salon for this reason, because it will stain your hands. Also, it claims to have growth inhibitors, although I have not seen a difference in hair growth on my legs and have been using this product for about 2 months now. It&#x27;s worth it for the leg bronzing.</li>
            <li> I like the product. Purchased with tanning lotion and after lotion. The combination of products works well together. I would recommend to others</li>
            <li> Occasionally I like to indoor tan due no free time during day. I have been using the same lotion also made by supre for years. Read all the reviews &amp; decided to try a new lotion. I got the Snookie black bronzer lotion for the rest of my body&amp; this Snookie Ultra Leg bronzer lotion. I really like it because it smells great &amp; I DEF got good color on my legs, (whole body) but  esp legs &amp; was very happy about that because it seems like my legs always take 2x  as long 2 get dark. I don&#x27;t know about the leg hair growth inhibitors but my main concern was getting color&amp;it delivered! I will continue to be using this product &amp; thank you!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about this product.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really make your legs tan, its just a bronzer (that makes them look tan without actually being tan). I was hoping to actually tan my legs, not just have a bronzer that washes off.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smells kind of citrus-ey, which I&#x27;m also not crazy about.&lt;br /&gt;Im not sure why but, I&#x27;ve also noticed that when I use this product, my legs tend to sweat while I&#x27;m tanning (they normally don&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a brighter note, the product was sealed, so props to the seller. :)</li>
            <li> Loved it, but it could use a little more bronzer. Use it every other day in the tanning bed at the gym.</li>
            <li> this product is for the legs.I have never used this before so Im giving it a shot.we will see how it goes</li>
            <li> turned you orange and hair still grew</li>
            <li> It smells soo good. and works great! can see a difference with just one use. :) skin is darker and firmer</li>
            <li> I used this on the hard to tan areas like my legs, arms, and feet! Even put a little on my face while in the level 2 bed, and I&#x27;m more than happy with my results. My only problem is that I didn&#x27;t buy more at the time! Ordering more now :)</li>
            <li> the scent is so good- I used 3-4 times so far-  and love the scent and getting some tan look too- but still it is not very dark as I was expecting - but I love that it has no after smell-  very good</li>
            <li> I love this leg bronzer. I always had a hard time getting my legs to tan and this works great.</li>
            <li> Very dark bronzer, and good tanner. Did not notice significant hair reduction. Slightly greasy formula and rubbed off on clothing/towels.</li>
            <li> Ok as a tanner this one is ok, the smell it pretty good, and does keep skin soft but my main draw for this lotion is after using it daily while tanning for only 5 days I noticed I wasn&#x27;t having to shave half as much! My hair is growing in thinner and only in little patches I was shocked since I mainly bought it for tanning purposes and nothe growth inhibitor</li>
            <li> this product works good to help focus more on tanning up the legs their much harder for me to tan for some reason so this helps target what I need and there aren&#x27;t many tanning products that address specific needs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great I love it!! It&#x27;s so worth it! I  would say it&#x27;s the darkest my legs my ever been :)</li>
            <li> This is the bomb! This lotion smells delicious and makes you sooooo tan! I&#x27;ll never use anything else ever again!</li>
            <li> I am not one that tans easily and this is now the 2nd bottle I have ordered! I&#x27;m white with very fair skin and my legs are super dark from this stuff! After 1 use you can tell you have color! I wanted to be dark for my Vegas trip so I started tanning 10 before I left, I was pale white and when I arrived I was SUPER DARK!!!! My legs are always the hardest to tan, this stuff is the bomb! Love, love, love it! I&#x27;ve tried a million products, most were the expensive top of the line products and this is by far the BEST one out there!!! I have SNOOKI legs lol!!!!! WooHoo!!</li>
            <li> Love the smile! Also the hair growth inhibitors does work too! I have to shave everyday but when use the leg bronzer I can skip a day or two.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! I&#x27;m fair skinned, tanned twice and had amazing color! Looked like I had tanned for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I never really leave reviews for products. But this time I must!&lt;br /&gt;I used the lotion for the first time today and it can already see a difference on the skin tone of my legs. I have tried to tan my legs but nothing ever works.The lotion smells delicious and it left my skin super soft!! One tip, massage your legs until your skin has absorbed the lotion completely, or make sure to get all the lotion you will use at once because it can get slippery.</li>
            <li> love this one too buy it again</li>
            <li> Works well and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot.  I love it because I even put it on when I&#x27;m not tanning.</li>
            <li> I thought it would make me darker than it has but it still works well. I like it. Smells very good!</li>
            <li> Smells great, shipped fast, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> This gives instant results. Not only that but it smells amazing and leaVes your legs feeling amazing!!! I LOVE the snooki&lt;br /&gt;Products!!! What a great treat to add to my tanning session!</li>
            <li> Love my Snooki legs!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great at darkening</li>
            <li> I have tried several other leg bronzer tanning creams.  This is by far the BEST!!!  Great color that lasts and doesn&#x27;t make your legs orange!  Way better than Dark Sexy Legs or Hooker Legs!!!  Snooki Ultra Dark Leg Bronzer is the BEST!</li>
            <li> It worked ok. Just thought I would see a much bigger differance in the tan on my legs.</li>
            <li> Ive used this lotion about 4 times now in 2 weeks and my legs are very dark, I havent really paid attention to slow down in hair growth as I shave every day anyway......I will buy again</li>
            <li> the only thing that got color was my hand towel from wiping my hands after application.</li>
            <li> It was ok, but didn&#x27;t do what I expected</li>
            <li> This is a great product!!!! I use it all over, no streaks and will even cover up scars. I have been tanning for a couple of years and this it the best product I have used.</li>
            <li> I am, and always have been, very pale. I barely tan at all in the sun and I find that a lot of sprays and lotions either make me orange or smell like crap. This lotion is AMAZING. It smells soo good with no trace of that typical tan smell at all. It goes on easy and leaves your skin very soft as well. I actually used JWOWW&#x27;s spray tan with snooki&#x27;s lotion applied after and it created the darkest, most perfect tan I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> Smells AMAZING and makes my legs silky smooth. Gets an even tan on your legs, and no streaks. Still smells great after tanning. Will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works exactly as described. I don&#x27;t use it every day but I haven&#x27;t really noticed the hair growth inhibitors doing much. Overall, I love this product and it really does help tan my legs much faster!</li>
            <li> This is worth the buy!!  I will only purchase this item from here on out!!  I used it everywhere.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t seem to get your legs to tan like you want, this product will Def get the color you want!!!! Awesome product!  Make sure you use a wipe to clean your hands after applying the lotion, the bronzer will stain your hands!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell 100% real and sealed... thats what i was hoping for.... and it smells better then jwoww..</li>
            <li> Excelent product, I love it</li>
            <li> I have been a sworn believer of Snooki&#x27;s tanning lotion since her first bottle. I didn&#x27;t really see the difference in hair growth, but I was also taking biotin vitamins at the time as well. All her lotions smell the same to me so that was a little downfall but it really help with getting my legs darker without having to use a tingler.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because I--like a lot of people I know--have most trouble with my legs tanning. This lotion seems to work well and actually does appear to inhibit hair growth (could be my imagination but I&#x27;d like to think otherwise). Nice smell both before and after tanning. No staining. Highly recommend this item as well as seller. Many many thanks!</li>
            <li> This product makes smoke/steem come from my legs after tanning.. Very odd. No lotion has ever done that before.  Smells great but I thought it would get me darker than it does.</li>
            <li> this is so wonderful and it really works great really darkens your legs very well its awesome product&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Great smell but does not deliver a tan AT ALL...</li>
            <li> SNOOKI SENT ME TO THE E.R.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; (&amp;#34;product&amp;#34; sounds  so &amp;#34;bland&amp;#34;, and far too complimentary. &amp;#34;caustic liquid from hell&amp;#34; is a better description) is the work of some unholy force. I guess that WOULD be why SNOOKI endorses it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the official Amazon record - I am a highly educated woman. I started a company while in grad school that now provides jobs to over 198 people in a struggling Southern town. (and I truly don&#x27;t mean to brag, because this is NOT worthy of bragging, but I lack only ONE IQ point for a lifetime MENSA membership)  I wanted to share those facts because SNOOKI, SNOOKI&#x27;S REALITY TELEVISION PROGRAM...and most of all, SNOOKI&#x27;S ULTRA DARK LEG BRONZER (from hell) are things that truly never cross MY mind.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNTIL I WAS THE MAID OF HONOR IN A WEDDING, ON THE BEACH, AND MY SKIN LOOKED LIKE IT WOULD CAUSE EDWARD CULLEN DIE...FROM JEALOUSY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a rather pale Caucasian woman, in case you did not realize that. I am ALSO thoroughly petrified of premature aging due to excessive sun exposure, MOST LIKELY because I was an anxious only child, and my Mother would allow me to read Vogue at an early age. The May 1989 issue beauty editor declared that age 29 is THE AGE of MASSIVE WRINKLE ONSET (amongst other things). That did quite a bit of damage on my young mind, and I have dreaded the age of 29 for 21 years. I just turned 29 and my collection of skin care potions causes Sephora employees to moan &amp;#34;Oh NO girlfriend, you just need to buy some plain SOAP. Please put down that acid.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did INTENSE self-tanner research online, because my skin simply had to look naturally orange for this blessed nuptial extravaganza. I was surprised to discover that SNOOKI, that lovable bouffant sporting oopma loompa, had sold her name (not to mention her reputation AND possible soul. still trying to figure out if that exists) for use on this product. I bought the product from Amazon, with a great sense of relief. I would look fabulous after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I did not test the product before the event, DUE TO THE BEYOND AMAZING REVIEWS. (never, ever trust a reviewer named &amp;#34;Pauly D Wanna B&amp;#34;).....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I AM a blonde, but that does not forgive such careless actions. I simply thought &amp;#34;well, SNOOKI has weather beaten skin that resembles the hide of cattle, so THAT means this product MUST work. SUCH a great marketing idea!  My alabaster legs will TOTALLY appear long, lean, sexy and bronze.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I ask that any readers mentally replay that famously viral &amp;#34;YAAASSSS Lady Gaga!&amp;#34; clip. You really should look it up. I&#x27;ll wait. Okay!  But, in THIS story, imagine a crowd of WASP wedding guests screaming &amp;#34;NNNNNOOOOOO Lady PalePale!&amp;#34; instead.  END.OF.STORY. right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A.) The product resembles MILDLY tinted water. It is a product that simply DOES NOT WORK AS CLAIMED. You really should not but it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B.) I APPLIED THE WATERY PRODUCT (ps I refuse to type the name again, because I TRULY have PTSD from the experience I am about to share. I am very sensitive. Emotionally.) EXACTLY ONE HOUR BEFORE THE CEREMONY. AND YES, that time table is well documented. By the videographer, in case you are wonderfing. He turned the camera to me, as the bride was stepping into her glorious couture gown from Paris, and asked what in the world (insert another word) I was doing to my legs, ONE HOUR BEFORE THE WEDDING, blowing my shins with a hairdryer set to &amp;#34;LOW&amp;#34;. I explained that I was simply &amp;#34;expediting the prescribed drying time&amp;#34;, to avoid any &amp;#34;transfer of coloring to natural fibers&amp;#34;. That IS what it said  to do, on the crumpled slip of paper included in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quickly (within three minutes) learned that .... WHAT THIS PRODUCT LACKS IN THE COLOR DEPARTMENT,  IT MAKES UP FOR IN THE TOXIC SMELL AND/OR  PUTRID INGREDIENT DEPARTMENT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to the HIGHLY religious ceremony, on the sweeping coastline of Nantucket. SPECIFICALLY fast forward to he moment of silent prayer for the bride&#x27;s recently departed grandmother. At THAT moment, the batty old minister quietly leaned over, covered his lapel microphone, and asked if I was allergic to my overflowing bouquet of gardenia and peony blossoms. I just brushed him off, thinking that he was insane. I am NOT allergic to flowers, grass, wheat, dairy, etc etc etc. Even IF I had an allergy to flowers, they  had NOT touched my LEGS! CLEARLY!  As it turns out, Men of God actually know a thing, or two, about a medical crisis. GO FIGURE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God must have crashed that ceremony, because the minister somehow noticed that my legs AND my palms were covered in massively angry red lumps that were larger than cookies. aka HIVES. (I had NOT noticed the hives, because I was too busy faux-smiling, fluffing skirts, and SOMEHOW blocking the pain of a rapidly developing, life threatening allergic reaction while dreaming of champagne. True love can conquer anything, I guess. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked down at my legs, and then I screamed. During the silent prayer. The minister screamed, because his hearing aid was &amp;#34;very sensitive to shrill noises&amp;#34;. The mother of the bride screamed from her seat. Followed by the Best Man (WHO WAS NOT A DOCTOR, BUT VERY HOT AND VERY SINGLE) who screamed if a doctor would come forward (THE DOCTOR WHO CAME FORWARD WAS NOT VERY HOT BUT VERY SINGLE). The wedding STOPPED. The vows? ON HOLD. I started to CRY. Hysterically. I was writhing under the multi-faith chuppah,  apologizing profusely for crying from fear/shock/swelling of my airway....because the bride had previously screamed that &amp;#34;ONLY SHE WAS ALLOWED TO CRY, AND HER TEARS WOULD BE HAPPY TEARS, NOT SAD TEARS, SO THOSE TEARS REALLY WOULD NOT COUNT FOR REAL CRYING AT ALL, AND EVERYONE ELSE CAN NOT CRY. AT ALL. EVER. BECAUSE OF THE PHOTO OPS WOULD BE DOOOOOMED&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paramedics (oh yes, all twelve came. with three ambulances. just like clowns, but with meds) soon carted me off on a stretcher hand-crafted from driftwood and exposed rusty nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard that the reception was a blast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bride now refuses to return my calls, and she returned my gift of a sterling teapot to Tiffany. Life is not great at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the pleasure of being stabbed with an epi-pen, while transported to the small island hospital, where I was again stabbed by the half - blind nursing student, as she tried to insert an IV.  However that Saturday was her FIRST DAY as a &amp;#34;REAL NURSE&amp;#34; since graduating in 2010, so I really can&#x27;t fault the poor girl.  (Martha V. from Nantucket, if you are reading, good luck in your new career!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The (sadly, once again, VERY HOT and VERY NOT SINGLE) doctor put the puzzle pieces of blood tests together, and declared that the aforementioned &amp;#34;PRODUCT&amp;#34; was CLEARLY the reason for my massive allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine the shame -- PURE SHAME, PEOPLE! -- of reading &amp;#34;SNOOKI SENT THIS WOMAN TO THE ER&amp;#34; on the hospital discharge papers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While heavily sedated, I had a dream about sending a postcard from Nantucket to MTV, with the following caption&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;wish you REALLY WERE here, snooki&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love snooki products...always a nice dark tan guidette style :)</li>
            <li> perfect tanning lotion, even though it says just for legs i use it on legs and arms, makes you super dark! smells great! and doesnt make you feel greasy after tanning!!</li>
            <li> Love . The smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping AND great product! Would definitely order this lotion again...Thank you!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great! Smell aside, it works. My legs are as dark as the rest of my body. That never happens. I have very fair skin and it takes me a while to get a good tan so I&#x27;m very picky with the products I use. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> works awesome, will stain clothes and hands so be sure you wash your hands, it does come out of your clothes in the wash though with no problem. Has a very nice smell, works great! A+! super fast shipping !</li>
            <li> Works great! No bad smell &amp; no streaking</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the smell. I wish her other tanning lotions had the same scent. I haven&#x27;t seen any change in leg hair, but I like how it instantly gives color to my legs.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I will have to order more this week, just to have extra and so I don&#x27;t run out anytime soon, I want to be able to use it all summer long at  least!!!&lt;br /&gt;it works, great, I can tell some difference in the hair growth on my legs already, my hair is thinner and doesn&#x27;t grow in as fast...&lt;br /&gt;it smells great, and is very mostourizering as well!&lt;br /&gt;It also does tan your legs a very pretty shade, not an orange shade, it doesn&#x27;t look like you have used a self tanner or anything, but it just leaves your legs a nice bronze.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to every lady!!! it is a must have for me, I don&#x27;t want to be without it!!!!</li>
            <li> On my third purchase. Every spring I buy this and love using it every two or three days after my shower. Just pre lotion your knees and ankles with non tanning lotion before you use if you have super dry skin and don&#x27;t want these areas to be darker. And it does inhibit my leg hair regrowth by at least a day. Try it. You won&#x27;t regret!  Nice scent too!</li>
            <li> BEST BRONZER I HAVE EVER USED! I wish I could use it on my face!  IT HAS HAIR GROWTH INHIBITORS IN IT! :D:D:D:D  LOL, I work at a tanning salon, and I&#x27;ve gotten the packets of it at work, but we don&#x27;t carry the bottles!  I am obsessed with this stuff, and I&#x27;ve been using it on my legs AND arms!  I&#x27;m incredibly  excited for this product to get here because the .57 oz packets are like 7 bucks!! I got the whole bottle on here for $11 plus shipping! :D  I&#x27;ve also seen them on here for 17-20 bucks too.. SUPRE MAKES WONDERFUL PRODUCTS... The snooki Black Hot Bronzer, and the 70x Bronzer are both amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SERIOUSLY, get it.  I am a certified tanning consultant, and I&#x27;m required to go to classes that train us on using all the newest lotions, and everything pertaining to tanning.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive about ordering a tanning lotion online, but I received the tube and it was wrapped in plastic AND sealed (I had to rip foil off the opening). I am very pleased with the speed of my package, as well. Definitely recommend this seller to anyone :) I have not gotten to use it yet (waiting on my tanning eye protectors to be delivered), but I am excited to use it. It smells great and looks like it will work wonders!</li>
            <li> I really did notice less hair growth while using this product and it gave excellent color for this extremely pale girl.  I don&#x27;t usually go with bronzers for fear of orange streakiness but that was not an issue with this lotion.  Thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!! Gets my legs soooo dark but make sure to wipe or wash your hands once you&#x27;ve applied it to your legs or it will stain your hands leaving them with an orange tint (not good).</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion. It smells amazing and makes my legs so tan and has a bronze glow. I would recommend this to any skin type. I have really fair skin and I love it.</li>
            <li> Horrible itching and bumpy feeling legs after shaving. Stopped using it and legs feel fine. Also never noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I LOVE SNOOKI.  IT WORKS GREAT AND MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SILKY AND SMOOTH.  I PLAN TO USE IT ON MY HUSBANDS LEGS!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. excellent product. would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Snook Ultra Dark Leg Bronzer with Hair Growth Inhibitors really works !!!  As an Add On product, this is an exceptional tanning lotion. It smells wonderful and truly slows down the growth of your leg hair.</li>
            <li> I did not find it help my legs at all to tan</li>
            <li> Second time using it and I can already see a difference! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I use this all over my body and I&#x27;m so dark from it even though I&#x27;m Irish and I&#x27;m hard to tan. No reddish tan for me from this bronzer. Extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s excellent. The smell is nice and light and the bronzer does great at getting your legs nice and dark. I could tell a difference after one use! I will buy again once I use all of this! I can&#x27;t wait to tan when I use this lotion!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any change with the hair growth inhibitors but my color is amazing!! I went from having no tan on my lower legs to noticeable color in just 3 uses!!</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing! you really do get dark quick with it.  highly recommend it.  gonna stick to this one for awhile unless i find something better which i doubt will happen :)</li>
            <li> Works so well I use it on my entire body! Gives me better color than any other lotion ever has.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount of this lotion to give you the dark look you are looking for. Your legs will be as tanned as the rest of your body. Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I love this leg tanning lotion. I could tell a difference within a few days with this product, I&#x27;ve used Australian Gold leg tanning lotion and never got the same results... My legs are much darker now!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair and it usually takes me awhile to get a tan. This got me to the color that I like and darker! Will definitely get this again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Clinique - much more expensive same quality. Good productBuy it. I think this is one of the best</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! I use it in my legs &amp; arms. It also has a great smell. The lotion arrived fast &amp; it had the seal on the container.</li>
            <li> WOW I WISH THEY MADE THIS AS A ALL OVER TANNER,USED 1 TIME AND VERY NOTICEABLE, PRETTY TAN ALREADY , GOING FOR THE SELLER NOW, PACKED SUPER DUPER, I  MEAN TOOK ME A FEW MINUTES TO UNWRAP,WHICH IS GOOD, PLUS THE TAB THATS ON THE STUFF TO COME OUT WAS INTACT, I WILL BE BACK, FAST SHIPPING, GOT HERE FAST, GET YOU SOME, ITS REALLY GOOD, THANK YOU</li>
            <li> I love this product. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell about the whole hair thing. but i&#x27;m excited to see</li>
            <li> Will streak. And fades quick. But over all it is a good bronzer!! You get no real tan underneath :/</li>
            <li> I am extremely pale and have been trying to get the best tanning lotion to get me bronzed and colored and this is by far the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve tried!  I have a hard time getting tan and after the first use I noticed a dramatic difference.  Defiantly would recommend this to other pale people out there who are looking to get a nice color!</li>
            <li> love this i dont do the tanning bed thing often but was tanning for my wedding always have a really really hard time getting my legs to tan but this did the trick havent been to the tanning bed sense the week of my wedding sep 6th  now is almost nov and still have some color  HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to over analyze this, it is just tanning lotion after all, but it smells absolutely INCREDIBLE, and works well. Noticeably tanner right after using it, but not too extreme. But that smell, though. It smells like heaven if heaven were made out of kiwi. Definitely get this.</li>
            <li> Best tanning bronzer I have used, it is honestly my favorite &amp; it smells bomb! Highly recommended! I will be buying this again when mine runs out</li>
            <li> Scent is beautiful and silky</li>
            <li> hands down snooki has the best smelling leg lotion most stink! and the hair inhibitors in here are amazing as well!</li>
            <li> any product made or endorsed by snooki is great, never had a problem and love all of her products. nicely priced as well</li>
            <li> Snooki Ultra Dark Leg Bronzer is a pretty good lotion. I was having a hard time getting my legs and arms tanner, and this really gave me the boost. It smells wonderful. It did not turn me orange, it gave me a nice dark color. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is a must have. I&#x27;ve come to believe in Snooki&#x27;s products. This really does decrease hair growth and is getting my legs super dark after just two weeks.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t get your legs tan use this lotion! Goes on smoothly and after you shower your legs feel so soft! Great lotion def a good buy and should have in your tanning rotationb</li>
            <li> I love this product and will be buying more. I would recomind reccomend this to anyone! It is GREAT!!!! It works great as well my legs got dark.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been tanning in years and just decided I needed to go. My legs have always been the hardest to darken. Received this super fast with prime and tried it out about 6 hours ago. I have super fair skin naturally and thus gave me the richest color. Ugh in love and smells so good! Also came sealed so I know it was true snooki product. I didn&#x27;t only get amazing color on my legs but I used it all over to get a good base tan. I love it!</li>
            <li> doesnt work at all!! i was really excited to use this and i was not impressed at all not buying again</li>
            <li> This bronzer makes my legs at least 2 shades darker than any other bronzer I have used.  I love it! And it smells amazing.  Wont buy anything else.</li>
            <li> My legs are normally white all year but the rest of me will tan..... It&#x27;s product has helped keep my skin a summers glow on my legs plus the hair on my legs take a longer time to grow and much thinner.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging for delivery was great and delivery time only two days thanks to amazons unlimited two day shipping. Would recommend to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again&lt;br /&gt;Marie</li>
            <li> I love this lotion because it gave me darker tan and great color. Another I dislike it because this lotion is not last longer and will be gone after shower/bath every time. I will never buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well &amp; smells amazing!! I will be buying this again!! Regular tanning lotion doesn&#x27;t seem to do the trick for my legs but this is awesome!!</li>
            <li> Great product !!!! I used it in a level 5 bed ... Had me very tan and glowingly... As far as this product stopping hair growth idk about that .. But it&#x27;s a great indoor tanner</li>
            <li> Was not that impressed with this product. I will not purchase this product agin. I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this product.... Thank you Snookie, Nichole...&lt;br /&gt;I love her tanning products. They smell great, feel smooth, rich and creamy, and always soak in nicely. Legs often need a little extra bronzer to tan them and this product  helps give them a natural golden rich color...plus it  inhibits hair growth so you can go longer between shaving or waxing, helping your tan stay dark longer. Isn&#x27;t that what we want...? More beauty, less work. I love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got the worst rash the. Hives.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff !!! Works like it says ! Will buy more :)</li>
            <li> No different from any other leg bronzer .</li>
            <li> Love this tanning lotion! I am pretty fair and have been tanning for a month before trying this. My legs are noticeably darker after three uses. The fragrance is amazing as well!</li>
            <li> Works great! And loved that it came to me super super fast!!!!</li>
            <li> This bronzer is great and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is DARK without being orange and awful tan looking</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh!! I never write a review until I have been using a product for a while but this product just blew me away. Today I went tanning and I have unlimited mega bed access and I used this on my legs arms and tummy and after my session I got 2-3 shades darker! No joke! That has never happened before With any tanning lotion and I have tried many tanning lotions. I did get super warm and sweated more than usual but definitely worth it! You definitely get a huge bang for you buck with this product!!</li>
            <li> One word....AMAZING!!!! This lotion will have you shades darker after one session without the orange color.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Ive already noticed a difference in my legs and LOVE the results. Will definitely buy again. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in the hair growth, but then again ive only been using this stuff for about a week now.</li>
            <li> This works great as a bronzer.. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been using it quite long enough to notice any &amp;#34;hair growth inhibitors&amp;#34;. The reason I gave it 3 stars because of the way it smells. Going on, it smells great. It does have a strong tanning lotion smell after tanning, though. I&#x27;d recommend using this if you&#x27;re just going home after, and don&#x27;t let it get on clothes that you plan to wear anywhere else after tanning.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I used it for the first time today on my legs and feet and got great results. It smells awesome, no bad after tan scent. Will definitely be buying it again once I run out!</li>
            <li> Snooki bronzer is the best I have ever found. I am a strawberry blonde so most bronzers tend to turn orange on my skin type. Not snooki it goes on evenly and looks natural. Love it!</li>
            <li> My legs do not tan easily but this lotion works great!! It does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Bad purchase from seller, lotion was expired and waste of money.  I guess this is why one should not buy tanning lotions online!</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF DID NOTHING FOR MY LEGS! I ordered it thinking it was going to be great... look at snooki, well it wasnt dont wast your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people whose legs just stay whiter than the rest of me, no matter what I do.  I&#x27;m also a Floridian in a career that requires me to wear suits and dress shoes, so the legs just can&#x27;t be hidden.  I had been using DC Legs (both with a different tanner for the rest of me, either Lively or Coco) and picked up this one for its hair growth inhibitor properties.  I&#x27;ve got to say that on all the criteria that I use to evaluate a leg specific bronzer, this one checks all the boxes!  Smells good, goes on smooth and silky, doesn&#x27;t streak, and doesn&#x27;t make me freckle.  It also seems to make the time between waxings just a tiny little bit longer, like maybe a week.</li>
            <li> Tried it once and it was okay. Not really good for pale skin.</li>
            <li> Not really seeing a big difference.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that it makes my legs any darker - still trying!</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion does all that it says it will do, I have a really hard time getting my legs to tan and this worked!</li>
            <li> My only wish is that it was a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love Snooki? I love this lotion!</li>
            <li> Love this product used for a few years</li>
            <li> It was okay. It made my legs a little bit darker the first couple uses. not very noticeable though.</li>
            <li> Love this! Definitely noticed a difference after using!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times so it&#x27;s hard to say if it&#x27;s helped slow down hair growth, but it got my legs super dark and the smell is AMAZING.  It reminds me of Jolly Ranchers.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice bronzer for my legs and this one seems to be doing great. The smell is okay :/ but it usually wears off which I am really glad of.</li>
