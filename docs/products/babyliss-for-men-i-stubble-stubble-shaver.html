            <li>This i-Stubble shaver is great for maintaining stubble or a light beard.  </li>
            <li>, it is quite amazing.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic makes nice trimmers ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Easily my favorite feature.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t want to be stuck without one and hunting for so many years like I did before this one.</li>
            <li>I love this stubble...</li>
            <li>good for your whole body.....</li>
            <li>It cleans easily and holds its charge well.  </li>
            <li>Never before have I used a trimmer that so easily allowed for shaving around my chin and jawline.</li>
            <li>The iStubble moves around my face so easily</li>
            <li>It makes keeping a beard well trimmed easy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s holding up fine</li>
            <li>Easy to clean</li>
            <li>Great for short trim beards</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and use.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t expect to get a clean shave by using this product alone.</li>
            <li>In the end, I&#x27;m still looking for the one product that &amp;#34;does it all&amp;#34;... clean shave AND beard/mustache trim.</li>
            <li>For a short beard it is good.  </li>
            <li>seller, Beauty Findz, issued me a full refund for the shipping cost to return my defective razor.  </li>
            <li>it runs pretty strong.  </li>
            <li>The digital settings are precise and foolproof till you make a change, And it is easy to clean after use.  </li>
            <li>The head feels cheap, brittle and is very unconfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Solid construction: Does not feel like cheap plastic like so many others.  </li>
            <li>The point of this review is to tell you that, for me, the iStubble has been worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bought a second one just to have handy in case</li>
            <li>The feel and function of this unit is superior to any other trimmer I have used.</li>
            <li>With others, I would have to pull at my skin to get the hair to the right position to trim.</li>
            <li>However when I plugged in the unit right out of the box it would not charge.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every stubble trimmer out there, and this is the most comfortable due to the plastic comb that glides along the face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s plastic and the top seems fragile, it will break if you drop it.</li>
            <li>Runs and feels like a higher quality piece of electronics than the price.  </li>
            <li>The Conair or Remington appear to be higher quality.</li>
            <li>Most importantly I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve just rubbed sandpaper all over my face after a trim like I did with Norelco or Remingtons and their crappy plastic combs that feel like little knives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having used a number of similar trimmer/removers over the years, I&#x27;d say this one provides the most consistent length after the trim is complete.</li>
            <li>This shaver has stopped working after several months of light use.</li>
            <li>but if you want to use one of the settings on the guard, you can&#x27;t really get up under your nose.  </li>
            <li>The clipper is also wide so gets more done in each pass.</li>
            <li>trimmer I purchased had a vacuum, which was nice to keep the bathroom clean, but it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Cuts really evenly, sharp blades, easy to use, doesn&#x27;t pull my hairs.</li>
            <li>: The guard folds back easily, and even the blade comes off without trouble for easy cleaning and replacement.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is the first stubble trimmer I&#x27;ve found in years that really does a fantastic job without leaving my face feeling raw.</li>
            <li>This really works and offers unrivalled precision.  </li>
            <li>Was an old Norelco devotee until they started putting in more plastic and less quality.</li>
            <li>I want the exact same length of stubble each time, it does this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a winner so far after a a month or so!</li>
            <li>This trimmer, despite the fact that you have never heard of this name before, is solid, doesn&#x27;t scratch your face when clipping short and has a really cool motorized length control.</li>
            <li>None so far.</li>
            <li>My 22 year old son likes it a lot too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s somewhat difficult to get unpackaged, but when you do (and have done the 16 hour charge), life is good.</li>
            <li>You have to flip the guard back and use your steady hand.  </li>
            <li>Adequate but would go with one of the other brands next time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 3rd one of these now as they break frequently...</li>

            <li> This i-Stubble shaver is great for maintaining stubble or a light beard.  The variety of settings makes it easy to find an ideal length at which to trim.  It cleans easily and holds its charge well.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is easily the best stubble/beard trimmer I have ever used. I was impressed from the moment I took it out of the box and loved it from the first time I used it.  Pros:  Solid construction: Does not feel like cheap plastic like so many others.  Motorized length setting: This really works and offers unrivalled precision.  \\&quot;Floating head\\&quot; design: Easily my favorite feature. Never before have I used a trimmer that so easily allowed for shaving around my chin and jawline. With others, I would have to pull at my skin to get the hair to the right position to trim. The iStubble moves around my face so easily, it is quite amazing.  Even cut: This trimmer has done the best job of the 3-4 I have tried in getting an even trim in the shortest time.  Easy to clean: The guard folds back easily, and even the blade comes off without trouble for easy cleaning and replacement.  Cons:  None so far. Yes it is expensive, but that&#x27;s something you know before you buy. The point of this review is to tell you that, for me, the iStubble has been worth the price.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to choose this. I want the exact same length of stubble each time, it does this but... it does not trim directly under your nose, there a space between the blades and the end, it cant reach the edge, it&#x27;s very annoying. It&#x27;s plastic and the top seems fragile, it will break if you drop it. I feel like I charge it quite a lot probably once a week. It has a digital read out of the length of stubble. Great, but it forgets it immediately when you turn it off so so have to re-select it. I will try something else next time.</li>
            <li> Bought it several months ago. So far so good.</li>
            <li> This shaver has stopped working after several months of light use. When it did work the product was mediocre. The construction is of very poor quality.</li>
            <li> Great for short trim beards</li>
            <li> Runs and feels like a higher quality piece of electronics than the price.  For a short beard it is good.  But I would agree with the comments that say it is hard to get up under your nose.  The plastic guard flips back and you can use the trimmers close to the skin and you can get up under your nose that way... but if you want to use one of the settings on the guard, you can&#x27;t really get up under your nose.  You have to flip the guard back and use your steady hand.  Other than that it runs pretty strong.  Best I have found with electronic stubble trimmers.</li>
            <li> Using this takes the guesswork out of shaving my face when I want to leave some stubble behind.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and it&#x27;s holding up fine (i.e. no problems holding a charge).  My 22 year old son likes it a lot too.  It&#x27;s somewhat difficult to get unpackaged, but when you do (and have done the 16 hour charge), life is good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd one of these now as they break frequently... yet I keep coming back. Why? I&#x27;ve tried every stubble trimmer out there, and this is the most comfortable due to the plastic comb that glides along the face. The clipper is also wide so gets more done in each pass. But this LCD version is over-engineered, with an electronic motor that can and has failed. I therefore recommend the cheaper version without the LCD control; it has a manual control but the head mechanism is identical.</li>
            <li> I have a neatly trimmed goatee that I&#x27;ve worn for years. Was an old Norelco devotee until they started putting in more plastic and less quality. This is the first stubble trimmer I&#x27;ve found in years that really does a fantastic job without leaving my face feeling raw. Cuts really evenly, sharp blades, easy to use, doesn&#x27;t pull my hairs. Most importantly I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve just rubbed sandpaper all over my face after a trim like I did with Norelco or Remingtons and their crappy plastic combs that feel like little knives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought a second one just to have handy in case they stop making them.... don&#x27;t want to be stuck without one and hunting for so many years like I did before this one. I&#x27;ve probably gone through five different models in four years and always been disappointed. This one is the best out there!</li>
            <li> I love this stubble...good for your whole body.....</li>
            <li> I would love to have given this shaver 5 stars except for one very annoying fact. The shaver goes back to the minimum setting every time you turn it off and when you adjust the height it turns it&#x27;s self off. You have to adjust it every time you shave and you have to turn it on twice every time you shave.</li>
            <li> It IS a &amp;#34;stubble remover&amp;#34; (as advertised) so you can&#x27;t expect to get a clean shave by using this product alone. Having used a number of similar trimmer/removers over the years, I&#x27;d say this one provides the most consistent length after the trim is complete. In the end, I&#x27;m still looking for the one product that &amp;#34;does it all&amp;#34;... clean shave AND beard/mustache trim.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. It makes keeping a beard well trimmed easy.</li>
            <li> Works great, have had for a couple of years now and still going strong.  Easy to clean and use.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver from Beauty Findz and it arrived on time as expected.  However when I plugged in the unit right out of the box it would not charge.  The LCD screen constantly flickered.  Even after leaving the power connected for 16 hours, as instructed, it would not power on.  I returned the defective unit and Beauty Findz promptly gave me a refund.  But to my surprise, I had to pay the cost of shipping.  Buyer Beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;The seller, Beauty Findz, issued me a full refund for the shipping cost to return my defective razor.  I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> The BaByliss for Men i-Stubble Shaver is the best made trimmer I have owned.  The digital settings are precise and foolproof till you make a change, And it is easy to clean after use.  The length settings range from 0.4mm to 5.0mm.  I only wish the longest setting was longer than 5.0mm and will research to see if the company makes a trimmer for use with a longer beard.  But if you want a short, neat beard, this is the one to buy.  I would call it the Rolls Royce of trimmers when compared to all others I have owned.</li>
            <li> The feel and function of this unit is superior to any other trimmer I have used. I have been closely trimming my beard for years now, and have gone through probably a dozen different trimmers. Panasonic makes nice trimmers ([[ASIN:B000F4USF8 Panasonic ER224S All-in-One Cordless Hair and Beard Trimmer (Silver)]])and I have been somewhat faithful to them. A recent Norelco [[ASIN:B003U8ESI4 Philips Norelco Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Mustache Trimmer Pro QT4070 /41]] trimmer I purchased had a vacuum, which was nice to keep the bathroom clean, but it didn&#x27;t last long. This trimmer, despite the fact that you have never heard of this name before, is solid, doesn&#x27;t scratch your face when clipping short and has a really cool motorized length control. It&#x27;s a winner so far after a a month or so!</li>
            <li> This shaver stopped working after 4 months of 1x weekly use.  Followed directions for properly charging battery and kept the blades cleaned and oiled.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this razor. The head feels cheap, brittle and is very unconfortable to use. At times it actually hurts as there is a very sharp edge of plastic across the centre that can scrape if you change the angle you are shaving too severely.</li>
            <li> This product is actually the Conair iStubble, BaByliss is even using Conair&#x27;s pictures. They simply overcharge twice what it costs, edit their pictures, and send you the Conair. Don&#x27;t be fooled, and don&#x27;t pay twice the price.</li>
            <li> Adequate but would go with one of the other brands next time.  The Conair or Remington appear to be higher quality.</li>
