            <li>Even though I&#x27;am not a fan of D&amp;G colognes , this one is very good (cytrus wood).</li>
            <li>What a great smelling cologne.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a great buy</li>
            <li>this is  a great cologne, I gave it to a friend and he loves it.</li>
            <li>This is a good dressy cologne.</li>
            <li>Some colognes hit you (or people you&#x27;re around) as being very strong scented with earthy or musty character.  </li>
            <li>I am an elderly man and have tried many colognes over the years.  </li>
            <li>Love this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad I found it again.</li>
            <li>I just love this eau de toilette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Dunno, maybe it would be hot for females to wear it :)</li>
            <li>After trying a whole bunch of fragrances throughout the years this one stuck out the most.  </li>
            <li>Love this  sooooo much</li>
            <li>I bought to Brasil to a friend and we compare to the real one !!</li>
            <li>For some unknown reason D &amp; G discontinued this wonderful cologne, my husband used to wear it and it would last for hours on him.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about those.</li>
            <li>However, I always return to this one because it has a mild pleasant quality, a bit fruity perhaps, but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Very unique&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>What really appeals to me is it&#x27;s lightness in tone - not an overpowering fragrance.  </li>
            <li>as ive learnt from my teenage years) really works wonders and will gain far more compliments (and less headaches to you and others).  </li>
            <li>It was the first time I ordered on Amazon and guess it will be the last one too.</li>
            <li>This is an old fragrance that I have missed.</li>
            <li>ilt is a masculine scent but still somewhat flowery,not at all femanine.</li>
            <li>he got this bottle, first of all, it was extremely expensive, a lot more than what I used to pay, the scent</li>
            <li>I have used this particular cologne for over 10 years now and have never looked back.  </li>
            <li>It was rancid,the scent wore out quickly and had a very dark yellow color.</li>

            <li> Not many know about this fragrance but believe me you will always get a compliment. As I wear it this fragrance brings out the confidence hidden inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells like:&lt;br /&gt;1. NOT CITRUS&lt;br /&gt;2. Definitely  made for male scent (Dunno, maybe it would be hot for females to wear it :)&lt;br /&gt;3. Very unique&lt;br /&gt;4. Not a cheap cologne&lt;br /&gt;5. Confidence</li>
            <li> For some unknown reason D &amp; G discontinued this wonderful cologne, my husband used to wear it and it would last for hours on him.&lt;br /&gt;When he got this bottle, first of all, it was extremely expensive, a lot more than what I used to pay, the scent it&#x27;s not the same and it last for a few minutes, that&#x27;s all....If you thinking on getting this bottle, don&#x27;t expect what MASCULINE used to be in the past, IT&#x27;S NOT....DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> I am an elderly man and have tried many colognes over the years.  In fact I still have several choices to use now.  However, I always return to this one because it has a mild pleasant quality, a bit fruity perhaps, but not overwhelming.  Some colognes hit you (or people you&#x27;re around) as being very strong scented with earthy or musty character.  I&#x27;m not crazy about those.</li>
            <li> After trying a whole bunch of fragrances throughout the years this one stuck out the most.  I have used this particular cologne for over 10 years now and have never looked back.  What really appeals to me is it&#x27;s lightness in tone - not an overpowering fragrance.  A subtle hint (as ive learnt from my teenage years) really works wonders and will gain far more compliments (and less headaches to you and others).  It seems like D&amp;G have discontinued this item so i would recommend purchasing the bigger bottle and using sparingly.</li>
            <li> This is an old fragrance that I have missed. the size was excellent and the product was in mint condition to use.</li>
            <li> This is a good dressy cologne. I have used it for a long time. ilt is a masculine scent but still somewhat flowery,not at all femanine. It is somewhat expensive for everyday use.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for years. It has become increasingly difficult to find. It&#x27;s a delightful fragrance for men. It&#x27;s not too heavy. Love this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend the shower gel. Our last purchase was watered down.</li>
            <li> This was a fake product!! So Upset with this people!! I bought to Brasil to a friend and we compare to the real one !!</li>
            <li> What a great smelling cologne.  They don&#x27;t sell it in the name brand stores these days, only online.  Glad I found it again.</li>
            <li> One of the best !!! Awesome Cologne. Not sure why it&#x27;s not easily available in stores. But it&#x27;s a great buy</li>
            <li> this is  a great cologne, I gave it to a friend and he loves it. No complaints about it being a knock off or bootleg so I would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t meet my expectations at all. It was rancid,the scent wore out quickly and had a very dark yellow color. I returned it and never got a refund. It was the first time I ordered on Amazon and guess it will be the last one too.</li>
            <li> Love this  sooooo much</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE SCENT BUT WOULD LIKE TO FIND IT LESS EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> I just love this eau de toilette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only one I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps: take the bigger one it will last very long.</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;am not a fan of D&amp;G colognes , this one is very good (cytrus wood). One of the best colognes for Men.</li>
            <li> The best ever made. I&#x27;m using this over 10 years and always received compliments from both women and men. Unfortunately they don&#x27;t make it anymore. I still haven&#x27;t found a replacement I could go with.</li>
            <li> I should have priced around - they are heavily overpriced.</li>
