    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have found that if you use a buf-puf sponge it works wonderful.</li>
            <li>Bert;s Bees products are all the very best  </li>
            <li>We have tried every soap on the shelf (dove, eucerin, etc) and this seems to work best.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is wonderful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Smells great also.</li>
            <li>Great body wash.  </li>

            <li>I love all Burt&#x27;s Bees products!</li>
            <li>I love this body wash!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a take it or leave it kind of smell.</li>
            <li>Okay, I wanted to love this but will not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>The smell is definitely more dairy-like than honey.  </li>
            <li>The Milk and Shea Butter Bodywash is OK.</li>
            <li>This is not a sudsy product like most soaps.</li>
            <li>Soaps up nicely, soft and great smell&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a capful for baths or a size of a nickel on a pouf and it lathers up just fine.</li>
            <li>Update: I had written another update to this original review but somehow it did not save.  </li>
            <li>to use a lot of the product to feel clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;No breakouts from perfumes added and great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is great for children with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It does not make a massive amount of bubbles in a tub but a fair amount( as it is not marketed as a bubble bath product).</li>
            <li>I like the mild scent as I like to wear different perfumes, but that&#x27;s not why I loved this stuff.</li>
            <li>We have been using it for 9 months since our son first had signs of dry skin/eczema, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;***I think this would be good for people with eczema or really dry</li>
            <li>smell is conflicting, smells nice for a second and then smells mediciny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will keep looking for a more natural body wash.</li>
            <li>I like the Body Wash very much</li>
            <li>It works fantastically and my legs feel SO soft and lightly moisturized.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that cleans me thoroughly without drying out my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have not used anything else since I first tried this.  </li>
            <li>At least it suds up nicely and make me feel like I&#x27;m getting clean.  </li>
            <li>I thought being shea butter it would be more moisturizing, but my skin is so dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li>I used the rest of this bottle and discovered that it will sud up nicely but in order to get it to, I had to use about 3x the amount of what I normally use with pretty much any other liquid soap I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Whenever this bottle is gone I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;ll be buying another bottle.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have much itching.</li>
            <li>but I think I much prefer the castille soap.  </li>
            <li>My skin gets painfully dry in the winter, especially on my legs, and this wash prevents most of the dryness, even when I don&#x27;t use lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;+Burt&#x27;s bee&#x27;s and natural</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve already noticed a marked difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I far prefer the Peppermint scented Bodywash from Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin silky soft.</li>
            <li>It smells odd, like old condensed milk or something; it doesn&#x27;t suds up very well; and it leaves a film on your skin.  </li>

            <li> I received this as a gift in the Milk and Shea butter scent.. I like the mild scent as I like to wear different perfumes, but that&#x27;s not why I loved this stuff. Not only do I use it as a body wash but I use it to shave as well. It works fantastically and my legs feel SO soft and lightly moisturized. Whenever this bottle is gone I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;ll be buying another bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that cleans me thoroughly without drying out my skin.  It has substantially reduced the occurrences of acne that I have suffered since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> This product was not sealed..looks like it&#x27;s been used</li>
            <li> Soaps up nicely, soft and great smell&lt;br /&gt;No breakouts from perfumes added and great for dry skin. Will buy again</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have not used anything else since I first tried this.  I have found that if you use a buf-puf sponge it works wonderful. Smells great also.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with a previous review. I end up using about three times as much as other body washes because it hardly suds. It&#x27;s almost like washing with lotion. I will keep looking for a more natural body wash.</li>
            <li> This does suds like other soaps! I am not sure why other reviews said it doesn&#x27;t ! I use a capful for baths or a size of a nickel on a pouf and it lathers up just fine. It does not make a massive amount of bubbles in a tub but a fair amount( as it is not marketed as a bubble bath product). The smell is that of Shea butter. It&#x27;s a take it or leave it kind of smell. If you like the scent of Shea then you will like this product.</li>
            <li> Burts Bees does it again!  For the price this soap has quality ingredients and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  Not much out there as good as this product to use in my shower.</li>
            <li> Bert;s Bees products are all the very best  I like the Body Wash very much</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product was old or what, but it smelled very bad. I even tried to add some lavender oil to it, but it made no difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  I thought being shea butter it would be more moisturizing, but my skin is so dry and itchy.  Not a fan.</li>
            <li> I just love the way it works and smell, but very disappointed on its discontinuations. Why Bird&#x27;s Bees ? why? Please bring it back.</li>
            <li> best burt bees product great for my 3 kids sensitive skin.  packing was not amazon quality.</li>
            <li> I have hard water and dry skin because of it. I&#x27;ve only used this body wash once but I&#x27;ve already noticed a marked difference in my skin. It&#x27;s visibly less dry and I don&#x27;t have much itching.</li>
            <li> Not sure what all the rave reviews are about but I do not like this product at all.  It smells odd, like old condensed milk or something; it doesn&#x27;t suds up very well; and it leaves a film on your skin.  I tried it because of the rave reviews and as an alternative to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castille soap (which can be somewhat drying at times) but I think I much prefer the castille soap.  At least it suds up nicely and make me feel like I&#x27;m getting clean.  The Burt&#x27;s Bees does not meet my expectations at all, especially considering the cost.  Do not recommend.    Update: I had written another update to this original review but somehow it did not save.  I used the rest of this bottle and discovered that it will sud up nicely but in order to get it to, I had to use about 3x the amount of what I normally use with pretty much any other liquid soap I&#x27;ve used.  For me, the cost to value ratio is just not good enough.  The smell is definitely more dairy-like than honey.  Still don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> The Milk and Shea Butter Bodywash is OK. I far prefer the Peppermint scented Bodywash from Burt&#x27;s Bees. The milk and shea wash does not foam up. It also has almost no scent. This product is not the type of soap I need.</li>
            <li> Great body wash.  Hard to find.</li>
            <li> This is the only body wash that I use past December. My skin gets painfully dry in the winter, especially on my legs, and this wash prevents most of the dryness, even when I don&#x27;t use lotion.</li>
            <li> I love all Burt&#x27;s Bees products!</li>
            <li> This is great for children with dry skin.  We have been using it for 9 months since our son first had signs of dry skin/eczema, and it works great.  We have tried every soap on the shelf (dove, eucerin, etc) and this seems to work best.  This is not a sudsy product like most soaps.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash! It makes my skin silky soft. I do not know why they are discontinuing it. :-(</li>
            <li> It conditions and cleans my body. The fragrance is wonderful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m disappointed that I couldn&#x27;t order more Shea Butter Body Wash.  I hope you will bring it back.</li>
