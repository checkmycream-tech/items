            <li>This wheel is the perfect colors for bruises and nasty-looking sores!</li>
            <li>it is perfect for all sorts of makeup!</li>
            <li>I use one of those beauty blenders with it, it worked the best.</li>
            <li>Worked perfect for daughter&#x27;s needs.</li>
            <li>Because these colors are cream based, they do smear a bit, and the staying power isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li>The best bruise wheel we have used!</li>

            <li>Love Mehron products!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with how much product there is here, but it wipes off/smudges/disappears too easily.</li>
            <li>Works great and the bruises look VERY realistic.  </li>
            <li>Really convincing,  </li>
            <li>I truly do love this product I&#x27;ve have done many makeups and still have a lot more makeup to with this product</li>
            <li>This comes in a generous size that will carry you through many productions.  </li>
            <li>Simply THE best bruise make up I&#x27;ve ever used for the stage.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>That worked better.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to dilute it with alcohol and not water.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li>Used this on top of some grey foundation makeup that we got for a zombie film I made, and these wheels were the best!</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best makeup for making bruises or cuts look realistic.</li>
            <li>Really cool!</li>
            <li>So easy to use, you can&#x27;t screw it up.</li>
            <li>Everything washed off easily too.  </li>
            <li>Easy to work with it won&#x27;t smear.</li>
            <li>Make up stayed on all night, even in hot kitchen, and washed off easily with soap and warm water.</li>
            <li>The black along with my shadows was perfect for around the eyes.</li>
            <li>I had a huge gig and needed these to work for me.</li>
            <li>This bruise wheel is great for basic sfx makeup use or for a Halloween costume.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use even for a beginner like me.  </li>
            <li>Works great when applied with a dry makeup sponge or brushes.</li>
            <li>My daughter has started doing special effects makeup</li>
            <li>It would look very faded/smeared after more than 2 hours or so.</li>
            <li>But not bad for the money.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for a quick zombie costume.  </li>
            <li>The item arrived quick and just like described.</li>
            <li>The makeup applies smoothly, and dried on the latex and doesn&#x27;t come off the latex without soap and water, (which is great) but is removable from the skin with a makeup remover wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic FX make-up - very creamy and rich in color.</li>
            <li>great makeup for making bruises and dark circles</li>
            <li>Very prompt shipping!!</li>
            <li>I bought this to do sfx makeup for a friend&#x27;s short film, and so far I&#x27;ve had a great experience with it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fun.</li>
            <li>Right out of the box</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast, it arrived a day earlier than expected, which was great because that gave me some more time to practice with it before Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This wheel is so easy to use and the makeup goes so far!.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect product if you&#x27;re looking for something a little easier to use than Ben Nye&#x27;s bruise wheel or if you&#x27;re staring a basic sfx makeup kit; for heavy-duty makeup, like for a theater production or prolonged photoshoot, I would recommend an alcohol-activated bruise palette.</li>
            <li>So either be prepared to clean really well, or use brushes you don&#x27;t like so much (or ones for FX</li>
            <li>exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li>She has made bruises that look real!</li>
            <li>The red color was perfect for adding a bit around his mouth where we were going to apply the blood to help boost that bloody look effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is PLENTY of product in the wheel which was great because we did a trial run the day before and didn&#x27;t have to worry about using it up.</li>
            <li>I then put glue on top of that and peeled it back to make it look like my skin was peeling.</li>
            <li>had to run and grab new makeup quickly.</li>
            <li>The color applies smooth and blends well; the payoff could be a little bit stronger, but overall it&#x27;s really easy to layer the color to make it more opaque.</li>
            <li>pretty much used all of the colors in the wheel along with some eye shadows I already had.</li>
            <li>They last a good amount of time too, but if you go overboard on one color over another, you may end up using up one color before other, but we used them all equally to give some variety, and it looked great in the end!</li>
            <li>The bruises look so realistic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never done costume make-up before but this was super easy to use and my bruises look completely real (minus the swelling part).  </li>
            <li>Helps create very realistic effects, from a fresh bruise to a two-week old bruise that&#x27;s healing.  </li>
            <li>It was fun the layer up and mix the colors to get that authentic *dead</li>
            <li>As described, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>Really adds to your costume.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It came packaged nicely, securely, and totally intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist and was excited to see this professional special effects makeup offered on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;However this product fell short.</li>
            <li>Really makes realistic bruises.</li>
            <li>I had a cool looking bruise just playing around with the different colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other bruise wheels before and various other cream based makeups and this has some of the best color payoff and smoothest formula I&#x27;ve seen so far.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re really worried about full realism, look into alcohol-activated dry</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Ben Nye is the best I wouldn&#x27;t say this company was bad</li>
            <li>Also, a big plus, unlike the grey foundation we bought, this stuff would stay on liquid latex so we were able to use it over the latex we used for scarring.</li>
            <li>I wrote a review pertaining to Mehron Blood Gel, and with this including Amon the blood dripping gash, you&#x27;ll be surprised by what one person would react to it.</li>
            <li>I would completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>As far as FX makeup goes, with everything I&#x27;ve tried, this was the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>expensive for some paints, but they are good quality.</li>
            <li>It contained enough of every color for me to not only paint my prosthetic, but to have more than enough left over to do some stuff on my face and such as well.</li>
            <li>I thought the price was a bit high, but now I can tell this wheel will last me forever.</li>
            <li>This wheel will last a long time... and it helps create very realistic injuries.  </li>
            <li>I fixed this by taking a bit of anti perspirant (gross I know, but it worked) on my nose before putting on the makeup.</li>
            <li>The green and yellow colors are pretty vibrant, but are easily dulled down by blending out or adding some black in along with them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colors I used the most were black, yellow and green.</li>
            <li>I actually had to learn to dip the brush into as little of it as possible, so as not to have too much pigment, to create a more subtle &amp;#34;bruising&amp;#34; effect.</li>
            <li>I also mixed some of these with some white clown makeup by Mehron to tone them down in certain areas.</li>

            <li> I fixed this by taking a bit of anti perspirant (gross I know, but it worked) on my nose before putting on the makeup.</li>

            <li> I also mixed some of these with some white clown makeup by Mehron to tone them down in certain areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The wheel is decently sized, a little larger than my palm.</li>
            <li> The makeup itself could be a little on the thick side trying to apply it and not smoothing out well but using a makeup sponge that was slightly damp helped to smooth it on better and thin it out.</li>
            <li> The green, yellow and a gray I had from something else mixed up well and was able to be layered to give his skin that icky dead look.</li>
            <li> My only slight tick is that the cream color base can seem, at times, to sit on top of the skin, which can ruin the realistic effect you&#x27;re going for, but with enough blending, thin layers, and a dusting of powder, this isn&#x27;t a huge issue.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Good quality, not like the crap you find at the dollar store.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li> Love Mehron products!  Had a great outcome with this year&#x27;s Halloween looks!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for a quick zombie costume.  Works great and the bruises look VERY realistic.  Could use this over, and over, and over again with the size.  Very pleased...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never done costume make-up before but this was super easy to use and my bruises look completely real (minus the swelling part).  When in doubt do some searches online for bruise tutorials.</li>
            <li> As described, fast shipping. Thank you</li>
            <li> good wheel, a bit greasier than Ben Nye but the color depth is excellent and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This wheel will last a long time... and it helps create very realistic injuries.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review pertaining to Mehron Blood Gel, and with this including Amon the blood dripping gash, you&#x27;ll be surprised by what one person would react to it.</li>
            <li> This wheel is the perfect colors for bruises and nasty-looking sores! I bought it to make up some wait staff as zombies for a restaurant zombie themed Halloween night. The colors I used the most were black, yellow and green. I used it on 5 wait staff and made myself up twice with it and still had plenty left over! It doesn&#x27;t take much. Make up stayed on all night, even in hot kitchen, and washed off easily with soap and warm water.</li>
            <li> it is perfect for all sorts of makeup! I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging it very nice. The container it&#x27;s in is a hard plastic so it&#x27;s durable. There&#x27;s a lot of product so it will last you quite a bit. Slowly im getting the hang of making fake bruises. Really cool!</li>
            <li> Really makes realistic bruises. A must for any thespian.</li>
            <li> This is a really good bruise wheel for the price. I use one of those beauty blenders with it, it worked the best. Really convincing,  or so I was told.</li>
            <li> Fantastic FX make-up - very creamy and rich in color. I actually had to learn to dip the brush into as little of it as possible, so as not to have too much pigment, to create a more subtle &amp;#34;bruising&amp;#34; effect. Blends beautifully. Before I bought it I thought the price was a bit high, but now I can tell this wheel will last me forever.</li>
            <li> Worked perfect for daughter&#x27;s needs. used for school&#x27;s Spring musical make-up artist.</li>
            <li> My daughter has started doing special effects makeup and she loves this product. She has made bruises that look real! Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So easy to use, you can&#x27;t screw it up.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best makeup for making bruises or cuts look realistic.</li>
            <li> This bruise wheel is great for basic sfx makeup use or for a Halloween costume. I bought this to do sfx makeup for a friend&#x27;s short film, and so far I&#x27;ve had a great experience with it. The color applies smooth and blends well; the payoff could be a little bit stronger, but overall it&#x27;s really easy to layer the color to make it more opaque. Because these colors are cream based, they do smear a bit, and the staying power isn&#x27;t the best. I recommend setting with either Mehron Colorstay powder or some regular translucent powder (e.l.f. makes a great one.) Before you use this product, you might want to wipe down the area you&#x27;re applying it to with some rubbing alcohol or non-oil based makeup remover, as I&#x27;ve noticed that having oils on your skin beforehand can cause the product to smear a bit. My only slight tick is that the cream color base can seem, at times, to sit on top of the skin, which can ruin the realistic effect you&#x27;re going for, but with enough blending, thin layers, and a dusting of powder, this isn&#x27;t a huge issue. If you&#x27;re really worried about full realism, look into alcohol-activated dry pigments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. I&#x27;ve used other bruise wheels before and various other cream based makeups and this has some of the best color payoff and smoothest formula I&#x27;ve seen so far. Works great when applied with a dry makeup sponge or brushes. This is the perfect product if you&#x27;re looking for something a little easier to use than Ben Nye&#x27;s bruise wheel or if you&#x27;re staring a basic sfx makeup kit; for heavy-duty makeup, like for a theater production or prolonged photoshoot, I would recommend an alcohol-activated bruise palette. Still, this wheel great product to have on hand.</li>
            <li> Good quality, not like the crap you find at the dollar store. Really adds to your costume.</li>
            <li> great makeup for making bruises and dark circles</li>
            <li> I truly do love this product I&#x27;ve have done many makeups and still have a lot more makeup to with this product a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> As described. Mehron Pro Make Up!</li>
            <li> The item arrived quick and just like described. I think the wheel itself worked well for my purposes. The makeup itself could be a little on the thick side trying to apply it and not smoothing out well but using a makeup sponge that was slightly damp helped to smooth it on better and thin it out. It was fun the layer up and mix the colors to get that authentic *dead* look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pretty much used all of the colors in the wheel along with some eye shadows I already had. The green, yellow and a gray I had from something else mixed up well and was able to be layered to give his skin that icky dead look. The black along with my shadows was perfect for around the eyes. I also mixed some of these with some white clown makeup by Mehron to tone them down in certain areas. The red color was perfect for adding a bit around his mouth where we were going to apply the blood to help boost that bloody look effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is PLENTY of product in the wheel which was great because we did a trial run the day before and didn&#x27;t have to worry about using it up. Everything washed off easily too.  I would completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The best bruise wheel we have used! You will not be disappointed !</li>
            <li> Worked awesome for my halloween costume. I just used the red to make it look like I had a sun burn on my arms and face. I then put glue on top of that and peeled it back to make it look like my skin was peeling. It was very convincing.</li>
            <li> This comes in a generous size that will carry you through many productions.  Helps create very realistic effects, from a fresh bruise to a two-week old bruise that&#x27;s healing.  Simply THE best bruise make up I&#x27;ve ever used for the stage.</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist and was excited to see this professional special effects makeup offered on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;However this product fell short. I had a huge gig and needed these to work for me. I used one only a tiny bit and it was awful.&lt;br /&gt;I had to run and grab new makeup quickly. Ben Nye is the best I wouldn&#x27;t say this company was bad but the quality of this wasn&#x27;t good at all.</li>
            <li> Present for my daughter &amp; she loves it!  Very prompt shipping!!</li>
            <li> Used this on top of some grey foundation makeup that we got for a zombie film I made, and these wheels were the best! They look very good, and the color options are great. They last a good amount of time too, but if you go overboard on one color over another, you may end up using up one color before other, but we used them all equally to give some variety, and it looked great in the end! Great bruise wheel! Also, a big plus, unlike the grey foundation we bought, this stuff would stay on liquid latex so we were able to use it over the latex we used for scarring. Some of these makeups just wont hold to that stuff.</li>
            <li> granddaughter loved it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS. Love this. As far as FX makeup goes, with everything I&#x27;ve tried, this was the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast, it arrived a day earlier than expected, which was great because that gave me some more time to practice with it before Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came packaged nicely, securely, and totally intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made a liquid latex zombie mouth prosthetic for Halloween this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wheel is decently sized, a little larger than my palm. It contained enough of every color for me to not only paint my prosthetic, but to have more than enough left over to do some stuff on my face and such as well. The green and yellow colors are pretty vibrant, but are easily dulled down by blending out or adding some black in along with them.&lt;br /&gt; The makeup applies smoothly, and dried on the latex and doesn&#x27;t come off the latex without soap and water, (which is great) but is removable from the skin with a makeup remover wipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only vices with this product are these - If you sweat a *lot*, it&#x27;s going to come off. I applied it to my nose and it started coming off after about twenty minutes. I fixed this by taking a bit of anti perspirant (gross I know, but it worked) on my nose before putting on the makeup. That worked better. Obviously, any makeup does this. Just a warning and what worked for me. Be prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second is this - I wouldn&#x27;t advise using your day to day make up brushes with this product. Applying my makeup yesterday, I realized I was still getting green from the wheel on my face along with my eyeliner. So either be prepared to clean really well, or use brushes you don&#x27;t like so much (or ones for FX use.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, great product. Would totally buy this again. (And hey, I might, next Halloween.)</li>
            <li> expensive for some paints, but they are good quality.</li>
            <li> Great makeup. Lasts a long time. Easy to work with it won&#x27;t smear. Doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin. Very happy this is a wonderful product! Just be sure to dilute it with alcohol and not water.</li>
            <li> Really good pigmentation... good product</li>
            <li> Great make up for Halloween, lasted all night!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fun. Super easy to use even for a beginner like me.  Right out of the box I had a cool looking bruise just playing around with the different colors. There is also directions to help you out. Planning on using this for some zombie makeup.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> This wheel is so easy to use and the makeup goes so far!. The effect is perfect.  The bruises look so realistic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with how much product there is here, but it wipes off/smudges/disappears too easily. Needs a more sturdy base to the formula. Definitely not good for long wear. A primer is a definite. But not bad for the money. Good for photo shoots.. but wouldn&#x27;t suggest for an all night costume/Halloween party. It would look very faded/smeared after more than 2 hours or so.</li>
