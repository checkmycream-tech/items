            <li>The color is amazing!</li>
            <li>Very beautiful nail polish, but it chips easily</li>

            <li>I love this color!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this nail polish!</li>
            <li>The brush is really nice and not flimsy unlike the lower end brands.</li>
            <li>The polish was \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; and nice.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great price!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I would have received the polish, I would have loved it,</li>
            <li>The really nice thing about this polish is that it&#x27;s PACKED with glitter...</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Teenage Dream&amp;#34; was kind of a gateway polish for me.  </li>
            <li>Looks good, but I like it on its own or as the top coat on another color, better.</li>
            <li>It shines so gorgeously in the light also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy.</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish</li>
            <li>I love the opi shatter.</li>

            <li>I Love, love, love this nailpolish.  </li>
            <li>I was so glad to be able to find it online.  </li>
            <li>Can one really love a nail-polish?  </li>
            <li>Teenage Dream is the best glitter polish I have ever had.</li>
            <li>Love this polish for my pedicure.  </li>
            <li>I have used this before and love it and have gotten many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>one coat is ok, but if you double up the layers your fingernails look AMAZING!!!!!</li>
            <li>So glad I was able to get this before they were all gone.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Either way it&#x27;s super cute!</li>
            <li>and make sure you use a couple top coats it ships easily</li>
            <li>OPI often have good formulas, and this is no exception (and a really pretty coloured glitter).</li>
            <li>It can be thinned out and works fine.  </li>
            <li>My husband says it is little girl polish... perfect for me :</li>
            <li>I love this fun nail polish.</li>
            <li>If you want a fun top coat, this is the way to go, or wear it alone.</li>
            <li>Other than that, very good product.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect sparkly, glittery, pretty pink.</li>
            <li>:) It is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Three coats, nails or intensified and looks like beautiful pink jewels.</li>
            <li>i first used it at a salon when me and my friends got Mani and pedis so cute</li>
            <li>It is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and I can&#x27;t be without it.  </li>
            <li>Its very pretty.</li>
            <li>It looks great by itself and over other colors!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pretty!</li>
            <li>Great polish for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just the right amount of sparkle for me.</li>
            <li>Looks especially good under artificial light, sparkle, sparkle, wow! :)</li>
            <li>If you apply only one quote, it looks beautiful and sheer as if there&#x27;s a suttle hint of color on your nails.  </li>
            <li>This polish is great over other colors - I use it all the time over other colors and get more compliments on my nails.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>So if your not looking for a very sheer color do not order it or just use it on top of another color.</li>
            <li>I first tried this at a salon with \\&quot;White Shatter,\\&quot; also pretty, but when she had put on two coats of this I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to put the Shatter over it because it is so pretty.</li>
            <li>The quality of teenage dream was okay.</li>
            <li>I love the teenage dream nail polish.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Teenage Dream.</li>
            <li>The only thing is because it&#x27;s a shimmery nail polish you have to use more than one coat.</li>
            <li>Pretty color, but blah on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s become pretty much the only nail polish I ever use. :)</li>
            <li>but it is very sparkly and shiny and looks pretty on.</li>
            <li>Two coats, nails look more glamorous and the Teenage Dream pink shows more.  </li>
            <li>The color itself is very buildable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s officially my favorite sparkly pink.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s really overpriced here (due to being a limited edition item), I&#x27;m still glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>the color is so pretty, and it seem to last a lot longer with out chipping then</li>
            <li>Katy Perry Teenage Dream was my first OPI nail polish I ever bought</li>
            <li>It adds to neutral colors and just down just a little bit bright colors to where I like them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gorgeous glitter that you can build up to opacity in many coats (although I generally prefer to do a colour base anyway).</li>
            <li>Plus it makes the color last much longer than they otherwise would.  </li>
            <li>Teenage dream is a nice color but its very very sheer and hard to tell you have it on</li>
            <li>I never usually wear glitter on my nails as its exceptional hard to take off but this combination of pink flecks and holographic glitter!!!</li>
            <li>unless it&#x27;s a holiday or a party (even under fluorescent lighting, it catches and reflects light like nobody&#x27;s business), but for everyday, I do like using this to paint on a bling-bling pink French tip on my toe nails.</li>
            <li>I initially bought it not long after it was released, and eventually I ended up with a collection of over 400 bottles of polish.  </li>
            <li>it has a sheer pink tone with large silver holographic glitter and micro pink glitter.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> it has a sheer pink tone with large silver holographic glitter and micro pink glitter.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the color seems to fade and it seems a little less sparkly after about 3 or 4 days, though a fresh coat of top coat can help a little bit.</li>
            <li> The gritty texture of the glitter also helps it to resist chipping for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> I used a very light pink nail polish as the base first and then used the teenage dream.</li>
            <li> It looked fabulous and you could barely tell that I had put a base coat of a different color.</li>
            <li> Definitely not your everyday nail polish.</li>
            <li> I needed this pink glittery goodness.</li>
            <li> my other nail polishes</li>
            <li> Guess that is why those that are available for purchase are so very expensive.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that stinks is that it is hard to get off your nails, but that is true with any giltter nail polish you buy.</li>
            <li> This is not right.</li>
            <li> , only thing is the glitter is hard to take all the way off.  </li>
            <li> This nail polish is just made so extremely well!</li>
            <li> It does thicken too much a little time.</li>
            <li> Just one coat is all I use - there&#x27;s still visible nail line with 1 coat which doesn&#x27;t bother me, but if VNL bothers you 2 coats will do the trick (or use a coat of white nail polish as your base, then put Teenage Dream over that).</li>
            <li> And it stays on forever - which makes it a little hard to get off, but who cares when your nails don&#x27;t chip for two weeks?!</li>
            <li> It is hard to find as I am told that it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d suggest applying at least 3 coats.</li>
            <li> with this, I don&#x27;t need to build up thick layers of polish to get the dense coverage of glitter I want.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely sparkle-y, but not in a bad way.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this nail polish.</li>
            <li> This is a color that sold out too soon and was difficult to find.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this nail polish the color is so pretty, and it seem to last a lot longer with out chipping then my other nail polishes ;)</li>
            <li> I love the opi shatter. Teenage dream is a nice color but its very very sheer and hard to tell you have it on but it is very sparkly and shiny and looks pretty on. So if your not looking for a very sheer color do not order it or just use it on top of another color.</li>
            <li> Katy Perry Teenage Dream was my first OPI nail polish I ever bought and I really love the nail polish quality.   The brush is really nice and not flimsy unlike the lower end brands. The polish was \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; and nice.  The color itself is very buildable. The maximum number of coats I recommend is three.   If you apply only one quote, it looks beautiful and sheer as if there&#x27;s a suttle hint of color on your nails.  Two coats, nails look more glamorous and the Teenage Dream pink shows more.  Three coats, nails or intensified and looks like beautiful pink jewels.</li>
            <li> Play with this over different colors. I love it over \\&quot;Sparrow me the Drama,\\&quot; I also have \\&quot;Planks A Lot\\&quot; Which I am going to try next. Will post pics. I first tried this at a salon with \\&quot;White Shatter,\\&quot; also pretty, but when she had put on two coats of this I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to put the Shatter over it because it is so pretty. I went ahead with the Shatter, because I had never tried that either. Looks good, but I like it on its own or as the top coat on another color, better. Looks especially good under artificial light, sparkle, sparkle, wow! :)</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this polish at my local beauty store but I had to have it  after I tried it on at my local nail salon.  Fast shipping and great price!  Great color for any occasion.</li>
            <li> so sparkly I love it i first used it at a salon when me and my friends got Mani and pedis so cute, only thing is the glitter is hard to take all the way off.  and make sure you use a couple top coats it ships easily</li>
            <li> I love this fun nail polish. It&#x27;s got chunky glittery pieces in it. Definitely not your everyday nail polish. If you want a fun top coat, this is the way to go, or wear it alone. Either way it&#x27;s super cute!</li>
            <li> I use this polish over a pinkish/tan colored polish and I get compliments all the time on my nails :-) I love it, pricey but I still love it.</li>
            <li> The price is fair. The quality of teenage dream was okay. I love this nail polish but it seems like its been sitting in a where house somewhere. The glitter stuck to the sides of the bottle. Shipping was timely though. I&#x27;m pretty happy. Especially since I couldn&#x27;t get the polish anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I seriously am in love with this polish! The color is amazing! It shines so gorgeously in the light also. It&#x27;s extremely sparkle-y, but not in a bad way. This nail polish is just made so extremely well!</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s really overpriced here (due to being a limited edition item), I&#x27;m still glad I bought it. It&#x27;s a gorgeous glitter that you can build up to opacity in many coats (although I generally prefer to do a colour base anyway). OPI often have good formulas, and this is no exception (and a really pretty coloured glitter).</li>
            <li> I Love, love, love this nailpolish.  I was so glad to be able to find it online.  Swift delivery is always a plus</li>
            <li> Can one really love a nail-polish?  Well, this is as close as it comes.  My husband says it is little girl polish... perfect for me :-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller was great.  Arrived quickly and I can&#x27;t be without it.  Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Teenage Dream is the best glitter polish I have ever had. I never usually wear glitter on my nails as its exceptional hard to take off but this combination of pink flecks and holographic glitter!!! Best polish of the year!</li>
            <li> I love the teenage dream nail polish. It is my absolute favorite. It&#x27;s become pretty much the only nail polish I ever use. :)</li>
            <li> Love this polish for my pedicure.  It matches my shellac polish that I put on my hand nails.  And, I don&#x27;t know why they are discontinuing this color.  Its very pretty.</li>
            <li> I have used this before and love it and have gotten many compliments on it.  It does thicken too much a little time. It can be thinned out and works fine.  It is hard to find as I am told that it has been discontinued. Guess that is why those that are available for purchase are so very expensive.  This is not right.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this nail polish. It is the perfect sparkly, glittery, pretty pink. The gritty texture of the glitter also helps it to resist chipping for a LONG time. My only complaint is that the color seems to fade and it seems a little less sparkly after about 3 or 4 days, though a fresh coat of top coat can help a little bit.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful nail polish, but it chips easily so I&#x27;d suggest applying at least 3 coats. Another drawback is that it is a pain to get off since it&#x27;s glitter nail polish. Might have to soak nails in acetone for easier removal. Other than that, very good product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Teenage Dream. The only thing is because it&#x27;s a shimmery nail polish you have to use more than one coat. I used a very light pink nail polish as the base first and then used the teenage dream. It looked fabulous and you could barely tell that I had put a base coat of a different color. I was getting complements on it all the time that one of my coworkers just had to go and by Teenage Dream herself.</li>
            <li> i love this nail polish! one coat is ok, but if you double up the layers your fingernails look AMAZING!!!!! definitely would suggest this item to any girlie girl!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this color! It&#x27;s one of my favorites and I wear it all the time! It was definitely a great choice!</li>
            <li> I love this color! It looks great by itself and over other colors! :) It is my new favorite. The only thing that stinks is that it is hard to get off your nails, but that is true with any giltter nail polish you buy.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this nail polish! It&#x27;s officially my favorite sparkly pink. There are dozens of different size sparkles, so it looks way different than your \\&quot;5th grade\\&quot; sparkle nail polish. And it stays on forever - which makes it a little hard to get off, but who cares when your nails don&#x27;t chip for two weeks?!</li>
            <li> This color almost matches the color of my nailbeds, so it looks like my natural nails just have glitter on them with just a hint of pink. It&#x27;s so pretty! When you want to remove it you&#x27;re going to have to use brute force since it&#x27;s a glitter polish, so beware.</li>
            <li> Pretty color, but blah on my skin.</li>
            <li> I was on vacation when it was delivered.The post office didn&#x27;t hold my mail as requested.I never received the nail polish. I&#x27;ve been talking to the supervisors at the Greentree Post Office and they keep putting me off. I&#x27;m sure if I would have received the polish, I would have loved it,</li>
            <li> Before buying Teenage Dream, I looked over tons of photos and read a lot of descriptions but somehow missed that this contains quite a lot of holographic glitter. It&#x27;s a bit too eye-catching on my entire nail unless it&#x27;s a holiday or a party (even under fluorescent lighting, it catches and reflects light like nobody&#x27;s business), but for everyday, I do like using this to paint on a bling-bling pink French tip on my toe nails. That&#x27;s just the right amount of sparkle for me. The really nice thing about this polish is that it&#x27;s PACKED with glitter... with this, I don&#x27;t need to build up thick layers of polish to get the dense coverage of glitter I want. Just one coat is all I use - there&#x27;s still visible nail line with 1 coat which doesn&#x27;t bother me, but if VNL bothers you 2 coats will do the trick (or use a coat of white nail polish as your base, then put Teenage Dream over that).</li>
            <li> So glad I was able to get this before they were all gone.  Great polish for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> This polish is great over other colors - I use it all the time over other colors and get more compliments on my nails.  It adds to neutral colors and just down just a little bit bright colors to where I like them.  Plus it makes the color last much longer than they otherwise would.  I love it.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Teenage Dream&amp;#34; was kind of a gateway polish for me.  I initially bought it not long after it was released, and eventually I ended up with a collection of over 400 bottles of polish.  But gasp!  My Teenage Dream was gone!  So it was off to my trusty Amazon, wherein I found another bottle to replace it.  Even with 400 bottles of polish I needed this pink glittery goodness.</li>
            <li> This is a color that sold out too soon and was difficult to find. it has a sheer pink tone with large silver holographic glitter and micro pink glitter.</li>
