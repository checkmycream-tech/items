            <li>Looks great on foreheads, cheeks, eyes, chins....</li>
            <li>This is great.</li>
            <li>This is a great hi-lighter for your cheekbones.</li>
            <li>It also looks very nice.</li>
            <li>This product is simply amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li>It is so easy and it does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, so maybe this just looks better on people with a tan.</li>
            <li>I am fair and this product gives me the glowy look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good highlighter.</li>
            <li>With the blush below it creates a contour that looks good.  </li>
            <li>It gives a good glow under the eyes and for the cheeks</li>
            <li>Now to the good part.</li>
            <li>I loved the fact that it&#x27;s not glittery or shimmery.</li>
            <li>so I already knew that I loved it.  </li>
            <li>This product by benefit fit the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li>I search the internet for products that keep me up-to-date and make me feel good about myself, also look the most attractive I can for my age.  </li>
            <li>A great way to appear more awake in the morning and freshen up at night.</li>
            <li>I see what the over 50ish appear like, see the photographs of models, and check out QVC&#x27;s chatter box on their site, very interesting.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great addition to anyone&#x27;s makeup arsenal, whether you&#x27;re a makeup addict, or more of a minimalist like me.</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>However, by mid-afternoon, my face looks too shiny (more than just a glow!)</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Versatile and lovely!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Most people consider things like mascara and lip gloss beauty staples; this needs to be added to the list!</li>
            <li>I have a very fair complexion, but High Beam always looks great.  </li>
            <li>This makes your skin look lovely and bright.</li>
            <li>Like almost all of Benefit&#x27;s product, this stuff is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>Beauty in a jar, with brush amazing.</li>
            <li>It gives you a nice glow that shows in pictures.</li>
            <li>However, it is nice to use on my brow bones as a highlighter.  </li>
            <li>This adds a nice glow to my skin without being greasy or gloppy.</li>
            <li>It gives my cheeks a nice creamy gleam and works well with the blush color of Benetint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nice pinkish glow.  </li>
            <li>THe product arrived way sooner than the tracking info implied it would, which was a nice surprise.  </li>
            <li>You just look healthy and fresh and wonderful.</li>
            <li>Dior shimmer star (rose), Bobby Brown shimmer brick,</li>
            <li>This product lasts all day and leaves a nice rosey tone.</li>
            <li>Perfect high lighter.</li>
            <li>High Beam is perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure its a good product its just way too light (color wise) for me.</li>
            <li>I look younger,fresh,and my skin has a lovely , dewey, healthy glow!</li>
            <li>I can see how it would be nice for someone young with flawless to near flawless skin to mix into thier makeup for a healthy shimmery effect.  </li>
            <li>I had always wanted a nice, healthy glow, but it seemed to me that most of the products that were formulated for that purpose were either bronzers or just too glittery.</li>
            <li>I love it, gives my face a nice healthy glow .</li>
            <li>I have a very fair complexion and this looks great blended in with my other</li>
            <li>It really illuminated my face and made my skin look so beautiful.</li>
            <li>i love trying all kinds of make up ive been wearing make up since i could walk.</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>she was famous for.</li>
            <li>Buy it ,you&#x27;ll love it.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better used at night if your skin colour is medium.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>i love this product if i didn&#x27;t have to wear powder foundation on top, but since i do, wearing this on top of it cakes my foundation and leaves streaks.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>This is one of their most versatile products.  </li>
            <li>It blends with my eyeshadow but opens my eyes up, making them look more alert and awake.  </li>
            <li>Much better than a shadow for that.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it on top of lipstick on my bottom lip for brightness.  </li>
            <li>Its ok.  .  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a phenomenal product.  </li>
            <li>consistency is brighter and more iridescent than the Sun Beam.</li>
            <li>Authentic as well in case some are worried about counterfeit products.</li>
            <li>I love the dewy look that it gives and</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Has always been favorite highlighter.</li>
            <li>This product is ok..</li>
            <li>I buy this about every six months and am always pleased.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>its lovely.</li>
            <li>I like applying it because it has a nice silky smooth texture.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t my favorite highlighter, though --  </li>
            <li>; you know the one you&#x27;re supposed to be able to get by eating salmon every day like Jennifer Lopez...</li>
            <li>because we all love salmon</li>
            <li>I love this under my makeup.</li>
            <li>It highlights my face very nicely and the color compliments my complexion and is very flattering.</li>
            <li>Pretty good highlighter for cheeks.</li>
            <li>Love the consistency; it&#x27;s soo easy to apply (as is moon beam), just use your fingers.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to use and gives you a really lovely effect.</li>
            <li>I had three people tell me how nice my skin was the first day I wore it including a man!</li>
            <li>I use High Beam on my cheeks at the very end of applying my makeup I get a perfect glow.</li>
            <li>The lip tint is just as great too, really all the makeup you need in two little bottles and a good mascara your good to go.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This could be because most people seem to use this over a full face of makeup</li>
            <li>And this is my first, I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>and...well, let&#x27;s just say there&#x27;s a fine line between \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; and \\&quot;shiny\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>They seem unique and special, and I love the names.</li>
            <li>best product to add a little glow under eyes and cheeks.</li>
            <li>Benefit&#x27;s Moon Beam has a golden glow to it and is better for darker complexions or night time use.</li>
            <li>One concern that I have with the product is that I noticed that it does not blend that well sometimes, but overall, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>This product diffuses and reflects light.</li>
            <li>It may not look like you have a lot on, but it will catch the light.</li>
            <li>Light dots on cheekbones, around the outer eye &amp; one or two dots at the end of the nose.  </li>
            <li>I even enjoy mixing into my concealers, to give them a highlighting effect, reflecting flaws and brightening skin.  </li>
            <li>The one I received was genuine.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product, and I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>Smooth delivery.</li>
            <li>Like almost all Benefit products, this is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Smooth consistency.</li>
            <li>Please make sure the right weight is shown or in the description.</li>
            <li>( I have oily skin )and is very economical.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite beauty product!</li>
            <li>I liked the effect, so I decided to look into a \\&quot;real\\&quot; highlighting product and every review I read pointed me to this - Benefit&#x27;s High Beam.  </li>
            <li>First, let me tell you, my skin color is kinda like light coffee, and this show up really really nice and pretty.</li>
            <li>I feel that it is well worth the price!</li>
            <li>contrast, High Beam is light, easily blendable, and gives a nice, pretty glow.</li>
            <li>I love the sheen it gives my cheeks, it brightens up your whole face.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly! :)</li>
            <li>Brush is only good to get stuff out of bottle; otherwise, just use my fingers to apply it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product, it&#x27;s just that with all the hype I guess I was expecting a miracle</li>
            <li>Used sparingly on the browbones, apples of the cheeks, or (my favorite) around lips, high beam will soften and brighten.</li>
            <li>A fun product to play and experiment with.</li>
            <li>Good for those days when you&#x27;ve stayed out too late the night before :)  </li>
            <li>Not for more mature ladies.</li>
            <li>Make sure to order directly from Amazon</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, but for an easy to use, everyday-wear glow that can be applied alone</li>
            <li>This has just the right amount of shine to be a highlighter without overdoing it.</li>
            <li>There is no wrong way or right wear to wear it.</li>
            <li>Much too light for me and too much shimmer.  </li>
            <li>and i love them equally.</li>
            <li>Several people have commented on how my skin looks really healthy after I started using this.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much (esp for the price!)</li>
            <li>First of all DON\\&quot;T BUY THESE PRODUCTS ON EBAY</li>
            <li>I use it on my cheekbones and a tiny bit under my eyes, and it make me look more awake for my early-morning classes.</li>
            <li>This performs exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>and it looks pretty in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>As all of the products on Amazon you don&#x27;t really know if you get the real deal but real or not, this highlighter is by far my favorite right now.</li>
            <li>This is a very natural looking, pinkish highlighter that goes well with my cool skintone.  </li>
            <li>That promised dewy skin finish is seriously delivered, very satisfied customer here!</li>
            <li>It gives you a subtle glow that makes your skin look great.</li>
            <li>As far as the texture, it feels very lightweight and smooth, not sticky nor oily.</li>
            <li>Even after that long, most of the bottle was still unused.</li>
            <li>This benefit highlighter is a wonderful product!place just above the cheekbone , on top of the outside of each eyebrow...or down the middle of the nose for a slimmer look-  </li>
            <li>High Beam works just right to get a bit of glow going without looking sparkly when the sun hits your face.</li>
            <li>As a makeup artist, I enjoy using this all over the face, it gives a natural shine to the skin, giving it more of a dewy finish than shimmery or glittery like a lot of other highlighters.  </li>
            <li>You just place little dots of this magic potion on your brow and cheeks, rub it in and tada!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone, although i first thought it was a little pricey, its worth it !!!</li>
            <li>My skin is combo and this last for many hours, considering that I live in tropical island, at the end of the day</li>
            <li>Not exactly older than dirt but close in my age, lets select a number over a healthy 65</li>
            <li>I very highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and you can do it in a way that is very subtle but really creates a beautiful effect on your face.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin that tends to look rather dull.</li>
            <li>i like to put it over my cover up on my whole face.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well to create that iridescent, fresh-faced look.  </li>
            <li>I really do think that the makeup artist for the Sex and the City series used this on SJP&#x27;s cheeks to give them that fab glow</li>
            <li>She suggested using a light eye shadow if you didn&#x27;t have an actual highlighter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a highligher that doesn&#x27;t have too much shimmer</li>
            <li>and that blends very well.    </li>
            <li>The key is to apply lightly and avoid a heavyhanded application.</li>
            <li>It really did transform my face and made a difference.</li>
            <li>To me this is nothing more than a liquid pink highlighter or eye shadow.    </li>
            <li>and it really glows in pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It must be the real deal (hopefully).</li>
            <li>I really think you can use it for any occasion, but I tend to wear it in the colder months when my skin is a bit lackluster.</li>
            <li>It gives me a youthful glow without too much shimmer or shine.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Benefit High Beam!</li>
            <li>And frankly, it doesn&#x27;t illuminate as much as I would like (and I have a golden-medium skintone).</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a little bit of light/eye catching going on where I&#x27;ve used the high beam</li>
            <li>Quite honestly, I see very little difference in this product vs. my much cheaper eye shadow.  </li>
            <li>But the product actually goes on and wears nicely, so it&#x27;s just a minor flaw.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s obviously a high quality product, but in terms of how it looks, I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference between highlighting my brow bones with a shimmery pinky eyeshadow (or silvery eyeshadow) and using this.</li>
            <li>It does have a lasting effect and can look nice in a photo from a distance but up close, eh, only the young.</li>
            <li>Before using it wash your face with an exfoliating cloth or use baking soda and a mild facial soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much foolproof to apply, as long as you keep in mind that you only need a tiny bit to get a nice, dewy glow.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it for people with dull skin, as it will make you look year younger and more rested.</li>
            <li>I bought both, high beam and moon beam</li>
            <li>I bought high beam about 3 months ago.</li>
            <li>I bought this with high expectations considering this is called \\&quot;Model in a Bottle\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>when I&#x27;ve used the High Beam.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of High Beam for years.</li>
            <li>High quality and lasts quite some time.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love my little bottle of high beam.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Negative - Wish the price was a little better.  </li>
            <li>The product High Beam that I purchased arrived in a sample size instead of the normal size.  </li>
            <li>The normal size in wt and ounces can be purchased at Sephora for $26.00.  </li>
            <li>maybe a little too much shine for me and it isn&#x27;t as smooth or blendable as I would like.</li>
            <li>I bought the second bottle only because I lost the first one somewhere after a year&#x27;s worth of use.  </li>
            <li>It is a light, liquid highlighter in a barely-there pink sparkle that looks natural on cheeks.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 41 years old and have normal skin.)  </li>
            <li>Este iluminador é ocque há de natural!</li>
            <li>Well, back to the product - used it, thought about it, sort of liked it, certainly never thought of sending it back.  </li>
            <li>Then apply your usual lotion and then just a few dabs of this on the apples of your cheeks and below brow and wow, amazing happens!</li>
            <li>Although this is not a highlighter that offers any coverage or evening of skin tones, it effortlessly creates that natural &amp;#34;dewey&amp;#34; and awake effect we are all struggling to find early in the morning.</li>
            <li>A lot of people don&#x27;t use highlighter because they think highlighting and contouring is a more advanced make-up trick, don&#x27;t be afraid.</li>
            <li>i only use it underneath and it doesn&#x27;t shine through as much as i would like.</li>
            <li>OLD comparing it to &#x27;sex in the city&#x27; ?   </li>
            <li>Listen gals, I&#x27;m old</li>
            <li>It is the classy way to do glitter without having any glitter.</li>
            <li>has been surprised that it worked so well with their skin tone as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is oily, so I work with powders trying to keep a matte finish, but this product offers a dewy, yet control finish that adds life and doesn&#x27;t look waxy or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>but it does a special little something to your look.</li>
            <li>I cleaned of the top which was caked with product and had a dark pink (lipstick-like) shade.</li>
            <li>-- if I apply it on my browbone, it tends to give my brown eyeshadow a red tint, but that could just be particular to me.</li>
            <li>I use Benefit High Beam with my Benetint, but only at night.</li>
            <li>I am a huge lover of Benefit&#x27;s similarly packaged lip stain, and finally decided to try High Beam a few months ago.</li>
            <li>Love the colour (pale pink shimmer).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several other brands of highlighter and primers intended to give you a glow, none of them look as natural as High Beam and the price for high beam</li>
            <li>I tried Benefit Watt&#x27;s Up prior to this one and prefer High Beam for several reasons.</li>
            <li>I had received a sample of high beam when i bought cosmetics at ulta, actually had it for quiet</li>
            <li>In general, I like benefit cosmetics.</li>
            <li>My eyes are a bit too close together, this works well and gives a natural brightness to the inner eye.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, when I use blush (either Nars Orgasm or Benefit&#x27;s cream blush), I use this above directly on my cheekbones.  </li>
            <li>When mixed with moisturizer, it makes my skin look so alive and blowy.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty universal color of pink and everyone that has borrowed or tried this</li>
            <li>I then just smudge the dots a little, you want to blend them in enough to remove the line but not so much you rub the high beam off.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re having a less-is-more makeup day then just mix a little high beam in with your face lotion and you&#x27;ll get a very natural looking all over glow</li>
            <li>I put some on right above the apples of my cheeks all the way to my temple (just a little bit) and it makes my cheekbones pop.</li>
            <li>I use it on the dark circles under my eyes and various other places for some added light and shine.</li>
            <li>But I have really dry skin and have to blend it well if you want natural glow look</li>
            <li>I have used other expensive highlighter pens and high beam does a better job, lasts all day</li>
            <li>but if you use too much it can look a little greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it over my foundation because it doesn&#x27;t show much otherwise, and it can make things look a little streaky.</li>
            <li>a little goes a long way and it really adds the brightening fnishing touch to make up!</li>

            <li> With the blush below it creates a contour that looks good.  </li>
            <li> It gives a good glow under the eyes and for the cheeks</li>
            <li> Now to the good part.</li>
            <li> I loved the fact that it&#x27;s not glittery or shimmery.</li>
            <li> so I already knew that I loved it.  </li>
            <li> This product by benefit fit the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li> I search the internet for products that keep me up-to-date and make me feel good about myself, also look the most attractive I can for my age.  </li>
            <li> A great way to appear more awake in the morning and freshen up at night.</li>
            <li> I see what the over 50ish appear like, see the photographs of models, and check out QVC&#x27;s chatter box on their site, very interesting.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great addition to anyone&#x27;s makeup arsenal, whether you&#x27;re a makeup addict, or more of a minimalist like me.</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> However, by mid-afternoon, my face looks too shiny (more than just a glow!)</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Versatile and lovely!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Most people consider things like mascara and lip gloss beauty staples; this needs to be added to the list!</li>
            <li> I have a very fair complexion, but High Beam always looks great.  </li>
            <li> This makes your skin look lovely and bright.</li>
            <li> Like almost all of Benefit&#x27;s product, this stuff is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> Beauty in a jar, with brush amazing.</li>
            <li> It gives you a nice glow that shows in pictures.</li>
            <li> However, it is nice to use on my brow bones as a highlighter.  </li>
            <li> This adds a nice glow to my skin without being greasy or gloppy.</li>
            <li> It gives my cheeks a nice creamy gleam and works well with the blush color of Benetint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nice pinkish glow.  </li>
            <li> THe product arrived way sooner than the tracking info implied it would, which was a nice surprise.  </li>
            <li> You just look healthy and fresh and wonderful.</li>
            <li> Dior shimmer star (rose), Bobby Brown shimmer brick,</li>
            <li> This product lasts all day and leaves a nice rosey tone.</li>
            <li> Perfect high lighter.</li>
            <li> High Beam is perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure its a good product its just way too light (color wise) for me.</li>
            <li> I look younger,fresh,and my skin has a lovely , dewey, healthy glow!</li>
            <li> I can see how it would be nice for someone young with flawless to near flawless skin to mix into thier makeup for a healthy shimmery effect.  </li>
            <li> I had always wanted a nice, healthy glow, but it seemed to me that most of the products that were formulated for that purpose were either bronzers or just too glittery.</li>
            <li> I love it, gives my face a nice healthy glow .</li>
            <li> I have a very fair complexion and this looks great blended in with my other</li>
            <li> It really illuminated my face and made my skin look so beautiful.</li>
            <li> i love trying all kinds of make up ive been wearing make up since i could walk.</li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> she was famous for.</li>
            <li> Buy it ,you&#x27;ll love it.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better used at night if your skin colour is medium.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> i love this product if i didn&#x27;t have to wear powder foundation on top, but since i do, wearing this on top of it cakes my foundation and leaves streaks.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> This is one of their most versatile products.  </li>
            <li> It blends with my eyeshadow but opens my eyes up, making them look more alert and awake.  </li>
            <li> Much better than a shadow for that.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on top of lipstick on my bottom lip for brightness.  </li>
            <li> Its ok.  .  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a phenomenal product.  </li>
            <li> consistency is brighter and more iridescent than the Sun Beam.</li>
            <li> Authentic as well in case some are worried about counterfeit products.</li>
            <li> I love the dewy look that it gives and</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Has always been favorite highlighter.</li>
            <li> This product is ok..</li>
            <li> I buy this about every six months and am always pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> its lovely.</li>
            <li> I like applying it because it has a nice silky smooth texture.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t my favorite highlighter, though --  </li>
            <li> ; you know the one you&#x27;re supposed to be able to get by eating salmon every day like Jennifer Lopez...</li>
            <li> because we all love salmon</li>
            <li> I love this under my makeup.</li>
            <li> It highlights my face very nicely and the color compliments my complexion and is very flattering.</li>
            <li> Pretty good highlighter for cheeks.</li>
            <li> Love the consistency; it&#x27;s soo easy to apply (as is moon beam), just use your fingers.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use and gives you a really lovely effect.</li>
            <li> I had three people tell me how nice my skin was the first day I wore it including a man!</li>
            <li> I use High Beam on my cheeks at the very end of applying my makeup I get a perfect glow.</li>
            <li> The lip tint is just as great too, really all the makeup you need in two little bottles and a good mascara your good to go.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This could be because most people seem to use this over a full face of makeup</li>
            <li> And this is my first, I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> and...well, let&#x27;s just say there&#x27;s a fine line between \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; and \\&quot;shiny\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> They seem unique and special, and I love the names.</li>
            <li> best product to add a little glow under eyes and cheeks.</li>
            <li> Benefit&#x27;s Moon Beam has a golden glow to it and is better for darker complexions or night time use.</li>
            <li> One concern that I have with the product is that I noticed that it does not blend that well sometimes, but overall, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This product diffuses and reflects light.</li>
            <li> It may not look like you have a lot on, but it will catch the light.</li>
            <li> Light dots on cheekbones, around the outer eye &amp; one or two dots at the end of the nose.  </li>
            <li> I even enjoy mixing into my concealers, to give them a highlighting effect, reflecting flaws and brightening skin.  </li>
            <li> The one I received was genuine.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product, and I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  </li>
            <li> Smooth delivery.</li>
            <li> Like almost all Benefit products, this is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Smooth consistency.</li>
            <li> Please make sure the right weight is shown or in the description.</li>
            <li> ( I have oily skin )and is very economical.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite beauty product!</li>
            <li> I liked the effect, so I decided to look into a \\&quot;real\\&quot; highlighting product and every review I read pointed me to this - Benefit&#x27;s High Beam.  </li>
            <li> First, let me tell you, my skin color is kinda like light coffee, and this show up really really nice and pretty.</li>
            <li> I feel that it is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> contrast, High Beam is light, easily blendable, and gives a nice, pretty glow.</li>
            <li> I love the sheen it gives my cheeks, it brightens up your whole face.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly! :)</li>
            <li> Brush is only good to get stuff out of bottle; otherwise, just use my fingers to apply it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product, it&#x27;s just that with all the hype I guess I was expecting a miracle</li>
            <li> Used sparingly on the browbones, apples of the cheeks, or (my favorite) around lips, high beam will soften and brighten.</li>
            <li> A fun product to play and experiment with.</li>
            <li> Good for those days when you&#x27;ve stayed out too late the night before :)  </li>
            <li> Not for more mature ladies.</li>
            <li> Make sure to order directly from Amazon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, but for an easy to use, everyday-wear glow that can be applied alone</li>
            <li> This has just the right amount of shine to be a highlighter without overdoing it.</li>
            <li> There is no wrong way or right wear to wear it.</li>
            <li> Much too light for me and too much shimmer.  </li>
            <li> and i love them equally.</li>
            <li> Several people have commented on how my skin looks really healthy after I started using this.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much (esp for the price!)</li>
            <li> First of all DON\\&quot;T BUY THESE PRODUCTS ON EBAY</li>
            <li> I use it on my cheekbones and a tiny bit under my eyes, and it make me look more awake for my early-morning classes.</li>
            <li> This performs exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> and it looks pretty in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> As all of the products on Amazon you don&#x27;t really know if you get the real deal but real or not, this highlighter is by far my favorite right now.</li>
            <li> This is a very natural looking, pinkish highlighter that goes well with my cool skintone.  </li>
            <li> That promised dewy skin finish is seriously delivered, very satisfied customer here!</li>
            <li> It gives you a subtle glow that makes your skin look great.</li>
            <li> As far as the texture, it feels very lightweight and smooth, not sticky nor oily.</li>
            <li> Even after that long, most of the bottle was still unused.</li>
            <li> This benefit highlighter is a wonderful product!place just above the cheekbone , on top of the outside of each eyebrow...or down the middle of the nose for a slimmer look-  </li>
            <li> High Beam works just right to get a bit of glow going without looking sparkly when the sun hits your face.</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist, I enjoy using this all over the face, it gives a natural shine to the skin, giving it more of a dewy finish than shimmery or glittery like a lot of other highlighters.  </li>
            <li> You just place little dots of this magic potion on your brow and cheeks, rub it in and tada!</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone, although i first thought it was a little pricey, its worth it !!!</li>
            <li> My skin is combo and this last for many hours, considering that I live in tropical island, at the end of the day</li>
            <li> Not exactly older than dirt but close in my age, lets select a number over a healthy 65</li>
            <li> I very highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and you can do it in a way that is very subtle but really creates a beautiful effect on your face.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin that tends to look rather dull.</li>
            <li> i like to put it over my cover up on my whole face.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well to create that iridescent, fresh-faced look.  </li>
            <li> I really do think that the makeup artist for the Sex and the City series used this on SJP&#x27;s cheeks to give them that fab glow</li>
            <li> She suggested using a light eye shadow if you didn&#x27;t have an actual highlighter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a highligher that doesn&#x27;t have too much shimmer</li>
            <li> and that blends very well.    </li>
            <li> The key is to apply lightly and avoid a heavyhanded application.</li>
            <li> It really did transform my face and made a difference.</li>
            <li> To me this is nothing more than a liquid pink highlighter or eye shadow.    </li>
            <li> and it really glows in pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It must be the real deal (hopefully).</li>
            <li> I really think you can use it for any occasion, but I tend to wear it in the colder months when my skin is a bit lackluster.</li>
            <li> It gives me a youthful glow without too much shimmer or shine.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Benefit High Beam!</li>
            <li> And frankly, it doesn&#x27;t illuminate as much as I would like (and I have a golden-medium skintone).</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a little bit of light/eye catching going on where I&#x27;ve used the high beam</li>
            <li> Quite honestly, I see very little difference in this product vs. my much cheaper eye shadow.  </li>
            <li> But the product actually goes on and wears nicely, so it&#x27;s just a minor flaw.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obviously a high quality product, but in terms of how it looks, I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference between highlighting my brow bones with a shimmery pinky eyeshadow (or silvery eyeshadow) and using this.</li>
            <li> It does have a lasting effect and can look nice in a photo from a distance but up close, eh, only the young.</li>
            <li> Before using it wash your face with an exfoliating cloth or use baking soda and a mild facial soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much foolproof to apply, as long as you keep in mind that you only need a tiny bit to get a nice, dewy glow.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it for people with dull skin, as it will make you look year younger and more rested.</li>
            <li> I bought both, high beam and moon beam</li>
            <li> I bought high beam about 3 months ago.</li>
            <li> I bought this with high expectations considering this is called \\&quot;Model in a Bottle\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> when I&#x27;ve used the High Beam.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of High Beam for years.</li>
            <li> High quality and lasts quite some time.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love my little bottle of high beam.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Negative - Wish the price was a little better.  </li>
            <li> The product High Beam that I purchased arrived in a sample size instead of the normal size.  </li>
            <li> The normal size in wt and ounces can be purchased at Sephora for $26.00.  </li>
            <li> maybe a little too much shine for me and it isn&#x27;t as smooth or blendable as I would like.</li>
            <li> I bought the second bottle only because I lost the first one somewhere after a year&#x27;s worth of use.  </li>
            <li> It is a light, liquid highlighter in a barely-there pink sparkle that looks natural on cheeks.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 41 years old and have normal skin.)  </li>
            <li> Este iluminador é ocque há de natural!</li>
            <li> Well, back to the product - used it, thought about it, sort of liked it, certainly never thought of sending it back.  </li>
            <li> Then apply your usual lotion and then just a few dabs of this on the apples of your cheeks and below brow and wow, amazing happens!</li>
            <li> Although this is not a highlighter that offers any coverage or evening of skin tones, it effortlessly creates that natural &amp;#34;dewey&amp;#34; and awake effect we are all struggling to find early in the morning.</li>
            <li> A lot of people don&#x27;t use highlighter because they think highlighting and contouring is a more advanced make-up trick, don&#x27;t be afraid.</li>
            <li> i only use it underneath and it doesn&#x27;t shine through as much as i would like.</li>
            <li> OLD comparing it to &#x27;sex in the city&#x27; ?   </li>
            <li> Listen gals, I&#x27;m old</li>
            <li> It is the classy way to do glitter without having any glitter.</li>
            <li> has been surprised that it worked so well with their skin tone as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is oily, so I work with powders trying to keep a matte finish, but this product offers a dewy, yet control finish that adds life and doesn&#x27;t look waxy or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> but it does a special little something to your look.</li>
            <li> I cleaned of the top which was caked with product and had a dark pink (lipstick-like) shade.</li>
            <li> -- if I apply it on my browbone, it tends to give my brown eyeshadow a red tint, but that could just be particular to me.</li>
            <li> I use Benefit High Beam with my Benetint, but only at night.</li>
            <li> I am a huge lover of Benefit&#x27;s similarly packaged lip stain, and finally decided to try High Beam a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Love the colour (pale pink shimmer).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several other brands of highlighter and primers intended to give you a glow, none of them look as natural as High Beam and the price for high beam</li>
            <li> I tried Benefit Watt&#x27;s Up prior to this one and prefer High Beam for several reasons.</li>
            <li> I had received a sample of high beam when i bought cosmetics at ulta, actually had it for quiet</li>
            <li> In general, I like benefit cosmetics.</li>
            <li> My eyes are a bit too close together, this works well and gives a natural brightness to the inner eye.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, when I use blush (either Nars Orgasm or Benefit&#x27;s cream blush), I use this above directly on my cheekbones.  </li>
            <li> When mixed with moisturizer, it makes my skin look so alive and blowy.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty universal color of pink and everyone that has borrowed or tried this</li>
            <li> I then just smudge the dots a little, you want to blend them in enough to remove the line but not so much you rub the high beam off.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having a less-is-more makeup day then just mix a little high beam in with your face lotion and you&#x27;ll get a very natural looking all over glow</li>
            <li> I put some on right above the apples of my cheeks all the way to my temple (just a little bit) and it makes my cheekbones pop.</li>
            <li> I use it on the dark circles under my eyes and various other places for some added light and shine.</li>
            <li> But I have really dry skin and have to blend it well if you want natural glow look</li>
            <li> I have used other expensive highlighter pens and high beam does a better job, lasts all day</li>
            <li> but if you use too much it can look a little greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it over my foundation because it doesn&#x27;t show much otherwise, and it can make things look a little streaky.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way and it really adds the brightening fnishing touch to make up!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy a lot of expensive designer makeup, but High Beam is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> If I am going out to a dark or dimly lit place, like a restaurant, bar, or night club, I would put this on.</li>
            <li> A tiny dot goes a long way - don&#x27;t overdue it</li>
            <li> It will last a long time.</li>
            <li> ends up being pharmacy brand level given how long a single bottle lasts even with daily use.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about High Beam.</li>
            <li> this is the only liquid I use in my makeup routine (foundation and all else are either mineral or pressed powder), and applying it reminds me how I don&#x27;t like the wet feeling of liquid makeup.</li>
            <li> However, it goes on kinda thick and can disappear if you rub your face too much as you&#x27;re putting it on.  </li>
            <li> I like to use this, along with a few other Benefit products for a very natural \\&quot;no makeup\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li> had this in my wish list on amazon for a very long time because I don&#x27;t spend a lot on cosmetics and this seemed just a bit too frivolous to me.</li>
            <li> It can be gloopy and I have to wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> I only purchased it because on a site I saw it as something to help with the undereye dark circles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this product is good, but it&#x27;s just not worth the money, as the effect is so subtle and there are other less expensive ways to get the same look.</li>
            <li> and it is only half finished.</li>
            <li> I use it on the inside half of my eyelids from nose to above my pupil.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only used half of the bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Positive - This little bottle will easily last me a year.  </li>
            <li> It added that little extra glow and radiance you see on the movie stars but can&#x27;t figure out how they do that.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other reviewer I use the high beam every day as it is very subtle and I am a pale,blue eyed blonde.</li>
            <li> but you have to have a \\&quot;need\\&quot; for it to buy it, definitely not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday to highlight my cheekbones and nose, and sometimes above the lips to give an illusion of fullness!</li>
            <li> I prefer a minimal makeup look, so I use this over concealer and get a refreshed look.</li>
            <li> The color is perfect...not too pink, not too peach.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be alarmed by the ballet shoes pink color, it blends effortlessly into the skin without looking glimmery or sparkly.</li>
            <li> After an unfortunate incident with Nars Albatros at work, I knew I needed something more subtle, pinker and dewey-er.</li>
            <li> Once all my standard makeup is on, I run a few dots down the center of my nose,</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It has a silvery shine, but the particles are too small to see with the naked eye, so you won&#x27;t look glittery.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the other reviewers, don&#x27;t bother ordering sunbeam or moonbeam.  </li>
            <li> I have had mine for two-years now and only a little bit is missing.</li>
            <li> and I was using it with very minimal makeup.</li>
            <li> It is a shine with a slight pink undertone.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s and this made my skin look so much younger.</li>
            <li> It is subtle enough that I wear it to work, but I also apply it for evenings out.  </li>
            <li> Gives a glamorous, dramatic yet blendable sheen like no other.</li>
            <li> I didnt pay attention to the size I purchased because I was shocked and pleasantly surprised to see how big the bottle was that I bought!</li>
            <li> I have been using it a for a few months on my cheek bones and brow bones.  </li>
            <li> have tried it going shopping during the day - haven&#x27;t checked out the kids yet - BUT believe it or not did receive a few complements to my amazement.  </li>
            <li> I hear about people applying this as a highlighter for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I found Watt&#x27;s Up to be heavy, a pain to blend, and it gave me acne like a 12 year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really too bad because I adore it otherwise.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can only leave a one star rating.</li>
            <li> a V shape around my eye and cheekbones and a small dot at the cupids bow on my lip.</li>
            <li> It may seem expensive, but one bottle of this lasts for a really long time.</li>
            <li> At least I try to \\&quot;create\\</li>
            <li> It has little, to no smell and its hard to get wrong.  </li>
            <li> I use it all over; as a cheek highlighter, an eyebrow shaper, on the nose, on my collarbones, and sometimes I combine it with my moisturizer for an all-over subtle shimmer.</li>
            <li> I do like that it isn&#x27;t glittery or shimmery; it applies subtle, natural-looking illumination.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can also be used for some subtle highlighting in your every day/work makeup.</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I opened the package and saw this tiny bottle.  </li>
            <li> My one criticism would be for the applicator, it&#x27;s a bit like an unruly nail polish wand, not great for faces or fingertips.</li>
            <li> Regardless, it&#x27;s a little annoying.</li>
            <li> I have tried it under and over foundation/powder because I thought I was using it wrong, but it looks like I didn&#x27;t put anything on.  </li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll look shiny scary.    </li>
            <li> Cumpre a proposta de deixar o rosto com uma cor de saudável, não dá um aspecto artificial e pode ser usado até mesmo de dia.</li>
            <li> I HATE glitter</li>
            <li> it makes them look really bad!</li>
            <li> THEY ARE FAKE Garbage!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I dont see how anyone could not like this product. even though it seemed pricey i thought id try it. i love trying all kinds of make up ive been wearing make up since i could walk. i love this product. a little goes a long way and it really adds the brightening fnishing touch to make up! makes my face looks flawless and glowy without glitter.stays on all day. i like to put it over my cover up on my whole face.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well to create that iridescent, fresh-faced look.  However, it goes on kinda thick and can disappear if you rub your face too much as you&#x27;re putting it on.  Also, a bit pricey, I think.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other reviewer I use the high beam every day as it is very subtle and I am a pale,blue eyed blonde. It is not glittery or shimmery at all. What it does do is give you a beautiful youthful glow, just like when you were a child out playing on a spring day. It is part highlighter too. I have used other expensive highlighter pens and high beam does a better job, lasts all day ( I have oily skin )and is very economical. I have had my bottle for a year now and it is only half finished. I really do think that the makeup artist for the Sex and the City series used this on SJP&#x27;s cheeks to give them that fab glow she was famous for. I am over 40 and this product takes off the years honey ! Buy it ,you&#x27;ll love it.    FYI....Benefit&#x27;s Moon Beam has a golden glow to it and is better for darker complexions or night time use.</li>
            <li> best product to add a little glow under eyes and cheeks. I use it daily! love it!</li>
            <li> I bought both, high beam and moon beam and i love them equally. Love the consistency; it&#x27;s soo easy to apply (as is moon beam), just use your fingers. Love the colour (pale pink shimmer). It&#x27;s better used at night if your skin colour is medium. It gives you a nice glow that shows in pictures. I recommend it 100%.</li>
            <li> I bought high beam about 3 months ago. I absolutely love it. You can wear it day or night. It gives you a subtle glow that makes your skin look great. Just one thing you cannot over do it.... I wear it in the corners of my outer eye and on my cheek bone. I blend with my finger because if you don&#x27;t it will looked stained. There is no wrong way or right wear to wear it. All of us have different tastes in make up and how we apply it so all I can say is it is a must have in your make up kit!</li>
            <li> This product has made it&#x27;s way into my daily beauty routine. A great way to appear more awake in the morning and freshen up at night. I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> I bought this with high expectations considering this is called \\&quot;Model in a Bottle\\&quot;.  I have been using it a for a few months on my cheek bones and brow bones.  I notice no difference on my cheek bones- I have tried it under and over foundation/powder because I thought I was using it wrong, but it looks like I didn&#x27;t put anything on.  However, it is nice to use on my brow bones as a highlighter.  Maybe because the skin is thinner there?</li>
            <li> This product is really wonderful. I was looking for a highlighter to get the dewy, brightened look especially in the winters. I am fair and this product gives me the glowy look. It is a shine with a slight pink undertone. I would highly recommend it. One concern that I have with the product is that I noticed that it does not blend that well sometimes, but overall, it&#x27;s great. Several people have commented on how my skin looks really healthy after I started using this.</li>
            <li> This benefit highlighter is a wonderful product!place just above the cheekbone , on top of the outside of each eyebrow...or down the middle of the nose for a slimmer look-  I look younger,fresh,and my skin has a lovely , dewey, healthy glow!</li>
            <li> ...but it just didn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s not a bad product, it&#x27;s just that with all the hype I guess I was expecting a miracle ;)  I saw a celebrity make up artist use a highlighter product on a television show.  She suggested using a light eye shadow if you didn&#x27;t have an actual highlighter.  So, I started using my Cover Girl eye shadow (French vanilla - #700).  I liked the effect, so I decided to look into a \\&quot;real\\&quot; highlighting product and every review I read pointed me to this - Benefit&#x27;s High Beam.  Quite honestly, I see very little difference in this product vs. my much cheaper eye shadow.  However, by mid-afternoon, my face looks too shiny (more than just a glow!) when I&#x27;ve used the High Beam.  It&#x27;s that reason I like the eye shadow - the powder doesn&#x27;t do that.  (I&#x27;m 41 years old and have normal skin.)  I&#x27;d say this product is good, but it&#x27;s just not worth the money, as the effect is so subtle and there are other less expensive ways to get the same look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good highlighter. But I have really dry skin and have to blend it well if you want natural glow look</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this product before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy to find it on Amazon at a lower price than Sephora. This adds a nice glow to my skin without being greasy or gloppy.</li>
            <li> This makes your skin look lovely and bright. I strongly recommend it for people with dull skin, as it will make you look year younger and more rested. I use it all over; as a cheek highlighter, an eyebrow shaper, on the nose, on my collarbones, and sometimes I combine it with my moisturizer for an all-over subtle shimmer. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> i love this product if i didn&#x27;t have to wear powder foundation on top, but since i do, wearing this on top of it cakes my foundation and leaves streaks.  i only use it underneath and it doesn&#x27;t shine through as much as i would like.</li>
            <li> THEY RAVE AT 40 YRS. OLD comparing it to &#x27;sex in the city&#x27; ?   Well, sex in my life is over, however I am extremely attractive according to the mailman, bartenders, church priest, family members, and my dogs.  I search the internet for products that keep me up-to-date and make me feel good about myself, also look the most attractive I can for my age.  Not exactly older than dirt but close in my age, lets select a number over a healthy 65 plus.  Heard that women preach about over 40 yrs. (like to be that again), so I plundged into the sea of cosmetics and purchased it.  I see what the over 50ish appear like, see the photographs of models, and check out QVC&#x27;s chatter box on their site, very interesting.  Well, back to the product - used it, thought about it, sort of liked it, certainly never thought of sending it back.  Use it every once in awhile going to Mass.  have tried it going shopping during the day - haven&#x27;t checked out the kids yet - BUT believe it or not did receive a few complements to my amazement.  Listen gals, I&#x27;m old so I don&#x27;t say go get it.  I say if you can afford it - give it a(s h o t) - giggling to self.</li>
            <li> In general, I like benefit cosmetics. They seem unique and special, and I love the names. However, I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about High Beam. It doesn&#x27;t do much (esp for the price!) and...well, let&#x27;s just say there&#x27;s a fine line between \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; and \\&quot;shiny\\&quot;. I have very fair skin, so maybe this just looks better on people with a tan.</li>
            <li> I like to use this, along with a few other Benefit products for a very natural \\&quot;no makeup\\&quot; look. The only thing is, it&#x27;s a bit goopy and the brush and the neck of the bottle get a bit glumpy at times. But the product actually goes on and wears nicely, so it&#x27;s just a minor flaw. Great product and company.</li>
            <li> Love this. Perfect high lighter.</li>
            <li> This is one of their most versatile products.  It&#x27;s a highligher that doesn&#x27;t have too much shimmer and that blends very well.    I use it on the inside half of my eyelids from nose to above my pupil.  It blends with my eyeshadow but opens my eyes up, making them look more alert and awake.  My eyes are a bit too close together, this works well and gives a natural brightness to the inner eye.  Much better than a shadow for that.    Additionally, when I use blush (either Nars Orgasm or Benefit&#x27;s cream blush), I use this above directly on my cheekbones.  With the blush below it creates a contour that looks good.  I&#x27;ve also used it on top of lipstick on my bottom lip for brightness.  And it lasts FOREVER.</li>
            <li> This product diffuses and reflects light. Used sparingly on the browbones, apples of the cheeks, or (my favorite) around lips, high beam will soften and brighten. The product is easy to apply. The key is to apply lightly and avoid a heavyhanded application. A fun product to play and experiment with.</li>
            <li> The product High Beam that I purchased arrived in a sample size instead of the normal size.  I was shocked when I opened the package and saw this tiny bottle.  It also says on the box \\&quot;not for resale.\\&quot;  I paid $35.00 plus some change for this and I am returning it to Amazon.  It is not Amazon&#x27;s fault that the product was received by them to sell for this seller.  I just want to warn anyone ordering this product to beware. I do not like being ripped off and this is a very good example.  The normal size in wt and ounces can be purchased at Sephora for $26.00.  Please make sure the right weight is shown or in the description. Unfortunately, I can only leave a one star rating.</li>
            <li> I use Benefit High Beam with my Benetint, but only at night. It gives my cheeks a nice creamy gleam and works well with the blush color of Benetint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not and would not use this at my job or during the day. It is the classy way to do glitter without having any glitter. I HATE glitter and I do not feel like it should be on any one&#x27;s face, unless you are 8 and in a tap recital. If I am going out to a dark or dimly lit place, like a restaurant, bar, or night club, I would put this on. It highlights my face very nicely and the color compliments my complexion and is very flattering. This is a pretty universal color of pink and everyone that has borrowed or tried this has been surprised that it worked so well with their skin tone as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a product that I would just pick-up and buy. When I was at Sephora, one of the employees showed me how it worked and I was hooked. It really did transform my face and made a difference. I put it on my cheeks, under my brow-bone, on my chin, and sometimes on my nose - depending on the occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a winner but you have to have a \\&quot;need\\&quot; for it to buy it, definitely not for everyday use. I have had mine for two-years now and only a little bit is missing.</li>
            <li> This is a very natural looking, pinkish highlighter that goes well with my cool skintone.  I use this everyday to highlight my cheekbones and nose, and sometimes above the lips to give an illusion of fullness!</li>
            <li> I dot a miniscule amount under brows, bow of lips, and cheekbones.    At least I try to \\&quot;create\\&quot; the sculpted cheekbones I don&#x27;t have!  A tiny dot goes a long way - don&#x27;t overdue it or you&#x27;ll look shiny scary.    It may not look like you have a lot on, but it will catch the light.</li>
            <li> Its ok.  .  I use it off and on.  It gives a good glow under the eyes and for the cheeks but if you use too much it can look a little greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive - This little bottle will easily last me a year.  A little goes a long way.  Nice pinkish glow.  Good for those days when you&#x27;ve stayed out too late the night before :)  The product does what its supposed to, just know how to apply it.  Light dots on cheekbones, around the outer eye &amp; one or two dots at the end of the nose.  Blend with finger, not brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative - Wish the price was a little better.  Too pricey for what it does.</li>
            <li> First of all DON\\&quot;T BUY THESE PRODUCTS ON EBAY THEY ARE FAKE Garbage!!! Buy your Benefit here on Amazon from Benefit only!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had this in my wish list on amazon for a very long time because I don&#x27;t spend a lot on cosmetics and this seemed just a bit too frivolous to me. I finally jumped off the fence and went ahead and ordered it. This product is simply amazing! It added that little extra glow and radiance you see on the movie stars but can&#x27;t figure out how they do that. This is it! I am in my late 40&#x27;s and this made my skin look so much younger. Before using it wash your face with an exfoliating cloth or use baking soda and a mild facial soap. Then apply your usual lotion and then just a few dabs of this on the apples of your cheeks and below brow and wow, amazing happens! I had three people tell me how nice my skin was the first day I wore it including a man! Get it you will be amazed how great you look with this product. The lip tint is just as great too, really all the makeup you need in two little bottles and a good mascara your good to go. Please don&#x27;t even go to Ebay you will waste your money, buy the real products from Benefit through Amazon.</li>
            <li> To me this is nothing more than a liquid pink highlighter or eye shadow.    Much too light for me and too much shimmer.  I can see how it would be nice for someone young with flawless to near flawless skin to mix into thier makeup for a healthy shimmery effect.  Not for more mature ladies. It does have a lasting effect and can look nice in a photo from a distance but up close, eh, only the young. It will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes me feel like I have kick ass skin. Beautiful glow it gives.</li>
            <li> Great product.  As a makeup artist, I enjoy using this all over the face, it gives a natural shine to the skin, giving it more of a dewy finish than shimmery or glittery like a lot of other highlighters.  It&#x27;s really a phenomenal product.  I even enjoy mixing into my concealers, to give them a highlighting effect, reflecting flaws and brightening skin.  You can literally put it anywhere and mix it with anything! Versatile and lovely!</li>
            <li> I am a huge lover of Benefit&#x27;s similarly packaged lip stain, and finally decided to try High Beam a few months ago. It&#x27;s a great addition to anyone&#x27;s makeup arsenal, whether you&#x27;re a makeup addict, or more of a minimalist like me. I don&#x27;t buy a lot of expensive designer makeup, but High Beam is well worth the money. It&#x27;s pretty much foolproof to apply, as long as you keep in mind that you only need a tiny bit to get a nice, dewy glow. It has a silvery shine, but the particles are too small to see with the naked eye, so you won&#x27;t look glittery. I use it on my cheekbones and a tiny bit under my eyes, and it make me look more awake for my early-morning classes. Make sure to order directly from Amazon so you don&#x27;t get a counterfeit. The one I received was genuine.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product, and I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  My skin is oily, so I work with powders trying to keep a matte finish, but this product offers a dewy, yet control finish that adds life and doesn&#x27;t look waxy or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.  It doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.  It has little, to no smell and its hard to get wrong.  I apply this as eye shadow a facial highlighter etc., and it seems to work where ever I put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is brighter and more iridescent than the Sun Beam.</li>
            <li> Great product. Authentic as well in case some are worried about counterfeit products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of High Beam for years. I love the dewy look that it gives and it gives me a hint of color on my light/pale toned skin. I prefer a minimal makeup look, so I use this over concealer and get a refreshed look.</li>
            <li> I hear about people applying this as a highlighter for everyday wear. Maybe i&#x27;m just a simply gal with my makeup, but when I did this it looked way too shiny. This could be because most people seem to use this over a full face of makeup and I was using it with very minimal makeup. I also discovered that if you have puffy eyes, don&#x27;t apply to puffy areas. it makes them look really bad! Now to the good part. For evenings out this product is excellent. When mixed with moisturizer, it makes my skin look so alive and blowy. I highly recommend this product, but for an easy to use, everyday-wear glow that can be applied alone I suggest Benefit&#x27;s Girl Meets Pearl instead.</li>
            <li> This product caused me to have breakouts when I applied it daily. I&#x27;ve been blessed with great skin, but this product is a pore clogger. It&#x27;s really too bad because I adore it otherwise.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. As all of the products on Amazon you don&#x27;t really know if you get the real deal but real or not, this highlighter is by far my favorite right now. I tap it on my cheekbones and nose and it really glows in pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I just saw that the seller is Benefit Cosmetics... It must be the real deal (hopefully).</li>
            <li> I use High Beam on my cheeks at the very end of applying my makeup I get a perfect glow.</li>
            <li> Has always been favorite highlighter. Gives a glamorous, dramatic yet blendable sheen like no other. Quality product. Smooth delivery.</li>
            <li> Like almost all of Benefit&#x27;s product, this stuff is truly amazing. I have fair skin that tends to look rather dull. I had always wanted a nice, healthy glow, but it seemed to me that most of the products that were formulated for that purpose were either bronzers or just too glittery. I didn&#x27;t want bronze skin, nor did I want to look like I came out of a time machine from the nineties. High Beam is perfect. It really illuminated my face and made my skin look so beautiful. It&#x27;s neither glittery or shimmery; it just glows! I really think you can use it for any occasion, but I tend to wear it in the colder months when my skin is a bit lackluster. It may seem expensive, but one bottle of this lasts for a really long time. I&#x27;ve have mine for just over a year and I&#x27;ve only used half of the bottle. It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product is ok..maybe a little too much shine for me and it isn&#x27;t as smooth or blendable as I would like.</li>
            <li> Like almost all Benefit products, this is fantastic.  I love the sheen it gives my cheeks, it brightens up your whole face. I recommend it highly! :)</li>
            <li> This performs exactly as described.  It is a light, liquid highlighter in a barely-there pink sparkle that looks natural on cheeks.  But do not make the mistake of trying to use it as an undereye cover-up!  It just collects in the creases under your eyes, and the sparkles draw attention to what you are trying to conceal.  Other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I use it on the dark circles under my eyes and various other places for some added light and shine. I just think mine was used. I cleaned of the top which was caked with product and had a dark pink (lipstick-like) shade. I am trying not to believe that amazon would send me a returned used make up product. YUK! It is a great item to have though.</li>
            <li> High quality and lasts quite some time.  I buy this about every six months and am always pleased.</li>
            <li> I am trying highlighters now. And this is my first, I&#x27;m loving it. First, let me tell you, my skin color is kinda like light coffee, and this show up really really nice and pretty. I loved the fact that it&#x27;s not glittery or shimmery. It&#x27;s just give you that dewy/glowy finish. My skin is combo and this last for many hours, considering that I live in tropical island, at the end of the day I have a faded glowy finish on my cheekbones. Try it with your fingers, if not then, try it with an Angle Foundation Brush. It does not break me out or make my skin oilier. That promised dewy skin finish is seriously delivered, very satisfied customer here!</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of this product for years. I bought the second bottle only because I lost the first one somewhere after a year&#x27;s worth of use.  Even after that long, most of the bottle was still unused.</li>
            <li> I tried Benefit Watt&#x27;s Up prior to this one and prefer High Beam for several reasons. I found Watt&#x27;s Up to be heavy, a pain to blend, and it gave me acne like a 12 year old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast, High Beam is light, easily blendable, and gives a nice, pretty glow. I use it on my cheekbones, the upper ridge of my nose, and on my browbone. I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments on how &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; I look since I started using it. I have a very fair complexion and this looks great blended in with my other makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely keep this as a staple!</li>
            <li> I have a very fair complexion, but High Beam always looks great.  I dab a bit on my cheeks and then blend it in with my finger.  It gives me a youthful glow without too much shimmer or shine.  It is subtle enough that I wear it to work, but I also apply it for evenings out.  The color is perfect...not too pink, not too peach.  It also lasts forever - I bought my bottle over a year ago, wear it almost daily, and I still have 1/4 of the bottle left!  I feel that it is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure its a good product its just way too light (color wise) for me.</li>
            <li> Pretty good highlighter for cheeks. Smooth consistency. Brush is only good to get stuff out of bottle; otherwise, just use my fingers to apply it. Thanks</li>
            <li> THe product arrived way sooner than the tracking info implied it would, which was a nice surprise.  I have been using highbeam for highlighting for awhile now so I already knew that I loved it.  I didnt pay attention to the size I purchased because I was shocked and pleasantly surprised to see how big the bottle was that I bought!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love my little bottle of high beam. After an unfortunate incident with Nars Albatros at work, I knew I needed something more subtle, pinker and dewey-er. This product by benefit fit the bill perfectly. It is really sheer. Looks great on foreheads, cheeks, eyes, chins....its lovely. I mix mine with foundation sometimes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the benefit of this product at all. I only purchased it because on a site I saw it as something to help with the undereye dark circles.</li>
            <li> our daughter loves this!!</li>
            <li> Ever wonder how those Hollywood starlets get that luminescent glow? I always did and I found out - this is it! Benefit High Beam! It is so easy and it does the job perfectly. You just place little dots of this magic potion on your brow and cheeks, rub it in and tada! You gleam like a youthful starlet! You just look healthy and fresh and wonderful. I love it! I don&#x27;t think I will ever do without it again. I very highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like the packaging on this and it looks pretty in my bathroom. I like applying it because it has a nice silky smooth texture. It&#x27;s obviously a high quality product, but in terms of how it looks, I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference between highlighting my brow bones with a shimmery pinky eyeshadow (or silvery eyeshadow) and using this.</li>
            <li> This is great. I used it on our wedding recently and everyone said I was glowing.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t mind-blowing, and I probably won&#x27;t buy it again. I do like that it isn&#x27;t glittery or shimmery; it applies subtle, natural-looking illumination. It isn&#x27;t my favorite highlighter, though --  this is the only liquid I use in my makeup routine (foundation and all else are either mineral or pressed powder), and applying it reminds me how I don&#x27;t like the wet feeling of liquid makeup. It can be gloopy and I have to wait for it to dry. I use it over my foundation because it doesn&#x27;t show much otherwise, and it can make things look a little streaky. And frankly, it doesn&#x27;t illuminate as much as I would like (and I have a golden-medium skintone). I&#x27;ll be looking for a different highlighter when this runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also -- if I apply it on my browbone, it tends to give my brown eyeshadow a red tint, but that could just be particular to me. Regardless, it&#x27;s a little annoying.</li>
            <li> High Beam works just right to get a bit of glow going without looking sparkly when the sun hits your face. If you&#x27;re having a less-is-more makeup day then just mix a little high beam in with your face lotion and you&#x27;ll get a very natural looking all over glow; you know the one you&#x27;re supposed to be able to get by eating salmon every day like Jennifer Lopez...because we all love salmon so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can also be used for some subtle highlighting in your every day/work makeup. Once all my standard makeup is on, I run a few dots down the center of my nose, a V shape around my eye and cheekbones and a small dot at the cupids bow on my lip. I then just smudge the dots a little, you want to blend them in enough to remove the line but not so much you rub the high beam off. Voila there&#x27;s a little bit of light/eye catching going on where I&#x27;ve used the high beam and I don&#x27;t look like I ran into the glitter corner of the arts and crafts store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several other brands of highlighter and primers intended to give you a glow, none of them look as natural as High Beam and the price for high beam ends up being pharmacy brand level given how long a single bottle lasts even with daily use. Comparable products that did not hold up as well when I&#x27;ve tried them: Dior shimmer star (rose), Bobby Brown shimmer brick, Tarina Tarintino pearl glow, Benefit that girl, Benefit watts up.</li>
            <li> Well done Benefit. This has just the right amount of shine to be a highlighter without overdoing it. Although this is not a highlighter that offers any coverage or evening of skin tones, it effortlessly creates that natural &amp;#34;dewey&amp;#34; and awake effect we are all struggling to find early in the morning. Don&#x27;t be alarmed by the ballet shoes pink color, it blends effortlessly into the skin without looking glimmery or sparkly. I&#x27;m convinced you can wear this in the winter or summer. As far as the texture, it feels very lightweight and smooth, not sticky nor oily. My one criticism would be for the applicator, it&#x27;s a bit like an unruly nail polish wand, not great for faces or fingertips. Excellent staple for your makeup bag!</li>
            <li> This is a great hi-lighter for your cheekbones. I don&#x27;t use a lot of make-up but this always makes me looks refreshed. Well worth the money. I have never used anything that compares to this.</li>
            <li> This product lasts all day and leaves a nice rosey tone. It also looks very nice. I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I had received a sample of high beam when i bought cosmetics at ulta, actually had it for quiet a while before trying it. I love it, gives my face a nice healthy glow . I would recommend it to anyone, although i first thought it was a little pricey, its worth it !!!</li>
            <li> I love this under my makeup. Gives me a glow without being too shiny</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use and gives you a really lovely effect. This is my new favorite beauty product!</li>
            <li> Beauty in a jar, with brush amazing.</li>
            <li> Most people consider things like mascara and lip gloss beauty staples; this needs to be added to the list! I put some on right above the apples of my cheeks all the way to my temple (just a little bit) and it makes my cheekbones pop. A lot of people don&#x27;t use highlighter because they think highlighting and contouring is a more advanced make-up trick, don&#x27;t be afraid. I swear. There are a ton of youtube videos on how to properly use highlighter and you can do it in a way that is very subtle but really creates a beautiful effect on your face. I promise you that this is a simple product to use but it does a special little something to your look.</li>
            <li> Este iluminador é ocque há de natural! Cumpre a proposta de deixar o rosto com uma cor de saudável, não dá um aspecto artificial e pode ser usado até mesmo de dia. Adorei!</li>
            <li> I have medium skin tone, perfect neutral, and I ordered this shade.  Don&#x27;t believe the other reviewers, don&#x27;t bother ordering sunbeam or moonbeam.  This is what you want.</li>
