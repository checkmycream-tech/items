            <li>I apsolutely love my chair.</li>
            <li>The chair came earlier then expexted which was great and very easy to assembly.</li>
            <li>Easy esembly sturdy &amp; durable product, Swivel with raise &amp; lower pedal for easy seat adjustmenr.</li>
            <li>The insucrtions were easy to follow.</li>
            <li>Yes, there is a strong odor to the fabric</li>
            <li>It was very easy to assemble, we did not have any issues with the hydraulics, they worked right away.</li>
            <li>happy with my chair, came fast easy to assemble and very comfortable&lt;br /&gt;came</li>
            <li>Very pretty cranberry color too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a at-home barber and needed a comfortable chair for my clients....</li>
            <li>Good thing all that was needed was the seat because old one was broke.</li>
            <li>fast easy to assemble and very comfortable</li>
            <li>And against that criteria... an easy 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;It is comfortable to sit in, it is pretty rugged, and it actually looks good in person.  </li>
            <li>But I bought it for what it is... a relatively simple salon chair that is functional and looks good.  </li>
            <li>overall good.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast, I received the chair in 3 business days, not bad!</li>
            <li>Other than that it works great for my needs.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price</li>
            <li>The chair is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>: the NEW rubber on the chair dose have a strong smell but smell eventually gos away</li>
            <li>But the chair is comfy, had my 1st service using the new chair last night and my guest loved it.</li>
            <li>thick padding makes their experience with me more comfortable and relaxing!!</li>
            <li>Okay... some might say that this doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles as a traditional barber&#x27;s chair, and they are right.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention the color and style are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It got to me in exactly 5 days.</li>
            <li>The only thing that really didn&#x27;t like is the smell of the plastic that is strong and is been one mount and still smells.</li>
            <li>Easy to assemble following the picture instructions and light enough to move around your house if needed...</li>
            <li>Rating the whole experience from the time I place my order till now 3.5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>and they need not be moving to much.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>really recommend the chair.</li>
            <li>this chair really fits the bill...</li>
            <li>The step to put up the chair, you have to pump more than other chairs I have used before.</li>
            <li>And the leather is really nice and will last long.</li>
            <li>It actually creates a bit of a vacuum / suction to the floor when you place it and sit in it, giving it a very very solid feel when using it (GREAT!), and when you go to lift it, at first, until you break the suction, it makes it feel heavy.  </li>
            <li>For me it would have been so much more trouble to send it in again.</li>
            <li>There was a slighr odor (that new smell)</li>
            <li>I have contacted this seller and asked for a new hydraulic system</li>
            <li>nothing overpowering that required it to be aired out.</li>
            <li>Had to use the pump off old chair.</li>
            <li>In the description, it said that it was comfortable, seat has very little cushion.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s barely noticeable because I had to have someone point it out to me.</li>
            <li>I assumed that because it was a big item that I would get the chair at least 10 days or so, but it came very quickly.</li>
            <li>The other point I&#x27;d make is that you really don&#x27;t have to move it...</li>
            <li>when you first get it, I let it air out in the garage for a few days before assembling.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> very sad I didn&#x27;t like it , it did not work well</li>
            <li> I recently got my cosmetology license and plan on only doing hair for family and friends and this chair was just what I needed. Yes, there is a strong odor to the fabric when you first get it, I let it air out in the garage for a few days before assembling. Shipping was very fast, I received the chair in 3 business days, not bad! My only annoyance for not giving 5 stars is that just hours (like 4) after ordering my chair, the price dropped from $93 to $79. That&#x27;s just weird. But the chair is comfy, had my 1st service using the new chair last night and my guest loved it. Easy to assemble following the picture instructions and light enough to move around your house if needed...it&#x27;s a great chair!</li>
            <li> Easy esembly sturdy &amp; durable product, Swivel with raise &amp; lower pedal for easy seat adjustmenr. It is worth the price</li>
            <li> Rating the chair ONLY I had to give it 5 stars. Rating the whole experience from the time I place my order till now 3.5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Speedy delivery, I ordered on a Wednesday it shipped on thur and I got my chair on Friday.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The instructions are terrible. absolutely no words only pictures, you kinda gotta guess where everything gos&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Once you&#x27;ve finally got the chair together it works just like expected (after it is assembled CORRECTLY)&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the NEW rubber on the chair dose have a strong smell but smell eventually gos away&lt;br /&gt;Pros: $57 great price Cons $52 shipping handling&lt;br /&gt;Overall $119 well spent.</li>
            <li> As a stylist for 11 years I would like to think I know a little about salon equipment. I am very pleased with this chair. I had it put together in 20 min. My clients are comfy and that matters most to me. Not to mention the color and style are exactly what I was looking for. The chair is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> In the description, it said that it was comfortable, seat has very little cushion.  It looks just like the picture. The step to put up the chair, you have to pump more than other chairs I have used before. Other than that, it does the job.</li>
            <li> The only thing that really didn&#x27;t like is the smell of the plastic that is strong and is been one mount and still smells. Everything else is excellent for the price. I used it 2 times per week .</li>
            <li> I have bought three of these and they all broke or were broken in the first year.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this chair. I am so displeased with this purchase. The pieces of the chair don&#x27;t line up correctly. The main piece that attaches the chair to the base is so crooked that the chair itself is crooked. It would be impossible for me to cut someones hair in this chair. I feel like a threw away $100. I have tried to fix it and finally realized there is no way to fix it because the manufactured piece is completely uneven. Such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I recieved the item as scheduled. It was very easy to assemble, we did not have any issues with the hydraulics, they worked right away. Also, some reviews mentioned the smell of the fabric. There was a slighr odor (that new smell) nothing overpowering that required it to be aired out. Over all very satisfied. I believe the weight limits are more like 250 lbs. and they need not be moving to much. Perfect for our need.</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist and I wanted a chair for my house to cut my family&#x27;s hair. This chair has a really good hydrolics on it. And the leather is really nice and will last long. Shipping was fast. However I had a slight hole as if someone poked it with a pen it&#x27;s barely noticeable because I had to have someone point it out to me. For me it would have been so much more trouble to send it in again. Or else I would have given the chair a 5 star rating. Other than that it works great for my needs.</li>
            <li> The chair came earlier then expexted which was great and very easy to assembly. The insucrtions were easy to follow.</li>
            <li> Received the chair and the pump did not work.  Had to use the pump off old chair. Waste of money!! Good thing all that was needed was the seat because old one was broke. Basically paid all this money for the seat. What a joke!</li>
            <li> I broke a pervious salon chair so I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for a replacement. This chair was inexpensive and stylish. My clients love it!</li>
            <li> It was a great deal when I brought those chair. I was please with my order.</li>
            <li> Okay... some might say that this doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles as a traditional barber&#x27;s chair, and they are right.  But I bought it for what it is... a relatively simple salon chair that is functional and looks good.  And against that criteria... an easy 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;It is comfortable to sit in, it is pretty rugged, and it actually looks good in person.  It will definitely last us for our lifetime of use.  I think some may have complained about the rubber ring coming off the base, but ours hasn&#x27;t, and I think it is an easy reason why... don&#x27;t drag it across the floor!  It actually creates a bit of a vacuum / suction to the floor when you place it and sit in it, giving it a very very solid feel when using it (GREAT!), and when you go to lift it, at first, until you break the suction, it makes it feel heavy.  I might guess that would make some people try to drag it, but actually the chair isn&#x27;t that heavy, so I have no problem lifting it to move it.  The other point I&#x27;d make is that you really don&#x27;t have to move it... i just did to find the best spot for it, but once in place, no need to move it again.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend the chair.</li>
            <li> The rubber around the stand of the chair is not holding and the dorsal side is shaking after a while.</li>
            <li> Perfect color! My clients love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a at-home barber and needed a comfortable chair for my clients....this chair really fits the bill...thick padding makes their experience with me more comfortable and relaxing!!</li>
            <li> I received the chair on time and was very pleased with the assembly and what was required of me in completion of the assembly.  Not much to do but put the chair on its base and ad the foot bar. very easy. I am another satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> plastic cylinder cover arrived broken also upon completion of building this chair, I notice the hydraulic system operates upside down, which will not work for me, I cannot bend over and pull up on the foot pedal every time I want the chair to go up or down. I have contacted this seller and asked for a new hydraulic system</li>
            <li> The company was very nice. I e mailed them to ask if the color was brown or burgundy. They responded immediately. I changed my order at that time to black. They had no problem and the chair came quick and correct!@ yay!!</li>
            <li> I apsolutely love my chair. It got to me in exactly 5 days. I assumed that because it was a big item that I would get the chair at least 10 days or so, but it came very quickly. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My daughter is very happy with her salon chair being a new hair stylist. The only problem with it is during assembly the chair won&#x27;t go all the way down on the pedestal. It still won&#x27;t. Hopefully won&#x27;t present future problem. Very pretty cranberry color too! Comfy!!</li>
            <li> happy with my chair, came fast easy to assemble and very comfortable&lt;br /&gt;came fast easy to assemble and very comfortable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend</li>
            <li> Had a little problem getting chair to pump up and down, but after contacting the seller and trying a few other things, chair works well..Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> ALLL good... the only thing that is a hassle is that the while the person is sitting on it,  the pump to either bring up or down the chair cannot be used. Otherwise- overall good.</li>
