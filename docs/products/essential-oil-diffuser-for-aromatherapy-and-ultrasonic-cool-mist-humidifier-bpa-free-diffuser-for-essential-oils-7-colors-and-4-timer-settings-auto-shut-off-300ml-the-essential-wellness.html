            <li>Its a great size and super easy to clean!  </li>
            <li>So far, a very good product.</li>
            <li>Love this diffuser and service provided by the seller, who went out of their way to contact me before and after shipment.  </li>
            <li>Love the lights that I often turn on at night for ambience.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are three things about it that  might be improved upon but I&#x27;m not even sure if they are possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This diffuser was reviewed much better.</li>
            <li>But it seems to me that the NOW model kicks out a stronger stream of mist that may do a better job of coverage.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love being able to time the lights and the diffuser.</li>
            <li>but I love that it allows you 4 cycle options.</li>
            <li>but I have made sure that is not the problem.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this diffuser.</li>
            <li>and I love the lights</li>
            <li>Since I just received it; I have only used it a couple of times, but I am really impressed with it.  </li>

            <li>love the time length of it and the out</li>

            <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this diffuser every day for over a week and absolutely LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>and maybe a couple more for some of the bedrooms.</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser as you can choose the amount of time you want it to run or let it run until it automatically shuts off.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Love it is working well thumbs up</li>

            <li>I love the time settings, 60/180/360 mins.</li>
            <li>Overall a very happy customer!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a diffuser with a capacity to hold more than 100ml of water.</li>
            <li>thought I found the perfect item in the Essential Wellness diffuser.  </li>
            <li>After about 100ml of usage, the scent runs out and you&#x27;ll have to put in more drops of oil.  </li>
            <li>I love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Love the lights and the ease of use.  </li>
            <li>Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>Works well and love the color options.</li>
            <li>I fell in love as soon as I turned it on.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact that is runs for a prolonged period.  </li>
            <li>Pleased with the diffuser and vender.</li>
            <li>I love the relaxing  sound of the water trickling!</li>
            <li>Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>This is a great diffuser at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this unit and indeed it was excellent while it worked, but any item that will not turn on after 5 days is a red flag for me.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying it now.  </li>
            <li>It is quiet and the colors you can use are great!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>However I would say is the top can stick to the bottom and cause water to splash out.</li>
            <li>Love the color changing lights &amp; ability to set timer.</li>
            <li>My home smells lovely</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Very affordable and great value for the price.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I went with this diffuser.</li>
            <li>The light function is nice, although we don&#x27;t use it when we are sleeping.  </li>
            <li>I bought 2 of these and absolutely LOVE them.</li>
            <li>Love this diffuser .</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Absolutely awesome...works great...</li>
            <li>I have mostly been using lavender oil for sleep and relaxation.</li>
            <li>I have to say that between the diffuser and the oil, I believe I&#x27;m sleeping better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>The Grand children love the color changing part.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It is very quiet, and throws the scent beautifully!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very quiet and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love the capacity of this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>In the questions some ask about the ionizer and people have responded regarding the mist output (showing that most people probably don&#x27;t even know what the ionizer is).</li>
            <li>and I would suggest you look up what ionizers are before getting this unit to be sure it&#x27;s something you want in your home.</li>
            <li>The Essential Wellness 300 ml Diffuser was the perfect choice for me.</li>
            <li>If every business was run like that the world would be a better place.</li>

            <li>Love this unit.</li>

            <li>, it is light smelling, not over powering.</li>
            <li>The light adds a fun feature, changing or to one of the many color options (bright or a dim) or OFF.</li>

            <li>The light show accompanying the diffuser is just as relaxing and therapeutic.</li>
            <li>I would also like to thank Essential Wellness for the great service - when Amazon was reading out-of-stock-  </li>
            <li>oh the light with the changing color thing..</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>and it was packaged securely.</li>

            <li>It is so easy to fill, add oils, and clean.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times with excellent results.</li>
            <li>I started off my diffuser use with a 100ml sized one and realized it has to be filled too often.</li>
            <li>like how you can turn off the light if needed.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the purchase of my Essential Wellness 300 ml Oil Diffuser.</li>
            <li>But overall a great product.</li>
            <li>So at this rate I can use it all the time which makes the oils very cost effective.</li>
            <li>I filled it up and it diffused for about 8 hours.  </li>
            <li>It is light weight.  </li>
            <li>I  like the fact that this diffuser can be used as an air purifier, ionizer, and humidifier as well as a night light.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used the light yet</li>
            <li>Item is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the type to wear a sleep mask to block out all light.</li>
            <li>They really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>My apartment smells fresh and fantastic!</li>
            <li>Including the &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; light option.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice, but I have to admit, I don&#x27;t use the light so much since this one is in the bedroom.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>It was a good price and love all the different color choices.</li>

            <li>This Product is awesome, I have as of today order a total of four (4), I gave one to my daughter who live in NY</li>
            <li>Love the larger capacity, works great in our large den.  </li>
            <li>It is very user friendly, easy to understand directions, and the kids love the colored lights.</li>
            <li>So far, very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this diffuser for my kids bedrooms and so far am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Really consistent for two weeks, enjoyable way to fall asleep.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides that, outstanding customer service and reasonable price!</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Good product - inexpensive, easy to use and simple and clean look</li>
            <li>I was also pleasantly surprised that I got an email from the company making sure that everything with my order was okay.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had to clean it yet</li>
            <li>It works very well and love the night light part also.</li>
            <li>I now have two good working units and can enjoy them in different rooms of the house.</li>
            <li>I use a 4 thieves essential oil and it smells great at the office and the colors of the lights are fun.</li>
            <li>So far very happy but only gave 4 stars because am still waiting to see how they do with my tables.</li>
            <li>I clean mine after every 3-4 uses.</li>
            <li>I do clean it every week though too.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are brief yet concise which is perfect.</li>
            <li>I am loving my diffuser, and I am enjoying playing with different oil combinations.  </li>
            <li>I decided to go ahead and purchase another unit to replace the first one simply because I really like this one the best.  </li>
            <li>and so far I love it!</li>
            <li>This diffuser works great for a bedroom or a room that is not very large.</li>
            <li>I love the large amount of water which it holds.  </li>
            <li>I love the lights and the large capacity.</li>
            <li>I shut the lighting off just as I&#x27;m about to fall asleep as it would be to bright for me personally.</li>
            <li>It was really outstanding service, and the product works very well.  </li>
            <li>The option for the different settings is so convenient and the multiple light settings is perfect.</li>
            <li>The multi-colored light is a fun added feature.</li>
            <li>The cool mist diffusion process does not heat up the oils</li>
            <li>I prefer to run it at full run setting, and it still lasts 8 hours.  </li>
            <li>I like the 300ml capacity of this diffuser and it does a good job of diffusing long-lasting scent from my essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love all of the light color choices, but it doesn&#x27;t matter because there are several to choose from depending on your mood, and there is a setting that let&#x27;s you choose brighter or more mute.</li>
            <li>The price is so good, I ordered 2, so my kids could each have one in their bedrooms, as they love the whole ESsential Oil diffusing thing!</li>
            <li>I love this diffuser because it really does the job.  </li>
            <li>I use this one in my kitchen as the 300 ml size is good for a larger space.</li>
            <li>Overall I did like the diffuser, the steam it produces is good.</li>
            <li>With full capacity, it runs for over 10 hours.</li>
            <li>It is quiet, but covers a good amount of space.</li>
            <li>Anyway thanks for your time :-)</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 days, but I think I made a good choice.</li>
            <li>Returned for full refund</li>
            <li>Well if you do it right I am sure you will enjoy this as much as I have, and those damn bugs will have met their match.</li>
            <li>Customer service was excellent, and the diffuser arrived to Canada a few days earlier than expected which was great!</li>
            <li>I love my new diffuser!</li>
            <li>it give a quick beep when it shuts off.</li>
            <li>I received my order quickly.</li>
            <li>You have the option of having the light change colors, keep it at your favorite color or turn it off completely.</li>
            <li>luckily, you don&#x27;t have to have them on at all while you&#x27;re using the diffuser.</li>
            <li>Really love this diffuser, I love the color lights &amp; different variations.  </li>
            <li>Simple and unobtrusive look and design fit my decor nicely.</li>
            <li>This diffuser is a wonderful way to utilize various essential oils I have gotten from the health food store.</li>
            <li>I also love that it is larger and is able to run throughout the night</li>
            <li>Works best in a smaller room, esp kids because it is very quiet!  </li>
            <li>Additionally shipment was quick.</li>
            <li>delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>They sent multiple emails to ensure that my package arrived safely and that I was pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This diffuser fit the bill exactly.</li>
            <li>Light colors are pretty, although I don&#x27;t use them ,but it does take lots of water and oil</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a singer, so a humidifier is pretty important to me</li>
            <li>We received our order quickly and the packaging is so pretty!</li>
            <li>I love my new defusor.</li>
            <li>I love my new Product.</li>
            <li>Works really well &amp; easy to operate.</li>
            <li>The controls are straight forward and easy to use</li>
            <li>I really like this diffuser with all the extras and it is easy to work.</li>
            <li>This makes the rooms smell good and has helped with the dry weather</li>
            <li>Okay so the diffuser turns on, lights up &amp; that&#x27;s pretty much it.</li>
            <li>Love it easy to use very quiet arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so quiet, my favorite part!</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!!</li>
            <li>Love my diffuser so far!</li>
            <li>I finally came across this one, and I love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, very quiet and I love the choice between the three timer settings.  </li>
            <li>Four stars because the unit was blissfully easy to set up &amp; operate and very quiet for the most part.</li>
            <li>It was easy  to set up, love the changing colors and the mist with the essential oils</li>
            <li>it is just what I think) is the fact that when my fur family investigates the new &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; mom bought - the mist is super fine and cool so the kits cannot get burned - and nothing gets in their eyes - or hurts them in any way.  </li>
            <li>it has a very steady flow of steam and the fragrance has filled my kitchen dining room living room and hallway.  </li>
            <li>It also has a large selection of colors it will change to if you want the light on.....</li>
            <li>I specifically selected it because of capacity (300 mL), as so many other diffusers are much smaller, and it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I also own a more expensive one from Doterra and like this one better!</li>
            <li>I am really going to enjoy it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thirdly,  and this may be true for all diffusers,  but most of the scent is given off early on within the first couple of hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and the kids love the light.</li>
            <li>It diffuses the essential oils nicely.  </li>
            <li>Their customer service is #1, which seems rare these days.  </li>
            <li>Love that the LED can be turned off completely.</li>
            <li>It was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I rarely review items - but felt this review was a must.  </li>
            <li>and I thought ok I&#x27;m going to ask and see if my old unit could be replaced.</li>
            <li>I am considering how one might be useful in my classroom...hmmm.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I add a combo of lemongrass and lavender essential oils which creates a really nice calm ambiance.</li>
            <li>Nice and quiet also.</li>
            <li>The colored lights are fun</li>
            <li>Love this diffuser so far.</li>
            <li>So far I am pleased.</li>
            <li>But it runs continuously for ten hours, which is a nice perk.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking about getting the same kind for our master bedroom/bathroom.</li>
            <li>So far I love it.</li>
            <li>But overall I am happy so far with the unit.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It runs quietly and my boys love the light options.</li>
            <li>The Essential Wellness diffuser works great so far.</li>
            <li>My friend was thrilled and starting using it right away.</li>
            <li>The led lights are ridiculously bright, even when dimmed, so it can easily be used as a nightlight (the dimmed red is really the least bright</li>
            <li>It is practically silent, has a nice sized section for the water which lasts a nice long time.  </li>
            <li>This product does a great job of releasing the full potential of essential oils into the air.</li>
            <li>I have been using mine with various combinations of Essential Oils - in different rooms - experimenting with the awesome changeable colors (or no color at all - your choice), the four easily changeable timed settings - the ease of operating and cleaning.</li>
            <li>I had my husband here to figure it out the right way.  </li>
            <li>This is right on par with what I have used before.</li>
            <li>I used 8 drops of my Ylang Ylang oil &amp; unless I was standing right by side</li>
            <li>Lets out just the right amount of mist and can run all night.</li>
            <li>It is super quiet and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like it better if the scent extended more beyond a typical 12X12</li>
            <li>I use on the top of our high counter in our kitchen which is between two main living areas.  </li>
            <li>Anything that makes my house smell this good without the danger of an open flame or artificial fragrance is awesome.  </li>
            <li>I have been shopping for a diffuser for a long time and I liked this one.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see how much was diffused by this unit,  having used another type that had a very light output.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Point two is that the aerosol stream could be larger or more powerful.  </li>
            <li>Came quick, thanks to Amazon Prime</li>
            <li>The only real draw backs are the fact that the chord plugs into the bottom of the same cavity that you fill with water and oil, so you must unplug it each time you take it to refill and that you must hit a button many, many times to turn the light off if using the diffuser at night.</li>
            <li>Multiple light colors, four timed settings with the longest at 6 hours, subtle design, and the perfect size.</li>
            <li>it just makes the room and your mood more relaxed when an essential oil relaxing blend or just lavender essential oil is put into the diffuser and the lights which are not to bright if you chose to put them in just adds to the mood, I like the blue light  </li>
            <li>This diffuser is super quiet, runs all night and the nite light is very pretty.</li>
            <li>honestly j don&#x27;t use the lights very often.&lt;br /&gt;The only improvement I would want is that the mist be directed higher.</li>
            <li>I like the diffuser very much.  </li>
            <li>The colors are a little bright, even on the lowest setting, but I don&#x27;t use the lights.</li>
            <li>This is my first diffuser</li>
            <li>I obviously recommend this diffuser. :)</li>
            <li>This is the second one we have ordered and may order more.</li>
            <li>This has been my first experience with a diffuser.</li>
            <li>I sleep much better and wake up the next morning refreshed.</li>
            <li>Other reviews say it runs for 10 hours, but I think it was more like 14 hours!</li>
            <li>The lights are pretty and can be turned off.</li>
            <li>It runs exactly as described....</li>
            <li>Would be better if I got the oils that I ordered at the same time.</li>
            <li>Love The Essential Wellness 300ml</li>
            <li>So glad I finally found it.</li>
            <li>When my grandson (8) sleeps over I usually diffuse lavender EO in it and love the timer feature with the colored lights.</li>
            <li>First review (</li>
            <li>but this is my first diffuser experience.  </li>
            <li>The Essential Wellness diffuser sends its mist out of the top at an angle.  </li>
            <li>It runs quietly and i love how it changes color.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s actually great minor white noise.</li>
            <li>This is my first diffuser</li>
            <li>I was comparing it to a Young Living Diffuser which does not have the light options or the length of time to run.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time stepping into &amp;#34;the</li>
            <li>It is my first diffuser, so I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li>I also wish it was pretty.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Its my first diffuse</li>
            <li>For the price, I had higher expectations.</li>
            <li>The lights work and are pretty.</li>
            <li>But I wanted something different, something with more mist output.</li>
            <li>Now my more recent post !!</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of a aromatherapy diffuser.  </li>
            <li>First item to be returned.</li>
            <li>I love that it has a big water chamber and can be set to stay on for 60, 180, 360 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I will order more to replace some at home once they are back in stock.</li>
            <li>Diffusses a great mist, runs a long time, and whisper quiet.</li>
            <li>and overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Like many diffusers, it also has the auto shut off safety feature and multiple lighting color and intensity settings.</li>
            <li>Being able to run it 6 hrs is a big plus</li>
            <li>I started looking for a product that would mist but also be able to use essential oils.</li>
            <li>They also had reached out to me initially to inquire whether I was satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has various timer options, one of which is an automatic shut off whenever it runs out of water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty to look at as well.</li>
            <li>My favorite feature: it runs QUIETLY.</li>
            <li>This is my first diffuser.  </li>
            <li>When I became interested and acquainted with essential oils I realized I needed a diffuser.  </li>
            <li>This is my first diffuser and chose this because of quality, looks, capacity and price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>really love this diffuser and am planing on buying a second one for my living room.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it has a timer and an automatic shut off mechanism, in the event the water chamber runs low.</li>
            <li>I love the different lighting options.</li>
            <li>We love our Essential Wellness 300ml Ultrasonic diffuser!</li>
            <li>I love that it has all the settings, different timings and colors can change or set to one color.</li>
            <li>I love the different color lighting options.</li>
            <li>Produces lots of mist; much more than our prior unit.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The item shipped so fast!</li>
            <li>I bought the six most common essential oils and they are all great as well.</li>
            <li>I am dōTERRA wellness advocate so am very familiar with different kinds of diffusers.</li>
            <li>It runs a long time, has auto shut off, it&#x27;s quiet and the light colors are nice, although a little bright for my baby&#x27;s room since i have it close to the crib.</li>
            <li>Love the lighting color choices-- very relaxing and soft enough to let me sleep with light on.</li>
            <li>I used the replacement last night - started it right before I went to bed - and it was still going as strong as when it started when I woke up this morning.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t fall for the cheap versions out there, I did and they do not work long and a pain to clean.</li>
            <li>It has a nice range but does not make it throughout the whole house, as I fully expected.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the near future for our bedrooms.shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>My essential oils have been diffused nicely thus far</li>
            <li>As per the rest of the reviews on here (which convinced me to purchase it), I must say this is a pretty simple easy to use product</li>
            <li>Love how long it works.</li>
            <li>Reasonable priced, multiple time setting, auto shut-off, does not sweat, nice soft changing color lights that can be turned off.</li>
            <li>I love the color changing options and also that it diffuses for so long.  </li>
            <li>It runs for a long time and has the biggest capacity of many on the market.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it pretty heavily since purchasing and it has been consistent and effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s right by my bed and helps me sleep with my favorite Young Living Essential Oils!!</li>
            <li>I replied to thier email and got a quick response and a confirmation that a new unit was on its way free of charge and no need to return it back.</li>
            <li>I feel like if I do have any issues in the future, they would be really easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Simple to set up, easy to refill, and I like the options of run time and lights on/off/changing color.</li>
            <li>The instructions are so easy to follow they make set up beyond simple and fool proof.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use, It will run all night and the lights are an extra added bonus.</li>
            <li>It is easy to fill, is very quiet when running</li>
            <li>We have a large bedroom and it smells of peppermint sticks.</li>
            <li>Large capacity runs all night in our large bedroom.</li>
            <li>Do like its large capacity.</li>
            <li>Bought one of these diffusers for myself a few months ago, and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love how much mist comes out, how much water it holds and how long it stays on.</li>
            <li>I have only used distilled water, although I read that tap water is fine.  </li>
            <li>It is very quiet, and I love the fact that it will run for more than a half hour if I choose.  </li>
            <li>The product is very quiet and gives of an ultra fine mist with a continuous flow.</li>
            <li>Nice little diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Started to relax right away and woke up early feeling rested and with energy!</li>
            <li>It is super quiet very soothing and puts out the right amount of mist for the room size.</li>
            <li>This one has several light and timer settings.</li>
            <li>It is mostly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much prefer to have an even distribution of the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t care.  </li>
            <li>Very customer-focused.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m not going to mind this too much, however.</li>
            <li>When the room is filled with scent, I simply turn the unit off.</li>
            <li>Directions for cleaning are very helpful.</li>
            <li>I feel like it really does a wonder for the feel of the space, the quality of the air, and depending on what oil I use, the space can be brightened, cleansed, or calmed etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So being efficient by purchasing a 300ml diffuser really didn&#x27;t work with this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I like this one so much</li>
            <li>Thankful for Amazon customer service and the refund, but would have been so much happier with a working unity.  </li>
            <li>Only wish that the light had a timer like the mist.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It really isn&#x27;t much to look at unless the lights are on.</li>
            <li>I did so much research before buying this diffuser.</li>
            <li>This diffuser is very well thought out and well made.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>I would highly, highly recommend this diffuser!</li>
            <li>which I can&#x27;t really complain about because I knew about it beforehand.  </li>
            <li>The color changes really enhance this product.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the different lights also.</li>
            <li>So, Essential Wellness, you did a fantastic job on this</li>
            <li>and I really like how there are 4 timer settings</li>
            <li>On continuous run last for about 8 hours and like the light colors.</li>
            <li>It is simple to use but in order for it to run longer that 360 minutes you have to push the mist button until the ON  light comes on.</li>
            <li>Plus it diffuses out to the side rather than straight up.</li>
            <li>I had never used one before, but it seemed reasonably priced for what it does so decided to try this one.  </li>
            <li>Really like the diffuser.  </li>
            <li>It requires too much effort to take apart to fill and requires cleaning.</li>
            <li>but I have to really listen for it to hear it.</li>
            <li>they will guarantee my diffuser for a whole year.  </li>
            <li>My diffuser arrived in a very timely manner and was packed well and had no issues.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this diffuser!</li>
            <li>Light mist, disperse essential oils into the room</li>
            <li>this unit I really could not smell the scent.</li>
            <li>Diffuses very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this diffuser</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>It really will run about 10 hours.  </li>
            <li>Seems to distribute very well in a room.</li>
            <li>Myrel with Essential Wellness customer service is fantastic</li>
            <li>Modern</li>
            <li>It is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I have only had it for a couple of days, but love it so far.</li>
            <li>(I was able to choose the color I wanted on solid, or turn it off completely).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times,  but so far I love it.  </li>
            <li>The only feedback I would give to the company is that I would prefer no writing on the unit, but that is my own personal aesthetic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first diffuser as I am new to EO&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Very simple to use and very user friendly.</li>
            <li>The smell from the oils is strong and the water lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>Not only is it very efficient, but it goes above and beyond by being able to run up to 10 hours straight !</li>
            <li>I wanted a diffuser that was bigger then the one I use in my bedroom that looked decent and fit my price range.</li>
            <li>As far as cleaning the lid for the diffuser I use an old toothbrush to get in the smallish areas to clean out anything that might be building up on there that I can&#x27;t see.</li>
            <li>Works just as described and is better than my other diffuser I have.</li>
            <li>I am so sad because I loved this diffuser!  </li>
            <li>and I have been thinking about get more for other rooms.</li>
            <li>My biggest problem is that I now want a couple more  diffusers for other rooms in my house.</li>
            <li>I tank pleasantly surprised with how much mist it creates, and I really like the different setting options and being able to direct the mist outward instead of just straight up like others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first diffuser had a small squeeking sound in the fan, I contacted the company and they quickly replaced it.</li>
            <li>It has so many quality features such as the different time settings and the different light options.</li>
            <li>*Be sure to only use 100% pure essential oils with this btw!!</li>
            <li>I personally do not like it as much as my young living diffuser as the mist is not as strong.  </li>
            <li>No noise, can turn off the light, and set it for how long you want.</li>
            <li>Small and nice looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am getting full benefits of the oils with the Essential Wellness 300ml Ultrasonic Diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Stopped working after 5 days, sent back for a full refund.</li>
            <li>The lights are cool and the unit is very simple to use.</li>
            <li>I have another Young Living diffuser that is more expensive and not as nice as this one.  </li>
            <li>Nice diffuser small but runs all night.  </li>
            <li>Received an email thanking me for my purchase, asking that I contact them right away with any problems or concerns (nothing major yet) and asking me for a review after I&#x27;d tried out the product.</li>
            <li>The lights are definitely soothing, but can be a little bright if you&#x27;re turning them on while you sleep --</li>
            <li>We use this through the whole night and it runs about 8 hours (maybe a little bit more) if you fill it to the max line.</li>
            <li>Not only is the unit beautiful to use, it runs quiet and gives you the ultimate essential oil experience.</li>
            <li>all users should know that the top has a black dot on the bottom side and</li>
            <li>It is easy to fill and empty, and can use tap water.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and use it daily with my essential oils.</li>
            <li>We have only had the product for three days and have only used organic peppermint, but I am able to breathe at night now.</li>
            <li>I have another diffuser from one of the essential oil companies, and the Essential Wellness works comparably but holds much more water.  </li>
            <li>The stream is steady, and the fragrance is immediately dispersed.</li>
            <li>I purchased this particular diffuser because of the length of time it will run (6 hours).  </li>
            <li>The user can select the length of time for steady &amp;#34;misting&amp;#34; (60, 180, 360 min, or continuous).  </li>
            <li>I purchased this as my first diffuser, and while I was a little hesitant to spend so much money on my first one, I LOOOOOVE this diffuser!!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using high quality oils.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Took a few minutes to get the hang of the light switch, but other than that -  set up was easy and it ran right away.  </li>
            <li>I wish it looked a little stylish</li>
            <li>This is my second diffuser,love my first diffuser,disappointed in this one!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, quiet and works as expected.</li>
            <li>I like this product a lot, but for a few reasons, don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>When I asked the company if that was normal they immediately sent out a replacement.  </li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars but haven&#x27;t used them long enough to say that I love them.</li>
            <li>Almost imperceptible hum so able to sleep with it running.</li>
            <li>Quiet, powerful, lots of timing and lighting options.</li>
            <li>but I have a good feeling about the company that stands behind this product.  </li>
            <li>So initially it&#x27;s a little too  strong,  but after about three hours,  the scent had really faded.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other diffusers that had multiple pieces to pull apart, this is one step and very easy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it was easy to set up and definitely scented the room.  </li>
            <li>Regular tap water made it easy to use with your choice of essential oil.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought 300ml was a little big, but now I love it.</li>
            <li>I placed it in a higher location and now I can smell the oils on my entire main floor of my smallish bungalow.</li>
            <li>I felt the diffuser started out strong and then after a couple hours it slowed down.  </li>
            <li>I do really like it especially because of its large water capacity.</li>
            <li>In other words, if you just use the light, it stays on until you manually turn it off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Within 2 days I had a new one delivered to me.</li>
            <li>I live the multicolor setting.</li>
            <li>They sent me a new diffuser immediately.</li>
            <li>They replaced my defective diffuser with a new one.</li>
            <li>know if I can return for a new one...</li>
            <li>I live in Florida, which is the BUG Capital of the USA</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s up and running, I love it, but taking it apart to fill or add oil is most inconvenient.</li>
            <li>I find I have to use more essential oil than I expected</li>
            <li>I love the light feature of which you can select a color or just let the color change randomly.  </li>
            <li>And ultimately, it gets the lowest scores for not really being able to smell it.</li>
            <li>but it just ends up being too strong of a scent and runs out half way through the 8 hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to fill, will run for as long as 10 hours and is very quiet.  </li>
            <li>Super quiet, even when using at night, I barely notice it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure some would like the quiet white noise,  but just wanted to say that it does give off a quiet hum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with essential oils and diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I did find that the first 1-2 times I ran this diffuser, it only lasted 6-8 hours.</li>
            <li>I researched so many different types and brands for the last three months and this is the only diffuser that met my needs.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely buy one or two more for my other rooms .</li>
            <li>Multiple time settings are very helpful!  </li>
            <li>I have in my bedroom and it may be a coincidence, but I slept through the night for the first time in ten years</li>
            <li>This is my first and only diffuser</li>
            <li>It is simple to operate and clean and will run several hours on one filling.</li>
            <li>This unit is easy to clean, however sometimes the top part of diffuser is hard to remove, so I put on a pair of thin rubber gloves which helps.</li>
            <li>Have used it for about 30 days, clean it and refill every other day.</li>
            <li>and I have used vinegar to clean my other diffusers.</li>
            <li>When I clean my machine after I&#x27;ve been using oils like citrus or thicker oils that your not usually supposed to use in diffusers i fill the diffuser with some water and a small amount of cheap vodka, let it sit for a minute then carefully use a q-tip to clean the diffuser center area.   </li>
            <li>I researched a good portion of the diffusers on this site and relied on user reviews to narrow down the selection.  </li>
            <li>I say most part because the unit had a very faint squeaking sound after a couple hours of operation, but I want to wait and run it a few more times before revising my review.</li>
            <li>This is easy to operate, holds lots of water with your choice of oils, and is quiet enough when needed bedside for occasional insomnia.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different types of oils and different amounts, but pretty much still the same: I cannot really smell it.  </li>
            <li>The large reservior 300ml and the different time settings (4) are all the reasons I chose to purchase this unit.</li>
            <li>The timer options only let you choose large chunks of time (e.g. 60, 180 min) and then turns itself off.</li>
            <li>but like I said, the last 25% off the mist time is more like just providing humidity to the air with little fragrance.</li>
            <li>just wish they would make the instructions a little more clear with specific cleaning instructions.</li>
            <li>I bought a diffuser from another company and even though it says the light shuts off, the base still glows brightly.</li>
            <li>The instructions aren&#x27;t exactly clear.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great when you first start it but leaves me disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I use it at night with Breathe oil to clear my sinuses.  </li>
            <li>but so far I like it.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t loud either,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only concerned about this because I feel like I really have to pry it off sometimes and don&#x27;t want to damage the unit.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Company is very responsive with inquiries, as I wanted to know if the controls were supposed to be on the opposite side of the output.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just received this diffuser, and so far I like it a lot.</li>
            <li>Completely recommend this company and its products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li>You can also choose the light color you want or no light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all about Young Living and have had 2 of their diffusers for awhile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this diffuser for a few days so far, but I love it.</li>
            <li>It definitely fills the whole room so much that I can only use 3 drops of oil.</li>
            <li>They last a lot longer and they work very well.</li>
            <li>I have so far purchased three and given one as a gift.</li>
            <li>( I&#x27;m not a doctor or health care professional, so do your research).</li>
            <li>The automatic shut off feature was a must have for me and so far has worked like a charm.  </li>
            <li>I really like the colors but also that you can turn it off (an option my last diffuser didn&#x27;t have).</li>
            <li>I recently bought another one for my daughter and hope she enjoys hers as much as I do mine.  </li>
            <li>the only noise it makes is the gentle splashing of water that occurs during operation.</li>
            <li>Many people have complained about the yellowing inside.</li>
            <li>So far my diffuser has been going about three hours</li>
            <li>It has really helped me with some respiratory issues when I use the germ fighter synergy essential oil.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Actual real life quality assurance being completed.</li>
            <li>&amp; it is powerful enough to notice the essential oils in any area.</li>
            <li>The ultrasonic diffuser has been working as expected and now I have to find the right amount (number of drops)</li>
            <li>I asked my husband to look at the unit, and he found it on the other side above the mist and light switch.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little unsure of the safest way to clean my unit.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only seen one other diffuser in action and that was the NOW brand which I was originally going to buy until I compared reviews.  </li>
            <li>Works just as well if not better then the more expensive doterra one we own.</li>
            <li>( machine makes a slight beep) and timer function is a big plus Vapor comes out the side versus the top Bigger resivoir for longer use Smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, it creates such a fine mist that I really have to look for it (no huge droplets like some diffusers), and it diffuses oils well.</li>
            <li>Also, I would be interested in a slightly larger machine that could hold enough water for 24 hours of continuous use, so I didn&#x27;t have to refill as often.</li>
            <li>I have used different oils, and always high quality oils.  </li>
            <li>We highly recommend this diffuser and will be getting a second one!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Essential Wellness 300 ml Ultrasonic.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, much cheaper than any other I could find for overnight diffusing.</li>
            <li>Seem sturdy solid easy to use and puts off heavy stream of oil and moisture.</li>
            <li>is strong with only a few drops Cons:</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t need much oil, maybe 3 drops, and run for a long time.</li>
            <li>The mist could be a little stronger but other than that I love it so far.</li>
            <li>I spent way more time researching different diffusers than I should have and decided on this one based on other reviews, the appearance, and the price.</li>
            <li>We live our essential defuser.</li>
            <li>and I have a big open flop plan I put it in the kitchen and the whole kitchen entry way and</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product, and I will likely be purchasing a 2nd one to use downstairs in my home.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and the I had the diffuser working within a few minutes of receiving it.</li>
            <li>If we ever purchase a second one, I would most likely buy another one of these unless we need a little smaller of one.</li>
            <li>The replacement makes a small white noise which is easily ignored.</li>
            <li>Clear directions on proper use and care.  </li>
            <li>Only took seconds to complete online.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback I can see so far is that there&#x27;s no intermittent option for the mist.</li>
            <li>and it is only a couple of weeks old.  </li>
            <li>The only difference I see is that the Young Living  seems to put out a heavier mist than this one does.  </li>
            <li>Also when the water fell below 100 ml the steam was barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I have only used it with one type oil so far, but it works.  </li>
            <li>Only used it 1 day so far.</li>
            <li>Customer service is on top of its game.</li>
            <li>I am new to essential oils and diffusers in the last month and have read lots of reviews and done a lot of research.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to essential oils, but this diffuser has totally won me over.  </li>
            <li>but I have several other diffusers and it is really nice that this one will run for at least 9 hours.</li>
            <li>I also hear a very light hum from the mechanism, but it&#x27;s very subtle.</li>
            <li>Price was a little higher a few others I had looked at, but for 10 hour capacity it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the device works really well.</li>
            <li>This one worked really well -- I ended up returning the other one.</li>
            <li>We only have this one diffuser right now, so we carry it back and forth between our bedroom and living room (we live in a small apartment).</li>
            <li>The ionizer puts out negative ions that are supposed to clean the air.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that you hear water trickling sound when it it running.</li>
            <li>I just received a Young Living Essential Oil Starter kit last week and I have been diffusing ever since!</li>
            <li>The first diffuser I received had a slight technical problem.</li>
            <li>That is such a benefit if you live in dry climates or suffer from coughs.</li>
            <li>I am sick of being mislead because someone got a free item, extra discount or has decided to be a PT reviewer it hopes to get something free.</li>
            <li>Its peaceful and has a little noise to the machine which I consider white noise.</li>
            <li>It produce very light steam w/ faint smell.</li>
            <li>Other then the lid getting jammed a bit if not lined up exactly correct</li>
            <li>The top is a little hard to put back on as others expressed.</li>

            <li> I own 2 Whisper diffusers, that I absolutely love.</li>
            <li> Impressed with customer service so far.  </li>
            <li> The multi colored lights are a nice feature that you are able to have on or not.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the light and the unit doesn&#x27;t have a bright glow.</li>

            <li> Love this diffuser and service provided by the seller, who went out of their way to contact me before and after shipment.  </li>
            <li> Love the lights that I often turn on at night for ambience.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are three things about it that  might be improved upon but I&#x27;m not even sure if they are possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This diffuser was reviewed much better.</li>
            <li> But it seems to me that the NOW model kicks out a stronger stream of mist that may do a better job of coverage.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love being able to time the lights and the diffuser.</li>
            <li> but I love that it allows you 4 cycle options.</li>
            <li> but I have made sure that is not the problem.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this diffuser.</li>
            <li> and I love the lights</li>

            <li> Overall a very happy customer!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a diffuser with a capacity to hold more than 100ml of water.</li>
            <li> thought I found the perfect item in the Essential Wellness diffuser.  </li>
            <li> After about 100ml of usage, the scent runs out and you&#x27;ll have to put in more drops of oil.  </li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Love the lights and the ease of use.  </li>
            <li> Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li> Works well and love the color options.</li>
            <li> I fell in love as soon as I turned it on.  </li>
            <li> Love the fact that is runs for a prolonged period.  </li>
            <li> Pleased with the diffuser and vender.</li>
            <li> I love the relaxing  sound of the water trickling!</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.</li>
            <li> This is a great diffuser at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this unit and indeed it was excellent while it worked, but any item that will not turn on after 5 days is a red flag for me.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying it now.  </li>
            <li> It is quiet and the colors you can use are great!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> However I would say is the top can stick to the bottom and cause water to splash out.</li>
            <li> Love the color changing lights &amp; ability to set timer.</li>
            <li> My home smells lovely</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Very affordable and great value for the price.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I went with this diffuser.</li>
            <li> The light function is nice, although we don&#x27;t use it when we are sleeping.  </li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these and absolutely LOVE them.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser .</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesome...works great...</li>
            <li> I have mostly been using lavender oil for sleep and relaxation.</li>
            <li> I have to say that between the diffuser and the oil, I believe I&#x27;m sleeping better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> The Grand children love the color changing part.</li>

            <li> I love the capacity of this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> In the questions some ask about the ionizer and people have responded regarding the mist output (showing that most people probably don&#x27;t even know what the ionizer is).</li>
            <li> and I would suggest you look up what ionizers are before getting this unit to be sure it&#x27;s something you want in your home.</li>
            <li> The Essential Wellness 300 ml Diffuser was the perfect choice for me.</li>
            <li> If every business was run like that the world would be a better place.</li>
            <li> I love the simplicity of how it connects.  </li>
            <li> Love this unit.</li>

            <li> The fragrance of the oils doesn&#x27;t seem to be as strong, though.</li>
            <li> at a strong flow (unlike others).  </li>
            <li> I used it yesterday and after 6 hours it was still going strong.</li>
            <li> It lasts all night with a strong stream of vapor.  </li>

            <li> Huge added bonus.</li>

            <li> , it is light smelling, not over powering.</li>
            <li> The light adds a fun feature, changing or to one of the many color options (bright or a dim) or OFF.</li>

            <li> The light show accompanying the diffuser is just as relaxing and therapeutic.</li>
            <li> I would also like to thank Essential Wellness for the great service - when Amazon was reading out-of-stock-  </li>
            <li> oh the light with the changing color thing..</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>

            <li> I like that you can turn the light off and still enjoy the diffusing while you drift off to sleep.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times with excellent results.</li>
            <li> I started off my diffuser use with a 100ml sized one and realized it has to be filled too often.</li>
            <li> like how you can turn off the light if needed.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the purchase of my Essential Wellness 300 ml Oil Diffuser.</li>
            <li> But overall a great product.</li>
            <li> So at this rate I can use it all the time which makes the oils very cost effective.</li>
            <li> I filled it up and it diffused for about 8 hours.  </li>
            <li> It is light weight.  </li>
            <li> I  like the fact that this diffuser can be used as an air purifier, ionizer, and humidifier as well as a night light.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the light yet</li>
            <li> Item is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type to wear a sleep mask to block out all light.</li>
            <li> They really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> My apartment smells fresh and fantastic!</li>
            <li> Including the &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; light option.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, but I have to admit, I don&#x27;t use the light so much since this one is in the bedroom.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> It was a good price and love all the different color choices.</li>

            <li> So far, very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this diffuser for my kids bedrooms and so far am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Really consistent for two weeks, enjoyable way to fall asleep.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides that, outstanding customer service and reasonable price!</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Good product - inexpensive, easy to use and simple and clean look</li>
            <li> I was also pleasantly surprised that I got an email from the company making sure that everything with my order was okay.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to clean it yet</li>
            <li> It works very well and love the night light part also.</li>
            <li> I now have two good working units and can enjoy them in different rooms of the house.</li>
            <li> I use a 4 thieves essential oil and it smells great at the office and the colors of the lights are fun.</li>
            <li> So far very happy but only gave 4 stars because am still waiting to see how they do with my tables.</li>
            <li> I clean mine after every 3-4 uses.</li>
            <li> I do clean it every week though too.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are brief yet concise which is perfect.</li>
            <li> I am loving my diffuser, and I am enjoying playing with different oil combinations.  </li>
            <li> I decided to go ahead and purchase another unit to replace the first one simply because I really like this one the best.  </li>
            <li> and so far I love it!</li>
            <li> This diffuser works great for a bedroom or a room that is not very large.</li>
            <li> I love the large amount of water which it holds.  </li>
            <li> I love the lights and the large capacity.</li>
            <li> I shut the lighting off just as I&#x27;m about to fall asleep as it would be to bright for me personally.</li>
            <li> It was really outstanding service, and the product works very well.  </li>
            <li> The option for the different settings is so convenient and the multiple light settings is perfect.</li>
            <li> The multi-colored light is a fun added feature.</li>
            <li> The cool mist diffusion process does not heat up the oils</li>
            <li> I prefer to run it at full run setting, and it still lasts 8 hours.  </li>
            <li> I like the 300ml capacity of this diffuser and it does a good job of diffusing long-lasting scent from my essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love all of the light color choices, but it doesn&#x27;t matter because there are several to choose from depending on your mood, and there is a setting that let&#x27;s you choose brighter or more mute.</li>
            <li> The price is so good, I ordered 2, so my kids could each have one in their bedrooms, as they love the whole ESsential Oil diffusing thing!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser because it really does the job.  </li>
            <li> I use this one in my kitchen as the 300 ml size is good for a larger space.</li>
            <li> Overall I did like the diffuser, the steam it produces is good.</li>
            <li> With full capacity, it runs for over 10 hours.</li>
            <li> It is quiet, but covers a good amount of space.</li>
            <li> Anyway thanks for your time :-)</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 days, but I think I made a good choice.</li>
            <li> Returned for full refund</li>
            <li> Well if you do it right I am sure you will enjoy this as much as I have, and those damn bugs will have met their match.</li>
            <li> Customer service was excellent, and the diffuser arrived to Canada a few days earlier than expected which was great!</li>
            <li> I love my new diffuser!</li>
            <li> it give a quick beep when it shuts off.</li>
            <li> I received my order quickly.</li>
            <li> You have the option of having the light change colors, keep it at your favorite color or turn it off completely.</li>
            <li> luckily, you don&#x27;t have to have them on at all while you&#x27;re using the diffuser.</li>
            <li> Really love this diffuser, I love the color lights &amp; different variations.  </li>
            <li> Simple and unobtrusive look and design fit my decor nicely.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is a wonderful way to utilize various essential oils I have gotten from the health food store.</li>
            <li> I also love that it is larger and is able to run throughout the night</li>
            <li> Works best in a smaller room, esp kids because it is very quiet!  </li>
            <li> Additionally shipment was quick.</li>
            <li> delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> They sent multiple emails to ensure that my package arrived safely and that I was pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This diffuser fit the bill exactly.</li>
            <li> Light colors are pretty, although I don&#x27;t use them ,but it does take lots of water and oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a singer, so a humidifier is pretty important to me</li>
            <li> We received our order quickly and the packaging is so pretty!</li>
            <li> I love my new defusor.</li>
            <li> I love my new Product.</li>
            <li> Works really well &amp; easy to operate.</li>
            <li> The controls are straight forward and easy to use</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser with all the extras and it is easy to work.</li>
            <li> This makes the rooms smell good and has helped with the dry weather</li>
            <li> Okay so the diffuser turns on, lights up &amp; that&#x27;s pretty much it.</li>
            <li> Love it easy to use very quiet arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so quiet, my favorite part!</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!!</li>
            <li> Love my diffuser so far!</li>
            <li> I finally came across this one, and I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, very quiet and I love the choice between the three timer settings.  </li>
            <li> Four stars because the unit was blissfully easy to set up &amp; operate and very quiet for the most part.</li>
            <li> It was easy  to set up, love the changing colors and the mist with the essential oils</li>
            <li> it is just what I think) is the fact that when my fur family investigates the new &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; mom bought - the mist is super fine and cool so the kits cannot get burned - and nothing gets in their eyes - or hurts them in any way.  </li>
            <li> it has a very steady flow of steam and the fragrance has filled my kitchen dining room living room and hallway.  </li>
            <li> It also has a large selection of colors it will change to if you want the light on.....</li>
            <li> I specifically selected it because of capacity (300 mL), as so many other diffusers are much smaller, and it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I also own a more expensive one from Doterra and like this one better!</li>
            <li> I am really going to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thirdly,  and this may be true for all diffusers,  but most of the scent is given off early on within the first couple of hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and the kids love the light.</li>
            <li> It diffuses the essential oils nicely.  </li>
            <li> Their customer service is #1, which seems rare these days.  </li>
            <li> Love that the LED can be turned off completely.</li>
            <li> It was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I rarely review items - but felt this review was a must.  </li>
            <li> and I thought ok I&#x27;m going to ask and see if my old unit could be replaced.</li>
            <li> I am considering how one might be useful in my classroom...hmmm.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I add a combo of lemongrass and lavender essential oils which creates a really nice calm ambiance.</li>
            <li> Nice and quiet also.</li>
            <li> The colored lights are fun</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser so far.</li>
            <li> So far I am pleased.</li>
            <li> But it runs continuously for ten hours, which is a nice perk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking about getting the same kind for our master bedroom/bathroom.</li>
            <li> So far I love it.</li>
            <li> But overall I am happy so far with the unit.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It runs quietly and my boys love the light options.</li>
            <li> The Essential Wellness diffuser works great so far.</li>
            <li> My friend was thrilled and starting using it right away.</li>
            <li> The led lights are ridiculously bright, even when dimmed, so it can easily be used as a nightlight (the dimmed red is really the least bright</li>
            <li> It is practically silent, has a nice sized section for the water which lasts a nice long time.  </li>
            <li> This product does a great job of releasing the full potential of essential oils into the air.</li>
            <li> I have been using mine with various combinations of Essential Oils - in different rooms - experimenting with the awesome changeable colors (or no color at all - your choice), the four easily changeable timed settings - the ease of operating and cleaning.</li>
            <li> I had my husband here to figure it out the right way.  </li>
            <li> This is right on par with what I have used before.</li>
            <li> I used 8 drops of my Ylang Ylang oil &amp; unless I was standing right by side</li>
            <li> Lets out just the right amount of mist and can run all night.</li>
            <li> It is super quiet and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like it better if the scent extended more beyond a typical 12X12</li>
            <li> I use on the top of our high counter in our kitchen which is between two main living areas.  </li>
            <li> Anything that makes my house smell this good without the danger of an open flame or artificial fragrance is awesome.  </li>
            <li> I have been shopping for a diffuser for a long time and I liked this one.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see how much was diffused by this unit,  having used another type that had a very light output.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Point two is that the aerosol stream could be larger or more powerful.  </li>
            <li> Came quick, thanks to Amazon Prime</li>
            <li> The only real draw backs are the fact that the chord plugs into the bottom of the same cavity that you fill with water and oil, so you must unplug it each time you take it to refill and that you must hit a button many, many times to turn the light off if using the diffuser at night.</li>
            <li> Multiple light colors, four timed settings with the longest at 6 hours, subtle design, and the perfect size.</li>
            <li> it just makes the room and your mood more relaxed when an essential oil relaxing blend or just lavender essential oil is put into the diffuser and the lights which are not to bright if you chose to put them in just adds to the mood, I like the blue light  </li>
            <li> This diffuser is super quiet, runs all night and the nite light is very pretty.</li>
            <li> honestly j don&#x27;t use the lights very often.&lt;br /&gt;The only improvement I would want is that the mist be directed higher.</li>
            <li> I like the diffuser very much.  </li>
            <li> The colors are a little bright, even on the lowest setting, but I don&#x27;t use the lights.</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser</li>
            <li> I obviously recommend this diffuser. :)</li>
            <li> This is the second one we have ordered and may order more.</li>
            <li> This has been my first experience with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> I sleep much better and wake up the next morning refreshed.</li>
            <li> Other reviews say it runs for 10 hours, but I think it was more like 14 hours!</li>
            <li> The lights are pretty and can be turned off.</li>
            <li> It runs exactly as described....</li>
            <li> Would be better if I got the oils that I ordered at the same time.</li>
            <li> Love The Essential Wellness 300ml</li>
            <li> So glad I finally found it.</li>
            <li> When my grandson (8) sleeps over I usually diffuse lavender EO in it and love the timer feature with the colored lights.</li>
            <li> First review (</li>
            <li> but this is my first diffuser experience.  </li>
            <li> The Essential Wellness diffuser sends its mist out of the top at an angle.  </li>
            <li> It runs quietly and i love how it changes color.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s actually great minor white noise.</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser</li>
            <li> I was comparing it to a Young Living Diffuser which does not have the light options or the length of time to run.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time stepping into &amp;#34;the</li>
            <li> It is my first diffuser, so I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I also wish it was pretty.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Its my first diffuse</li>
            <li> For the price, I had higher expectations.</li>
            <li> The lights work and are pretty.</li>
            <li> But I wanted something different, something with more mist output.</li>
            <li> Now my more recent post !!</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of a aromatherapy diffuser.  </li>
            <li> First item to be returned.</li>
            <li> I love that it has a big water chamber and can be set to stay on for 60, 180, 360 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I will order more to replace some at home once they are back in stock.</li>
            <li> Diffusses a great mist, runs a long time, and whisper quiet.</li>
            <li> and overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Like many diffusers, it also has the auto shut off safety feature and multiple lighting color and intensity settings.</li>
            <li> Being able to run it 6 hrs is a big plus</li>
            <li> I started looking for a product that would mist but also be able to use essential oils.</li>
            <li> They also had reached out to me initially to inquire whether I was satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I love that it has various timer options, one of which is an automatic shut off whenever it runs out of water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty to look at as well.</li>
            <li> My favorite feature: it runs QUIETLY.</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser.  </li>
            <li> When I became interested and acquainted with essential oils I realized I needed a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser and chose this because of quality, looks, capacity and price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> really love this diffuser and am planing on buying a second one for my living room.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it has a timer and an automatic shut off mechanism, in the event the water chamber runs low.</li>
            <li> I love the different lighting options.</li>
            <li> We love our Essential Wellness 300ml Ultrasonic diffuser!</li>
            <li> I love that it has all the settings, different timings and colors can change or set to one color.</li>
            <li> I love the different color lighting options.</li>
            <li> Produces lots of mist; much more than our prior unit.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The item shipped so fast!</li>
            <li> I bought the six most common essential oils and they are all great as well.</li>
            <li> I am dōTERRA wellness advocate so am very familiar with different kinds of diffusers.</li>
            <li> It runs a long time, has auto shut off, it&#x27;s quiet and the light colors are nice, although a little bright for my baby&#x27;s room since i have it close to the crib.</li>
            <li> Love the lighting color choices-- very relaxing and soft enough to let me sleep with light on.</li>
            <li> I used the replacement last night - started it right before I went to bed - and it was still going as strong as when it started when I woke up this morning.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall for the cheap versions out there, I did and they do not work long and a pain to clean.</li>
            <li> It has a nice range but does not make it throughout the whole house, as I fully expected.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more in the near future for our bedrooms.shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> My essential oils have been diffused nicely thus far</li>
            <li> As per the rest of the reviews on here (which convinced me to purchase it), I must say this is a pretty simple easy to use product</li>
            <li> Love how long it works.</li>
            <li> Reasonable priced, multiple time setting, auto shut-off, does not sweat, nice soft changing color lights that can be turned off.</li>
            <li> I love the color changing options and also that it diffuses for so long.  </li>
            <li> It runs for a long time and has the biggest capacity of many on the market.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it pretty heavily since purchasing and it has been consistent and effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s right by my bed and helps me sleep with my favorite Young Living Essential Oils!!</li>
            <li> I replied to thier email and got a quick response and a confirmation that a new unit was on its way free of charge and no need to return it back.</li>
            <li> I feel like if I do have any issues in the future, they would be really easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Simple to set up, easy to refill, and I like the options of run time and lights on/off/changing color.</li>
            <li> The instructions are so easy to follow they make set up beyond simple and fool proof.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use, It will run all night and the lights are an extra added bonus.</li>
            <li> It is easy to fill, is very quiet when running</li>
            <li> We have a large bedroom and it smells of peppermint sticks.</li>
            <li> Large capacity runs all night in our large bedroom.</li>
            <li> Do like its large capacity.</li>
            <li> Bought one of these diffusers for myself a few months ago, and I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love how much mist comes out, how much water it holds and how long it stays on.</li>
            <li> I have only used distilled water, although I read that tap water is fine.  </li>
            <li> It is very quiet, and I love the fact that it will run for more than a half hour if I choose.  </li>
            <li> The product is very quiet and gives of an ultra fine mist with a continuous flow.</li>
            <li> Nice little diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Started to relax right away and woke up early feeling rested and with energy!</li>
            <li> It is super quiet very soothing and puts out the right amount of mist for the room size.</li>
            <li> This one has several light and timer settings.</li>
            <li> It is mostly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much prefer to have an even distribution of the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t care.  </li>
            <li> Very customer-focused.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m not going to mind this too much, however.</li>
            <li> When the room is filled with scent, I simply turn the unit off.</li>
            <li> Directions for cleaning are very helpful.</li>
            <li> I feel like it really does a wonder for the feel of the space, the quality of the air, and depending on what oil I use, the space can be brightened, cleansed, or calmed etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So being efficient by purchasing a 300ml diffuser really didn&#x27;t work with this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I like this one so much</li>
            <li> Thankful for Amazon customer service and the refund, but would have been so much happier with a working unity.  </li>
            <li> Only wish that the light had a timer like the mist.</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> It really isn&#x27;t much to look at unless the lights are on.</li>
            <li> I did so much research before buying this diffuser.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is very well thought out and well made.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> I would highly, highly recommend this diffuser!</li>
            <li> which I can&#x27;t really complain about because I knew about it beforehand.  </li>
            <li> The color changes really enhance this product.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the different lights also.</li>
            <li> So, Essential Wellness, you did a fantastic job on this</li>
            <li> and I really like how there are 4 timer settings</li>
            <li> On continuous run last for about 8 hours and like the light colors.</li>
            <li> It is simple to use but in order for it to run longer that 360 minutes you have to push the mist button until the ON  light comes on.</li>
            <li> Plus it diffuses out to the side rather than straight up.</li>
            <li> I had never used one before, but it seemed reasonably priced for what it does so decided to try this one.  </li>
            <li> Really like the diffuser.  </li>
            <li> It requires too much effort to take apart to fill and requires cleaning.</li>
            <li> but I have to really listen for it to hear it.</li>
            <li> they will guarantee my diffuser for a whole year.  </li>
            <li> My diffuser arrived in a very timely manner and was packed well and had no issues.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this diffuser!</li>
            <li> Light mist, disperse essential oils into the room</li>
            <li> this unit I really could not smell the scent.</li>
            <li> Diffuses very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> It really will run about 10 hours.  </li>
            <li> Seems to distribute very well in a room.</li>
            <li> Myrel with Essential Wellness customer service is fantastic</li>
            <li> Modern</li>
            <li> It is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a couple of days, but love it so far.</li>
            <li> (I was able to choose the color I wanted on solid, or turn it off completely).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times,  but so far I love it.  </li>
            <li> The only feedback I would give to the company is that I would prefer no writing on the unit, but that is my own personal aesthetic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first diffuser as I am new to EO&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Very simple to use and very user friendly.</li>
            <li> The smell from the oils is strong and the water lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Not only is it very efficient, but it goes above and beyond by being able to run up to 10 hours straight !</li>
            <li> I wanted a diffuser that was bigger then the one I use in my bedroom that looked decent and fit my price range.</li>
            <li> As far as cleaning the lid for the diffuser I use an old toothbrush to get in the smallish areas to clean out anything that might be building up on there that I can&#x27;t see.</li>
            <li> Works just as described and is better than my other diffuser I have.</li>
            <li> I am so sad because I loved this diffuser!  </li>
            <li> and I have been thinking about get more for other rooms.</li>
            <li> My biggest problem is that I now want a couple more  diffusers for other rooms in my house.</li>
            <li> I tank pleasantly surprised with how much mist it creates, and I really like the different setting options and being able to direct the mist outward instead of just straight up like others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first diffuser had a small squeeking sound in the fan, I contacted the company and they quickly replaced it.</li>
            <li> It has so many quality features such as the different time settings and the different light options.</li>
            <li> *Be sure to only use 100% pure essential oils with this btw!!</li>
            <li> I personally do not like it as much as my young living diffuser as the mist is not as strong.  </li>
            <li> No noise, can turn off the light, and set it for how long you want.</li>
            <li> Small and nice looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am getting full benefits of the oils with the Essential Wellness 300ml Ultrasonic Diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Stopped working after 5 days, sent back for a full refund.</li>
            <li> The lights are cool and the unit is very simple to use.</li>
            <li> I have another Young Living diffuser that is more expensive and not as nice as this one.  </li>
            <li> Nice diffuser small but runs all night.  </li>
            <li> Received an email thanking me for my purchase, asking that I contact them right away with any problems or concerns (nothing major yet) and asking me for a review after I&#x27;d tried out the product.</li>
            <li> The lights are definitely soothing, but can be a little bright if you&#x27;re turning them on while you sleep --</li>
            <li> We use this through the whole night and it runs about 8 hours (maybe a little bit more) if you fill it to the max line.</li>
            <li> Not only is the unit beautiful to use, it runs quiet and gives you the ultimate essential oil experience.</li>
            <li> all users should know that the top has a black dot on the bottom side and</li>
            <li> It is easy to fill and empty, and can use tap water.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and use it daily with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> We have only had the product for three days and have only used organic peppermint, but I am able to breathe at night now.</li>
            <li> I have another diffuser from one of the essential oil companies, and the Essential Wellness works comparably but holds much more water.  </li>
            <li> The stream is steady, and the fragrance is immediately dispersed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this particular diffuser because of the length of time it will run (6 hours).  </li>
            <li> The user can select the length of time for steady &amp;#34;misting&amp;#34; (60, 180, 360 min, or continuous).  </li>
            <li> I purchased this as my first diffuser, and while I was a little hesitant to spend so much money on my first one, I LOOOOOVE this diffuser!!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using high quality oils.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Took a few minutes to get the hang of the light switch, but other than that -  set up was easy and it ran right away.  </li>
            <li> I wish it looked a little stylish</li>
            <li> This is my second diffuser,love my first diffuser,disappointed in this one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, quiet and works as expected.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot, but for a few reasons, don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li> When I asked the company if that was normal they immediately sent out a replacement.  </li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars but haven&#x27;t used them long enough to say that I love them.</li>
            <li> Almost imperceptible hum so able to sleep with it running.</li>
            <li> Quiet, powerful, lots of timing and lighting options.</li>
            <li> but I have a good feeling about the company that stands behind this product.  </li>
            <li> So initially it&#x27;s a little too  strong,  but after about three hours,  the scent had really faded.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other diffusers that had multiple pieces to pull apart, this is one step and very easy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it was easy to set up and definitely scented the room.  </li>
            <li> Regular tap water made it easy to use with your choice of essential oil.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought 300ml was a little big, but now I love it.</li>
            <li> I placed it in a higher location and now I can smell the oils on my entire main floor of my smallish bungalow.</li>
            <li> I felt the diffuser started out strong and then after a couple hours it slowed down.  </li>
            <li> I do really like it especially because of its large water capacity.</li>
            <li> In other words, if you just use the light, it stays on until you manually turn it off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within 2 days I had a new one delivered to me.</li>
            <li> I live the multicolor setting.</li>
            <li> They sent me a new diffuser immediately.</li>
            <li> They replaced my defective diffuser with a new one.</li>
            <li> know if I can return for a new one...</li>
            <li> I live in Florida, which is the BUG Capital of the USA</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s up and running, I love it, but taking it apart to fill or add oil is most inconvenient.</li>
            <li> I find I have to use more essential oil than I expected</li>
            <li> I love the light feature of which you can select a color or just let the color change randomly.  </li>
            <li> And ultimately, it gets the lowest scores for not really being able to smell it.</li>
            <li> but it just ends up being too strong of a scent and runs out half way through the 8 hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to fill, will run for as long as 10 hours and is very quiet.  </li>
            <li> Super quiet, even when using at night, I barely notice it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure some would like the quiet white noise,  but just wanted to say that it does give off a quiet hum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with essential oils and diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I did find that the first 1-2 times I ran this diffuser, it only lasted 6-8 hours.</li>
            <li> I researched so many different types and brands for the last three months and this is the only diffuser that met my needs.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely buy one or two more for my other rooms .</li>
            <li> Multiple time settings are very helpful!  </li>
            <li> I have in my bedroom and it may be a coincidence, but I slept through the night for the first time in ten years</li>
            <li> This is my first and only diffuser</li>
            <li> It is simple to operate and clean and will run several hours on one filling.</li>
            <li> This unit is easy to clean, however sometimes the top part of diffuser is hard to remove, so I put on a pair of thin rubber gloves which helps.</li>
            <li> Have used it for about 30 days, clean it and refill every other day.</li>
            <li> and I have used vinegar to clean my other diffusers.</li>
            <li> When I clean my machine after I&#x27;ve been using oils like citrus or thicker oils that your not usually supposed to use in diffusers i fill the diffuser with some water and a small amount of cheap vodka, let it sit for a minute then carefully use a q-tip to clean the diffuser center area.   </li>
            <li> I researched a good portion of the diffusers on this site and relied on user reviews to narrow down the selection.  </li>
            <li> I say most part because the unit had a very faint squeaking sound after a couple hours of operation, but I want to wait and run it a few more times before revising my review.</li>
            <li> This is easy to operate, holds lots of water with your choice of oils, and is quiet enough when needed bedside for occasional insomnia.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different types of oils and different amounts, but pretty much still the same: I cannot really smell it.  </li>
            <li> The large reservior 300ml and the different time settings (4) are all the reasons I chose to purchase this unit.</li>
            <li> The timer options only let you choose large chunks of time (e.g. 60, 180 min) and then turns itself off.</li>
            <li> but like I said, the last 25% off the mist time is more like just providing humidity to the air with little fragrance.</li>
            <li> just wish they would make the instructions a little more clear with specific cleaning instructions.</li>
            <li> I bought a diffuser from another company and even though it says the light shuts off, the base still glows brightly.</li>
            <li> The instructions aren&#x27;t exactly clear.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great when you first start it but leaves me disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I use it at night with Breathe oil to clear my sinuses.  </li>
            <li> but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t loud either,  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only concerned about this because I feel like I really have to pry it off sometimes and don&#x27;t want to damage the unit.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Company is very responsive with inquiries, as I wanted to know if the controls were supposed to be on the opposite side of the output.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just received this diffuser, and so far I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Completely recommend this company and its products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> You can also choose the light color you want or no light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about Young Living and have had 2 of their diffusers for awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this diffuser for a few days so far, but I love it.</li>
            <li> It definitely fills the whole room so much that I can only use 3 drops of oil.</li>
            <li> They last a lot longer and they work very well.</li>
            <li> I have so far purchased three and given one as a gift.</li>
            <li> ( I&#x27;m not a doctor or health care professional, so do your research).</li>
            <li> The automatic shut off feature was a must have for me and so far has worked like a charm.  </li>
            <li> I really like the colors but also that you can turn it off (an option my last diffuser didn&#x27;t have).</li>
            <li> I recently bought another one for my daughter and hope she enjoys hers as much as I do mine.  </li>
            <li> the only noise it makes is the gentle splashing of water that occurs during operation.</li>
            <li> Many people have complained about the yellowing inside.</li>
            <li> So far my diffuser has been going about three hours</li>
            <li> It has really helped me with some respiratory issues when I use the germ fighter synergy essential oil.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Actual real life quality assurance being completed.</li>
            <li> &amp; it is powerful enough to notice the essential oils in any area.</li>
            <li> The ultrasonic diffuser has been working as expected and now I have to find the right amount (number of drops)</li>
            <li> I asked my husband to look at the unit, and he found it on the other side above the mist and light switch.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little unsure of the safest way to clean my unit.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only seen one other diffuser in action and that was the NOW brand which I was originally going to buy until I compared reviews.  </li>
            <li> Works just as well if not better then the more expensive doterra one we own.</li>
            <li> ( machine makes a slight beep) and timer function is a big plus Vapor comes out the side versus the top Bigger resivoir for longer use Smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, it creates such a fine mist that I really have to look for it (no huge droplets like some diffusers), and it diffuses oils well.</li>
            <li> Also, I would be interested in a slightly larger machine that could hold enough water for 24 hours of continuous use, so I didn&#x27;t have to refill as often.</li>
            <li> I have used different oils, and always high quality oils.  </li>
            <li> We highly recommend this diffuser and will be getting a second one!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Essential Wellness 300 ml Ultrasonic.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, much cheaper than any other I could find for overnight diffusing.</li>
            <li> Seem sturdy solid easy to use and puts off heavy stream of oil and moisture.</li>
            <li> is strong with only a few drops Cons:</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t need much oil, maybe 3 drops, and run for a long time.</li>
            <li> The mist could be a little stronger but other than that I love it so far.</li>
            <li> I spent way more time researching different diffusers than I should have and decided on this one based on other reviews, the appearance, and the price.</li>
            <li> We live our essential defuser.</li>
            <li> and I have a big open flop plan I put it in the kitchen and the whole kitchen entry way and</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product, and I will likely be purchasing a 2nd one to use downstairs in my home.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and the I had the diffuser working within a few minutes of receiving it.</li>
            <li> If we ever purchase a second one, I would most likely buy another one of these unless we need a little smaller of one.</li>
            <li> The replacement makes a small white noise which is easily ignored.</li>
            <li> Clear directions on proper use and care.  </li>
            <li> Only took seconds to complete online.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback I can see so far is that there&#x27;s no intermittent option for the mist.</li>
            <li> and it is only a couple of weeks old.  </li>
            <li> The only difference I see is that the Young Living  seems to put out a heavier mist than this one does.  </li>
            <li> Also when the water fell below 100 ml the steam was barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have only used it with one type oil so far, but it works.  </li>
            <li> Only used it 1 day so far.</li>
            <li> Customer service is on top of its game.</li>
            <li> I am new to essential oils and diffusers in the last month and have read lots of reviews and done a lot of research.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to essential oils, but this diffuser has totally won me over.  </li>
            <li> but I have several other diffusers and it is really nice that this one will run for at least 9 hours.</li>
            <li> I also hear a very light hum from the mechanism, but it&#x27;s very subtle.</li>
            <li> Price was a little higher a few others I had looked at, but for 10 hour capacity it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the device works really well.</li>
            <li> This one worked really well -- I ended up returning the other one.</li>
            <li> We only have this one diffuser right now, so we carry it back and forth between our bedroom and living room (we live in a small apartment).</li>
            <li> The ionizer puts out negative ions that are supposed to clean the air.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that you hear water trickling sound when it it running.</li>
            <li> I just received a Young Living Essential Oil Starter kit last week and I have been diffusing ever since!</li>
            <li> The first diffuser I received had a slight technical problem.</li>
            <li> That is such a benefit if you live in dry climates or suffer from coughs.</li>
            <li> I am sick of being mislead because someone got a free item, extra discount or has decided to be a PT reviewer it hopes to get something free.</li>
            <li> Its peaceful and has a little noise to the machine which I consider white noise.</li>
            <li> It produce very light steam w/ faint smell.</li>
            <li> Other then the lid getting jammed a bit if not lined up exactly correct</li>
            <li> The top is a little hard to put back on as others expressed.</li>
            <li> but like the fact that it uses plain cold tap water and should be easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Compared to others I looked at this holds twice as much water &amp; is half the price!</li>
            <li> Quiet operation with only minor water sounds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little clumsy to open and close with liquid in it because my fingers always end up pressing the mist and/or light buttons but its not enough of a problem to not consider purchasing another.</li>
            <li> Quiet and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is quiet and can be programmed to run as long as six hours.</li>
            <li> - it lasts a long time (no constant refilling) and the mist comes</li>
            <li> and I was worried that we would not find one that ran long enough.  </li>
            <li> Not loud enough to be bothersome if placed in a sleeping area.</li>
            <li> , the oils last as long as the mist&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It is a little tough to remove the top, but doable.</li>
            <li> The cover sticks and hard to attach,not very eye appealing,I do like the 7 different colors,but would not purchase another one like this.</li>
            <li> It is simple to use and diffuses for a LONG time!</li>
            <li> I like that it is very long lasting</li>
            <li> I am glad I didn&#x27;t listen to all the negative reviews, what I like also is that when the water is all gone the unit stops automatically and it will run for at least 6/8 hours.  </li>
            <li> Seems very cheaply made, awkward to use, and we could not smell the oil being diffused.</li>
            <li> - She loved it - unfortunately it quit working today!!  </li>
            <li> My other diffuser sends its mist directly up out of the center of it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t waste as much oils as i do with other diffusers.</li>
            <li> Well built, holds a lot of water, runs for a long time, and affordable.</li>
            <li> I use it overnight, near my bed and there is almost no sound.</li>
            <li> Has automatic shutoff and as long as you keep</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time since it is 300ml instead of 100ml</li>
            <li> By the way, this DOES beep when it shuts off, but not loudly.</li>
            <li> It does hold a lot of water and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It works a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have signed up for the 1 year warranty and am curious to see what being a VIP (no extra cost for either) will include.</li>
            <li> so it runs a long time.</li>
            <li> Long running.  </li>
            <li> I did a LOT of research trying to find a diffuser that would work in my bedroom and work all night long.</li>
            <li> Depending on how long I am home I can set it and forget it.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t want to use any oils I just diffuse plain old water.   </li>
            <li> like several other well rated ones.</li>
            <li> I went through three other diffusers (returning them all), before finally finding this one.</li>
            <li> the last few night have been heavenly using it next to my bed with Lavender and frankensense.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> It is almost completely silent, there is only a very slight hum.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me started on the endless light options unless you are color blind</li>
            <li> There is a very soft hum which I hardly ever hear.  </li>
            <li> The diffuser also came really quickly, less than 3 days from ordering, with standard shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mist is really, really light and is actually very difficult to tell whether the diffuser is actually working.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so quiet, just a slight bubbling</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this less than 1 week and have used it daily.  </li>
            <li> I moved from a humid area to a very dry area.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about a week with not a single complaint.</li>
            <li> very kind emails from them (not the usual annoying ones from sellers)...</li>
            <li> I have run it with a lot of water and only a little.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used multiple other diffusers previously to purchasing this one</li>
            <li> We have been using this diffuser for about a week now and have had no issues, and my only complaint is that it drips when you take the top off, but I imagine that is hard to avoid with any diffuser, so I&#x27;m not greatly upset about it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how durable it is because I have only had it for a few days.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve only had this product for a few days</li>
            <li> Got this a few days ago and am using it finally today...</li>
            <li> I read the instructions a few times, and didn&#x27;t see where to turn on the different speeds.  </li>
            <li> Auto shut off when empty.</li>
            <li> Just a few days later it stopped working</li>
            <li> I found out that they really stand behind their products.</li>
            <li> I was in pain and could not unwind even though I was physically spent..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few days</li>
            <li> Ive only had this a few weeks and it already doesnt work well....</li>
            <li> You actually have to follow directions and use just a few drops or else</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> It works ok but the white noise it emits is annoying.  </li>
            <li> Seriously would buy a second one on my next payday.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to experimenting with other oils.  </li>
            <li> Put it beside my bed the other night..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to travel with.</li>
            <li> I would recommended this to anyone that uses essential oils or even as a humidifier for a small room.</li>
            <li> A little cheaper looking than i expected for the price.</li>
            <li> It is a little larger than I thought it would be but it still fits nicely on a small end table.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the markings are wearing off within a week of purchase which is dissapointing.</li>
            <li> but it works as advertised with only one complaint</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it, but I don&#x27;t hate it either.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m refilling it frequently, which is frustrating too.</li>
            <li> My decision came down to capacity, leave on/auto shut off and warranty.  </li>
            <li> you plug the adapter cord into the underside of the unit making it very awkward to unplug when you need to clean it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on other diffusers.  </li>
            <li> Since we have started diffusing oils while we sleep he snores less</li>
            <li> I researched long and hard before I decided on a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a little less than a week.</li>
            <li> I have tried a little oil and a lot of oil.  </li>
            <li> I had a little difficulty understanding how to set the timer</li>
            <li> So I did a quick google search and found that the ozone ionizers make can cause people to feel sick</li>
            <li> The buttons are on the back side away from the steam opening and it feels awkward finding and pressing them there, but not a big problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that also helps you to get maximum use of your oils-which innmy case are not cheap bc</li>
            <li> You can also opt for no light.</li>
            <li> I have trouble sleeping, and it doesn&#x27;t keep me awake.</li>
            <li> I have been having trouble with sleep and getting up to work</li>
            <li> Quit working after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you time falling for the lies of paid reviews.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this due to a review about the cover being hard to remove</li>
            <li> I hear a very subtle trickle of water that is actually soothing rather than distracting.</li>
            <li> and you truly cannot really smell it, unless you stick your nose in the very faint mist.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little workhorse!</li>
            <li> I have small hands, and arthritic thumbs</li>
            <li> It does make a small amt of noise when running</li>
            <li> Summersaults, a small family business, took care of it IMMEDIATELY.</li>
            <li> I likes the small size but not quality product.</li>
            <li> but I usually have them off.</li>
            <li> I have ran it every day for the past couple months</li>
            <li> I only gave it four starts because I do find it a bit difficult to remove the cover when refilling,  </li>
            <li> I also received an email from the seller saying that if I am not satisfied to please let them know.</li>
            <li> I have already recommended this product to my friends who are attending an essential oil party I am hosting, instead of purchasing the very expensive diffusers that are being sold by other companies.</li>
            <li> It was initially hard to get the cover on and off.  </li>
            <li> It was to hard to remove the cover.  </li>
            <li> We have hard water</li>
            <li> I turned it off before I leave in the late afternoon and there is still water in it.</li>
            <li> One day too late to return and get a replacement from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> A couple others have commented that its awkward having the controls on the back of the unit</li>
            <li> but I would still buy this product with this one negative.  </li>
            <li> As a health fanatic and air quality lover..</li>
            <li> At least I know what to ask for as a birthday gift.</li>
            <li> I purchased a mister that changes colour, slowly going through the rainbow.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, the cover can be difficult to get off sometimes.</li>
            <li> Small unit does wonders!</li>
            <li> I would prefer it if I could plug it into an extension cord but other than that you can&#x27;t go wrong if you purchase this item.</li>
            <li> My DoTerra diffuser lasted 6 months -- and I was never really happy with the small mist stream.  </li>
            <li> but it has a very small water capacity</li>
            <li> Was less expensive than the ones I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li> I actually started feeling like I was getting sick, so I have been mixing my lavender with a combo of oils by &amp;#34;Now&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I started to wonder after using it again the next day if it was the ionizer in the unit that was making me feel sick.</li>
            <li> How dumb is that?</li>
            <li> Which I&#x27;m not happy about.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it was designed poorly.</li>
            <li> and it got worse as the unit stayed on.</li>
            <li> She was not happy either to hear it.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any problems with how the diffuser functions.</li>
            <li> Very solid unit with sturdy base.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s actually not very good for you at all.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed - Diffuser would only turn on 1 time.  </li>
            <li> At which point it becomes an expensive humidifier.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the scent is not emitted on a continual basis from beginning to end.</li>
            <li> My issue is that I started to feel ill just after turning it on.</li>
            <li> My fiance has terrible allergies and would snore all night long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little inconvenient that the power cord goes into the base of the unit</li>
            <li> However, as a byproduct they produce ozone (think bad air quality).</li>
            <li> Could have been a bad unit.</li>
            <li> I just got the diffuser a couple of days ago, and I have to say I&#x27;m a bit frustrated with it.  </li>
            <li> They were supposed to be here yesterday still haven&#x27;t gotten them :-[</li>
            <li> : (sort of)&lt;br /&gt;The instructions advise to not use acidic substances.</li>
            <li> It can be very dangerous for those with breathing or lung issues.</li>
            <li> I did not know how to line up the cover and base, as I thought the notches needed to be lined up together.  </li>
            <li> and I hate bugs!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product. I bought a diffuser from another company and even though it says the light shuts off, the base still glows brightly. This one has several light and timer settings.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser and service provided by the seller, who went out of their way to contact me before and after shipment.  It was really outstanding service, and the product works very well.  I specifically selected it because of capacity (300 mL), as so many other diffusers are much smaller, and it works beautifully.  Love the lights that I often turn on at night for ambience.</li>
            <li> I Ordered two and I love them! Easy to use and the oils are wonderful!  Diana L. Carter</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to but so far I like it. I don&#x27;t know how durable it is because I have only had it for a few days. It is mostly what I expected.  The description of the product is accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three things about it that  might be improved upon but I&#x27;m not even sure if they are possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The machine is not silent.  It isn&#x27;t loud either,  but it&#x27;s definitely not silent.  I have used it in the bedroom and can easily sleep with it and I&#x27;m sure some would like the quiet white noise,  but just wanted to say that it does give off a quiet hum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Point two is that the aerosol stream could be larger or more powerful.  I&#x27;ve only seen one other diffuser in action and that was the NOW brand which I was originally going to buy until I compared reviews.  This diffuser was reviewed much better. But it seems to me that the NOW model kicks out a stronger stream of mist that may do a better job of coverage.  I&#x27;d like it better if the scent extended more beyond a typical 12X12 room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly,  and this may be true for all diffusers,  but most of the scent is given off early on within the first couple of hours. So initially it&#x27;s a little too  strong,  but after about three hours,  the scent had really faded. I&#x27;d much prefer to have an even distribution of the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,  I am happy with the model.  It is a little larger than I thought it would be but it still fits nicely on a small end table. The lights are a nice option and easy to control.  I like the larger capacity of water and the extended mist time,  but like I said, the last 25% off the mist time is more like just providing humidity to the air with little fragrance. Lastly,  I like the variable misting timers. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for! All of the features work perfectly:)</li>
            <li> It was my wife&#x27;s idea and I really didn&#x27;t care.  I was convinced otherwise after she plugged it in.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I have used my diffuser every day since receiving it. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for you if you are using oils while you sleep. Lasts all night and has a soothing light that can be turned off if you don&#x27;t want it on. Easy to clean and has settings for 1/4/6 hour or until it runs out. Highly recommend, much cheaper than any other I could find for overnight diffusing.</li>
            <li> Love it! Ordered two on accident and decided to keep both!</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot, but for a few reasons, don&#x27;t love it.  The sellers do seem to have great customer service, though, and that&#x27;s always a huge plus.  I feel like if I do have any issues in the future, they would be really easy to work with. The diffuser also came really quickly, less than 3 days from ordering, with standard shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- As other reviewers have mentioned, the cover can be difficult to get off sometimes. I&#x27;m only concerned about this because I feel like I really have to pry it off sometimes and don&#x27;t want to damage the unit.&lt;br /&gt;- The instructions aren&#x27;t exactly clear.  I&#x27;m a little unsure of the safest way to clean my unit.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a little inconvenient that the power cord goes into the base of the unit where the water tank is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Super quiet, even when using at night, I barely notice it. Big plus for me as I intend to use it at night regularly.&lt;br /&gt;- Nice, steady mist stream.&lt;br /&gt;- Small and nice looking.&lt;br /&gt;- I love that the light can be turned off completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a really great unit. Works as described and I would recommend it to others.  I love and appreciate the great customer service, just wish they would make the instructions a little more clear with specific cleaning instructions.</li>
            <li> I just got the diffuser a couple of days ago, and I have to say I&#x27;m a bit frustrated with it.  I have small hands, and arthritic thumbs - so trying to grasp the cover to turn/open/close the unit is much more difficult than I would have imagined (especially with all the warnings not to tip it).  Once it&#x27;s up and running, I love it, but taking it apart to fill or add oil is most inconvenient.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Great lights (maybe a weee bright for night time), pretty quiet diffuser, water lasts for an entire week if you run for an hour a night.  I love being able to time the lights and the diffuser.</li>
            <li> Very quiet. I am glad that the light option can be turned off. The fragrance of the oils doesn&#x27;t seem to be as strong, though.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve only had this product for a few days but I love that it allows you 4 cycle options. I&#x27;ve used it for 1 hour while my daughter napped &amp; then for an extended time at bedtime. It&#x27;s quiet and the kids love the light. The design is unobtrusive and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it was easy to set up and definitely scented the room.  I like the fact that the business followed up via email to invite feedback and opened the door for resolving any issues, should they exist.  Very customer-focused.</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser and I love it!  It is very quiet, very attractive when lit, and works wonderfully.  Both of my teenage boys now want one in their rooms.  It makes my bedroom smell and feel like a sanctuary! Simple to set up, easy to refill, and I like the options of run time and lights on/off/changing color.</li>
            <li> It works great, but took a bit to figure out how to get it to turn on and use the timer function.</li>
            <li> This is a great diffuser! Well built, holds a lot of water, runs for a long time, and affordable. My daughter loves the changing colors.</li>
            <li> Nice little diffuser.  Company is very responsive with inquiries, as I wanted to know if the controls were supposed to be on the opposite side of the output.  They are, so that the mist stays away from the controls.  Unit is very easy to operate.  Plus I have peace of mind with the 1 year warranty.</li>
            <li> Quiet and lasts a long time.  Perfect so far...</li>
            <li> No matter what I do it stops putting out scent after 30 minutes to an hour.  At which point it becomes an expensive humidifier.  I have tried a little oil and a lot of oil.  I have used different oils, and always high quality oils.  I have run it with a lot of water and only a little.  Nothing makes a difderence.  It&#x27;s great when you first start it but leaves me disappointed.  And  I know you can get desensitized after awhile but I have made sure that is not the problem. If this is how all diffusers are, then there isn&#x27;t any point to spending the extra dollars on one that will go all nIght.</li>
            <li> Just received this item this afternoon.  It&#x27;s my first diffuser as I am new to EO&#x27;s. I researched a good portion of the diffusers on this site and relied on user reviews to narrow down the selection.  My decision came down to capacity, leave on/auto shut off and warranty.  I suffer from migraines and asthma and am hoping that this will help ease both.  Took a few minutes to get the hang of the light switch, but other than that -  set up was easy and it ran right away.  It has been running steady for almost 3 hours so far and my room smells wonderful (Ovvio Inhale).  Just an FYI - Warranty in Box states 3 months, however, if you register with their VIP program (free), you get the year.  Only took seconds to complete online.  So far, very pleased.  I am planning on letting it run through the night and am looking forward to how I&#x27;ll feel in the morning!</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with essential oils and diffuser.  I am so pleased with this diffuser. It puts out a lot of scent into the room and I love the lights (didn&#x27;t think I would like or use this part of the diffuser).  Since I just received it; I have only used it a couple of times, but I am really impressed with it.  I am thinking about ordering another one to use at my shop. At this point, I would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just received this diffuser, and so far I like it a lot. It&#x27;s quiet, it creates such a fine mist that I really have to look for it (no huge droplets like some diffusers), and it diffuses oils well. Almost as important, the company has great customer service, replying to questions immediately. The only drawback I can see so far is that there&#x27;s no intermittent option for the mist. The unit is either on or off. I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;m not going to mind this too much, however. When the room is filled with scent, I simply turn the unit off. All in all, a great diffuser from an impressive company that stands behind its products.</li>
            <li> I just received this as a Christmas gift and set it up next to my bed. I got the Breathe fragrance, it is light smelling, not over powering. I am finding I breathe easier with it.</li>
            <li> This difuser works great. The option for the different settings is so convenient and the multiple light settings is perfect.</li>
            <li> The product is just awesome and the customer service was top notch!  Completely recommend this company and its products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I chose this diffuser because of the size. I wanted something that would last all night in my sons room. It works perfectly. Their customer service is fantastic and I will be ordering more for the rest of the house!</li>
            <li> Seem sturdy solid easy to use and puts off heavy stream of oil and moisture. price for the size of unit was great.  Would by another one.</li>
            <li> Perfect!! We love this and use it in our baby&#x27;s nursery. I plan to buy another one for my daughter&#x27;s room!</li>
            <li> Got this a few days ago and am using it finally today...It is wonderful!!!! love the time length of it and the out put it does if just great!!! we will get another for the family room!</li>
            <li> Love the timer setting.  Emits a nice output.  The multi-colored light is a fun added feature.</li>
            <li> This product does the job.  I find I have to use more essential oil than I expected or I don&#x27;t get the smell I hoped for.  It seems fairly sturdy but takes awhile to figure out how to use it.  All in all I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I like the diffuser.  It diffuses the essential oils nicely.  I like the varying colors of lights.  It was initially hard to get the cover on and off.  Strained my wrists a bit.  I think it is loosening up with daily use.  I read the instructions a few times, and didn&#x27;t see where to turn on the different speeds.  I asked my husband to look at the unit, and he found it on the other side above the mist and light switch.  I did not know how to line up the cover and base, as I thought the notches needed to be lined up together.  Good thing I had my husband here to figure it out the right way.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have been using this diffuser every day for over a week and absolutely LOVE IT.... I will be ordering more. It produces a lot of vapor and fills the room with wonderful smells from essential oils and cleans easily.</li>
            <li> I ordered this diffuser as a gift for a friend in Canada. Customer service was excellent, and the diffuser arrived to Canada a few days earlier than expected which was great! My friend was thrilled and starting using it right away. She loves the aroma and the ease of this diffuser. Thanks for making my friend&#x27;s birthday great!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser! I spent way more time researching different diffusers than I should have and decided on this one based on other reviews, the appearance, and the price. The timer settings are great. You have the option of 30, 180, or 360 minutes or just ON. It will turn off by itself if it runs out of water. The light adds a fun feature, changing or to one of the many color options (bright or a dim) or OFF. I was worried about the output of the water vapor, since I live in a very humid part of Texas, but it is perfect. It is not like a regular humidifier, which leaves my house damp and sticky feeling in my area. I have my diffuser in my living area, close to the kitchen, and it masks food smells but is not too overpowering if sitting close by in the living area. It has a nice range but does not make it throughout the whole house, as I fully expected. I will eventually get one for the front of my house...and maybe a couple more for some of the bedrooms. I obviously recommend this diffuser. :)</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser as you can choose the amount of time you want it to run or let it run until it automatically shuts off.  You can also choose the light color you want or no light. I would definitely purchase this diffuser again</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser! It has a timer.  Auto shut off when empty. Directions for cleaning are very helpful. This is the second one we have ordered and may order more.</li>
            <li> This has been my first experience with a diffuser. the last few night have been heavenly using it next to my bed with Lavender and frankensense.&lt;br /&gt;Both my husband and I have slept more soundly and peacefully with this diffuser. I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great!</li>
            <li> Performs as advertised.  Not noisy.  Customer service outreach (and response) like I have never encountered before.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> Love it is working well thumbs up</li>
            <li> Love it! Love how long it works. Baby is sleeping better from it!</li>
            <li> I felt the diffuser started out strong and then after a couple hours it slowed down.  When I asked the company if that was normal they immediately sent out a replacement.  They were very quick to respond and no questions asked.  Their customer service is #1, which seems rare these days.  I received the replacement unit today and look forward to trying it out tonight.  It seems to be a very good product and is very easy to use.  UPDATE:  I used the replacement last night - started it right before I went to bed - and it was still going as strong as when it started when I woke up this morning.  Very happy with the replacement.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  I like the timer settings.  Does not have an intermittent setting though.  I do like that it give a quick beep when it shuts off.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is great. Great value. It looks great on my bedside table. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser! Especially the lights!</li>
            <li> I love it. Works just as described and is better than my other diffuser I have.</li>
            <li> I am dōTERRA wellness advocate so am very familiar with different kinds of diffusers. This is the best one I have used yet! Not only is it very efficient, but it goes above and beyond by being able to run up to 10 hours straight ! Which is great for overnight runs or for people who work in a spa setting and do not have time to switch on and off constantly.....that also helps you to get maximum use of your oils-which innmy case are not cheap bc they are non synthetic! Good stuff! Very happy. Pretty colors and awesome features!</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a couple of days, but love it so far. I will award the fifth star when I see how it holds up over time. Love the lighting color choices-- very relaxing and soft enough to let me sleep with light on. Easy to use and fills the bedroom with the essence of choice. The diffuser I had before this one was on the noisy side and beeped when it shut off. This one runs quietly and I have not been awakened by any beeps when it shuts off.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser. It is so easy to use. It is safe to use in my classroom and the kids are asking me to fill it up when they come in and it isn&#x27;t on yet. I turned it off before I leave in the late afternoon and there is still water in it. It runs for longer than the 6 hours advertised. It is easy to fill and clean. I plan to get another for home use.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser! I run it all the time in my apartment. I feel like it really does a wonder for the feel of the space, the quality of the air, and depending on what oil I use, the space can be brightened, cleansed, or calmed etc. I love the time settings, 60/180/360 mins. And you can use it with the light off, or add some color to the room. It cycles thru several beautiful colors and you can stop it on one you like too. The cool mist diffusion process does not heat up the oils so it does not damage or change your oils.  ***Be sure to only use 100% pure essential oils with this btw!!</li>
            <li> Simple to operate.  Timer turns it off so there is no danger hazard.  It doesn&#x27;t sputter or hiss or even produce heat.  I sleep much better and wake up the next morning refreshed.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is absolutely amazing! I would highly recommend it. I use doterra oils and hAve only used their diffusers. This is right on par with what I have used before. Other reviews say it runs for 10 hours, but I think it was more like 14 hours! My only complaint is that the markings are wearing off within a week of purchase which is dissapointing. Overall a very happy customer!</li>
            <li> Works well, good mist, nice options for time and color.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a diffuser with a capacity to hold more than 100ml of water. We have larger rooms and I wanted something that can run for 8 hours without the constant refilling.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I found the perfect item in the Essential Wellness diffuser.  Unfortunately, the scent is not emitted on a continual basis from beginning to end. After about 100ml of usage, the scent runs out and you&#x27;ll have to put in more drops of oil.  I tried putting in 10 drops of my essential oil to begin with but it just ends up being too strong of a scent and runs out half way through the 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;So being efficient by purchasing a 300ml diffuser really didn&#x27;t work with this product. I would look for either a smaller diffuser or another one that can process the oil/water on a continual basis.</li>
            <li> I waited to write the review because I got 3... Wanted to see how they worked...and I am VERY happy with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> Can I give this 10 stars?  Have tried 3 different diffusers, and this one finally gives me what I want.  There are several settings on it, allowing you to run it at your preference. I prefer to run it at full run setting, and it still lasts 8 hours.  In our house, we only use doTERRA essential oils. I am getting full benefits of the oils with the Essential Wellness 300ml Ultrasonic Diffuser.  This is easy to operate, holds lots of water with your choice of oils, and is quiet enough when needed bedside for occasional insomnia. During the day, I use different oils depending upon my mood.  Seriously would buy a second one on my next payday.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser.  Puts out a great amount of mist and aroma.  Great item.</li>
            <li> Using it in our bedroom. No noise, can turn off the light, and set it for how long you want.</li>
            <li> This diffuser works great. It is quiet and can be programmed to run as long as six hours. The lights are pretty and can be turned off. Customer service is wonderful and responded to my question promptly.</li>
            <li> Purchased this diffuser as a gift for my daughter May 27th - She loved it - unfortunately it quit working today!!  One day too late to return and get a replacement from Amazon.  So, it only worked for 31 days!  Product info says there is a one year warranty.  Is there a way to get a replacement?</li>
            <li> My Essential Wellness Diffuser arrived this morning!  I can&#x27;t believe how quiet it is!!  I will definitely order another one or two for my guest room and living area.  Easy instructions and assembly!!&lt;br /&gt; BJL  Texas</li>
            <li> I ordered this diffuser for my kids bedrooms and so far am very pleased. They don&#x27;t need much oil, maybe 3 drops, and run for a long time. They like the light that changes color and makes a nice night light. I was also pleasantly surprised that I got an email from the company making sure that everything with my order was okay. I would give it 5 stars but haven&#x27;t used them long enough to say that I love them. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This has been a great product, however the lights weren&#x27;t working all the time so after a month I contacted the seller. Within 2 days I had a new one delivered to me. I love this product and use it daily with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> Great product and wonderful communication from the company. Thinking of purchasing a second one so I do not have to move from room to room</li>
            <li> This is a really good diffuser!! I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!!! Works so well by my bedside! Fills my room with a beautiful relaxing smell! Small unit does wonders!</li>
            <li> Just as described. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I would give it a 5 if not for the following:  I fumble with the switches each time I try to operate the unit.  The AC cord should lay to the back of the unit; the switches should be in the front and so should the spout (where the mist escapes).  Other than that, the device works really well.</li>
            <li> I have never had an essential oil diffuser so did a lot of research to determine the best one to buy.  I am very pleased with this product.  It runs exactly as described....when you put on the continuous speed, it goes for almost 12 hours.  Service from the seller was amazing and the item shipped right away.  A couple others have commented that its awkward having the controls on the back of the unit and I agree it would be easier if they were in the front but I would still buy this product with this one negative.  Love the lights and the ease of use.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Works great and my boys love it as a night light.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser. Works well and love the color options.</li>
            <li> It is fine. Would be better if I got the oils that I ordered at the same time. They were supposed to be here yesterday still haven&#x27;t gotten them :-[</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about Young Living and have had 2 of their diffusers for awhile. I&#x27;ve only used this diffuser for a few days so far, but I love it. It&#x27;s so quiet, my favorite part! Oils from YL, diffuser from the Essential Wellness.</li>
            <li> This arrived yesterday.  I fell in love as soon as I turned it on.  Love the fact that is runs for a prolonged period.  Hopefully it will continue to work.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the diffuser and vender. I like the larger volume of water it can handle and longer time. I use it overnight, near my bed and there is almost no sound. The colors are nice, but I have to admit, I don&#x27;t use the light so much since this one is in the bedroom. I like this one so much, I just ordered a second one.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser. Love that the LED can be turned off completely.</li>
            <li> Love The Essential Wellness 300ml Ultrasonic Difusser - it lasts a long time (no constant refilling) and the mist comes&lt;br /&gt;out at a strong flow (unlike others).  Regular tap water made it easy to use with your choice of essential oil.  Slept with it&lt;br /&gt;on last night on my nightstand (I was able to choose the color I wanted on solid, or turn it off completely).  There&#x27;s alot&lt;br /&gt;of choices out there, I chose the right product!!</li>
            <li> Very simple to use and very user friendly. Smells as advertised. We have only had the product for three days and have only used organic peppermint, but I am able to breathe at night now. We have a large bedroom and it smells of peppermint sticks. Smell on brother, smell on.</li>
            <li> Quiet, diffuses well. Easy to use and clean. Has helped my sinuses. Also wonderful just for aromatherapy. I had been looking for a good diffuser for quite some time. So glad I finally found it.</li>
            <li> I wanted a diffuser that was bigger then the one I use in my bedroom that looked decent and fit my price range. This diffuser fit the bill exactly. I almost didn&#x27;t buy this due to a review about the cover being hard to remove ( I have arthritis in my hands) but I found that it&#x27;s easier to remove then my pebble diffuser by  Deneve. I haven&#x27;t had to clean it yet but like the fact that it uses plain cold tap water and should be easy to clean. Pros: Easy to turn on ( machine makes a slight beep) and timer function is a big plus Vapor comes out the side versus the top Bigger resivoir for longer use Smell is strong with only a few drops Cons: None yet but will edit post if I find some  I would definitely buy this again  UPDATED REVIEW  (2016)  I&#x27;ve had this machine for just about a year and can honestly say it&#x27;s a great machine. I actually just bought another one to use in my utility room and am waiting for it to arrive.  When my grandson (8) sleeps over I usually diffuse lavender EO in it and love the timer feature with the colored lights. It brightens up the room enough that he isn&#x27;t scared. If I don&#x27;t want to use any oils I just diffuse plain old water.   I have used citrus oils in this machine without any effects.   When I clean my machine after I&#x27;ve been using oils like citrus or thicker oils that your not usually supposed to use in diffusers i fill the diffuser with some water and a small amount of cheap vodka, let it sit for a minute then carefully use a q-tip to clean the diffuser center area.   As far as cleaning the lid for the diffuser I use an old toothbrush to get in the smallish areas to clean out anything that might be building up on there that I can&#x27;t see.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with this diffuser. It was to hard to remove the cover.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser! It is the perfect size to fit on my night stand. The mist could be a little stronger but other than that I love it so far. I love the relaxing  sound of the water trickling! I will be buying another one soon for my kids room!  Very happy with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I love the 300 ml capacity to ensure you good enjoy your diffused oils all night. I&#x27;ve had it for 2 months now and I have it on almost all day.  The light feature is so mezmerizing. Kid&#x27;s would love this as a night light.  It&#x27;s the perfect size for a bedroom or office!  I definitely want to get another one!!</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser. It&#x27;s right by my bed and helps me sleep with my favorite Young Living Essential Oils!!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser. My niece recommended this as an alternative to a more expensive brand..so far so good.</li>
            <li> I have used the Essential Wellness diffuser for three nights now and I have no complaints. I have only used the lavender oil. I am looking forward to experimenting with other oils.  I definitely would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> ****updated review**** I had rated this product with 5 stars and a glowing review.  However, I have had to change it.  Just a few days later it stopped working and it is only a couple of weeks old.  I am so sad because I loved this diffuser!  They are out of stock so I could not get a replacement, only a refund.  Thankful for Amazon customer service and the refund, but would have been so much happier with a working unity.  Going to try a different brand I guess.  First review (before it broke): This is my very favorite diffuser! I love how much mist comes out, how much water it holds and how long it stays on.</li>
            <li> I like the diffuser very much.  I had a little difficulty understanding how to set the timer but this is my first diffuser experience.  Once I figured out you were supposed to push the mist button until you got the time you wanted and that &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; meant stay on, I was happy.  The mist is good and I like that the machine is not noisy.</li>
            <li> Really consistent for two weeks, enjoyable way to fall asleep.</li>
            <li> I have only had the diffuser for a week but have ran it almost continually. I like that it holds 300ml of water so it runs longer. It is easy to operate and looks good no matter what room I have it in.</li>
            <li> This is a great diffuser at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 5 days, sent back for a full refund. I wanted to like this unit and indeed it was excellent while it worked, but any item that will not turn on after 5 days is a red flag for me. Will not be ordering another one.</li>
            <li> I like the 300ml capacity of this diffuser and it does a good job of diffusing long-lasting scent from my essential oils.  I have another diffuser from one of the essential oil companies, and the Essential Wellness works comparably but holds much more water.  My other diffuser sends its mist directly up out of the center of it.  The Essential Wellness diffuser sends its mist out of the top at an angle.  I think this would be a good feature if you are setting the diffuser up on a shelf, since you can aim the mist out towards the room instead of up at the wall.</li>
            <li> This is a great diffuser.  It is practically silent, has a nice sized section for the water which lasts a nice long time.  I am enjoying it now.  The colors change smoothly.  Great delivery, it came on time and in great condition..</li>
            <li> Awesome Lil diffuser!  Quiet and efficient.  Good value for money.  Getting one for each room now!</li>
            <li> This diffuser is perfect!  Our big one broke and I was worried that we would not find one that ran long enough.  After looking at tons, we chose this one.  It runs for hours!! Its a great size and super easy to clean!  Does great with my essential oils and doesn&#x27;t create any kind of troublesome buildup.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A simply good looking diffuser. Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for two weeks and I love it! It is really nice. I added some Eucalyptus essential oil drops and set it for two hours and it goes off when it is done. It is quiet and the colors you can use are great! It was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is great!  Has automatic shutoff and as long as you keep it filled up runs perfect.  It also changes colors.  I own another brand and it does not compare to this one.</li>
            <li> I got this thing and immediately started using it. It looks nice and is very good at diffusing the oils.</li>
            <li> Amazing product,  exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I received my order quickly. Diffuser works great. It runs quietly and i love how it changes color. Great customer service.</li>
            <li> I love this product. However I would say is the top can stick to the bottom and cause water to splash out. Also my numbers are worn off already. Which I&#x27;m not happy about.</li>
            <li> I bought this and another diffuser. This one worked really well -- I ended up returning the other one. I use it in my bedroom to diffuse lavender and eucalyptus oils. I like that you have the option to turn the light on or off. It does make a small amt of noise when running but I think it&#x27;s actually great minor white noise. I plan on buying a second one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times,  but so far I love it.  Easy to use and has great output.</li>
            <li> Works really well &amp; easy to operate. Love the color changing lights &amp; ability to set timer.</li>
            <li> Perfect for our family&#x27;s needs! I&#x27;ll soon be purchasing an additional one for our home. Easy to use and runs 10-12 hours. I did find that the first 1-2 times I ran this diffuser, it only lasted 6-8 hours. But now I easily get 10 hours out of it. My home smells lovely and I know that I&#x27;m helping my family each time I use it! I&#x27;ve diffused DoTerra oils including lemon, lavender, peppermint, OnGuard, and Breathe. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Very nice! Love all the settings! Great colors for the lights. Only wish that the light had a timer like the mist. In other words, if you just use the light, it stays on until you manually turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, outstanding customer service and reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I love my new defusor. I set it up with a allergy blend essential oil and turned it on at bedtime. No noise....Wonderful!  Husband slept like a baby and couldn&#x27;t figure out why! Haha</li>
            <li> I love it! This is my first diffuser and I have a big open flop plan I put it in the kitchen and the whole kitchen entry way and family room smell amazing:) good price and fast shipping. Light colors are pretty, although I don&#x27;t use them ,but it does take lots of water and oil BUT it does run 6 hours so I love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased a mister that changes colour, slowly going through the rainbow. When you add the aromatherapy oil to the water, it smells heavenly. Very easy to use and cleaning is a breeze. Very affordable and great value for the price. I&#x27;m going to order some for gifts.</li>
            <li> I searched reviews for weeks and I am so glad I went with this diffuser. It lasts a long time since it is 300ml instead of 100ml like several other well rated ones. It definitely fills the whole room so much that I can only use 3 drops of oil. I am using Plant Therapy Organic Lavender and Eden&#x27;s Gardens Organic oils and their Good Night. The lights are cool and the unit is very simple to use.</li>
            <li> I really like it. It works very well and love the night light part also. I am very pleased with this diffuser.</li>
            <li> we are not professionals on the subject, but of all the ones we looked at, this one had the best capacity, longest running, and we liked the esthetics of it.  The light function is nice, although we don&#x27;t use it when we are sleeping.  Very easy to use and take care of and the product description is straight forward and tru</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these and absolutely LOVE them. They last a lot longer and they work very well. Great price too!</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser . It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Great, quiet, seems like it can go forever!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! I love it</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesome...works great...the place smells wonderful, inviting and relaxing. The light show accompanying the diffuser is just as relaxing and therapeutic. I have so far purchased three and given one as a gift. I would also like to thank Essential Wellness for the great service - when Amazon was reading out-of-stock-  I inquired and you told me it would be back on the shelves in a matter of days...and it was! The best part of doing business with a company is their customer relations and yours is top notch! Thank you again ....I see a great relationship in our mutual futures.....this diffuser makes for wonderful gifts and I have several friends and family members in mind!</li>
            <li> I have had my diffuser for about 10 days and have been using it constantly. So far, I am very happy with it. I have mostly been using lavender oil for sleep and relaxation. I have to say that between the diffuser and the oil, I believe I&#x27;m sleeping better. I don&#x27;t love all of the light color choices, but it doesn&#x27;t matter because there are several to choose from depending on your mood, and there is a setting that let&#x27;s you choose brighter or more mute. You can also opt for no light. The stream is steady, and the fragrance is immediately dispersed. I hear a very subtle trickle of water that is actually soothing rather than distracting. I also hear a very light hum from the mechanism, but it&#x27;s very subtle. I have trouble sleeping, and it doesn&#x27;t keep me awake. I actually started feeling like I was getting sick, so I have been mixing my lavender with a combo of oils by &amp;#34;Now&amp;#34; called &amp;#34;Clear the Air&amp;#34; (peppermint, eucalyptus, hyssop, and rosemary), and I swear it has helped me with respiratory issues ( I&#x27;m not a doctor or health care professional, so do your research). I have only used distilled water, although I read that tap water is fine.  So far, I am very happy with my purchase. The only feedback I would give to the company is that I would prefer no writing on the unit, but that is my own personal aesthetic. Also, I would be interested in a slightly larger machine that could hold enough water for 24 hours of continuous use, so I didn&#x27;t have to refill as often. For me, it lasts about 8 hours although I have not specifically timed it.</li>
            <li> i like it it is great product.</li>
            <li> Works well, good value!</li>
            <li> My family loves this diffuser and I purchased a second one for my son&#x27;s room.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on other diffusers.  I did, and I wish I had known about this brand earlier on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased. Was less expensive than the ones I&#x27;m used to and I&#x27;m not dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> The Grand children love the color changing part.</li>
            <li> I purchased this particular diffuser because of the length of time it will run (6 hours).  It also has a large selection of colors it will change to if you want the light on.....or you can choose only one constant color.  It has a measuring cup that comes along with it, which is nice so you don&#x27;t have to  unplug the unit and take to the faucet or use a glass.  For the most part, I am very pleased with this product.  I was comparing it to a Young Living Diffuser which does not have the light options or the length of time to run.  The only difference I see is that the Young Living  seems to put out a heavier mist than this one does.  That is probably not an issue as this one does fill up the room quite well.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As per the rest of the reviews on here (which convinced me to purchase it), I must say this is a pretty simple easy to use product and it&#x27;s what you expect. Love it. It&#x27;s my first time stepping into &amp;#34;the essential oil realm&amp;#34;...I purchased pure lavender oil and this thing has my room smelling delightful. But NOT overbearing..just perfect. My brother loved it too so now I&#x27;m buying him one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And oh the light with the changing color thing..awesome. Huge added bonus.</li>
            <li> This diffuser works as advertised!. It is my first diffuser, so I have nothing to compare it to. It is very quiet, and throws the scent beautifully! The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it was designed poorly. The buttons are located on the back of the diffuser, and the notch for the cord is on the front, of all places! How dumb is that? I also don&#x27;t like that you plug the adapter cord into the underside of the unit making it very awkward to unplug when you need to clean it! Especially when they tell you not to tip it! I also wish it was pretty. It really isn&#x27;t much to look at unless the lights are on. By the way, this DOES beep when it shuts off, but not loudly.</li>
            <li> I use it every night to help me relax before I go to sleep!</li>
            <li> Great little diffuser that works well and provides a nice light show. Great 300Ml tank capacity runs for quite some time. Quiet operation with only minor water sounds. Not loud enough to be bothersome if placed in a sleeping area.</li>
            <li> Loved it from the first time I plugged it in. It&#x27;s easy to use and puts out a sufficient amount of mist.  The controls are straight forward and easy to use and  I love the light feature of which you can select a color or just let the color change randomly.  The automatic shut off feature was a must have for me and so far has worked like a charm.  I would definetely order this again.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been using the diffuser every day.  It&#x27;s very easy to use, quiet and works as expected. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works great so far!!! Its my first diffuse so I have nothing to compare it to. I live the multicolor setting. Its great!</li>
            <li> Almost imperceptible hum so able to sleep with it running. Haven&#x27;t used the auto power shut off when water runs out, but appreciate it just the same. Easy to clean. Using this with essential oils for aromatherapy. Chose this model for the 360 min. continuous run. It&#x27;s a little clumsy to open and close with liquid in it because my fingers always end up pressing the mist and/or light buttons but its not enough of a problem to not consider purchasing another. So far, a very good product. Shipping was quickl</li>
            <li> I have had several diffusers over the years, and this one falls in the &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; category.  I don&#x27;t love it, but I don&#x27;t hate it either.  It does last all night which I like.  The led lights are ridiculously bright, even when dimmed, so it can easily be used as a nightlight (the dimmed red is really the least bright and so we use that as a nightlight in my daughter&#x27;s room).  The mist is really, really light and is actually very difficult to tell whether the diffuser is actually working.  And ultimately, it gets the lowest scores for not really being able to smell it. I&#x27;ve been using it in my daughter 11x12 room and you truly cannot really smell it, unless you stick your nose in the very faint mist.  I&#x27;ve tried different types of oils and different amounts, but pretty much still the same: I cannot really smell it.  For the price, I had higher expectations.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome diffuser! Came quick, thanks to Amazon Prime and it was packaged securely. It has easy to follow care instructions and is easy to fill and use. The LED lights are great, the machine is quiet and I am a happy camper! The price is so good, I ordered 2, so my kids could each have one in their bedrooms, as they love the whole ESsential Oil diffusing thing! I just received a Young Living Essential Oil Starter kit last week and I have been diffusing ever since! 😃</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I use doTerra oils in it in my bedroom at night when I sleep.  I&#x27;ve only had to fill it twice since getting it.  I run it about 2 hours each night at bedtime.  It&#x27;s very quiet and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser!  I have another Young Living diffuser that is more expensive and not as nice as this one.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have only had this for a couple of days and have used both days. So far it has worked well and seems to be a great product.</li>
            <li> I love the capacity of this diffuser.  It is nice to have one that lasts more than an hour and the lights are an added attraction. Because I like mine so well I bought one for my daughter for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. Very quiet and efficient.  Fair price and good delivery</li>
            <li> I use this diffuser in my office to diffuse Thieves.  The diffuser was delivered on time and looks great.</li>
            <li> I did so much research before buying this diffuser. It had many features I liked (larger capacity, could handle citrus oils). The top is a little hard to put back on as others expressed. Wasn&#x27;t a total deal breaker though. The output was good and I could easily smell the oils. The lights work and are pretty. My issue is that I started to feel ill just after turning it on. I had nausea and light headedness and it got worse as the unit stayed on. I started to wonder after using it again the next day if it was the ionizer in the unit that was making me feel sick. So I did a quick google search and found that the ozone ionizers make can cause people to feel sick (my symptoms) and it&#x27;s actually not very good for you at all. In the questions some ask about the ionizer and people have responded regarding the mist output (showing that most people probably don&#x27;t even know what the ionizer is). The ionizer has nothing to do with mist output. The ionizer puts out negative ions that are supposed to clean the air. However, as a byproduct they produce ozone (think bad air quality). It can be very dangerous for those with breathing or lung issues. I will look for another unit that does not include an ionizer and I would suggest you look up what ionizers are before getting this unit to be sure it&#x27;s something you want in your home.</li>
            <li> I own 2 Whisper diffusers, that I absolutely love. But I wanted something different, something with more mist output. The Essential Wellness 300 ml Diffuser was the perfect choice for me. It can create mist from 300 ml of water in 10 hours vs 80 ml in 9 hours. That is such a benefit if you live in dry climates or suffer from coughs. This diffuser is very well thought out and well made. You have the option of having the light change colors, keep it at your favorite color or turn it off completely. It is almost completely silent, there is only a very slight hum. The only thing I wish would be added is a second slot for the cord in the back.  The first diffuser I received had a slight technical problem. Summersaults, a small family business, took care of it IMMEDIATELY. If every business was run like that the world would be a better place.</li>
            <li> I rarely review items - but felt this review was a must.  My DoTerra diffuser lasted 6 months -- and I was never really happy with the small mist stream.  This diffuser is amazing.  I love the settings!  I love the large amount of water which it holds.  I love the simplicity of how it connects.  I highly recommend it!  I moved from a humid area to a very dry area.  This mist allows me to sleep wonderfully.  I run it constantly!</li>
            <li> Love this unit. The large reservior 300ml and the different time settings (4) are all the reasons I chose to purchase this unit. It is super quiet very soothing and puts out the right amount of mist for the room size. It is so easy to fill, add oils, and clean. I debated on purchasing an additional unit for our home office but when my unit quit working after only a month or so I was concerned about the quality. I decided to go ahead and purchase another unit to replace the first one simply because I really like this one the best.  I received an email from the company thanking me for my purchase and I thought ok I&#x27;m going to ask and see if my old unit could be replaced. I replied to thier email and got a quick response and a confirmation that a new unit was on its way free of charge and no need to return it back. I have never received better customer service in my life.  Karen was so helpful, kind and so easy to work with that i will continue to buy from this company from now on. I now have two good working units and can enjoy them in different rooms of the house. This is a great company and a really good diffuser......I will recommend it to everyone I know!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic Diffuser! I really like the colors but also that you can turn it off (an option my last diffuser didn&#x27;t have). And their customer service is the best!</li>
            <li> using this diffuser with essential oils for our dog. easy to use and clean. Have used it for about 30 days, clean it and refill every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in the market for a diffuser since I started using EO&#x27;s and have been holding out until I found one I liked. I&#x27;m a singer, so a humidifier is pretty important to me and it&#x27;s great that this does both. The lights are definitely soothing, but can be a little bright if you&#x27;re turning them on while you sleep -- luckily, you don&#x27;t have to have them on at all while you&#x27;re using the diffuser. It has 3 timer settings - which is great, it will automatically shut off if the water runs out - which I love, and it&#x27;s QUIET! I would highly, highly recommend this diffuser!</li>
            <li> Now my more recent post !! I found out that they really stand behind their products. Customer Service was Fantastic. They sent me a new diffuser immediately. I am so happy with it now. Just love it. Changing stars for sure now.  Thank you !! Very disappointed - Diffuser would only turn on 1 time.  Now just beeps and shuts off.  Even My Chiropractor recommended this one.  I have informed her of the issue.  She was not happy either to hear it. Should be No Stars of course because it does NOT work.</li>
            <li> I love my diffuser. Maybe I&#x27;ll get another for downstairs</li>
            <li> This diffuser really is nice to use.  It works well and has a relaxing effect thru the light&#x27;s changing feature.  I like that you can turn the light off and still enjoy the diffusing while you drift off to sleep.  This is important to me, because I am light-sensitive...  My husband likes it and will add water, essential oil drops and start it if I haven&#x27;t already turned it on.  I am considering how one might be useful in my classroom...hmmm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about a week with not a single complaint.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have a more expensive diffuser, but prefer this one.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is great! I also own a more expensive one from Doterra and like this one better! It runs a long time, has auto shut off, it&#x27;s quiet and the light colors are nice, although a little bright for my baby&#x27;s room since i have it close to the crib. I will buy another one when I need for more rooms. Very happy!!!</li>
            <li> Great Product! Fast Shipping!!</li>
            <li> I like it. Diffuses well, just feels like an inexpensive product. May not last.&lt;br /&gt;flimsy/ overpriced</li>
            <li> I like that it is very long lasting and I can see the mist emitting from the machine.  It was a good price and love all the different color choices.</li>
            <li> Works great so far. No complaints. The changing lights are really pretty but very bright so if you&#x27;re trying to fall asleep don&#x27;t put the diffuser by your bed. I&#x27;m happy with the product overall</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter and her family, they LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> We live our essential defuser. Works just as well if not better then the more expensive doterra one we own. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> As a health fanatic and air quality lover.. I love my new Product. Put it beside my bed the other night.. I was in pain and could not unwind even though I was physically spent.. Started to relax right away and woke up early feeling rested and with energy! Great value well worth the expence! I have been having trouble with sleep and getting up to work this product is Fabulous! I will be buying another one for my living room</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. The product simply does what it is designed for. We use it nightly with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Works great, very quiet.  Will run all night on continuous mode, but can also be set for a specific time before it shuts off.  Love the larger capacity, works great in our large den.  I researched several of these before I settled on this one.  Got a personal email from someone at the company when I ordered it telling me to contact them if I had any questions or concerns once it arrived.  Impressed with customer service so far.  Bought two of these, but have only had them for a week or so now, so can&#x27;t attest to longevity.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of a aromatherapy diffuser.  I researched by reading reviews of countless diffusers and this one seemed to have everything I wanted with the best reviews. I&#x27;ve only had it a few days but it works as advertised with only one complaint which I can&#x27;t really complain about because I knew about it beforehand.  One of the reviewers mentioned that it has to be plugged into the wall and not into any type of extension cord.  If I didn&#x27;t know that beforehand I might have thought it was defective.  I love this diffuser because it really does the job.  I would prefer it if I could plug it into an extension cord but other than that you can&#x27;t go wrong if you purchase this item.</li>
            <li> Wonderful diffuser/humidifier. The color changes really enhance this product. It is quiet, has different timer settings and when you fill the well, it lasts for days if you are running it for 1 hour at a time (I put it on the 60 minute setting before bedtime). I add a combo of lemongrass and lavender essential oils which creates a really nice calm ambiance.</li>
            <li> I love this. Enjoy the different lights also.</li>
            <li> This diffuser worked great the first time. I&#x27;ve tried several times to use it again and while the lights come on no water or oils are diffused. It started and stopped several times and now nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: customer service is amazing!  They replaced my defective diffuser with a new one. This one works perfectly.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it! I especially like the larger capacity so I can enjoy my scented oils even more.</li>
            <li> I like this item. It does hold a lot of water and lasts a long time. It is very quiet too.</li>
            <li> Great product...works great and I love it</li>
            <li> This diffuser is great. Lasts all night. Nice and quiet also.</li>
            <li> Quit working after a few weeks. I likes the small size but not quality product. Amazon did refund my money after I returned it. First item to be returned.</li>
            <li> I love that it has a big water chamber and can be set to stay on for 60, 180, 360 minutes.  It is super quiet and easy to clean.  The product arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Excellant diffuser, will run 8 hours, perfect for my use</li>
            <li> This diffuser works great for a bedroom or a room that is not very large. I like the timer and the larger size water tank. The colored lights are fun but I usually have them off.</li>
            <li> I sent a email last week...Ive only had this a few weeks and it already doesnt work well....i turn it on before I go to sleep at night and I have to turn it off in the morning....it never runs out of water....dont know if I can return for a new one...</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser so far. I am new to essential oils and diffusers in the last month and have read lots of reviews and done a lot of research. My work office has been infested with sickness for months so I am happy to have it here now to ward off the bacteria, fungus and virus. I use a 4 thieves essential oil and it smells great at the office and the colors of the lights are fun. I love that the diffuser had time settings or can run continuous for up to 10 hours that way I have purified and therapeutic air all day at the office. I will order more to replace some at home once they are back in stock. Don&#x27;t fall for the cheap versions out there, I did and they do not work long and a pain to clean.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I&#x27;ve used it a few times with excellent results.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this diffuser! We received our order quickly and the packaging is so pretty! The manual was very straight forward and this diffuser is easy to use and I love how it looks. I&#x27;ve used multiple other diffusers previously to purchasing this one and I have to say this one defintely tops them all! I highly recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li> Really love this diffuser, I love the color lights &amp; different variations.  Diffusses a great mist, runs a long time, and whisper quiet. I will be getting another one for my house.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is perfect!  It&#x27;s easy to use, very quiet and I love the choice between the three timer settings.  I use this one in my kitchen as the 300 ml size is good for a larger space.</li>
            <li> Love my diffuser so far!</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with the diffusers - I bought one for myself and one for my daughter&#x27;s birthday.  I researched so many different types and brands for the last three months and this is the only diffuser that met my needs.  For me, it is a combination of the best qualities of all of them.  I have been using mine with various combinations of Essential Oils - in different rooms - experimenting with the awesome changeable colors (or no color at all - your choice), the four easily changeable timed settings - the ease of operating and cleaning. It scents the air very quickly.  One of the features I truly love (and is not sold with this reason - it is just what I think) is the fact that when my fur family investigates the new &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; mom bought - the mist is super fine and cool so the kits cannot get burned - and nothing gets in their eyes - or hurts them in any way.  So, Essential Wellness, you did a fantastic job on this well thought out diffuser - and I hope you like the plug for &amp;#34;kitty safe&amp;#34; diffusing!</li>
            <li> I started off my diffuser use with a 100ml sized one and realized it has to be filled too often. This one is good because being 300 ml it will go all night. There&#x27;s nothing special about its design otherwise, but it&#x27;s a handy purposeful product.</li>
            <li> I have never purchased a diffuser before but am very satisfied with my first purchase of this diffuser. It was extremely easy to set up and I really like how there are 4 timer settings so I don&#x27;t have to remember to turn it off later. The light feature is a very nice touch and I even sleep with it at night, but also like how you can turn off the light if needed. My essential oils have been diffused nicely thus far and overall I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m buying another one to give to my brother-in-law for his 50th b&#x27;day. i love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a little less than a week. So far I am pleased. The smell from the oils is strong and the water lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this oil diffuser!  It is so easily to fill, has a decent liquid capacity and it&#x27;s awesome that it has timer options.</li>
            <li> Bought one of these diffusers for myself a few months ago, and I love it!  I use it in my bedroom and it works great.  I recently bought another one for my daughter and hope she enjoys hers as much as I do mine.  Great value for the money!</li>
            <li> The diffuser stopped working after 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love my new diffuser! It works great and I&#x27;m planning on buying another one soon.</li>
            <li> Bought these to replace the ones that ruined the finish on my wood tables. On continuous run last for about 8 hours and like the light colors. So far very happy but only gave 4 stars because am still waiting to see how they do with my tables.</li>
            <li> I have had several diffusers and can recommend this one. The only real draw backs are the fact that the chord plugs into the bottom of the same cavity that you fill with water and oil, so you must unplug it each time you take it to refill and that you must hit a button many, many times to turn the light off if using the diffuser at night.But it runs continuously for ten hours, which is a nice perk. Like many diffusers, it also has the auto shut off safety feature and multiple lighting color and intensity settings. The diffuser itself is virtually silent, so the only noise it makes is the gentle splashing of water that occurs during operation. The one-year guarantee makes it an easy sell.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser with all the extras and it is easy to work.</li>
            <li> Very nice, easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for one week but all seems to be working well. My kids like the color changing feature.</li>
            <li> Other then the lid getting jammed a bit if not lined up exactly correct I love it.  Being able to run it 6 hrs is a big plus</li>
            <li> I went through three other diffusers (returning them all), before finally finding this one. It&#x27;s AWESOME! Quiet, powerful, lots of timing and lighting options. High-end quality for middle of the line price! If you&#x27;re searching for the best diffuser this is the one! :)</li>
            <li> I am happy with the purchase of my Essential Wellness 300 ml Oil Diffuser. It is simple to operate and clean and will run several hours on one filling. Simple and unobtrusive look and design fit my decor nicely. My kids like the changing lights but honestly j don&#x27;t use the lights very often.&lt;br /&gt;The only improvement I would want is that the mist be directed higher. It comes out at about a 45 degree angle, and sitting on an end table I felt the scent was not being dispersed throughout the room. I placed it in a higher location and now I can smell the oils on my entire main floor of my smallish bungalow.</li>
            <li> I started looking for a product that would mist but also be able to use essential oils. I finally came across this one, and I love it! It&#x27;s small enough to travel with. My daughter has allergies so when we do travel, I take this with and its fantastic! Many people have complained about the yellowing inside. Yes it does, but that is because it needs to be cleaned. I clean mine after every 3-4 uses. It cleans wonderfully and the yellowing has never caused any issues. I would recommend using high quality oils. The colors are a little bright, even on the lowest setting, but I don&#x27;t use the lights. Its peaceful and has a little noise to the machine which I consider white noise. But overall a great product. I have had no issues!</li>
            <li> Overall I did like the diffuser, the steam it produces is good. With full capacity, it runs for over 10 hours. It is easy to fill and rinse. The buttons are on the back side away from the steam opening and it feels awkward finding and pressing them there, but not a big problem.&lt;br /&gt;However, on my unit I have noticed that after just two times that I have rinsed it, the markings for the timer and the buttons were already wiping off and smearing around. Also when the water fell below 100 ml the steam was barely noticeable. Could have been a bad unit. The seller was very kind and refunded me promptly. They also had reached out to me initially to inquire whether I was satisfied with my purchase.  Excellent customer service and communication.</li>
            <li> I shopped styles and price before purchase. Decided on this one from reviews. Very happy with it. Use it daily.</li>
            <li> This product was as described, arrived in excellent condition, fast service. I was looking for a diffuser that would use tap water because when we travel I take one with me and it is not always possible to take or get distilled water. The description does not say it will use tap water but I read a lot of the reviews and found one review that mentioned using tap water. When I received the diffuser the instructions did state that you could use tap water.  I have only had it for  one day but I have several other diffusers and it is really nice that this one will run for at least 9 hours. It is simple to use but in order for it to run longer that 360 minutes you have to push the mist button until the ON  light comes on. I would recommended this to anyone that uses essential oils or even as a humidifier for a small room.</li>
            <li> Beautiful addition to room as the diffuser is well designed and attractive. It definitely works as outlined in the description. I look forward to using my diffuser for many years to come.</li>
            <li> I have never had anything work as well dispersing the wonderful scent of essential oils all over the house. You actually have to follow directions and use just a few drops or else it will overpower your nose. So at this rate I can use it all the time which makes the oils very cost effective. Would order it again in a skinny minute.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with the diffuser!  It is easy to use and has a great output.  My kids love the color changing effect.  I filled it up and it diffused for about 8 hours.  This will be perfect for diffusing at night all winter long! Great price! I plan to buy another soon!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great diffuser!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as my first diffuser, and while I was a little hesitant to spend so much money on my first one, I LOOOOOVE this diffuser!! It is quiet, but covers a good amount of space. I love that it has various timer options, one of which is an automatic shut off whenever it runs out of water. We use this through the whole night and it runs about 8 hours (maybe a little bit more) if you fill it to the max line. It is lightweight, and easy to move around. We only have this one diffuser right now, so we carry it back and forth between our bedroom and living room (we live in a small apartment). We have been using this diffuser for about a week now and have had no issues, and my only complaint is that it drips when you take the top off, but I imagine that is hard to avoid with any diffuser, so I&#x27;m not greatly upset about it. If we ever purchase a second one, I would most likely buy another one of these unless we need a little smaller of one.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser! I have ran it every day for the past couple months and I have had no issues. I do clean it every week though too.  This makes the rooms smell good and has helped with the dry weather and I have been thinking about get more for other rooms.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser!  It runs for a longer period than any I&#x27;ve seen. Plus it diffuses out to the side rather than straight up. This is really nice for bedtime!</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser!! Love it!  I had never used one before, but it seemed reasonably priced for what it does so decided to try this one.  It works a long time.  It has multiple different color settings or can change from color to color.  I use on the top of our high counter in our kitchen which is between two main living areas.  It releases the oils and makes all three rooms smell wonderful.  I have only used it with one type oil so far, but it works.  I&#x27;m thinking about getting the same kind for our master bedroom/bathroom.</li>
            <li> Customer service is on top of its game. Received an email thanking me for my purchase, asking that I contact them right away with any problems or concerns (nothing major yet) and asking me for a review after I&#x27;d tried out the product. Four stars because the unit was blissfully easy to set up &amp; operate and very quiet for the most part. I say most part because the unit had a very faint squeaking sound after a couple hours of operation, but I want to wait and run it a few more times before revising my review. Love the timer &amp; light options, the EO blend I put into the water came out strong &amp; filled my office but didn&#x27;t encroach into my colleagues spaces or the adjacent hallway. Am taking it home to see how it fares in a larger room. I have signed up for the 1 year warranty and am curious to see what being a VIP (no extra cost for either) will include. Stay tuned!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little workhorse! I&#x27;ve been using it pretty heavily since purchasing and it has been consistent and effective. So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Nice diffuser small but runs all night.  I just got it and I hope it continues to run for many years!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love my diffuser. I&#x27;ve used it non stop for the last week &amp; I am very impressed with the quality. Compared to others I looked at this holds twice as much water &amp; is half the price! It&#x27;s pretty to look at as well. I use it downstairs &amp; we have an open floor plan that is approx 1000 sq ft &amp; it is powerful enough to notice the essential oils in any area. I will be buying more in the near future for our bedrooms.shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> So far I love it. I wish it looked a little stylish but I just ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li> I do really like it especially because of its large water capacity. I would have given it 5 stars if it had a timer that ran the diffuser for say 30 minutes on, 30 minutes off. The timer options only let you choose large chunks of time (e.g. 60, 180 min) and then turns itself off. So you either have to leave it running all the time or you have to keep turning it on after it finished its time cycle. I have another diffuser which does have the 20 min interval timer but it has a very small water capacity so I&#x27;m refilling it frequently, which is frustrating too.</li>
            <li> Large capacity runs all night in our large bedroom.</li>
            <li> Really like the diffuser.  It was easy  to set up, love the changing colors and the mist with the essential oils is very enjoyable. I&#x27;m thinking of ordering my granddaughter one.</li>
            <li> Best one I have ever had, and I have bought many diffusers!!! It holds more water which is great.  Love it!</li>
            <li> It requires too much effort to take apart to fill and requires cleaning. Do like its large capacity.</li>
            <li> My NOW diffuser died after 4 months so I took a chance on this one, based on reviews. It&#x27;s so quiet, just a slight bubbling but I have to really listen for it to hear it. I tank pleasantly surprised with how much mist it creates, and I really like the different setting options and being able to direct the mist outward instead of just straight up like others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it yesterday and I&#x27;ve already received 2 very kind emails from them (not the usual annoying ones from sellers)... one thanking me and one asking if I need anything. Nice touch!</li>
            <li> Love this difusser. Reasonable priced, multiple time setting, auto shut-off, does not sweat, nice soft changing color lights that can be turned off. Everything I want in a difusser! I have 2. Great customer service from seller!!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser and the customer service is outstanding!!! I bought one for my mom as a gift because I liked it so much, and she loves hers too!!</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today and I love this!!!  The instructions are so easy to follow they make set up beyond simple and fool proof.  I added my own mix of fabulous doterra oils and now I&#x27;m enjoying my Sunday afternoon.  Of course only time will tell if this diffuser will hold up to continued use but I have a good feeling about the company that stands behind this product.  They have been so kind in contacting me to make sure that I got the product that it was in perfect working order and that I&#x27;m happy with it. Even more impressive if I register my diffuser online they will guarantee my diffuser for a whole year.  So far my diffuser has been going about three hours it has a very steady flow of steam and the fragrance has filled my kitchen dining room living room and hallway.  Anything that makes my house smell this good without the danger of an open flame or artificial fragrance is awesome.  Don&#x27;t get me started on the endless light options unless you are color blind there is definitely a color that will appeal to your visual senses. Obviously I&#x27;m very happy with my diffuser.</li>
            <li> My diffuser arrived in a very timely manner and was packed well and had no issues. It is wonderful and I feel it does s great job!</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Preforms just as I had hoped</li>
            <li> I love the packaging and the over-all presentation of this product. The instructions are brief yet concise which is perfect. User-friendly. Once running it is quiet and efficient.  Five stars.</li>
            <li> It is light weight.  Wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> This unit has it all. Multiple light colors, four timed settings with the longest at 6 hours, subtle design, and the perfect size. Continuous mist diffuses oil fragrances evenly throughout the room. My favorite feature: it runs QUIETLY. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this diffuser for a week. It has really helped me with some respiratory issues when I use the germ fighter synergy essential oil. I have not experienced any problems with how the diffuser functions. I have told several friends about it.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is one of the best diffuser .It is very quiet . You can easily forget it&#x27;s on . I like that it has different settings and it shuts off when it&#x27;s out of water . I will definitely buy one or two more for my other rooms .</li>
            <li> I have been using this diffuser almost non-stop since I got a couple of days ago. Shipping was quick and the I had the diffuser working within a few minutes of receiving it. This diffuser is a wonderful way to utilize various essential oils I have gotten from the health food store. I  like the fact that this diffuser can be used as an air purifier, ionizer, and humidifier as well as a night light. This unit is easy to clean, however sometimes the top part of diffuser is hard to remove, so I put on a pair of thin rubber gloves which helps. This is the first ultrasonic diffuser I have purchased, and I am very pleased with my purchase, I would love to have this diffuser in every room of the house.</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser.  When I became interested and acquainted with essential oils I realized I needed a diffuser.  I found this diffuser on Amazon. It is easy to use  and I would purchase another one!</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this diffuser.  I&#x27;m new to essential oils, but this diffuser has totally won me over.  It is quiet, easy to use, and is just perfect.  I have no complaints with this seller, nor with the item.  Amazing customer service as well.  I hope to purchase more of these as my kids are already begging for one in each of their rooms.  It was a great decision to go with this diffuser; I did lots and lots of research on the best one, and read tons and tons of reviews.  The light is a nice feature, but I am glad it is able to be turned off as well.  I also love that it is larger and is able to run throughout the night so I can enjoy my lavender!! :)  It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have only been using my diffuser for a week or so now, but I would give it a thumbs up.  It is very quiet, and I love the fact that it will run for more than a half hour if I choose.  I only gave it four starts because I do find it a bit difficult to remove the cover when refilling,  The position of the power button gets in the way when I try to remove the cover and sometimes I inadvertently turn the machine on when I am not intending to.  But overall I am happy so far with the unit.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I like the shape and design - some of the others just look too &amp;#34;new age&amp;#34; or futuristic. Price was a little higher a few others I had looked at, but for 10 hour capacity it is well worth it. Multiple time settings are very helpful!  I don&#x27;t use the lights at night, but for day use they are very pleasant. Easy to fill, easier to operate.</li>
            <li> It works ok but the white noise it emits is annoying.  I prefer silence to white noise for sleeping and find it distracting</li>
            <li> I purchased for a gift so I am unsure at this time to comment but it looks really cool!</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser and chose this because of quality, looks, capacity and price.&lt;br /&gt;I really love this diffuser and am planing on buying a second one for my living room.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser! It is beautiful when lit.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser and company! The company contacted me immediately to make sure I was completely satisfied with the purchase, and I most certainly was! The product is very quiet and gives of an ultra fine mist with a continuous flow. I also love the fact that it has a timer and an automatic shut off mechanism, in the event the water chamber runs low. The LED lighting is also perfect in giving off a calming lighting effect, which is great to use at bedtime for a nightlight. I have already recommended this product to my friends who are attending an essential oil party I am hosting, instead of purchasing the very expensive diffusers that are being sold by other companies. HIGHLY recommend this diffuser!</li>
            <li> Very solid unit with sturdy base.  I personally do not like it as much as my young living diffuser as the mist is not as strong.  Works best in a smaller room, esp kids because it is very quiet!  My daughter didn&#x27;t even realize it was in her room :)</li>
            <li> Great size, easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> The first diffuser had a small squeeking sound in the fan, I contacted the company and they quickly replaced it. The replacement makes a small white noise which is easily ignored. The diffuser lasts all night which is helpful for my son who sometimes likes a soothing scent in his room at night. I love the different lighting options.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser.  I love the color changing options and also that it diffuses for so long.  Happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Light mist, disperse essential oils into the room well I love this great to use to wind down in the evening it just makes the room and your mood more relaxed when an essential oil relaxing blend or just lavender essential oil is put into the diffuser and the lights which are not to bright if you chose to put them in just adds to the mood, I like the blue light  I just set the light on this one color, again nice and soft in color and not too bright.</li>
            <li> Love the many colors and the choices of timers for my diffuser. Let&#x27;s me go to sleep knowing it will turn off automatically .</li>
            <li> This Product is awesome, I have as of today order a total of four (4), I gave one to my daughter who live in NY and I have three (3) in different rooms in my house.  I live in Florida, which is the BUG Capital of the USA and I hate bugs!  I place one of these at all opened doors and I use the essential oil &amp;#34;peppermint, lemongrass, eucalyptus oils&amp;#34; it seems to keep the bugs at bay and my whole house smells good! I am glad I didn&#x27;t listen to all the negative reviews, what I like also is that when the water is all gone the unit stops automatically and it will run for at least 6/8 hours.  all users should know that the top has a black dot on the bottom side and if you look inside you will see that these dots have to line up in order for it to lock in place, and that you have to hole the start button for at lease 2 seconds to hear the beep and then after 3 beeps it is at the highest level, if you let it beep four times it will shut off!  There are many people who are doing this wrong and are writing reviews that say things like this item &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t work!&amp;#34;  Well if you do it right I am sure you will enjoy this as much as I have, and those damn bugs will have met their match.</li>
            <li> Okay so the diffuser turns on, lights up &amp; that&#x27;s pretty much it. It produce very light steam w/ faint smell. I used 8 drops of my Ylang Ylang oil &amp; unless I was standing right by side this unit I really could not smell the scent. Don&#x27;t waste you time falling for the lies of paid reviews. I am sick of being mislead because someone got a free item, extra discount or has decided to be a PT reviewer it hopes to get something free. Now I&#x27;m not mad that others received units of free BUT have some integrity for heavens sakes!  That said I do not recommend this product/merchant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone could recommend another diffuser that would be great. Anyway thanks for your time :-)</li>
            <li> We love our Essential Wellness 300ml Ultrasonic diffuser! At first I thought 300ml was a little big, but now I love it. It is very user friendly, easy to understand directions, and the kids love the colored lights. We highly recommend this diffuser and will be getting a second one!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  Just pull off the covering to add water and oild and then snap the cover back on.  I&#x27;ve had other diffusers that had multiple pieces to pull apart, this is one step and very easy.  Also easy to press the buttons to turn on the lights and the machine.  I used it yesterday and after 6 hours it was still going strong.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is awesome. I like that the essential oil is diffused with no heat. It has so many quality features such as the different time settings and the different light options. I had occasion to visit with customer service, and their helpfulness was over the top.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great product for the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best diffuser I have.  It runs for a long time and has the biggest capacity of many on the market.  Good price for the money and it is very good quality. I love it.  The company was nice and helpful.</li>
            <li> I Love this diffuser! It arrived on time and as expected. I am truly enjoying how easy it is to use. I am very happy with it!!</li>
            <li> I researched long and hard before I decided on a diffuser.  I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this one. It&#x27;s so easy to use, It will run all night and the lights are an extra added bonus. I love that it has all the settings, different timings and colors can change or set to one color. My kids love it and have already asked for one for their rooms. Definitely pleased!!!</li>
            <li> The Essential Wellness 300 ml Unisonic Diffuser is a very good product.  I love the shape of it, as it fits in well with any room design.  The order was shipped promptly and arrived in perfect condition.  It is easy to assemble and operate.  I&#x27;ve received compliments on it already.  I like the fact that it ionizes the air as well as sending out a mist.  Great product.  It gets five stars from me!</li>
            <li> A little cheaper looking than i expected for the price. Only used it 1 day so far. Do not smell the oil, could be because it is one i have had for a while. Stay tuned for details.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple weeks. I have been using EO diffusers for 3+ years and this is the BEST diffuser yet. This is my 6th diffuser and THE BEST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I like the mist shooting out at an angle (not straight up) and also the amount of mist is wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Large water reservoir&lt;br /&gt;Some diffusers bubble out the oils rapidly, the oils last as long as the mist&lt;br /&gt;This runs all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: (sort of)&lt;br /&gt;The instructions advise to not use acidic substances. We have hard water and I have used vinegar to clean my other diffusers.</li>
            <li> I chose this because of the timer. Easy to use. Diffuses very well. Haven&#x27;t used the light yet but I plan to.</li>
            <li> I really love it. It can go up to 10 hrs and i like to put it on and if i wake up i can click it on again. I don&#x27;t waste as much oils as i do with other diffusers. The night light is the best one ever!!! Looking forward to getting another one next month.</li>
            <li> love this diffuser!  I use it at night with Breathe oil to clear my sinuses.  Lets out just the right amount of mist and can run all night.</li>
            <li> This is a great diffuser that holds 300ml of water so it runs a long time. The buttons (controls) are easy to use. I have 4 diffusers and this is my favorite one.</li>
            <li> I received this diffuser promptly. I also received an email from the seller saying that if I am not satisfied to please let them know. I have been shopping for a diffuser for a long time and I liked this one. It&#x27;s very attractive, easy to use and so far I love it! I have in my bedroom and it may be a coincidence, but I slept through the night for the first time in ten years, I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 days, but I think I made a good choice. If something changes, I&#x27;ll post again.</li>
            <li> Great machine and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love it! Fast delivery and works flawlessly.</li>
            <li> The ultrasonic diffuser has been working as expected and now I have to find the right amount (number of drops) oil to get the desired ambiance.</li>
            <li> this works great for going to sleep-like your in another world with lavender oils.</li>
            <li> This is a great diffuser - it runs for hours! The multi colored lights are a nice feature that you are able to have on or not.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased 4 of these, one for me ~ 3 as gifts for my children. Everyone agrees, this diffuser is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Good product - inexpensive, easy to use and simple and clean look</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!  It is simple to use and diffuses for a LONG time!</li>
            <li> After doing a lot of research, I decided to give this  diffuser a try. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks. This is my first and only diffuser so I cannot compare to any others. I absolutely love this diffuser. I like the tank size and the fact that I do not need to refill it nightly. I have it set to run 6 hours a night. Item is easy to clean. I love the different color lighting options. It&#x27;s nice &amp; pretty for a background light while laying in bed reading/watching tv. I shut the lighting off just as I&#x27;m about to fall asleep as it would be to bright for me personally. Others may not mind. I&#x27;m the type to wear a sleep mask to block out all light. I do wish that the on/off/lighting buttons were placed on the front of the diffuser. Maybe that can be done if the item is ever redesigned. It&#x27;s definitely not a deal breaker though. My biggest problem is that I now want a couple more  diffusers for other rooms in my house. At least I know what to ask for as a birthday gift. I would ask for this same product/brand.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! So quiet. I am really going to enjoy it. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> We have had the diffuser about 1 week and it works great.  It is easy to fill, will run for as long as 10 hours and is very quiet.  Additionally shipment was quick.</li>
            <li> This is my second diffuser,love my first diffuser,disappointed in this one! The cover sticks and hard to attach,not very eye appealing,I do like the 7 different colors,but would not purchase another one like this.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice, easy to use diffuser.  It is easy to fill and empty, and can use tap water.  The user can select the length of time for steady &amp;#34;misting&amp;#34; (60, 180, 360 min, or continuous).  I was surprised to see how much was diffused by this unit,  having used another type that had a very light output.  The color lights progress through 7 colors, and can be paused on a preferred color.</li>
            <li> I really like this diffuser, It has a big water resevoir and has a timer to run for either 60 min, 180min or 360 minutes.  The lights on it are awesome, you can choose your color or opt for the changing colors. Customer service is great!</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Produces lots of mist; much more than our prior unit. It is a little tough to remove the top, but doable.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot.  It really will run about 10 hours.  And the colored lighting is nice if you want it.  Easy to use.  And I love that it uses tap water.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is super quiet, runs all night and the nite light is very pretty. It is well worth the money. I love it! I diffuse a sleep blend of essential oils at night and a meditation blend when I study.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift. They really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I am loving my diffuser, and I am enjoying playing with different oil combinations.  My sleep has also been improved since using the diffuser at night.  I absolutely recommend this product, and I will likely be purchasing a 2nd one to use downstairs in my home.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this diffuser! It is beautiful, balanced, made well &amp; I love the features. Seems to distribute very well in a room. Didn&#x27;t even have to leave on all night because it filled the room so nicely &amp; quickly but love the all night option. Pleasantly surprised. Ordered new after much comparison and for the price, I absolutely love it!!! Myrel with Essential Wellness customer service is fantastic</li>
            <li> I love this auto-shut off diffuser.  We have it set up in our bedroom with primarily Lavender for a great night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> delivered quickly. Product was exactly as described. It runs quietly and my boys love the light options. I would definitely buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> Best diffuser ...  excellent value.  Quiet. Long running.  Easy to clean.  Clear directions on proper use and care.  Love the lights (which can be turned off if you prefer). I plan to buy another.</li>
            <li> Love it easy to use very quiet arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the bedroom.</li>
            <li> This is the first diffuser I ever purchased and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser. I did a LOT of research trying to find a diffuser that would work in my bedroom and work all night long. My fiance has terrible allergies and would snore all night long. Since we have started diffusing oils while we sleep he snores less and we both woke up feeling rested.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Essential Wellness 300 ml Ultrasonic. Not only is the unit beautiful to use, it runs quiet and gives you the ultimate essential oil experience. The customer service is outstanding! I had some questions and emailed the company and got a response the next day that resolved my issue. They go out of their way to make sure you are happy with their product.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is great!  💛💙💜💚 the lights and big reservoir.</li>
            <li> Received my diffuser as promised.  I have been using it for the past 3 nights and it works exactly as advertised.  Easy to fill and operate - so far so good!</li>
            <li> It is a great diffuser. I bought two, one for home, and one for my office. Today is my third day using it. It works great. Easy to use. Modern design.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li> This is the diffuser I have been looking for!  It lasts all night with a strong stream of vapor.  I don&#x27;t use the light and the unit doesn&#x27;t have a bright glow. The best part is that it is so quiet. There is a very soft hum which I hardly ever hear.  If it lasts a long time, it will be the perfect package.  I have only had mine for a week, and will update as time goes by.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had this product and I loved it, so I bought one and love it!! Works great!</li>
            <li> The Essential Wellness diffuser works great so far. It is easy to fill, is very quiet when running and I like the option to have a color on or off. I also like the option to have it on for 1, 3 or 6 hours. Depending on how long I am home I can set it and forget it.</li>
            <li> Love the run time options and lighting. Easy to fill. Only complaint is that you hear water trickling sound when it it running. Sometimes bothersome at night</li>
            <li> Received this yesterday and will be returning it shortly. Seems very cheaply made, awkward to use, and we could not smell the oil being diffused.</li>
            <li> I love the lights and the large capacity.</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser. I keep it on my night stand.</li>
            <li> I received this and it did not even turn on. Returned for full refund</li>
            <li> I did some research on which type of diffuser to buy; pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s about all.  On the advice of a friend who has been using diffusers for awhile, she liked this type the best. I have to agree. Works like a champ, and hopefully I have seen the last of tea lights for warmers, even though they work .</li>
            <li> Love the product and the seller was super quick with responding to my questions. I will definitely looking for this seller on any items I buy in the future. Actual real life quality assurance being completed. This product does a great job of releasing the full potential of essential oils into the air.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase and love having it on especially at night when the colors are changing. It is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> Not only do I love the diffuser I bought, but the experience with this company was awesome! They sent multiple emails to ensure that my package arrived safely and that I was pleased with my purchase. The item shipped so fast! I bought the six most common essential oils and they are all great as well. My apartment smells fresh and fantastic! Great buying experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this less than 1 week and have used it daily.  So far, it has been a wonderful addition to my aroma therapy collection.  I will continue using this unit and update my review if necessary.  I love the timer settings and the many options you have with the light settings.  Including the &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; light option.</li>
            <li> Nice size, and good output.</li>
    </ol>
