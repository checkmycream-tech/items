            <li>I sometimes will mix it with shea butter (no fragrances) and that works good too.</li>

            <li>Amazing healing oil.  </li>
            <li>I take into account the time it takes for skin to heal on its own.</li>
            <li>A very happy buyer here so far....</li>
            <li>the older I become.&lt;br /&gt;After using just the Emu Oil on me, I have seen an incredible improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It seems okay, but</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I am telling friends weekly to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>A quality product you skin will love.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great price.</li>
            <li>If you using this just for hair moisturizing, skin moisturizing, etc., then it probably is okay.</li>
            <li>I use it in my hair and have found better, ever for hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item for my wife, her skin looks fabulous!</li>
            <li>My favorite Emu oil is still from thunder valley.</li>
            <li>Pretty good for these types of oils.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This one is the best because it doesn&#x27;t STINK like every other emu oil I have bought.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel compelled to try any others since ths one works just fine.</li>
            <li>Cant wait to see with continued use if it will help a scar on my face and un-define the fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>However, it seems to rub in just fine.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use a lot of commercial moisturisers, so this is great.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily and am happy.</li>
            <li>I really do like this one, seems more potent for my intended needs.</li>
            <li>Great stuff for my super dry face and no \\&quot;product smell\\&quot;, just soothing light oil that goes into your skin in about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to get pure , unrefined Emu oil from Australia as there are a lot of bogus ones on the market.</li>
            <li>it really helps my skin look better.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve found this, it sure seems to do very well.</li>
            <li>I like this product as a carrier oil as it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>the future, I will pay more attention, and probably pay more, to purchase a product that states that the EMU oil is 100%...</li>
            <li>but the fact that it does leads me to believe that its pretty genuine.</li>
            <li>I have used another brand before, was even more expensive than this Australia Naturals Emu Oil, all I can say is that this one works better based on my own personal experience, so happy that I purchased this at Amazon</li>
            <li>well worth it.</li>
            <li>This emu oil helps my skin heal in a pretty safe and effective way.&lt;br /&gt;There is a minimal amount of Vitamin E in this product, a .00022% to be exact.  </li>
            <li>So overall, you get a decent product, lots of it, for a good price.</li>
            <li>Although, I am not disappointed with this product, I am very suspicious that it has been cut with something else.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my makeup looks as good using this one as the other brand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other emu oils and have found this to be superior.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order again when I need more</li>
            <li>Do you kill them first, then mash them up, then put them in a press?</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it seems to become more sensitive</li>
            <li>At first I was using wayyyy too much.</li>
            <li>I do not believe this pure EMU oil.</li>
            <li>If you looking for a pure oil, you probably should look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I needed a large bottle to tend to some scars.</li>
            <li>I admit I really didn&#x27;t know anything about Emu Oil.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think it was doing much until I missed a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>It really makes a difference for me.</li>
            <li>I have always used Emu oil and  it really works for my arthritis.</li>
            <li>bottle for twice as much money as I paid for the 8 oz.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought 2 bottles of this brand of emu oil now, and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find that this helped in particular, at least in immediate relief/results, but seems to be good for the skin.</li>
            <li>I avoid using traditional lotions because they are full of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>This emu oil is decent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to keep using it regularly to gauge its effectiveness but so far I&#x27;m not disappointed</li>
            <li>and my skin has been so soft all day!  </li>
            <li>The oil is creamy white and has no odor which is better than the oil I was buying previously.</li>
            <li>apply before bedtime, wake up to soft and healed hands.</li>
            <li>but it is expensive considering it doesn&#x27;t smooth on like most lotions but is rather for specific applications.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really tried it on my skin yet, but will do so later.</li>
            <li>for your feet, apply it then put on an old pair of cotton socks at bedtime.</li>
            <li>Odd since I live in a very hot and humid region of the nation.</li>
            <li>I am African American, and my child has coarse hair, it really helped with managebility.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it for muscle aches, joint pains, rashes, burns, facial break outs and shingles.</li>
            <li>I decided to just use the Australia Naturals Emu Oil only and directly on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I will highly recommend this product for anyone with dry skin or psoriasis, etc.</li>
            <li>On my skin that isn&#x27;t so dry, it is so soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Brand&lt;br /&gt;which isnt as good but less expensive.</li>

            <li> Have used Emu oil before long ago and didnt stick with it, because of local cost.</li>
            <li> The little over 99% of the product is emu oil.&lt;br /&gt;Whether a person has sensitive skin or not, I would recommend this emu oil to everyone.</li>
            <li> I was just looking for something to combat my extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> My wife uses it for her dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For dry skin  </li>
            <li> Bought this for callused feet, but also use in on my dry cracked rough hands.  </li>
            <li> It goes on oily but absorbs pretty well making it a bit difficult for larger areas.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and this oil helps to moisturize it and make it softer.</li>
            <li> Feels different with the little grits than my other emu oil.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with my raw shea butter</li>
            <li> My skin has been transformed from dry, itchy, scaly to healed, smoother, less itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and sometimes put a little oil on the ends before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> i previously heard about Emu oil for hair and skin, but was unfamiliar with it.</li>
            <li> I usually mix it with other oils and products to boost their efficacy</li>
            <li> so its not really liquid in the bottle making it hard to get out</li>
            <li> Waste of cash.  </li>
            <li> These are just a few I want to mention.</li>
            <li> My hands are always dried and cracked every winter.</li>
            <li> The emu oil takes a few minutes to absorb on my hands but protects them for hours.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands, but have ordered this one at least twice.</li>
            <li> the past, I have had 100% EMU OIL, but I am not convinced that this is 100% EMU oil.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Has a healing effect on small cuts and skin problems.</li>
            <li> I use it as a body lotion, on my feet and will sometimes put a small amount in my hair as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> However, I am not discouraged by this small amount.  </li>
            <li> I have had really dry skin over the past few months and it has been very unpleasant with all of the itching and rough hands.  </li>
            <li> dozens of times every day which makes my hands even worse.</li>
            <li> I would say not great, but, it does the job.</li>
            <li> Though is brutally expensive.</li>
            <li> But then again, thunder valley for this size would be crazy expensive.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even squeeze it out of the bottle when its chilly out side</li>
            <li> over rated  and very expensive</li>
            <li> It has drawbacks but they are not that bad.</li>
    </ol>

This stuff is amazing and it does not have a greasy feel.  I mixed it with my raw shea butter and my skin has been so soft all day!  I will definitely be purchasing it again!!</li>
            <li> I tried this oil because of the price. The oil is creamy white and has no odor which is better than the oil I was buying previously. My skin is very dry and this oil helps to moisturize it and make it softer. I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I like this product as a carrier oil as it absorbs quickly. I will definitely order again when I need more</li>
            <li> My friend told me about this product and so I wanted to try it. It works great for my hair and I love it. I will definitely be buying it again</li>
            <li> I use this along with MSM liquid on my knees, feet, and lower back to ease neuropathy and arthritis pain.  Didn&#x27;t think it was doing much until I missed a couple of days.  It really makes a difference for me.</li>
            <li> Although, I am not disappointed with this product, I am very suspicious that it has been cut with something else.&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I have had 100% EMU OIL, but I am not convinced that this is 100% EMU oil.&lt;br /&gt;In the future, I will pay more attention, and probably pay more, to purchase a product that states that the EMU oil is 100%...</li>
            <li> This emu oil works great for what I use it for (skin &amp; hair). I usually mix it with other oils and products to boost their efficacy and I do notice a difference when I don&#x27;t use it.I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands, but have ordered this one at least twice. I don&#x27;t feel compelled to try any others since ths one works just fine.</li>
            <li> This oil will fix cracked hands overnight.  Bought this for callused feet, but also use in on my dry cracked rough hands.  apply before bedtime, wake up to soft and healed hands.</li>
            <li> I had another brand of Emu Oil that was more expensive.  When I ran out, I decided to try this one.  It seems okay, but I don&#x27;t think my makeup looks as good using this one as the other brand.  I often use this at night too and like how it helps keep my skin moist.  I have long hair and sometimes put a little oil on the ends before I go to bed.  It  works great as a hair conditioner too!</li>
            <li> Keeps consistant moisture on the face throughout the day. Has a healing effect on small cuts and skin problems.</li>
            <li> I have always used Emu oil and  it really works for my arthritis. I searched the internet and found this company to have the best price. A local vendor had the 4 oz. bottle for twice as much money as I paid for the 8 oz. bottle. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Have used Emu oil before long ago and didnt stick with it, because of local cost. Now that I&#x27;ve found this, it sure seems to do very well. Cant wait to see with continued use if it will help a scar on my face and un-define the fine lines and wrinkles. Ive seen testimonies to its use on burn patients and scars. So will see what it will do in my case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert on emu oil but suffer from eczema. I didn&#x27;t find that this helped in particular, at least in immediate relief/results, but seems to be good for the skin. It goes on oily but absorbs pretty well making it a bit difficult for larger areas.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing is it congeals in in my climate so its not really liquid in the bottle making it hard to get out but the fact that it does leads me to believe that its pretty genuine. There is no discernable odor I can detect nor is there any residue when using it. I&#x27;ll have to keep using it regularly to gauge its effectiveness but so far I&#x27;m not disappointed but it is expensive considering it doesn&#x27;t smooth on like most lotions but is rather for specific applications.</li>
            <li> Waste of cash.  Would not purchase again.  Can&#x27;t even squeeze it out of the bottle when its chilly out side</li>
            <li> This one is the best because it doesn&#x27;t STINK like every other emu oil I have bought. (I think i have bought them all!) Get this one!</li>
            <li> I had doubts but I decided to try this for thinning on my hairline. After several months of regular use I have visible regrowth!</li>
            <li> I use this on my skin before bed &amp; after washing my hair, add a dab to make hair shiny &amp; well conditioned.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!!! I use it as a body lotion, on my feet and will sometimes put a small amount in my hair as a leave in conditioner. EMU Oil is a great product with many benefits.</li>
            <li> I use emu oil on cuts, burns, scraps, blemishes, and my hair. It makes an injury heal ten times faster. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizing oil for my hair. I haven&#x27;t really tried it on my skin yet, but will do so later.</li>
            <li> I used it for my child&#x27;s hair.  I am African American, and my child has coarse hair, it really helped with managebility.  I also use it for my hair as well, and it does the same.  One of my staple oils!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know there was vitamin E in this and I am allergic to vitamin E. This is NOT 100% Emu Oil. I had to go back to the more expensive one from Emu Depot which is 100% Emu Oil.  I may try the one sold by Puritans Pride next as it is cheaper than Emu Depot.</li>
            <li> After searching for several years for a moistureizer, a friend let me try her Emu Oil.  Great stuff for my super dry face and no \\&quot;product smell\\&quot;, just soothing light oil that goes into your skin in about 10 minutes.  I love this product and I am telling friends weekly to give it a try.  Amazon has a great selection and I will be buying it again on my Prime Account.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on my face for years.  It is wonderful for dry skin.  I&#x27;ve tried other emu oils and have found this to be superior.</li>
            <li> I had an emu and could get the oil out of him. Everytime I sqeezed  him he pecked the heck out of me. Do you kill them first, then mash them up, then put them in a press? I&#x27;m waiting for my hair to grow.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best emu oil I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but well worth it. I also purchase the &amp;#34;Radiant&amp;#34; Brand&lt;br /&gt;which isnt as good but less expensive. I really do like this one, seems more potent for my intended needs. So far I&#x27;ve used it for muscle aches, joint pains, rashes, burns, facial break outs and shingles. These are just a few I want to mention. It has worked wonders for me. I always have a bottle with me wherever I go. I highly recommend this to others. Try it for yourselves.</li>
            <li> over rated  and very expensive</li>
            <li> Amazing healing oil.  Use or moisturizing as well as healing injuries.  Great for so many uses.  A quality product you skin will love.  Fast shipping and great price.</li>
            <li> My hands are always dried and cracked every winter. I am a nurse so I wash or alcohol my hands dozens of times every day which makes my hands even worse. The emu oil takes a few minutes to absorb on my hands but protects them for hours. On my skin that isn&#x27;t so dry, it is so soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I will highly recommend this product for anyone with dry skin or psoriasis, etc. I use it daily and am happy. I can only go one day without it before I know the difference in my psoriasis. My wife uses it for her dry skin. It doesn&#x27;t take much either. At first I was using wayyyy too much. A little goes a long way. Just rub it in and give it a chance to soak in before getting dressed, if possible.&lt;br /&gt;For dry skin  for your feet, apply it then put on an old pair of cotton socks at bedtime.</li>
            <li> I have had really dry skin over the past few months and it has been very unpleasant with all of the itching and rough hands.  I decided to just use the Australia Naturals Emu Oil only and directly on my skin.  I have sensitive skin and it seems to become more sensitive the older I become.&lt;br /&gt;After using just the Emu Oil on me, I have seen an incredible improvement in my skin.  My skin has been transformed from dry, itchy, scaly to healed, smoother, less itchy skin.  I take into account the time it takes for skin to heal on its own. This emu oil helps my skin heal in a pretty safe and effective way.&lt;br /&gt;There is a minimal amount of Vitamin E in this product, a .00022% to be exact.  However, I am not discouraged by this small amount.  The little over 99% of the product is emu oil.&lt;br /&gt;Whether a person has sensitive skin or not, I would recommend this emu oil to everyone.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for these types of oils. I would say not great, but, it does the job. I do not believe this pure EMU oil. It seems to be adulterated in some form. If you looking for a pure oil, you probably should look elsewhere. If you using this just for hair moisturizing, skin moisturizing, etc., then it probably is okay. I use it in my hair and have found better, ever for hair. Good for psoriasis and excema too. Though is brutally expensive.These EMU producers need to chill on gross greed they have.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my wife, her skin looks fabulous! Perhaps I should try it?!</li>
            <li> My favorite Emu oil is still from thunder valley. I needed a large bottle to tend to some scars. This emu oil is decent. However, it gets gritty. I think some of it has coagulated. Odd since I live in a very hot and humid region of the nation. However, it seems to rub in just fine. Feels different with the little grits than my other emu oil. But then again, thunder valley for this size would be crazy expensive. So overall, you get a decent product, lots of it, for a good price. It has drawbacks but they are not that bad. Good deal if you need a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I avoid using traditional lotions because they are full of chemicals.  I use to use coconut oil for my lotion but decided to try Emu oil.  I&#x27;ve bought 2 bottles of this brand of emu oil now, and I really like it.  I use it on my hands and face daily.</li>
            <li> i previously heard about Emu oil for hair and skin, but was unfamiliar with it. After doing some research I found that Emu oil is a great moisturizer for the skin and hair and has been said to help with hair growth. Make sure to get pure , unrefined Emu oil from Australia as there are a lot of bogus ones on the market.</li>
