            <li>If that&#x27;s the product that is right for you, then this one is great.</li>
            <li>More suitable</li>
            <li>So glad I could remember I needed these and order them so easily!</li>
            <li>You can tell its made very cheaply</li>
            <li>The handles are very comfortable as well.</li>
            <li>Head has nice shape and is easily maneuvered in the mouth.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad that you carried them.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more them</li>
            <li>For some reason I think they will hold their firmness better.  </li>
            <li>LOVE these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I always like to keep extra around the house, what a great value!!</li>
            <li>I gave most of them away to someone who had none.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more when I need them and will recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li>I love these toothbrushes, now I know why they stop selling them in stores.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Also, love that these brushes come in a 12 pack - 1 for each month in the year.</li>
            <li>Pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>Pretty good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel great and the 12 pack lets me use a new toothbrush every month.  </li>
            <li>This just kind of seems like a cheap brush you might get free from the dentist.</li>
            <li>glad these are available.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is slender and fits in my mouth better than the fatter ones and is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Both are very inexpensive and are good toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>cause it does the trick right!!</li>
            <li>But they work fine.</li>
            <li>When you could easily get a firm toothbrush, I had the best dental health.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These brushes are comfortable and have the firmness I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Some brands have smooth finish on the handles.</li>
            <li>Cheap but what you would expect.</li>
            <li>they are cheap.</li>
            <li>Fantastic price for these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping these fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Good Value for the money, makes It easy to change toothbrushes every three months or as necessary</li>
            <li>A good firm brush for those that like to have more work done by the brush instead of your wrist!</li>
            <li>Amazon is a great place to stock up on long term sustainable products.  </li>
            <li>My mouth feels clean after each use.</li>
            <li>Eficientemete to clean teeth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how clean my teeth feel and</li>
            <li>The seller was excellent, but the product was not firm enough.</li>
            <li>This is just what i needed to clean with.</li>
            <li>Neither get my teethe clean.  </li>
            <li>Good, solid toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Its about time I find &amp;#34;FIRM&amp;#34; full head tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>Thanks for such great customer service.  </li>
            <li>My husband goes through about one a month, so it is great to get a big pack like this at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>how good my moral went up the first time I used these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used hard, for over 60 years, and the enamel on my teethe is very good</li>
            <li>it was a cheap quality and fit an adult not a child!</li>
            <li>Colgate Extra Clean Toothbrush Full Head Firm #40... is EXCELLENT in cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>While I understand that dentists do not like firm toothbrushes, there are those of us who do, and have been using them all our lives with great results.</li>
            <li>Nice, solid pack of toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>, I get good checkups, and minimal need of cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased to be able to order a hard bristle toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Did not feel right in my hand.  </li>
            <li>these are firm and give a good brush but would like firmer if i can find these make a great but odd gift</li>
            <li>The Reach toothbrushes are better quality and worth the tad extra money.</li>
            <li>love the firm texture of the bristles.can&#x27;t find them in the store any more.</li>
            <li>Great price for hard to find &amp;#34;Firm&amp;#34; bristles</li>
            <li>I use these to clean gages with at work, they are a nice stiff brush.</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured and described.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>They are firm brushes, but good for the price.</li>
            <li>this are great tooth brushes the bristles are rounded to accommodate the teeth, specially the front ones and are firm enough to remove some plaque you might have formed form forgetting to brush once.</li>
            <li>I am accustomed to the newer, more &amp;#34;deluxe&amp;#34; store-bought toothbrushes with softer bristles and rubber nubbies going in different directions, with a much wider grip.</li>
            <li>Just what I expected for a good old toothbrush.</li>
            <li>These firm toothbrushes are perfect for cleaning some small spaces and work better for this purpose than the soft ones.</li>
            <li>This product lasts TWICE as long compared to most MEDIUM head toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;2.)  </li>
            <li>The uneven bristles also seem to provide a better clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched high and low in stores for hard toothbrushes, and I&#x27;m so happy to find them here!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and a much better price than purchasing in the store</li>
            <li>I certainly will order again.</li>
            <li>Very good, hard to find locally.</li>
            <li>Great for removing tough plaques and tartar.</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush if u line hard Bristles.</li>
            <li>The picture doesn&#x27;t really give that away.</li>
            <li>so this product does the job very well.</li>
            <li>Traveling - check, your girls - check, whereever really</li>
            <li>Really a value pack.</li>
            <li>reasonable cost. ..</li>
            <li>REALLY FAST DELIVERY............</li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner than when using MEDIUM head</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so much cleaner when I use these.</li>
            <li>Thanks guys.</li>
            <li>Purchased this as it is much cheaper than purchasing in a store.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled  to find  FIRM  </li>
            <li>They are nice and firm on my teeth as I brush them.</li>
            <li>Even though they look exactly like the Colgate brushes I normally buy from the store, the brushes are made of some sharp plastic which fits better for scratching out the rust from your sink and not for your mouth.</li>
            <li>And they stay strong for a long time.</li>
            <li>They make my teeth feel extra clean and my mouth much fresher.</li>
            <li>Nice product, not more reason not to brush, HaHa</li>
            <li>I must admit, they&#x27;re fine with curved bristles, which supposedly clean better, but I&#x27;d still prefer my previous &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34; firm toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Not to sure if that&#x27;s average.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, I grew up in the 70&#x27;s before the whole soft toothbrush push from your dentist.  </li>
            <li>They are not firm at all; in fast I&#x27;d feel generous saying they are even medium.  </li>
            <li>WE LOVE OUR FIRM TOOTH BRUSHES</li>
            <li>Firm isn&#x27;t for everybody, but I feel like my teeth are better cleaned.</li>
            <li>I love these firm bristle toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>but I feel the firm heads work better for me and my needs.</li>
            <li>The price was right especially since I switch my toothbrush often .</li>
            <li>but they just don&#x27;t leave me with the same clean, smooth feeling that firm ones do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I always have new toothbrushes around.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve always said hard toothbrushes get your teeth white along with good toothpaste of course</li>
            <li>It is pretty much exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>They are nice and stiff, a bit hard when you first use it but soften up just right</li>
            <li>Not firm!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually bought these for friends, I like them so much!</li>
            <li>I love the hard brush.</li>
            <li>Its hard to get firm toothbrushes, so i was happy this site carried then, they have worked out well.</li>
            <li>Not firm at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, they will last longer and you just have to brush with a gentle pressure.</li>
            <li>was not firm they were all soft</li>
            <li>I did nit order soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the &#x27;soft&#x27; toothbrush recommended by the dentist.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re not suppose to use a firm toothbrush, but I just don&#x27;t feel like I can get my teeth clean with anything else.</li>
            <li>I need a firm brush else don&#x27;t feel my teeth are clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Until the past several years I was able to get firm brushes locally pretty much everywhere, but the stores that carried them got fewer and fewer.  </li>
            <li>No regrets !!</li>
            <li>I use to clean small things</li>
            <li>Colgate extra firm toothbrushes provide a clean that the pansy medium/soft brushes do not.</li>
            <li>All of the local stores near me only offer soft and medium toothbrushes</li>
            <li>Really just what I expected and wanted.  </li>
            <li>It is very difficult to find firm toothbrushes, so I was very happy to find these.  </li>
            <li>Soft seem pretty useless and medium seem pretty soft.</li>
            <li>A very nice toothbrush, slightly less mushy than the useless soft versions, however still a long way from &amp;#34;firm.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Cheaply made, too stiff and rough when brushing.</li>
            <li>The brushes are small but powerful.</li>
            <li>At least I&#x27;ll have clean, white teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are a little small, but I love the firmness.</li>
            <li>I bought both the Colgate Extra Clean Toothbrush Full Head Firm #40, Brushes Hard (Pack of 12) and the Reach Toothbrush Firm Full Head 12 Brushes Hard.  </li>
            <li>I have been searching for where to get a better and little hard toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I wanted some cheap, tough toothbrushes</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Also, love that these brushes come in a 12 pack - 1 for each month in the year.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> Pretty good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel great and the 12 pack lets me use a new toothbrush every month.  </li>
            <li> This just kind of seems like a cheap brush you might get free from the dentist.</li>
            <li> glad these are available.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is slender and fits in my mouth better than the fatter ones and is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Both are very inexpensive and are good toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> cause it does the trick right!!</li>
            <li> But they work fine.</li>
            <li> When you could easily get a firm toothbrush, I had the best dental health.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These brushes are comfortable and have the firmness I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Some brands have smooth finish on the handles.</li>
            <li> Cheap but what you would expect.</li>
            <li> they are cheap.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price for these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping these fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Good Value for the money, makes It easy to change toothbrushes every three months or as necessary</li>
            <li> A good firm brush for those that like to have more work done by the brush instead of your wrist!</li>
            <li> Amazon is a great place to stock up on long term sustainable products.  </li>
            <li> My mouth feels clean after each use.</li>
            <li> Eficientemete to clean teeth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how clean my teeth feel and</li>
            <li> The seller was excellent, but the product was not firm enough.</li>
            <li> This is just what i needed to clean with.</li>
            <li> Neither get my teethe clean.  </li>
            <li> Good, solid toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Its about time I find &amp;#34;FIRM&amp;#34; full head tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> Thanks for such great customer service.  </li>
            <li> My husband goes through about one a month, so it is great to get a big pack like this at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> how good my moral went up the first time I used these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hard, for over 60 years, and the enamel on my teethe is very good</li>
            <li> it was a cheap quality and fit an adult not a child!</li>
            <li> Colgate Extra Clean Toothbrush Full Head Firm #40... is EXCELLENT in cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> While I understand that dentists do not like firm toothbrushes, there are those of us who do, and have been using them all our lives with great results.</li>
            <li> Nice, solid pack of toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> , I get good checkups, and minimal need of cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased to be able to order a hard bristle toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Did not feel right in my hand.  </li>
            <li> these are firm and give a good brush but would like firmer if i can find these make a great but odd gift</li>
            <li> The Reach toothbrushes are better quality and worth the tad extra money.</li>
            <li> love the firm texture of the bristles.can&#x27;t find them in the store any more.</li>
            <li> Great price for hard to find &amp;#34;Firm&amp;#34; bristles</li>
            <li> I use these to clean gages with at work, they are a nice stiff brush.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured and described.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> They are firm brushes, but good for the price.</li>
            <li> this are great tooth brushes the bristles are rounded to accommodate the teeth, specially the front ones and are firm enough to remove some plaque you might have formed form forgetting to brush once.</li>
            <li> I am accustomed to the newer, more &amp;#34;deluxe&amp;#34; store-bought toothbrushes with softer bristles and rubber nubbies going in different directions, with a much wider grip.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected for a good old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These firm toothbrushes are perfect for cleaning some small spaces and work better for this purpose than the soft ones.</li>
            <li> This product lasts TWICE as long compared to most MEDIUM head toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;2.)  </li>
            <li> The uneven bristles also seem to provide a better clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low in stores for hard toothbrushes, and I&#x27;m so happy to find them here!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and a much better price than purchasing in the store</li>
            <li> I certainly will order again.</li>
            <li> Very good, hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> Great for removing tough plaques and tartar.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush if u line hard Bristles.</li>
            <li> The picture doesn&#x27;t really give that away.</li>
            <li> so this product does the job very well.</li>
            <li> Traveling - check, your girls - check, whereever really</li>
            <li> Really a value pack.</li>
            <li> reasonable cost. ..</li>
            <li> REALLY FAST DELIVERY............</li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner than when using MEDIUM head</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so much cleaner when I use these.</li>
            <li> Thanks guys.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as it is much cheaper than purchasing in a store.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled  to find  FIRM  </li>
            <li> They are nice and firm on my teeth as I brush them.</li>
            <li> Even though they look exactly like the Colgate brushes I normally buy from the store, the brushes are made of some sharp plastic which fits better for scratching out the rust from your sink and not for your mouth.</li>
            <li> And they stay strong for a long time.</li>
            <li> They make my teeth feel extra clean and my mouth much fresher.</li>
            <li> Nice product, not more reason not to brush, HaHa</li>
            <li> I must admit, they&#x27;re fine with curved bristles, which supposedly clean better, but I&#x27;d still prefer my previous &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34; firm toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Not to sure if that&#x27;s average.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, I grew up in the 70&#x27;s before the whole soft toothbrush push from your dentist.  </li>
            <li> They are not firm at all; in fast I&#x27;d feel generous saying they are even medium.  </li>
            <li> WE LOVE OUR FIRM TOOTH BRUSHES</li>
            <li> Firm isn&#x27;t for everybody, but I feel like my teeth are better cleaned.</li>
            <li> I love these firm bristle toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> but I feel the firm heads work better for me and my needs.</li>
            <li> The price was right especially since I switch my toothbrush often .</li>
            <li> but they just don&#x27;t leave me with the same clean, smooth feeling that firm ones do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I always have new toothbrushes around.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve always said hard toothbrushes get your teeth white along with good toothpaste of course</li>
            <li> It is pretty much exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> They are nice and stiff, a bit hard when you first use it but soften up just right</li>
            <li> Not firm!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually bought these for friends, I like them so much!</li>
            <li> I love the hard brush.</li>
            <li> Its hard to get firm toothbrushes, so i was happy this site carried then, they have worked out well.</li>
            <li> Not firm at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, they will last longer and you just have to brush with a gentle pressure.</li>
            <li> was not firm they were all soft</li>
            <li> I did nit order soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the &#x27;soft&#x27; toothbrush recommended by the dentist.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not suppose to use a firm toothbrush, but I just don&#x27;t feel like I can get my teeth clean with anything else.</li>
            <li> I need a firm brush else don&#x27;t feel my teeth are clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Until the past several years I was able to get firm brushes locally pretty much everywhere, but the stores that carried them got fewer and fewer.  </li>
            <li> No regrets !!</li>
            <li> I use to clean small things</li>
            <li> Colgate extra firm toothbrushes provide a clean that the pansy medium/soft brushes do not.</li>
            <li> All of the local stores near me only offer soft and medium toothbrushes</li>
            <li> Really just what I expected and wanted.  </li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find firm toothbrushes, so I was very happy to find these.  </li>
            <li> Soft seem pretty useless and medium seem pretty soft.</li>
            <li> A very nice toothbrush, slightly less mushy than the useless soft versions, however still a long way from &amp;#34;firm.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, too stiff and rough when brushing.</li>
            <li> The brushes are small but powerful.</li>
            <li> At least I&#x27;ll have clean, white teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are a little small, but I love the firmness.</li>
            <li> I bought both the Colgate Extra Clean Toothbrush Full Head Firm #40, Brushes Hard (Pack of 12) and the Reach Toothbrush Firm Full Head 12 Brushes Hard.  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for where to get a better and little hard toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I wanted some cheap, tough toothbrushes</li>
            <li> I have not had them long enough however to see if they bristles last longer than the Reach.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1.)  LOW FRILLS:  No major frills that you sometimes see in toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One remark, the size of the head is typical: Not excessively small or large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these are real.</li>
            <li> I tend to brush harder than most and my toothbrush&#x27;s bristles(medium bristles) always ends up smashed and almost useless after a very short time.</li>
            <li> They last a long time.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think they will last long...</li>
            <li> Personally, I prefer SOFT to FIRM.</li>
            <li> Currently, none of my local stores carry firm brushes from either major manufacturers or even house brands.  </li>
            <li> You really have to like hard bristles and a cheap-feeling brush to like this product.</li>
            <li> Firm good but head small but will do hard to find firm</li>
            <li> My preference is a firm brush and these fill the bill and get my teeth cleaner than all the soft brushes out there.</li>
            <li> I prefer the firm bristles over the soft anytime over what the dentist recommends.</li>
            <li> From the picture, it looks like it has that nice, fat grip, but the handle (under the Colgate logo in the pic) is very thin and actually almost hard to hold --</li>
            <li> Firm bristles good - flexible handle bad.</li>
            <li> These are individually wrapped like the photo, my previous Amazon offering had the brushes in two packs so to get one you have to leave the other in an open container until you swapped it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried soft brushes (usually the freebies from cleanings)</li>
            <li> The neck is also slightly flimsy and the actually head is skinny.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are so stiff that I can barely brush my tongue, it is just too rough.</li>
            <li> head could have been a little larger.</li>
            <li> like feel of brush not too hard and not too soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been  big fan of firm toothbrushes since I was a kid.  </li>
            <li> Went back to Reach toothbrushes since they are firm and stay that way</li>
            <li> The last time I ordered 12 FIRM toothbrushes through Amazon they were another brand than Colgate and were firm as described, but that was several years ago.  </li>
            <li> Standard with firm head.</li>
            <li> Standard firm toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I cannot find Colgate &#x27;firm&#x27; toothbrushes local.  </li>
            <li> My family also likes the harder brush.</li>
            <li> Not very &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected</li>
            <li> None of the local pharmacies or supermarkets carry the firm bristle tooth brushes anymore</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a firm toothbrush for quite awhile in local stores with no luck</li>
            <li> Reach toothbrushes are harder ones.</li>
            <li> I disliked these brushes because they are way too small for an adult mouth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to find FIRM toothbrushes in stores any more</li>
            <li> About half the size of the Reach extra firm.  </li>
            <li> I can get to all the tiny, hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> Back to the hard,</li>
            <li> Labeled as firm, but wasn&#x27;t firm for very long.  </li>
            <li> Just saw the dentist who yelled at me for using a firm toothbrush due to all the damage it did to my gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to give such a low rating, but as I stated in the heading I believe the order was mislabeled.</li>
            <li> I had previously bought.  </li>
            <li> They are sized for little kids.</li>
            <li> Yes the bristles are hard, but not as hard as the Reach extra firm bristles</li>
            <li> Firm bristles that I ever wanted.</li>
            <li> If you like a firm toothbrush, I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> Note these are FIRM.</li>
            <li> but I can see some people missing that in the description.</li>
            <li> I have just opened the 12 piece shipment of what was labeled as FIRM toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> It does not soften after a few use...</li>
            <li> I wasted a firm brush.</li>
            <li> I have been looking all over to find these firm head tooth brushes</li>
            <li> and I was informed that they will not carry firm ones anymore.</li>
            <li> But for people who like using FIRM, I guess no problem at all.</li>
            <li> These firm brushes do the job.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find a firm bristle in the stores.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a firm brush, you might like these.</li>
            <li> We have seen power outages, roads blocked and heavy storms.  </li>
            <li> I know these are firm</li>
            <li> the picture said firm not what I received</li>
            <li> not stay firm</li>
            <li> they are as advertised, firm</li>
            <li> With the firm bristles I tend to brush lighter and my toothbrush lasts longer</li>
            <li> I know firm bristles can damage your teeth&#x27;s enamel(which</li>
            <li> These also have ridges on the back of the head which is really irritating to the inside of my mouth.</li>
            <li> The brush head is a little small</li>
            <li> The head it&#x27;s a little small.</li>
            <li> a little bit hard of the brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used the firm, or hard tooth brush to care for my teeth</li>
            <li> Hard to find firm brushes.</li>
            <li> Since firm bristle toothbrushes are hard to come by</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a firm toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find firm anymore.</li>
            <li> This is not more like medium.</li>
            <li> What a sham!  </li>
            <li> Small head and handle.</li>
            <li> small head&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> but these are stiff as wire!</li>
            <li> not suitable for kids.</li>
            <li> Even though it says hard, it does not hurt your gums.</li>
            <li> I looked for hard bristle brushes for years and couldn&#x27;t find any.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in any store.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why they&#x27;re so hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> When they say these are hard brushes, they mean it.</li>
            <li> Sick of those soft.</li>
            <li> and the bristles are just too sharp and uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Poor quality, small head size.</li>
            <li> the head of the toothbrush is very small</li>
            <li> Looking for hard toothbrushes which are very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I have a difficult time buying the pitch that a hard bristle will damage the enamel on my teeth, when they scrape my teethe with a metal instrument and then &#x27;polish&#x27; my teethe with the drill and abrasive.</li>
            <li> While these aren&#x27;t bad, they are also not what I had expected.  </li>
            <li> Worst purchase on Amazon so far.</li>
            <li> They were not firm at all, very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I ordered wrong product for myself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to locate &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing fancy or disappointing about them.</li>
            <li> However they are almost impossible to find.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>

            <li> good value and quality</li>
            <li> Awesome toothbrush. I was wondering why I&#x27;ve never seen &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; toothbrushes in the store. Soft seem pretty useless and medium seem pretty soft. These can actually be used to brush stuff off my teeth. Great concept.</li>
            <li> Very good transaction. Item as described</li>
            <li> I use these to clean gages with at work, they are a nice stiff brush.</li>
            <li> Nice product, not more reason not to brush, HaHa</li>

            <li> You really have to like hard bristles and a cheap-feeling brush to like this product.

            <li> Exactly what I expected and a much better price than purchasing in the store</li>
            <li> They are toothbrushes and they are there when you need them (en masse).</li>
            <li> Great product, good value and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I know, I know ... you&#x27;re not suppose to use a firm toothbrush, but I just don&#x27;t feel like I can get my teeth clean with anything else. It&#x27;s almost impossible to find FIRM toothbrushes in stores any more so I was really happy when I found these here. I am very happy with my purchase. If you like a firm toothbrush, I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> The brushes  served  they&#x27;re  ppurpose!</li>
            <li> Dude these toothbrushes are the bomb like get 12 and take them anywhere. Traveling - check, your girls - check, whereever really</li>
            <li> Not firm! Poor quality, small head size.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and affordable toothbrush. Great for removing tough plaques and tartar.</li>
            <li> My Dentist recommend the Colgate Extra and toothbrushes. They seem to be working great...</li>
            <li> A very nice toothbrush, slightly less mushy than the useless soft versions, however still a long way from &amp;#34;firm.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great deal and color variety!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been  big fan of firm toothbrushes since I was a kid.  Yeah, I grew up in the 70&#x27;s before the whole soft toothbrush push from your dentist.  I&#x27;ve tried soft brushes (usually the freebies from cleanings) but they just don&#x27;t leave me with the same clean, smooth feeling that firm ones do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until the past several years I was able to get firm brushes locally pretty much everywhere, but the stores that carried them got fewer and fewer.  Currently, none of my local stores carry firm brushes from either major manufacturers or even house brands.  Amazon to the rescue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are comfortable and have the firmness I was looking for.  My teeth feel great and the 12 pack lets me use a new toothbrush every month.  These are individually wrapped like the photo, my previous Amazon offering had the brushes in two packs so to get one you have to leave the other in an open container until you swapped it out.</li>
            <li> Labeled as firm, but wasn&#x27;t firm for very long.  Went back to Reach toothbrushes since they are firm and stay that way</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, too stiff and rough when brushing.</li>
            <li> Firm bristles good - flexible handle bad.</li>
            <li> Came as promised. Note these are FIRM. I like mine that way so it&#x27;s not an issue for me but I can see some people missing that in the description.</li>
            <li> I bought both the Colgate Extra Clean Toothbrush Full Head Firm #40, Brushes Hard (Pack of 12) and the Reach Toothbrush Firm Full Head 12 Brushes Hard.  Both are very inexpensive and are good toothbrushes.  The Reach toothbrushes are better quality and worth the tad extra money.</li>
            <li> I have just opened the 12 piece shipment of what was labeled as FIRM toothbrushes.  They are not firm at all; in fast I&#x27;d feel generous saying they are even medium.  The last time I ordered 12 FIRM toothbrushes through Amazon they were another brand than Colgate and were firm as described, but that was several years ago.  I&#x27;m sorry to give such a low rating, but as I stated in the heading I believe the order was mislabeled.</li>
            <li> good packaging. like feel of brush not too hard and not too soft</li>
            <li> Really a value pack. I love the hard brush.</li>
            <li> excellent. .......reasonable cost. ..</li>
            <li> The toothbrush are great. And they stay strong for a long time. It does not soften after a few use...Even though it says hard, it does not hurt your gums. Would buy them again...</li>
            <li> Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> Not what I wanted.  Not firm at all.&lt;br /&gt;Did not feel right in my hand.  More suitable&lt;br /&gt;for children than adults.</li>
            <li> I needed lots for a mission trip. Came on time and as described.</li>
            <li> Very happy with it. Excellent quality product</li>
            <li> Colgate extra firm toothbrushes provide a clean that the pansy medium/soft brushes do not. When you could easily get a firm toothbrush, I had the best dental health. Now that they&#x27;ve sold the idea these will damage your enamel, I&#x27;ve put my dentists kids through school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad to have found these and plan to use them until I&#x27;m placed in a pine box. At least I&#x27;ll have clean, white teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad these are available.</li>
            <li> Great price.  Hard to find firm brushes.</li>
            <li> Junk. I wasted a firm brush. This is not more like medium.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for cleaning jewelry.</li>
            <li> Since firm bristle toothbrushes are hard to come by I took a chance purchasing these and I am very happy with my purchase. Exactly as pictured and described.</li>
            <li> So glad I could remember I needed these and order them so easily! Thanks for such great customer service.  I will do it again when needed!</li>
            <li> Good, solid toothbrushes. Standard with firm head. My husband goes through about one a month, so it is great to get a big pack like this at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My preference is a firm brush and these fill the bill and get my teeth cleaner than all the soft brushes out there.</li>
            <li> The brushes are small but powerful. My mouth feels clean after each use. I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been looking all over to find these firm head tooth brushes and I&#x27;m glad that you carried them.</li>
            <li> REALLY FAST DELIVERY............WE LOVE OUR FIRM TOOTH BRUSHES</li>
            <li> I have enough tooth brushes now for entire family when we go on vacations. Great to have for friends and family</li>
            <li> Good price for a lot of toothbrushes- keep on hand for when guests visit (I like to keep a fully stocked bathroom for guests).</li>
            <li> This set was great! They come packages individually just as you see them in stores. A good firm brush for those that like to have more work done by the brush instead of your wrist!</li>
            <li> very nice. love the firm texture of the bristles.can&#x27;t find them in the store any more.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a great price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy and does a wonderful job cleaning my teeth. The price was right especially since I switch my toothbrush often . No regrets !!</li>
            <li> Excellent items that work great at a great price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a firm toothbrush.  If that&#x27;s the product that is right for you, then this one is great.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled  to find  FIRM  tooth brushes  and  I order them in bulk.  They&#x27;re  a great Find, Price  and  my Fave Brushes.</li>
            <li> I need a firm brush else don&#x27;t feel my teeth are clean. Some brands have smooth finish on the handles. These have nice rubber grip on the handles that help reduce slip and injury. Head has nice shape and is easily maneuvered in the mouth.  One end of the the head has longer bristles that get into crevices nicely.</li>
            <li> Its about time I find &amp;#34;FIRM&amp;#34; full head tooth brushes. You can tell its made very cheaply but I dont care cause it does the trick right!! I will purchase more them</li>
            <li> In my country I do not get this firmness and toothpastes have lowered quality. This is very good brush. Eficientemete to clean teeth.</li>
            <li> Bought these for a friend who could not find them in town. He is a very happy camper now.</li>
            <li> Good  price and great service.</li>
            <li> All of the local stores near me only offer soft and medium toothbrushes and I was informed that they will not carry firm ones anymore. I can&#x27;t tell you how clean my teeth feel and how good my moral went up the first time I used these toothbrushes. I bought two hardpacks, maybe enough till I die.&lt;br /&gt;JJK</li>
            <li> Please note: the \\&quot;Five-Star\\&quot; I gave is only for service not the product. Personally, I prefer SOFT to FIRM. I ordered wrong product for myself. But for people who like using FIRM, I guess no problem at all.</li>
            <li> They are great. They last a long time. I know you should change them after a month or so but if the still do the job why throw them away.</li>
            <li> Cheap but what you would expect.</li>
            <li> this are great tooth brushes the bristles are rounded to accommodate the teeth, specially the front ones and are firm enough to remove some plaque you might have formed form forgetting to brush once.</li>
            <li> It is pretty much exactly what I expected. Standard firm toothbrush. I like it. Firm isn&#x27;t for everybody, but I feel like my teeth are better cleaned.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1.)  DURABLE:  This product lasts TWICE as long compared to most MEDIUM head toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;2.)  PRICE:  I paid $12.83 for 12 toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;3.)  CLEANS GREAT:  My teeth feel much cleaner than when using MEDIUM head toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1.)  LOW FRILLS:  No major frills that you sometimes see in toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One remark, the size of the head is typical: Not excessively small or large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please vote on my post if you found this review helpful.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> The seller was excellent, but the product was not firm enough.</li>
            <li> I looked for hard bristle brushes for years and couldn&#x27;t find any.  The dentist says not to use them, then scrapes my teeth with metal!  What a sham!  As soon as I got these....of course I found some on the store shelf!  Whatever now I have 12!</li>
            <li> This is just what i needed to clean with. Its hard to get firm toothbrushes, so i was happy this site carried then, they have worked out well. I can get to all the tiny, hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, delivered on time and best deal. Will continue to order this item through Amazon</li>
            <li> Small head and handle. don&#x27;t think they will last long...</li>
            <li> Great price for hard to find &amp;#34;Firm&amp;#34; bristles</li>
            <li> I disliked these brushes because they are way too small for an adult mouth.  They are sized for little kids.</li>
            <li> I cannot find Colgate &#x27;firm&#x27; toothbrushes local.  I&#x27;m so grateful to find them on Amazon.  Excellent brush, perfect shape....we keep extra ones at work, in brief cases and back packs, and in our luggage.  Colgate is the best.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> Great deal. Toothbrushes for me last about two weeks. Not to sure if that&#x27;s average. But works great</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re tooth brushes... arrived on time and for a great price</li>
            <li> head could have been a little larger. good bristles.</li>
            <li> I need to feel like I did a good job of cleaning my teeth. These firm brushes do the job. Hard to find in any store.</li>
            <li> While these aren&#x27;t bad, they are also not what I had expected.  Yes the bristles are hard, but not as hard as the Reach extra firm bristles I had previously bought.  The neck is also slightly flimsy and the actually head is skinny.  About half the size of the Reach extra firm.  I have not had them long enough however to see if they bristles last longer than the Reach.  For some reason I think they will hold their firmness better.  The uneven bristles also seem to provide a better clean.</li>
            <li> Terrible! Even though they look exactly like the Colgate brushes I normally buy from the store, the brushes are made of some sharp plastic which fits better for scratching out the rust from your sink and not for your mouth. Worst purchase on Amazon so far.</li>
            <li> Great deal.  We keep these at lake house and if anyone forgets their toothbrush we give them one of these.</li>
            <li> LOVE these toothbrushes. I can&#x27;t find a firm bristle in the stores. The handles are very comfortable as well. VERY happy!</li>
            <li> Nice, solid pack of toothbrushes.  Good value for a good brush.  If you&#x27;re looking for a firm brush, you might like these.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to be able to order a hard bristle toothbrush. My family also likes the harder brush. I certainly will order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low in stores for hard toothbrushes, and I&#x27;m so happy to find them here! I have no idea why they&#x27;re so hard to find in stores. My mouth feels so much cleaner when I use these. I&#x27;ve actually bought these for friends, I like them so much!</li>
            <li> Very nice toothbrushes for a good price.</li>
            <li> While I understand that dentists do not like firm toothbrushes, there are those of us who do, and have been using them all our lives with great results. However they are almost impossible to find. So glad I thought to look on Amazon!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a child size..it was a cheap quality and fit an adult not a child! Thank God I had a back up plan</li>
            <li> Hard to find firm anymore. Just what I expected for a good old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes!  They are nice and firm on my teeth as I brush them. My mouth does feel cleaner!</li>
            <li> Amazon is a great place to stock up on long term sustainable products.  We have seen power outages, roads blocked and heavy storms.  Backing up supplies only makes sense.  This was meant for our back up storage.</li>
            <li> a little bit hard of the brush. not suitable for kids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these are real. They are inexpensive and disposable.</li>
            <li> I always like to keep extra around the house, what a great value!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> I know these are firm but these are stiff as wire! and the bristles are just too sharp and uncomfortable I was very disappointed. I gave most of them away to someone who had none.</li>
            <li> Very good, hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> these are firm and give a good brush but would like firmer if i can find these make a great but odd gift</li>
            <li> i dont need to buy more for one year! :)</li>
            <li> the head of the toothbrush is very small</li>
            <li> Good Value for the money, makes It easy to change toothbrushes every three months or as necessary</li>
            <li> They brush your teeth....they are cheap.</li>
            <li> The handle feels too thin and cheaply made but it does the job... It almost feels like a kid&#x27;s toothbrush...</li>
            <li> Not very &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Came with medium bristles as well.</li>
            <li> These brushes are the hardest bristle tooth brushes I have ever had! However, they will last longer and you just have to brush with a gentle pressure.</li>
            <li> I love these firm bristle toothbrushes.  They make my teeth feel extra clean and my mouth much fresher. I prefer the firm bristles over the soft anytime over what the dentist recommends.</li>
            <li> They are firm brushes, but good for the price.</li>
            <li> Yes that is all I have to say</li>
            <li> was not firm they were all soft I did nit order soft the picture said firm not what I received</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m prepared for the toothpocalypse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to locate &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; toothbrushes today, so when I saw these (by Colgate) online, I decided to try them.  I must admit, they&#x27;re fine with curved bristles, which supposedly clean better, but I&#x27;d still prefer my previous &amp;#34;Reach&amp;#34; firm toothbrushes.  I guess it&#x27;s all what you get used to... and what does a good job cleaning.</li>
            <li> Medium to small head&lt;br /&gt;Does not stay firm</li>
            <li> I have been searching for where to get a better and little hard toothbrush. Sick of those soft. .. my hubby n I love it.</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected</li>
            <li> They were not firm at all, very disappointed!</li>
            <li> they are as advertised, firm</li>
            <li> Really just what I expected and wanted.  None of the local pharmacies or supermarkets carry the firm bristle tooth brushes anymore and I just can&#x27;t get between my teeth without them.  I&#x27;m really glad that I thought to look on  amazing Amazon where you can find just about anything you need! Thanks guys.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this purchase.  Great price and fast delivery.  I will be ordering more when I need them and will recommend to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as it is much cheaper than purchasing in a store.  You can never have enough toothbrushes.  I feel like I need to switch out my boyfriends toothbrush every month or two depending on his use.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a firm toothbrush for quite awhile in local stores with no luck so when I found this set online I was thrilled. I tend to brush harder than most and my toothbrush&#x27;s bristles(medium bristles) always ends up smashed and almost useless after a very short time. With the firm bristles I tend to brush lighter and my toothbrush lasts longer and I feel it gets the spots others miss. I know firm bristles can damage your teeth&#x27;s enamel(which is why I cant get one at the local stores) but I feel the firm heads work better for me and my needs. This toothbrush is slender and fits in my mouth better than the fatter ones and is comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes, now I know why they stop selling them in stores. They are nice and stiff, a bit hard when you first use it but soften up just right and you get used to it, I&#x27;ve always said hard toothbrushes get your teeth white along with good toothpaste of course but these are good buy em</li>
            <li> Fantastic price for these toothbrushes.  It is very difficult to find firm toothbrushes, so I was very happy to find these.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Unbeatable deal on a whole lot of toothbrushes, bear in mind that these are firm. I could probably buy only three at my local pharmacy chain with what I paid for these.</li>
            <li> Looking for hard toothbrushes which are very hard to find.  I&#x27;m hoping these fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Colgate Extra Clean Toothbrush Full Head Firm #40... is EXCELLENT in cleaning my teeth. It is what I was looking for. My teeth feel cleaner, even the next morning. I&#x27;m getting these again when I&#x27;ve run out.</li>
            <li> Just saw the dentist who yelled at me for using a firm toothbrush due to all the damage it did to my gums. These also have ridges on the back of the head which is really irritating to the inside of my mouth.</li>
            <li> These are a little small, but I love the firmness. You can&#x27;t buy these at the store anymore.</li>
            <li> Reach toothbrushes are harder ones.</li>
            <li> maybe a medium....if you&#x27;re looking for firm...this isn&#x27;t it</li>
            <li> When they say these are hard brushes, they mean it. I wanted some cheap, tough toothbrushes and I got them. There&#x27;s nothing fancy or disappointing about them.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrushes at a great price !</li>
            <li> When you order twelve and receive only six, something is lacking.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for hygiene packets to be delivered to the needy in our community.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the &#x27;soft&#x27; toothbrush recommended by the dentist.  I&#x27;ve tried medium.  Neither get my teethe clean.  Back to the hard, and I love it.  I&#x27;ve used hard, for over 60 years, and the enamel on my teethe is very good, I get good checkups, and minimal need of cleaning.  I have a difficult time buying the pitch that a hard bristle will damage the enamel on my teeth, when they scrape my teethe with a metal instrument and then &#x27;polish&#x27; my teethe with the drill and abrasive. Also, love that these brushes come in a 12 pack - 1 for each month in the year.</li>
            <li> Firm good but head small but will do hard to find firm</li>
            <li> Pretty good toothbrush.  I subscribe and save on these so I always have new toothbrushes around.</li>
