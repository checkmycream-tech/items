            <li>The case that I received is not the one pictured, I used to work in a dental office which is why I ordered this model because it&#x27;s sturdy &amp; does not break easily.</li>
            <li>They do the trick just fine.</li>
            <li>This case easily fits my retainer for easy, clean storage.  </li>
            <li>Great simple case for my invisalign.  </li>

            <li>Shipping was fast as well with this seller.</li>
            <li>My advice is to spend one or two bucks more and get one a little bit sturdier.</li>
            <li>this item is exactly as it states, however it is not big enough to clean a set of dentures.  </li>
            <li>I bought this case when my old case broke.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot of money for a simple mouthguard case.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually more cherry than pink, and I definitely wanted pink.  </li>
            <li>Will buy again in the near future.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly as pictured.  Great simple case for my invisalign.  Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Perfect for a partial plate. I could not find one any where to protect my plate. Or to travel with it.</li>
            <li> Afrter breaking 2 sets of retainers while carrying them in my pocket, I finally decided to order 4 of these.  They do the trick just fine.</li>
            <li> It is just what  I wanted right size,fun color&lt;br /&gt;and closes tight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected there two different things it&#x27;s not what I wanted  As you can see in your picture and mines there different I do not like it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually more cherry than pink, and I definitely wanted pink.  But it works just fine, and that is the most important thing!</li>
            <li> The case that I received is not the one pictured, I used to work in a dental office which is why I ordered this model because it&#x27;s sturdy &amp; does not break easily. I received a thin cheaper version that doesn&#x27;t look like this &amp; when I tried to exchange it for the one pictured I received a short response with a refund instead of having any option to switch it out. The item you receive should be the one pictured in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Good for a backup retainer case. Quality durable plastic. Very easy to clean. Color is as shown on picture described.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, price and just what I needed.  These were so cheap I got two and could not be happier with the prodcut</li>
            <li> I bought this case when my old case broke.  This case easily fits my retainer for easy, clean storage.  I would recommend this to other people.</li>
            <li> I definitely got what I paid for with this retainer case - very little! It does not stay shut because the top and bottom halves are off-centered. My advice is to spend one or two bucks more and get one a little bit sturdier.</li>
            <li> Nice cheap retainer. Works well.</li>
            <li> this item is exactly as it states, however it is not big enough to clean a set of dentures.  But it is really cute.</li>
            <li> I lost my retainer case that I originally got from the ortho. 99 cents for this was a great deal. The case works just fine :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot of money for a simple mouthguard case. This fits the bill and is inexpensive. Plus it comes in a wide choice of colors.</li>
            <li> The case is a nice size although I did not expect it to have two air holes in the bottom.  When I store my retainer in my purse the dampness leaks out when I travel.</li>
            <li> My daughter needed extra cases since her orthodontist only gave her 1. These are perfect and very reasonably priced. Would recommend to anyone with retainers.</li>
            <li> It does its job, hold my retainer. So far so good.</li>
            <li> So maybe the kid won&#x27;t lose it this time?  Good there is more than one anyway.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth so my dentist made me a guard to wear at night but he gave me a retainer case to put it in. The guard did not fit in the container case so I was using one of my hair bands to try and keep it somewhat closed. That is until I found this beauty! It fits perfectly and has holes in it to help dry it out. Definitely recommend. Shipping was fast as well with this seller.</li>
            <li> It fits my Invizaline retainers and color is awesome! I recommend this product. Will buy again in the near future.</li>
            <li> perfect like i expected, no lies no nothing just like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;just what i expected from this product.&lt;br /&gt;best retainer case</li>
            <li> great price very cute</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed. Just need something to carry retainers in. It is very similar to the one I got from the dentist (which broke after a couple of years; it is plastic, after all). I don&#x27;t know why anyone would give this a bad review -- it is inexpensive and it holds my retainers. The end.</li>
            <li> this case is perfect for my invisible retainers, I need one in every color and plan to order again! Shipping was super fast and product as described!</li>
            <li> Correct size for my bite guard. Was slightly disappointed that it has two small holes in the lid but is much sleeker and cuter than the one the dentist gave me!</li>
            <li> 5 stars for this amazing retainer container. Good quality, great price!</li>
            <li> Really love the color work great for me</li>
            <li> I use this to hold my retainers. I&#x27;m an adult and I still have to wear them occasionally! It&#x27;s a good price and came quickly.</li>
