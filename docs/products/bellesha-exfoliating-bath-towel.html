            <li>However they are perfect for scrubbing your back!</li>
            <li>Ok, they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>My skin felt very clean after using this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d call them a win so far.  </li>
            <li>It does dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>bellesha exfoliating bath towel towelettes are a easy way for all over exfoliation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes in a three pack of bright and vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>and it works just fine for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want to scrub your back without dislocating your shoulders, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I was contacted by a rep for BellaSha and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wavering between a four and five rating, but because they made my loved one feel better in her last days, I&#x27;m going with five stars.</li>
            <li>While that may be overselling it a bit, these textured towels work a LOT better than the shower balls as they lather nicely and they allow you to have complete control over the pressure you&#x27;re providing and exactly where you&#x27;re able to get it.  </li>
            <li>These exfoliating cloths are popular in Asia and particularly in Japan.  </li>
            <li>It gives my back a pleasant scratching, it leathers up well, and I like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the hard weave before, and it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes those super plush washcloths just don&#x27;t get the job done</li>
            <li>Arrives quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, they are wonderful not just for exfoliating, but for gently scratching itchy skin without irritating it or making it itch more.  </li>
            <li>It dries very quickly as the fibers do not absorb much water.</li>
            <li>This textile gives just the right amount of friction and does so very evenly and is easy to manipulate because of the length.  </li>
            <li>Yeah I had never herd of them either until I agreed to review them in return for a free product and let me tell you they worked very well.</li>
            <li>You get three in the package, and in addition to being colorful, they seem well made.</li>
            <li>My thoughts are of my own and are based solely on my personal experiences with this product.</li>
            <li>My suggestion would be to toss them in the wash as frequently as you would your towels to make sure they really stay clean and don’t harbor any bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they are more than long enough that you can easily scrub your own back from top to bottom.  </li>
            <li>These BelleSha hard exfoliating bath towels are perfect if you want to exfoliate that hard-to-reach skin on your back.  </li>
            <li>The skin feels soft and clean after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First I must say these are more the size of a long hand towel.</li>
            <li>Cleanse your back easily with exfoliating bath towel</li>
            <li>But I consider them too large for washing the rest of me.</li>
            <li>They clean up easily &amp; dry quickly.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working fine on my back.</li>
            <li>They really exfoliate well.</li>
            <li>The sheets (I hearby refuse to call them towels) are pliable and create a mass of suds with a reasonable amount of bodywash.  </li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo9RPYD4FQFU2A]]This towel has an interesting texture, it has somewhat rough construction with loops that remind me of Velcro.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rough so really good for scrubbing the back.</li>
            <li>Taking off dead skin however is just what they like to do most.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still almost new.</li>
            <li>This is a new product to us that we started to like.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These vibrantly colored rough mesh towels not only work well to slough off dead skin cells, but because of the length, always work great as a back scratcher!</li>
            <li>Ok, not really, but getting you dry is not on their list of objectives.  </li>
            <li>hence you have to be cautious when using in the sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>They weigh almost nothing and the biggest initial impression is from the intense candy</li>
            <li>The length and width were just right for getting my back, something I normally would need a long handled scrub brush for.  </li>
            <li>You can literally feel and see the difference as they clean the dead skin off you.</li>
            <li>It is a decent size towel for scrubbing the back of the body.</li>
            <li>recently had a very close family member in Hospice care in my home, and she was bedridden for the last eight weeks of her life.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These cloths also do work well as intended, for gentle to moderate exfoliation in the bath, especially when used with a creamy body wash like the ones from Dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What would you have if you took a pouf net sponge / shower ball and straightened it out into a large, single sheet?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a simple idea that I&#x27;m surprised that it&#x27;s not the standard as of</li>
            <li>One could cut these down into small sections, turning 3 into several more and saving a bit of change.  </li>
            <li>The texture is much rougher than the previous brand I had used.</li>
            <li>So... these &amp;#34;exfoliating bath towels&amp;#34; are really nothing like a towel, other than they are flat and rectangular shaped and can be used in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so make a super back-scratcher, but I’m not sure if that will work as well, because the braided rope wouldn’t be as uniform as the flat surface of the individual strips.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s when you go for something a little less soft and a little more exfoliating like these bath cloths by BelleSha.</li>
            <li>It is pretty big for other parts of the body.&lt;br /&gt;The towel is a bit rough</li>

            <li> The towel is long enough to hold on each end and rub it on your back.</li>
            <li> It is long enough to reach around and use on my back.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about whole body.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quite simply, you use them, rinse them, hang them up to dry, and reuse them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve claimed the yellow one then gave my husband the blue one and my daughter the pink one.</li>
            <li> These felt too rough when dry, but when they finally got wet, they were not rough enough.</li>
            <li> They are thin but just the right amount of texture to get a deep scrub on without causing irritation.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t rub it against my skin hard, I do it gently wish my cleaners</li>
            <li> You can also wad it up and use it like a poof on easier-to-reach places like your arms and legs, but i found it a shade too rough to use on tender skin like my inner arms, my stomach, or my</li>
            <li> long and are made of finely-woven and slightly-stretchy mesh that is hemmed at both ends.  </li>
            <li> As long as you aren&#x27;t expecting something soft and luxurious, and you want to scrub off dead skin (which is what exfoliate means in not so flowery language), then these will get the job</li>
            <li> they are long enough to grab in both hands and shimmy up and down your back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only the pink was exfoliating and &#x27;rough&#x27; the blue and yellow as soon as I wet them, they turned flat and delicate!&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> There’s no description, but I’ll say that the yellow is a super hard weave, the pink a hard weave, and the blue a medium weave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really want to make that clear because I know somebody will buy them thinking they are absorbent like a towel should be, and they&#x27;ll be angry when they receive these.</li>
            <li> Towels get you dry.  </li>
            <li> Back brush can lather your back but not these towels can also give you a rub to remove dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> not sure what the product&#x27;s instructions are, but i throw it in the washing machine with a batch of cold water washing once a week or so, and dry it flat, and so far it has held up just fine.</li>
            <li> This towel&#x27;s size is 11.5\\&quot; wide and 35\\&quot; long.</li>
            <li> Rinsing takes a little longer compared to a pouf or washcloth, but only a little extra.  </li>
            <li> A total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> wide by 35 in.</li>
            <li> Cleaned and out of the shower, my skin was pink and tingly.  </li>
            <li> Not intended for use on the face (or use very carefully), but work well on rough, calloused heels.</li>
            <li> These, unfortunately, are already looking worn, and they shed in the tub, leaving pink, blue or yellow tiny bits in the water.</li>
            <li> For years, I have used a bath brush with dense bristles as a back scratcher, but no more.  </li>
            <li> It is very hard to reach your back unless you have a back brush.</li>
            <li> I use them for scratching those hard to reach spots on back too.</li>
            <li> Though they are a little rough so don’t push to hard.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package the bath towel were somewhat smelling but after few minutes the smell seems to be wear off.</li>
            <li> Even felt up a few at the store just to see if the ones I had hanging around were wearing out.  </li>
            <li> Now some people might think that is a negative remark, but I mean it in no such way.</li>
            <li> I made one small square for my face</li>
            <li> I just ordered one that says it is the really &#x27;hard weave&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I thought they were scratchier than a common pouf/synthetic loofah.  </li>
            <li> #34;a piece of thick absorbent cloth or paper used for drying oneself or wiping things dry&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> They are essentially a thin scrubby pad like you might use to do dishes.</li>
            <li> It thin and transparent as you can see in my video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;In terms of price, not too bad.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are better qualty than the Body Shop equivalents.  Have been using it now for months and it&#x27;s still almost new.</li>
            <li> I used to buy exfoliating bath towels and they lasted for ages. They were well made and kept their exfoliating properties. These, unfortunately, are already looking worn, and they shed in the tub, leaving pink, blue or yellow tiny bits in the water. If you&#x27;re in a shower I guess it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> Sometimes those super plush washcloths just don&#x27;t get the job done so that&#x27;s when you go for something a little less soft and a little more exfoliating like these bath cloths by BelleSha. They are thin but just the right amount of texture to get a deep scrub on without causing irritation. I like that this is a 3-pack with 3 different colors. I&#x27;ve claimed the yellow one then gave my husband the blue one and my daughter the pink one. They clean up easily &amp; dry quickly. *I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.*</li>
            <li> When I opened the package the bath towel were somewhat smelling but after few minutes the smell seems to be wear off.It&#x27;s rough so really good for scrubbing the back.I am not sure about whole body.It does dries very quickly.Seems to be working fine on my back.I got this from seller for evaluation purpose.</li>
            <li> These are great and provide just the right amount of exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I was offered these for review and figured I had nothing to lose, so I accepted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I have to cover is the name choice for this product. The word &amp;#34;towel&amp;#34; as defined in every dictionary I&#x27;ve consulted is defined similar to the following: &amp;#34;a piece of thick absorbent cloth or paper used for drying oneself or wiping things dry&amp;#34;. Folks, there is nothing absorbent about these towels. I really want to make that clear because I know somebody will buy them thinking they are absorbent like a towel should be, and they&#x27;ll be angry when they receive these. I once reviewed colored paper that was even titled as such and saw the product had three one star reviews from shoppers complaining that the paper was colored and not white... I kid you not. So... these &amp;#34;exfoliating bath towels&amp;#34; are really nothing like a towel, other than they are flat and rectangular shaped and can be used in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the above said, these things definitely do exfoliate. They are essentially a thin scrubby pad like you might use to do dishes. Now some people might think that is a negative remark, but I mean it in no such way. As long as you aren&#x27;t expecting something soft and luxurious, and you want to scrub off dead skin (which is what exfoliate means in not so flowery language), then these will get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had a very close family member in Hospice care in my home, and she was bedridden for the last eight weeks of her life. We cut these into 10 inch squares and used them during her sponge baths. She really liked the way they made her skin feel, and they did a great job of keeping her skin looking nice and fresh. I&#x27;m wavering between a four and five rating, but because they made my loved one feel better in her last days, I&#x27;m going with five stars.</li>
            <li> These BelleSha hard exfoliating bath towels are perfect if you want to exfoliate that hard-to-reach skin on your back.  Sometimes a bath brush just isn’t enough and lathering up and using an exfoliating towel does the trick.  There are three different exfoliating towels in this packet, each a different weave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a nylon and polyester mix that gives them exfoliating power, but also that extra bit of flexibility that works well when trying to do your back.  There’s no description, but I’ll say that the yellow is a super hard weave, the pink a hard weave, and the blue a medium weave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite simply, you use them, rinse them, hang them up to dry, and reuse them.  My suggestion would be to toss them in the wash as frequently as you would your towels to make sure they really stay clean and don’t harbor any bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►  Cleanse your back easily with exfoliating bath towel&lt;br /&gt;►  Dimensions: 34.5 x 11.5 inches&lt;br /&gt;►  Made of 60% nylon 40% polyester&lt;br /&gt;►  Dries quickly&lt;br /&gt;►  Use with your favorite shower gel or body wash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality?  Well, I don’t have a lot to compare these with, but I can say that they will provide a very nice bathing experience and will make your skin feel wonderful.  The packaging is minamalist-style and comes in a simple plastic bag.  Each towel comes to just over four dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting something with some scratch and body, but these are junky.  A total waste of money.  I just ordered one that says it is the really &#x27;hard weave&#x27;.  I&#x27;ve tried the hard weave before, and it is wonderful.  These are too flimsy.</li>
            <li> It is a decent size towel for scrubbing the back of the body. It is pretty big for other parts of the body.&lt;br /&gt;The towel is a bit rough hence you have to be cautious when using in the sensitive skin. The skin feels soft and clean after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample received for a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li> Exfoliating towels you say?  Yeah I had never herd of them either until I agreed to review them in return for a free product and let me tell you they worked very well. You can literally feel and see the difference as they clean the dead skin off you. Though they are a little rough so don’t push to hard.</li>
            <li> What would you have if you took a pouf net sponge / shower ball and straightened it out into a large, single sheet?  A BelleShe Exfoliating Bath Towel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, I wasn&#x27;t sold on the idea when I was offered a sample to review but once I tried using them it was like a showering revolution!  While that may be overselling it a bit, these textured towels work a LOT better than the shower balls as they lather nicely and they allow you to have complete control over the pressure you&#x27;re providing and exactly where you&#x27;re able to get it.  These towels work great on feet and between toes and they are more than long enough that you can easily scrub your own back from top to bottom.  It&#x27;s such a simple idea that I&#x27;m surprised that it&#x27;s not the standard as of yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is I love this product and give it five stars all the way!</li>
            <li> Loved it. Arrives quickly. Good quality. Good price.</li>
            <li> Horrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only the pink was exfoliating and &#x27;rough&#x27; the blue and yellow as soon as I wet them, they turned flat and delicate!&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money. I wanted three good ones not just one. I want my money back</li>
            <li> If you want to scrub your back without dislocating your shoulders, this is a great product. You can also wad it up and use it like a poof on easier-to-reach places like your arms and legs, but i found it a shade too rough to use on tender skin like my inner arms, my stomach, or my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the product&#x27;s instructions are, but i throw it in the washing machine with a batch of cold water washing once a week or so, and dry it flat, and so far it has held up just fine.</li>
            <li> I was asked by BelleSha to try their product in exchange for an honest review. I gave these towel&#x27;s to my wife and her review is below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These vibrantly colored rough mesh towels not only work well to slough off dead skin cells, but because of the length, always work great as a back scratcher! Not intended for use on the face (or use very carefully), but work well on rough, calloused heels. You get three in the package, and in addition to being colorful, they seem well made.</li>
            <li> Exfoliating is a must for your skin. This helps promote good cell turnover and refreshes your skin. Theses bellesha exfoliating bath towel towelettes are a easy way for all over exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;These exfoliating bath towels are 34.5 x 11.5&amp;#34;. It comes in a three pack of bright and vibrant colors.I personally trimmed it to make individual pads for every day use. I made one small square for my face so I keep that by my sink and then I cut off a nice size portion or all over exfoliation. Now I don&#x27;t rub it against my skin hard, I do it gently wish my cleaners and it works just fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am satisfied with this product. I received this product for free for testing purposes in exchange for an honest review. My thoughts are of my own and are based solely on my personal experiences with this product.</li>
            <li> The texture is much rougher than the previous brand I had used. So I will be returning.  Nice bright colors.</li>
            <li> These exfoliating cloths are popular in Asia and particularly in Japan.  They don’t look like very much, to be sure.  They are about 11 1/2 in. wide by 35 in. long and are made of finely-woven and slightly-stretchy mesh that is hemmed at both ends.  They weigh almost nothing and the biggest initial impression is from the intense candy colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, they are wonderful not just for exfoliating, but for gently scratching itchy skin without irritating it or making it itch more.  For years, I have used a bath brush with dense bristles as a back scratcher, but no more.  This textile gives just the right amount of friction and does so very evenly and is easy to manipulate because of the length.  I am also thinking about twisting and braiding all three together so make a super back-scratcher, but I’m not sure if that will work as well, because the braided rope wouldn’t be as uniform as the flat surface of the individual strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These cloths also do work well as intended, for gentle to moderate exfoliation in the bath, especially when used with a creamy body wash like the ones from Dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BelleSha provided a sample for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> First I must say these are more the size of a long hand towel. However they are perfect for scrubbing your back! they are long enough to grab in both hands and shimmy up and down your back. They really exfoliate well. My skin felt very clean after using this product. I use them for scratching those hard to reach spots on back too. You can use them for exfoliating almost anywhere, however they are rough and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them on sensitive skin. I received this product for a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li> 3-pack color coded, so family members will not confuse which one is hers/his. This is a new product to us that we started to like. It is very hard to reach your back unless you have a back brush. Back brush can lather your back but not these towels can also give you a rub to remove dead skin cells. The towel is long enough to hold on each end and rub it on your back. It also reach parts of your back that itches which makes dual-purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After use, I pat it on a terry towel to remove water. This way it doesn&#x27;t get soggy or prevent the growth of germs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.</li>
            <li> *Disclosure: I was contacted by a rep for BellaSha and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;You want us to what?&amp;#34; asked my housemates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Exfoliate!  It&#x27;s eeeeeeeeasy.  Just use it.  Put your bodywash on there, and scrub.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy did I get the hairy eyeball.  Oh well.  If I find something fishy in my coffee, I know where they live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon examination, these &amp;#34;bath towels&amp;#34; are not towels.  Towels get you dry.  These take your skin off.  Ok, not really, but getting you dry is not on their list of objectives.  Taking off dead skin however is just what they like to do most.  I thought they were scratchier than a common pouf/synthetic loofah.  Even felt up a few at the store just to see if the ones I had hanging around were wearing out.  The sheets (I hearby refuse to call them towels) are pliable and create a mass of suds with a reasonable amount of bodywash.  The length and width were just right for getting my back, something I normally would need a long handled scrub brush for.  Rinsing takes a little longer compared to a pouf or washcloth, but only a little extra.  Cleaned and out of the shower, my skin was pink and tingly.  Ok, they work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of price, not too bad.  One could cut these down into small sections, turning 3 into several more and saving a bit of change.  I&#x27;d call them a win so far.  As for the housemates, I guess I should have warned them about where on the body it wasn&#x27;t a good idea to use them.  I&#x27;ll be keep an eye on my coffee for a while.</li>
            <li> These are just right--both size and texture--for scrubbing your back. The short ends have a folded-over seam that makes it easier to get a grip. But I consider them too large for washing the rest of me. That&#x27;s okay though, it&#x27;s great to have something like this in addition to my hand-size scrubby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from BelleSha.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo9RPYD4FQFU2A]]This towel has an interesting texture, it has somewhat rough construction with loops that remind me of Velcro. This towel&#x27;s size is 11.5\\&quot; wide and 35\\&quot; long. It is long enough to reach around and use on my back. It gives my back a pleasant scratching, it leathers up well, and I like it. It is made out of 60% nylon and 40% polyester. It dries very quickly as the fibers do not absorb much water. It thin and transparent as you can see in my video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This exfoliating bath towel is provided by BellaSha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> These felt too rough when dry, but when they finally got wet, they were not rough enough. Oh well!</li>
