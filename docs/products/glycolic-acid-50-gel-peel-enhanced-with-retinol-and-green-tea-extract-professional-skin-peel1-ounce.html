            <li>perfect image has a 30% Glycolic Peel formula if you are a novice.</li>

            <li>Im so happy!!</li>
            <li>Awesome!!</li>
            <li>For best results mix with vitamin c cream consider one of the ones featured on amazon)  which helps activate the product quicker and feels smoother...</li>
            <li>This is a great peel!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s awesome!  </li>
            <li>spas will look at you like you have two heads, if you ask for it on your knees and elbows :-D</li>

            <li>sure to wear sunscreen after doing these treatments!!!</li>
            <li>Simply Amazing!!</li>
            <li>Ideal results should be experiences within 4-6 months.</li>
            <li>This works great.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>All my friends tell me how great my skin looks now.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel great but it hurts when it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li>I think this is a great product</li>
            <li>Serums are best to use after your treatment as they will absorb better and moisturize your skin, then follow up with a moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found perfect image!</li>
            <li>the product is actually really effective!</li>
            <li>It is very strong!</li>
            <li>Good product!&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good peel.</li>
            <li>it was a good peel in-between the 2.</li>
            <li>So far-so good.</li>
            <li>I just hope it continues to do me good.</li>
            <li>and then the item I&#x27;m using doesn&#x27;t work so good after a while.</li>
            <li>They have a superior  quality</li>
            <li>The expiration is good, but you never know what you are getting.</li>
            <li>I also had a good bit of peeling which made me feel like it was doing its job.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this purchase and my priors from Perfect Image:product is good, shipping is quick and well packaged.</li>
            <li>It smells really good, and works nicely on my face.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I believe you will love this peel too!</li>
            <li>I love these peels!  </li>
            <li>But this works amazing people ask what im using.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing product.</li>
            <li>: try this method at your own risk.</li>
            <li>you go to a nice spa and have this done ask what percentage they are using on you and take a look at the take home products they try to sell you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Be sure and follow directions and use a good moisturizer and  your sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>and I look 24 or 25 mainly because of the perfect image peels.</li>
            <li>The glycolic is probably the best out of all of the Perfect Image peels that I&#x27;ve used in the past 2-3 years---and I&#x27;ve used every peel in their skin-care line except the papaya and pineapple.</li>
            <li>It is very strong.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong so use it with care.  </li>
            <li>I plan on moving up to Lactic Acid and/or TCA peels that Perfect image also offers after I&#x27;m finished with the Level 2 bottle.  </li>
            <li>Perfect Image makes it clear</li>
            <li>This peel is without question the most effective I have ever found without a prescription.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and shipping quick.</li>
            <li>This peel is also good at keeping mild acne at bay(not 100% though).</li>
            <li>Works even better than the lactic acid peel.</li>
            <li>Love the 50 glycolic.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I do love the fact that these are gel peels, but if you want another peel of this strength, I would say go with the lactic acid.  </li>
            <li>It is much more moisturizing and it seems to be  better at brightening my skin.  </li>
            <li>It also tightened my skin much much more than the glycolic.  </li>
            <li>but I think it just soaked up most of the product.</li>
            <li>My make up went on much better as well.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m confident I will with continued use.</li>
            <li>It basically removes the protective layer of your skin and puts you at risk for more harmful UV</li>
            <li>Give yourself a peek once a month and you will get even better results than using a lotion every day.  </li>
            <li>It gives me a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother and the oiliness is better controlled.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and I saw more results with the 30 than I&#x27;ve seen with this.</li>
            <li>When I put it on my face, I felt more sting than Lactic Acid 50%.</li>
            <li>but I felt that it was safe to use.  </li>
            <li>It stings a bit more then the 30%</li>
            <li>I can handle this peel better than others</li>
            <li>This should help even more with wrinkle and pigment/discoloration that have been plugging my face for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they want you to succeed when using it as well as making sure your experience is successful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face has never been better.</li>
            <li>Love this product, and have stepped up from the 30%.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>Need a more aggressive peel</li>
            <li>It also helps make-up application glide smoothly and set SO beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve applied this peel on many occasions to treat acne and post-inflammatory hyper pigmentation (PIH).  </li>
            <li>Excellent Glycolic Peel, especially for an at home peel.  </li>
            <li>recommend following the directions enclosed to the tee for the best results.</li>
            <li>Be sure to rinse your face thoroughly with water or something pH neutralizing after waiting the recommended amount of time.</li>
            <li>I ordered more product to repeat the process until I am completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I have done more than one applications.</li>
            <li>Saw results after first application!!!</li>
            <li>Add more water if the tingling sensation is too strong..</li>
            <li>The 50% strength is not as strong as a doctor&#x27;s office - but I can use it more often.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, in 2 weeks i can clearly see the diference, my face is more bright and more clean</li>
            <li>and I do recommend it, but please follow the directions closely and use a very good moisturizer and apply it several times the day you use this product.  </li>
            <li>This product worked great for me, but I would not recommend it to those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great peel with clear instructions.</li>
            <li>Within 2-3 days of using the product I got some light flaking and peeling around my nose which cleared away to nicer, more even toned skin.</li>
            <li>First time users, be sure to have a makeshift fan handy, trust me, you&#x27;ll need it.</li>
            <li>I have tried the 30% peel from Perfect Image and felt I needed a little more</li>
            <li>This is a great product and will definitely buy more once it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>It has greatly improved my overall skin texture and the once prominent pores on my nose</li>
            <li>Winter in NY requires more exfoliation so moisturizer can be absorbed better.</li>
            <li>I am a strong believer of peels, and I like this one.</li>
            <li>I have been doing peels my whole life and this stuff is very potent.</li>
            <li>fine lines have has deceased a lot.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and shiny skin after treatments.  </li>
            <li>important tips when using this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Moisturize the skin with a non hypoallergenic moisturizer that is free from perfumes that may irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve had peels before and are comfortable with the sting, this is your product.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>and I must say my chest area looks smooth and rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li>But so far, so good.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;sting factor&amp;#34; was quite a bit higher with the 50%, but my face feels very smooth afterward.  </li>
            <li>I first used level 1 to try this out because I love glycolic acid products.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to start with the Level 1 peel first.</li>
            <li>Works great, even on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I never experience peeling, just tightness and feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>That way you know the professional procedure and actual amount of time to leave the mask on and also the Percentage that works best for you.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any real reductions of wrinkles, although, I have seen some reduction in the fine lines around my eyes, so I am giving this product 4 stars, instead of 5!  </li>
            <li>so I was super excited when I saw this product.</li>
            <li>The latest edition of Fitzpatrick&#x27;s Dermatology outlines promising results by combining skin needling and peels.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been blessed with good genetics in that I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, but my splotchy skin tone definitely ages my skin.</li>
            <li>It came very well packaged and the bottle itself was wrapped in plastic to make sure there was no leakage.</li>
            <li>I can keep it on for the full time.</li>
            <li>Use a cool fan on your face as the &#x27;burning&#x27; intensifies.</li>
            <li>I love this product it really does wonders on my acne and as well as on my acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;Glycolic</li>
            <li>It is not a bad smell, I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Was not irritating and my skin looks as good as a professional chemical peel.  </li>
            <li>Mild lotions will help with your appearance during this phase.</li>
            <li>and then before you use the actual peel, swipe your face clean with alcohol (drug store kind).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a product junkie and love trying out new skin care and makeup.</li>
            <li>This peel has really helped to smooth out my face.</li>
            <li>I think I need a different kind of acid.</li>
            <li>Powerful stuff.  </li>
            <li>Since M-D Forte&#x27; decided to abandon loyal customers and cease production of its 30% glycolic acid face cream, this is the logical alternative.  </li>
            <li>I guess most people don&#x27;t know about these peels because they don&#x27;t appear on commercials and are mainly done in high end spas.</li>
            <li>Use soft cotton pads/balls to apply the gel ( may be used on various areas of the body that need refreshing ie forehead, cheeks, chin, nose, neck, chest, top of hands, elbows and knees etc.)</li>
            <li>Its nice because after the couple of treatments, I don&#x27;t have to really do anything but moisturize my legs for the next month.</li>
            <li>This will greatly decrease any possible sensitivity when starting with Level1 on this product since your skin will have a chance to acclimate to it.</li>
            <li>My hyper pigmentation is slowly but surely fading, faster than it would if I allowed my skin to heal on its own.  </li>
            <li>Of course, I will try it from another company&#x27;s product because I like using new stuff!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Be very gentle with your skin the first 3-5 days after application of this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it , I can feel and see the  the different in my skin texture and have done two treatment.my face is softer .the</li>
            <li>The first application I used a cotton pad</li>
            <li>The second time I used my fingers and it worked much better.  </li>
            <li>My skin was incredibly smooth and soft and noticeably brighter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first at-home peel.  </li>
            <li>I bought this about two months ago and have been using consistently.</li>
            <li>and it was my first time to use chemical peel on my face by myself.</li>
            <li>This is such a fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>I used all lactic acid 50%, which was pretty worked well for my face, so, at this time, I ordered Glycolic Acid 50% gel, and I have used 3 times every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>After first use I got visible results and over 8 weeks use (using once per week)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a change with my skin within 2-3 days after first using the Level 1 product.  </li>
            <li>Use a good quality moisturizer on your face for the the first few days as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time user and I purchased this product and followed the instructions exactly as written.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>With consistent use, there will be a noticeable change.  </li>
            <li>That said, I decided to experiment and use the 50% on my décolletage area where age shows first.  </li>
            <li>My cheeks, especially look more youthful.</li>
            <li>I am MALE, but very conscious of my skin and finally ordered Perfect Image after using a product with Glycolic Acid (only 8%) and being happy with the results that the small concentration of Glycolic Acid within a lotion gave me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so strong, actually, that I&#x27;m a bit surprised it&#x27;s available here.  </li>
            <li>It really helps all beauty products penetrate deep into the skin and work better.</li>
            <li>The sting was intense at first</li>
            <li>Probably a little bit stronger than I needed, still love it!</li>
            <li>When you start washing it off it becomes a little more burny, but it goes away really quick.</li>
            <li>actual lemon, not the bottle), will work just fine as a alpha hydroxyl astringent.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to everyon!</li>
            <li>the lighter spots are very faded.</li>
            <li>Always monitor the effects and if there&#x27;s too much reddening or burning rinse off immediately.</li>
            <li>If I do then it fades really fast (within 5</li>
            <li>You will be very irritated.</li>
            <li>I have used the 30% peel, and felt I was ready for the 50%.  </li>
            <li>I works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Do purchase a brush tho, it makes it much easier to apply.</li>
            <li>I used this product on myself and really noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>This product really works well.</li>
            <li>It takes up to 3 days to really see the results after you use it, but I&#x27;m really like it.</li>
            <li>Delivery has been fast each time I&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
            <li>Burns so much had to remove immediately.</li>
            <li>I expected more result for a high level peel.</li>
            <li>I am 74 yrs old and have pretty good skin but several freckles in that area due to sun exposure.  </li>
            <li>Initial results (day 1) is very soft and smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Use the full amount the dropper will allow {about a teaspoon} mix with equal parts of bottled water.</li>
            <li>I personally soak a fan brush with water and squeeze out a dropper full of the peel onto the brush then apply it onto my face.</li>
            <li>I use a blow dryer on cool the entire time and witch</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product but very dangerous if you don&#x27;t follow guidelines respectfully.</li>
            <li>my legs are so smooth - dry skin gone.  </li>
            <li>I started with Level 1 and quickly moved up to Level 2 after very carefully following all directions contained with the products.</li>
            <li>50% is WAY too high of a percentage to start off with on virgin</li>
            <li>I think it is not as strong as I read in other reviews.  </li>
            <li>Sure it has a four star rating, but not very many reviews, so I was a bit</li>
            <li>you receive some dermaplaning by a REAL professional.</li>
            <li>I suffer through bouts of cystic acne and this peel is able to penetrate my dermis enough to dry out my pimples.</li>
            <li>And my skin is very sensitive, I recommend it</li>
            <li>AFTER USING INSTANT PEEL FIRST...</li>
            <li>The directions say to only leave it on for 30 seconds the first use.</li>
            <li>Areas of the skin may be red for the first 24-48 hours.</li>
            <li>It cleared up old and new acne.</li>
            <li>Gently pat dry your skin and use a mild, high quality face soap for those first few days after the application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This peel does an outstanding job of brightening my skin and giving it a boost when it is getting dull.</li>
            <li>Does great, follow the instructions or you&#x27;ll be extra sorry.</li>
            <li>It also cures my adult acne.</li>
            <li>However, it is early on, so things could change.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have an olive complexion, and at 63 years, my skin has developed some age spots.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really get all that red after using it.</li>
            <li>Does not even come close to a professional peel.  </li>
            <li>Going to a professional from now on.</li>
            <li>So far when I use the product yes, it does tingle</li>
            <li>I am 64 years old and use it on my lower legs -</li>
            <li>Whenever i use this  it leaves  the  skin soft and the pores shrink.. leaving my  skin with a  glow</li>
            <li>I have been using once a month for three months so far</li>
            <li>Wipe off with soft cotton pads/balls drenched in ice water.</li>
            <li>In most day spas this a glycol peel is at least an $40 add on for the face.</li>
            <li>Professional Skin Peel)1 ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kashish Gupta</li>
            <li>The other differences are definitely worth keeping it up, though.</li>
            <li>I really notice a different in my face texture and my acne scars when I regularly use this once a week.</li>
            <li>and I do not apply it above my upper lip or very close to my eyebrows, as that caused itching as well.  </li>
            <li>It was okay, but a bit weak for me.</li>
            <li>an entire layer of dead skin will peel off leaving fresh new pinkish skin.</li>
            <li>Please follow directions carefully and be certain to do sensitivity test beforehand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only done about 3 peels so far</li>
            <li>Bottom line however, talk to your doctor or dermatologist if you have sensitive skin or issues prior to using this product.</li>
            <li>However, now I can keep it on the complete 2 minutes, with less intense sting.  </li>
            <li>The other option, which I have tried, is to apply the Level 2 product, but only briefly at first, perhaps for one minute.</li>
            <li>The directions are thorough and clearly written;  following these instructions carefully really does produce the same results as a salon peel, minus the salon cost.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to apply from much longer than 8 minutes due to the strength.</li>
            <li>and I could only stand one minute, just barely.  </li>
            <li>I first ordered the 20% glycolic peel a few times before I even considered this one.</li>
            <li>and after I wash it off my face seems to be a little more pinker than usual</li>
            <li>It did tingle a little bit more that what I have used in the past</li>
            <li>It stings, so I was a little nervous the first time and only left it on 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I am a bit clearer right after the peel, but definitely for the next 2-3 days after I am VERY dry to the point where it ages me slightly.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Ideal results should be experiences within 4-6 months.</li>
            <li> This works great.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> All my friends tell me how great my skin looks now.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel great but it hurts when it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product</li>
            <li> Serums are best to use after your treatment as they will absorb better and moisturize your skin, then follow up with a moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found perfect image!</li>
            <li> the product is actually really effective!</li>
            <li> It is very strong!</li>
            <li> Good product!&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good peel.</li>
            <li> it was a good peel in-between the 2.</li>
            <li> So far-so good.</li>
            <li> I just hope it continues to do me good.</li>
            <li> and then the item I&#x27;m using doesn&#x27;t work so good after a while.</li>
            <li> They have a superior  quality</li>
            <li> The expiration is good, but you never know what you are getting.</li>
            <li> I also had a good bit of peeling which made me feel like it was doing its job.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase and my priors from Perfect Image:product is good, shipping is quick and well packaged.</li>
            <li> It smells really good, and works nicely on my face.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I believe you will love this peel too!</li>
            <li> I love these peels!  </li>
            <li> But this works amazing people ask what im using.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product.</li>
            <li> : try this method at your own risk.</li>
            <li> you go to a nice spa and have this done ask what percentage they are using on you and take a look at the take home products they try to sell you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Be sure and follow directions and use a good moisturizer and  your sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> and I look 24 or 25 mainly because of the perfect image peels.</li>
            <li> The glycolic is probably the best out of all of the Perfect Image peels that I&#x27;ve used in the past 2-3 years---and I&#x27;ve used every peel in their skin-care line except the papaya and pineapple.</li>
            <li> It is very strong.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong so use it with care.  </li>
            <li> I plan on moving up to Lactic Acid and/or TCA peels that Perfect image also offers after I&#x27;m finished with the Level 2 bottle.  </li>
            <li> Perfect Image makes it clear</li>
            <li> This peel is without question the most effective I have ever found without a prescription.  </li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and shipping quick.</li>
            <li> This peel is also good at keeping mild acne at bay(not 100% though).</li>
            <li> Works even better than the lactic acid peel.</li>
            <li> Love the 50 glycolic.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I do love the fact that these are gel peels, but if you want another peel of this strength, I would say go with the lactic acid.  </li>
            <li> It is much more moisturizing and it seems to be  better at brightening my skin.  </li>
            <li> It also tightened my skin much much more than the glycolic.  </li>
            <li> but I think it just soaked up most of the product.</li>
            <li> My make up went on much better as well.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m confident I will with continued use.</li>
            <li> It basically removes the protective layer of your skin and puts you at risk for more harmful UV</li>
            <li> Give yourself a peek once a month and you will get even better results than using a lotion every day.  </li>
            <li> It gives me a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother and the oiliness is better controlled.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> and I saw more results with the 30 than I&#x27;ve seen with this.</li>
            <li> When I put it on my face, I felt more sting than Lactic Acid 50%.</li>
            <li> but I felt that it was safe to use.  </li>
            <li> It stings a bit more then the 30%</li>
            <li> I can handle this peel better than others</li>
            <li> This should help even more with wrinkle and pigment/discoloration that have been plugging my face for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they want you to succeed when using it as well as making sure your experience is successful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face has never been better.</li>
            <li> Love this product, and have stepped up from the 30%.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> Need a more aggressive peel</li>
            <li> It also helps make-up application glide smoothly and set SO beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied this peel on many occasions to treat acne and post-inflammatory hyper pigmentation (PIH).  </li>
            <li> Excellent Glycolic Peel, especially for an at home peel.  </li>
            <li> recommend following the directions enclosed to the tee for the best results.</li>
            <li> Be sure to rinse your face thoroughly with water or something pH neutralizing after waiting the recommended amount of time.</li>
            <li> I ordered more product to repeat the process until I am completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I have done more than one applications.</li>
            <li> Saw results after first application!!!</li>
            <li> Add more water if the tingling sensation is too strong..</li>
            <li> The 50% strength is not as strong as a doctor&#x27;s office - but I can use it more often.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, in 2 weeks i can clearly see the diference, my face is more bright and more clean</li>
            <li> and I do recommend it, but please follow the directions closely and use a very good moisturizer and apply it several times the day you use this product.  </li>
            <li> This product worked great for me, but I would not recommend it to those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great peel with clear instructions.</li>
            <li> Within 2-3 days of using the product I got some light flaking and peeling around my nose which cleared away to nicer, more even toned skin.</li>
            <li> First time users, be sure to have a makeshift fan handy, trust me, you&#x27;ll need it.</li>
            <li> I have tried the 30% peel from Perfect Image and felt I needed a little more</li>
            <li> This is a great product and will definitely buy more once it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> It has greatly improved my overall skin texture and the once prominent pores on my nose</li>
            <li> Winter in NY requires more exfoliation so moisturizer can be absorbed better.</li>
            <li> I am a strong believer of peels, and I like this one.</li>
            <li> I have been doing peels my whole life and this stuff is very potent.</li>
            <li> fine lines have has deceased a lot.  </li>
            <li> Smooth and shiny skin after treatments.  </li>
            <li> important tips when using this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Moisturize the skin with a non hypoallergenic moisturizer that is free from perfumes that may irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had peels before and are comfortable with the sting, this is your product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> and I must say my chest area looks smooth and rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li> But so far, so good.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;sting factor&amp;#34; was quite a bit higher with the 50%, but my face feels very smooth afterward.  </li>
            <li> I first used level 1 to try this out because I love glycolic acid products.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to start with the Level 1 peel first.</li>
            <li> Works great, even on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I never experience peeling, just tightness and feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> That way you know the professional procedure and actual amount of time to leave the mask on and also the Percentage that works best for you.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any real reductions of wrinkles, although, I have seen some reduction in the fine lines around my eyes, so I am giving this product 4 stars, instead of 5!  </li>
            <li> so I was super excited when I saw this product.</li>
            <li> The latest edition of Fitzpatrick&#x27;s Dermatology outlines promising results by combining skin needling and peels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been blessed with good genetics in that I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, but my splotchy skin tone definitely ages my skin.</li>
            <li> It came very well packaged and the bottle itself was wrapped in plastic to make sure there was no leakage.</li>
            <li> I can keep it on for the full time.</li>
            <li> Use a cool fan on your face as the &#x27;burning&#x27; intensifies.</li>
            <li> I love this product it really does wonders on my acne and as well as on my acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;Glycolic</li>
            <li> It is not a bad smell, I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Was not irritating and my skin looks as good as a professional chemical peel.  </li>
            <li> Mild lotions will help with your appearance during this phase.</li>
            <li> and then before you use the actual peel, swipe your face clean with alcohol (drug store kind).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product junkie and love trying out new skin care and makeup.</li>
            <li> This peel has really helped to smooth out my face.</li>
            <li> I think I need a different kind of acid.</li>
            <li> Powerful stuff.  </li>
            <li> Since M-D Forte&#x27; decided to abandon loyal customers and cease production of its 30% glycolic acid face cream, this is the logical alternative.  </li>
            <li> I guess most people don&#x27;t know about these peels because they don&#x27;t appear on commercials and are mainly done in high end spas.</li>
            <li> Use soft cotton pads/balls to apply the gel ( may be used on various areas of the body that need refreshing ie forehead, cheeks, chin, nose, neck, chest, top of hands, elbows and knees etc.)</li>
            <li> Its nice because after the couple of treatments, I don&#x27;t have to really do anything but moisturize my legs for the next month.</li>
            <li> This will greatly decrease any possible sensitivity when starting with Level1 on this product since your skin will have a chance to acclimate to it.</li>
            <li> My hyper pigmentation is slowly but surely fading, faster than it would if I allowed my skin to heal on its own.  </li>
            <li> Of course, I will try it from another company&#x27;s product because I like using new stuff!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Be very gentle with your skin the first 3-5 days after application of this product.  </li>
            <li> I love it , I can feel and see the  the different in my skin texture and have done two treatment.my face is softer .the</li>
            <li> The first application I used a cotton pad</li>
            <li> The second time I used my fingers and it worked much better.  </li>
            <li> My skin was incredibly smooth and soft and noticeably brighter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first at-home peel.  </li>
            <li> I bought this about two months ago and have been using consistently.</li>
            <li> and it was my first time to use chemical peel on my face by myself.</li>
            <li> This is such a fantastic product!  </li>
            <li> I used all lactic acid 50%, which was pretty worked well for my face, so, at this time, I ordered Glycolic Acid 50% gel, and I have used 3 times every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> After first use I got visible results and over 8 weeks use (using once per week)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a change with my skin within 2-3 days after first using the Level 1 product.  </li>
            <li> Use a good quality moisturizer on your face for the the first few days as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time user and I purchased this product and followed the instructions exactly as written.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> With consistent use, there will be a noticeable change.  </li>
            <li> That said, I decided to experiment and use the 50% on my décolletage area where age shows first.  </li>
            <li> My cheeks, especially look more youthful.</li>
            <li> I am MALE, but very conscious of my skin and finally ordered Perfect Image after using a product with Glycolic Acid (only 8%) and being happy with the results that the small concentration of Glycolic Acid within a lotion gave me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so strong, actually, that I&#x27;m a bit surprised it&#x27;s available here.  </li>
            <li> It really helps all beauty products penetrate deep into the skin and work better.</li>
            <li> The sting was intense at first</li>
            <li> Probably a little bit stronger than I needed, still love it!</li>
            <li> When you start washing it off it becomes a little more burny, but it goes away really quick.</li>
            <li> actual lemon, not the bottle), will work just fine as a alpha hydroxyl astringent.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to everyon!</li>
            <li> the lighter spots are very faded.</li>
            <li> Always monitor the effects and if there&#x27;s too much reddening or burning rinse off immediately.</li>
            <li> If I do then it fades really fast (within 5</li>
            <li> You will be very irritated.</li>
            <li> I have used the 30% peel, and felt I was ready for the 50%.  </li>
            <li> I works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Do purchase a brush tho, it makes it much easier to apply.</li>
            <li> I used this product on myself and really noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> This product really works well.</li>
            <li> It takes up to 3 days to really see the results after you use it, but I&#x27;m really like it.</li>
            <li> Delivery has been fast each time I&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
            <li> Burns so much had to remove immediately.</li>
            <li> I expected more result for a high level peel.</li>
            <li> I am 74 yrs old and have pretty good skin but several freckles in that area due to sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> Initial results (day 1) is very soft and smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Use the full amount the dropper will allow {about a teaspoon} mix with equal parts of bottled water.</li>
            <li> I personally soak a fan brush with water and squeeze out a dropper full of the peel onto the brush then apply it onto my face.</li>
            <li> I use a blow dryer on cool the entire time and witch</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product but very dangerous if you don&#x27;t follow guidelines respectfully.</li>
            <li> my legs are so smooth - dry skin gone.  </li>
            <li> I started with Level 1 and quickly moved up to Level 2 after very carefully following all directions contained with the products.</li>
            <li> 50% is WAY too high of a percentage to start off with on virgin</li>
            <li> I think it is not as strong as I read in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Sure it has a four star rating, but not very many reviews, so I was a bit</li>
            <li> you receive some dermaplaning by a REAL professional.</li>
            <li> I suffer through bouts of cystic acne and this peel is able to penetrate my dermis enough to dry out my pimples.</li>
            <li> And my skin is very sensitive, I recommend it</li>
            <li> AFTER USING INSTANT PEEL FIRST...</li>
            <li> The directions say to only leave it on for 30 seconds the first use.</li>
            <li> Areas of the skin may be red for the first 24-48 hours.</li>
            <li> It cleared up old and new acne.</li>
            <li> Gently pat dry your skin and use a mild, high quality face soap for those first few days after the application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This peel does an outstanding job of brightening my skin and giving it a boost when it is getting dull.</li>
            <li> Does great, follow the instructions or you&#x27;ll be extra sorry.</li>
            <li> It also cures my adult acne.</li>
            <li> However, it is early on, so things could change.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have an olive complexion, and at 63 years, my skin has developed some age spots.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really get all that red after using it.</li>
            <li> Does not even come close to a professional peel.  </li>
            <li> Going to a professional from now on.</li>
            <li> So far when I use the product yes, it does tingle</li>
            <li> I am 64 years old and use it on my lower legs -</li>
            <li> Whenever i use this  it leaves  the  skin soft and the pores shrink.. leaving my  skin with a  glow</li>
            <li> I have been using once a month for three months so far</li>
            <li> Wipe off with soft cotton pads/balls drenched in ice water.</li>
            <li> In most day spas this a glycol peel is at least an $40 add on for the face.</li>
            <li> Professional Skin Peel)1 ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kashish Gupta</li>
            <li> The other differences are definitely worth keeping it up, though.</li>
            <li> I really notice a different in my face texture and my acne scars when I regularly use this once a week.</li>
            <li> and I do not apply it above my upper lip or very close to my eyebrows, as that caused itching as well.  </li>
            <li> It was okay, but a bit weak for me.</li>
            <li> an entire layer of dead skin will peel off leaving fresh new pinkish skin.</li>
            <li> Please follow directions carefully and be certain to do sensitivity test beforehand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only done about 3 peels so far</li>
            <li> Bottom line however, talk to your doctor or dermatologist if you have sensitive skin or issues prior to using this product.</li>
            <li> However, now I can keep it on the complete 2 minutes, with less intense sting.  </li>
            <li> The other option, which I have tried, is to apply the Level 2 product, but only briefly at first, perhaps for one minute.</li>
            <li> The directions are thorough and clearly written;  following these instructions carefully really does produce the same results as a salon peel, minus the salon cost.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to apply from much longer than 8 minutes due to the strength.</li>
            <li> and I could only stand one minute, just barely.  </li>
            <li> I first ordered the 20% glycolic peel a few times before I even considered this one.</li>
            <li> and after I wash it off my face seems to be a little more pinker than usual</li>
            <li> It did tingle a little bit more that what I have used in the past</li>
            <li> It stings, so I was a little nervous the first time and only left it on 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I am a bit clearer right after the peel, but definitely for the next 2-3 days after I am VERY dry to the point where it ages me slightly.  </li>
            <li> For those who know they are sensitive skin users, definitely purchase a lotion with Glycolic acid in it (10% of less).  </li>
            <li> And you can use it far less often.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t peel, but I do feel dry several days after.</li>
            <li> The product is fairly gentle on the skin due to the green tea extract.  </li>
            <li> Word of caution: if you use retinol, you may want to discontinue its use (several days prior) while using this product due to increased skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Yeah it is a little spicy, I would not recommend this if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I did see diminishing in my spots but minor differences.</li>
            <li> After 2 days, there was nothing peeled my face skin and also, I didn&#x27;t feel any dry.</li>
            <li> I am in FL, so I don&#x27;t have the dry feel afterwards</li>
            <li> I have tough skin on my face and can take the higher percentage.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this product to someone who has received professional peels before by a dermatologist or spa in the past.</li>
            <li> For a year of use (once/week), my tummy has gone from lots of extra skin to almost tight.</li>
            <li> As you can see the Melasma is not as bad as the B/W make it seem and most people do not notice, BUT</li>
            <li> use carefully so that it does not burn your skin.</li>
            <li> RESULTS ARE NOT WHAT I EXPECTED...</li>
            <li> You should read directions carefully before using and maybe even research tips online to get safe/best results.</li>
            <li> Dont really know how the product is for it came damaged and broken in an envelope.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not really making a difference on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Black and White photos are taken with the Mono Setting on iPhone 6, I was trying to create contrast so the dark patches would show up.  </li>
            <li> I have used several different types of peels from different places/companies (glycolic, retinol, lactic, tca, other random aha/bha combos, etc).</li>
            <li> It onky takes a small amount at a time so this bottle will last for quite some time.</li>
            <li> and  have lot of  small pores open.</li>
            <li> After working in or around the medical community for the past 20 years, I am usually  reserved in my enthusiasm for a product or procedure until I actually witness or experience them myself.  </li>
            <li> that other reviewers note, but I DO peel slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> After going through 2-3 procedures with the Level 2 product, I&#x27;ve noticed a slight decrease in uneven skin pigment and dark spots/colors on my forehead from sun exposure as a teen ager.  </li>
            <li> and I did burn a small pach on my face the second time I used it, but it does not leave any down time to recover.</li>
            <li> However, after 6 weeks of use I am a little disappointed that it hasn&#x27;t had a greater impact on my melasma, which hasn&#x27;t faded at all.</li>
            <li> The stinging can be a little harsh and uncomfortable but it&#x27;s worth the struggle.</li>
            <li> It is 4-5 times stronger than the average peel.</li>
            <li> Days 2-4 will look a bit rough, as you shed dead layers of skin.</li>
            <li> careful.. it can burn your face !!</li>
            <li> I started by watering down the product with water half and half, then 2/3 peel and 1/3 water then 3/4 peel and 1/4 over the course of two weeks until I began using it</li>
            <li> I skipped step one and was using PTR unwrinkle pads previously which has some acid.</li>
            <li> After one treatment of the dermaroller and 6 peels I am noticing a slight decrease in pitting.</li>
            <li> I previously used the lactic acid and tca from this company, and I wanted to try the glycolic thinking</li>
            <li> The heat from the peel intensifies slightly with each session but is manageable.  </li>
            <li> It is not your typical 15% glycolic pad.</li>
            <li> Holy cow!</li>
            <li> This probably dilutes the gel slightly</li>
            <li> I have graduated to 3 and half minutes with this peel.</li>
            <li> So, just a little background.  </li>
            <li> Rinsing with copious amounts of cold water after the peel is very soothing.</li>
            <li> I was also using Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid everyday.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> just use this peel a few times and your skin will glow.  </li>
            <li> Totally, I wasted my money for that.</li>
            <li> Do not SCRUB, rough-up or use harsh cleansers on your skin.</li>
            <li> Acid 50% Gel Peel - Enhanced with Retinol &amp; Green Tea Extract (</li>
            <li> Remember, no picking at dead skin, stay out of the sun and use a sensitive-skin sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the added ingredients make a difference, but I don&#x27;t think this works as well as other products that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s alright because I&#x27;m quite pale anyway.</li>
            <li> I saw a very slight peeling</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the green tea or what, but this has such a fake, rotten type smell.</li>
            <li> Horrible all it did was burnnnnnnnn my skin and make me break out more</li>
            <li> I have trouble with rosacea and after about a week, alternating with lactic acid my skin has improved by about 90%.&lt;br /&gt;Lifesaver!</li>
            <li> At least wait two days until you use another harsh product.</li>
            <li> Not sure I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> but I am not sure what that&#x27;d about because there are no visible changes.</li>
            <li> but I think it was a little bit weak.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my complexion is dull</li>
            <li> The smell makes it really hard to use.</li>
            <li> As a woman in my late 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Use common sense, should you wish to try it.</li>
            <li> This product has already saved my at least $200.</li>
            <li> Use this peel at least 4 times a month.  </li>
            <li> removed it with several splashes of cold water.  </li>
            <li> The changes are subtle but you&#x27;ll notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed by this product especially because it&#x27;s 50% in strength.</li>
            <li> A Glycolic acid peel is a very common entry-level peel that is tolerable by almost all people.  </li>
            <li> A glycolic acid peel in a salon is an expensive proposition, but the results are a clearer complexion with refined pores, and a smoother and tighter appearance and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had been using the 30%, but unfortunately, dropped the bottle and it shattered.  </li>
            <li> (I like to have a bowl of cold water to slip my face into after I&#x27;ve wiped away the gel.)</li>
            <li> hazel seems to stop the stinging after a cold water rinse.</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This works great.  I leave it on about three minutes.  What a difference!</li>
            <li> Good product!&lt;br /&gt;Must use carefully so that it does not burn your skin.</li>
            <li> Works even better than the lactic acid peel. Love the 50 glycolic. I&#x27;m 31 and I look 24 or 25 mainly because of the perfect image peels. It also cures my adult acne. I guess most people don&#x27;t know about these peels because they don&#x27;t appear on commercials and are mainly done in high end spas. But anyone can do this at home and affordably. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great product. I skipped step one and was using PTR unwrinkle pads previously which has some acid. I started by watering down the product with water half and half, then 2/3 peel and 1/3 water then 3/4 peel and 1/4 over the course of two weeks until I began using it a full strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am darker skin complexion (South East Asian) and have acne scars (ice pick and box car) and there are no good therapies to reduce scarring especially in people with my colour. The latest edition of Fitzpatrick&#x27;s Dermatology outlines promising results by combining skin needling and peels. At the moment I am combing these peels twice weekly and using 1.0 roller every 4 weeks. After one treatment of the dermaroller and 6 peels I am noticing a slight decrease in pitting. Ideal results should be experiences within 4-6 months. Hope that helps others in my position</li>
            <li> It has worked great for me! And my skin is very sensitive, I recommend it</li>
            <li> RESULTS ARE NOT WHAT I EXPECTED...AFTER USING INSTANT PEEL FIRST...</li>
            <li> This product worked great for me, but I would not recommend it to those with sensitive skin. I first ordered the 20% glycolic peel a few times before I even considered this one. I used this peel specifically to help combat hyperpigmentation and scaring left from acne breakouts. It worked really well, but like the 20% peel it stopped working after a few months. I can only assume my skin adapted. This peel is also good at keeping mild acne at bay(not 100% though). I would suggest following the directions...I believe it says use a alpha hydroxyl peel for some time before and then before you use the actual peel, swipe your face clean with alcohol (drug store kind). I don&#x27;t believe it is necessary to buy a alpha hydroxyl lotion/gel/astringent. Diluted lemon juice(from actual lemon, not the bottle), will work just fine as a alpha hydroxyl astringent.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. My skin has never looked healthier and younger. I would highly recommend to everyon!</li>
            <li> I had read that glycolic acid works somewhat for stretch marks. I actually purchased this product to deal with stretch marks and &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; skin left over from pregnancy. It takes some time, but does work. For a year of use (once/week), my tummy has gone from lots of extra skin to almost tight. I started with level 1 and then moved to level 2.</li>
            <li> I use this approx. every 3 weeks on melasma spots. I&#x27;m 37 with combination skin. I&#x27;ve been blessed with good genetics in that I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, but my splotchy skin tone definitely ages my skin. I think I&#x27;ve applied it 5x now and the lighter spots are very faded. I think with continued use, the darkest spot will also fade. I&#x27;m also diligent with sunscreen and use retinoid cream when not using the glycolic acid. You should read directions carefully before using and maybe even research tips online to get safe/best results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good peel. I started off with a lower percentage then leveled up to 50%. I did see diminishing in my spots but minor differences. Overall, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Dont really know how the product is for it came damaged and broken in an envelope.</li>
            <li> Excelente product with excellent results</li>
            <li> So, just a little background.  I have used several different types of peels from different places/companies (glycolic, retinol, lactic, tca, other random aha/bha combos, etc). I previously used the lactic acid and tca from this company, and I wanted to try the glycolic thinking it was a good peel in-between the 2. I&#x27;ve only done about 3 peels so far and it&#x27;s not really making a difference on my skin.  It is also a bit drying for me.  I am a bit clearer right after the peel, but definitely for the next 2-3 days after I am VERY dry to the point where it ages me slightly.  I do love the fact that these are gel peels, but if you want another peel of this strength, I would say go with the lactic acid.  It is much more moisturizing and it seems to be  better at brightening my skin.  It also tightened my skin much much more than the glycolic.  However, it is early on, so things could change.  But I doubt it.  If they do, I will update this review.</li>
            <li> I expected more result for a high level peel.</li>
            <li> I love it , I can feel and see the  the different in my skin texture and have done two treatment.my face is softer .the fine lines have has deceased a lot.  I&#x27;m well please with it</li>
            <li> As a woman in my late 30&#x27;s I&#x27;ve noticed my complexion is dull and I also have sun spots on my face. I&#x27;ve always wanted to try a peel but getting them at the spa is pricey so I was super excited when I saw this product. I knew I had to try it. It came very well packaged and the bottle itself was wrapped in plastic to make sure there was no leakage. The directions say to only leave it on for 30 seconds the first use. I did that but couldn&#x27;t tell it did anything. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so I tried it again two days later and left it on about 6 minutes. The first application I used a cotton pad but I think it just soaked up most of the product. The second time I used my fingers and it worked much better.  After the second application I could definitely tell a difference. My skin was incredibly smooth and soft and noticeably brighter. My make up went on much better as well. I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in the sun spots yet but I&#x27;m confident I will with continued use. It onky takes a small amount at a time so this bottle will last for quite some time. This is a great product and will definitely buy more once it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> careful.. it can burn your face !!</li>
            <li> Horrible all it did was burnnnnnnnn my skin and make me break out more</li>
            <li> Using this gives you the smoothest skin and seems to decrease wrinkles and scars. The smell is pleasant and shipping quick.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with rosacea and after about a week, alternating with lactic acid my skin has improved by about 90%.&lt;br /&gt;Lifesaver!</li>
            <li> Start at level one and work your way up. It&#x27;s a great product but very dangerous if you don&#x27;t follow guidelines respectfully.After your allergy test, here&#x27;s a trick you can try to speed up results. Use the full amount the dropper will allow {about a teaspoon} mix with equal parts of bottled water. apply on your face and leave it on. Add more water if the tingling sensation is too strong.. By the end of a day or two an entire layer of dead skin will peel off leaving fresh new pinkish skin. You&#x27;ll need sunblock after than and any redness clears up in a couple hours. Whilst this is a hack method for the product (and un-endorsed) Use common sense, should you wish to try it. Always monitor the effects and if there&#x27;s too much reddening or burning rinse off immediately.Disclaimer: try this method at your own risk.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, in 2 weeks i can clearly see the diference, my face is more bright and more clean</li>
            <li> I started using this last year after I was paying $100 for peels at a salon.  I began using the 30% and am now using the 50% strength.  It has greatly improved my overall skin texture and the once prominent pores on my nose have now all but disappeared.  I have an olive complexion, and at 63 years, my skin has developed some age spots.  I have noticed that these are fading with use of this product.  I treat my skin twice a week, leaving on for about 5 minutes, then washing off in the shower.  I have recommended this product to my friends!</li>
            <li> Yeah it is a little spicy, I would not recommend this if you have sensitive skin. I have been doing peels my whole life and this stuff is very potent. I can&#x27;t leave it on my face longer than 5 minutes. When you start washing it off it becomes a little more burny, but it goes away really quick. I don&#x27;t really get all that red after using it. If I do then it fades really fast (within 5 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to wear sunscreen after doing these treatments!!! It basically removes the protective layer of your skin and puts you at risk for more harmful UV rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to do these at night, once a week. Never do them on the same day as a scrub or a deep cleansing clay mask. You will be very irritated. At least wait two days until you use another harsh product. Serums are best to use after your treatment as they will absorb better and moisturize your skin, then follow up with a moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using this home peel since July 25th 2015.  Today, August 27 2015, I am posting my results after 4 peels.  Peel 1, 2, &amp; 3 were all done 1 week apart and the 4th peel was two weeks after the 3rd. I was also using Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid everyday.  After the Third Peel I started using skin bleaching from Obagi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concerning the Perfect Image Glycolic Acid-  My skin felt &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34; and I thought the peels made my skin smoother immediately.  I never had any skin peel off and my face was slightly red for 30 minutes after each peel.  The heat from the peel intensifies slightly with each session but is manageable.  I use baking soda to neutralize as I wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first at-home peel.  I do see results that I would attribute to the Chemical Peel such as smoother skin, tighter skin and softer skin.  I do not think the peel is helping me fight Melasma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Black and White photos are taken with the Mono Setting on iPhone 6, I was trying to create contrast so the dark patches would show up.  The color picture was taken 20 minutes after Peel #3 and my skin is irritated. As you can see the Melasma is not as bad as the B/W make it seem and most people do not notice, BUT I DO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I will keep using it until it runs out because I like the way my skin feels but I will look into alternatives for Melasma treatments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and it totally works!!!!!  I recomended to everyone!!!! I am  Very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I bought this about two months ago and have been using consistently. I&#x27;m not sure if the added ingredients make a difference, but I don&#x27;t think this works as well as other products that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I think this is designed for the face, though I bought it for use on my problem upper arms. I think I need a different kind of acid. It smells really good, and works nicely on my face. And I&#x27;m a guy.</li>
            <li> Does not even come close to a professional peel.  Waste of money.  Tried it 3x now. No visual difference.  Going to a professional from now on.</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice and already my age spots are decreasing and my skin feel wonderful. I have recommended this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Save money on serums and lotions-- just use this peel a few times and your skin will glow.  Give yourself a peek once a month and you will get even better results than using a lotion every day.  It is very strong! Start out only leaving it on your face 1-2 minutes until you know how your skin will react.  **read the package directions and follow. If you use retinol on your skin, discontinue for a week before doing any acid peel.  If you overdo it you will burn your skin.  perfect image has a 30% Glycolic Peel formula if you are a novice.</li>
            <li> Powerful stuff.  Since M-D Forte&#x27; decided to abandon loyal customers and cease production of its 30% glycolic acid face cream, this is the logical alternative.  And you can use it far less often.</li>
            <li> So far when I use the product yes, it does tingle and after I wash it off my face seems to be a little more pinker than usual but that&#x27;s alright because I&#x27;m quite pale anyway. It gives me a healthy glow. My pores seem to have gotten smaller or appear to be smaller anyway. So far-so good. I just hope it continues to do me good. It seems my skin gets used to things I use on it and then the item I&#x27;m using doesn&#x27;t work so good after a while. I guess I&#x27;ll see and keep you updated on if it does or not.</li>
            <li> I used to spend over $100 on glycolic peels at a doctor&#x27;s office. I have oily skin with damage (sun, acne scars). The 50% strength is not as strong as a doctor&#x27;s office - but I can use it more often. I have noticed a difference. My skin feels smoother and the oiliness is better controlled. Even others have complimented my skin. That&#x27;s never happened before. I&#x27;m glad I found perfect image!</li>
            <li> A glycolic acid peel in a salon is an expensive proposition, but the results are a clearer complexion with refined pores, and a smoother and tighter appearance and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Glycolic Acid 50% Gel Peel, you can get the same results at home.  The directions are thorough and clearly written;  following these instructions carefully really does produce the same results as a salon peel, minus the salon cost.</li>
            <li> Great peel with clear instructions. Works great, even on my dry skin. Also works well on hands.</li>
            <li> It is very strong.  I like it and this formula I am not allergic to for once!</li>
            <li> I first used level 1 to try this out because I love glycolic acid products.  It stings, so I was a little nervous the first time and only left it on 5 minutes.  The next time I left it on 10 minutes.  You have to put a fan on the area where you apply it, so it doesn&#x27;t sting.  It worked well, so I went to level 2 - I am 64 years old and use it on my lower legs - I use it 2 x in 7 days (one bottle)  &amp; my legs are so smooth - dry skin gone.  I&#x27;m going to level 3 and see how that works.  Haven&#x27;t used it on face yet.  Did apply to arms for about 3 minutes &amp; it did well - plan to use it again.  Its nice because after the couple of treatments, I don&#x27;t have to really do anything but moisturize my legs for the next month.</li>
            <li> I have used the 30% peel, and felt I was ready for the 50%.  The &amp;#34;sting factor&amp;#34; was quite a bit higher with the 50%, but my face feels very smooth afterward.  I don&#x27;t peel, but I do feel dry several days after. I do the peel once a week. I am a strong believer of peels, and I like this one.</li>
            <li> I got this and it was my first time to use chemical peel on my face by myself. It was okay, but a bit weak for me. I used it and layered it twice. Then used another 2 layers the following night. I saw a very slight peeling but I think it was a little bit weak. But I did not get any redness nor allergic reaction whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This stuff works as well as the salon.  Gone are the days of paying $90 for a chem peel.</li>
            <li> Smooth and shiny skin after treatments.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> This  is  the best  glycolic  acid peel  that  i  purchased .. I have acne prone skin  and  have lot of  small pores open. Whenever i use this  it leaves  the  skin soft and the pores shrink.. leaving my  skin with a  glow and  even my friends have noticed it.. I  will be  buying  these  products  again.. They have a superior  quality</li>
            <li> This is such a fantastic product!  It makes my skin glow. I get complimented on my skin whenever I use it. Please follow directions carefully and be certain to do sensitivity test beforehand.  Also, please be vigilant about avoiding sun and using your facial sunscreen. I believe you will love this peel too!</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the green tea or what, but this has such a fake, rotten type smell. The smell makes it really hard to use. Despite the smell, I&#x27;ve used a number of times and have not noticed any changes. I moved up to this from using a 30 percent and I saw more results with the 30 than I&#x27;ve seen with this.</li>
            <li> I never experience peeling, just tightness and feeling clean.  I think it is not as strong as I read in other reviews.  The expiration is good, but you never know what you are getting.</li>
            <li> Im weary of at home skin peels since Ive burned my face off before, no joke. But this works amazing people ask what im using. It cleared up old and new acne. deff buying again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong so use it with care.  I works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions, but no peeling occurred. I didn&#x27;t want to apply from much longer than 8 minutes due to the strength. Not sure I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Simply Amazing!! Saw results after first application!!! Im so happy!! Do purchase a brush tho, it makes it much easier to apply.</li>
            <li> I used all lactic acid 50%, which was pretty worked well for my face, so, at this time, I ordered Glycolic Acid 50% gel, and I have used 3 times every 2 weeks. However, I don&#x27;t see any improvement on my face. When I put it on my face, I felt more sting than Lactic Acid 50%. After 2 days, there was nothing peeled my face skin and also, I didn&#x27;t feel any dry. At attempted second times for 1 min, still there was nothing changed on face skin, At attempted third times for 2 min, of course, there was nothing changed. hummmmm...I expect that this one is not gonna work for me at all. Totally, I wasted my money for that. I probably will go back to Lactic acid 50%. Of course, I will try it from another company&#x27;s product because I like using new stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product junkie and love trying out new skin care and makeup. I had tried several things to diminish sun spots but nothing had worked. After first use I got visible results and over 8 weeks use (using once per week) they are almost gone. All my friends tell me how great my skin looks now. Awesome!!</li>
            <li> I used this product on myself and really noticed a difference.  It did tingle a little bit more that what I have used in the past but I felt that it was safe to use.  The only thing I do like about it is the way it smells.  It is not a bad smell, I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> This product really works well. Within 2-3 days of using the product I got some light flaking and peeling around my nose which cleared away to nicer, more even toned skin. However, after 6 weeks of use I am a little disappointed that it hasn&#x27;t had a greater impact on my melasma, which hasn&#x27;t faded at all. I guess I&#x27;ll just have to see if there&#x27;s any effect after longer use. The other differences are definitely worth keeping it up, though.</li>
            <li> Does great, follow the instructions or you&#x27;ll be extra sorry.</li>
            <li> This peel has really helped to smooth out my face. It stings a bit more then the 30% and I did burn a small pach on my face the second time I used it, but it does not leave any down time to recover. It takes up to 3 days to really see the results after you use it, but I&#x27;m really like it.</li>
            <li> I love these peels!  We started with the level 1, finished that bottle and bumped up to the level 2.  I really notice a different in my face texture and my acne scars when I regularly use this once a week.</li>
            <li> Worked at advertised.  Help improve my skin&#x27;s texture and appearance.  Was not irritating and my skin looks as good as a professional chemical peel.  Delivery has been fast each time I&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
            <li> Probably a little bit stronger than I needed, still love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using once a month for three months so far and it seems to be helping my skin quite a bit. I can handle this peel better than others so  I can keep it on for the full time. I also had a good bit of peeling which made me feel like it was doing its job.</li>
            <li> I am MALE, but very conscious of my skin and finally ordered Perfect Image after using a product with Glycolic Acid (only 8%) and being happy with the results that the small concentration of Glycolic Acid within a lotion gave me.  I started with Level 1 and quickly moved up to Level 2 after very carefully following all directions contained with the products. I&#x27;ve noticed a change with my skin within 2-3 days after first using the Level 1 product.  After going through 2-3 procedures with the Level 2 product, I&#x27;ve noticed a slight decrease in uneven skin pigment and dark spots/colors on my forehead from sun exposure as a teen ager.  Skin moisture and elasticity were also increased.  A Glycolic acid peel is a very common entry-level peel that is tolerable by almost all people.  I plan on moving up to Lactic Acid and/or TCA peels that Perfect image also offers after I&#x27;m finished with the Level 2 bottle.  This should help even more with wrinkle and pigment/discoloration that have been plugging my face for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some important tips when using this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Follow the directions and documentation with the product! It is a wealth of information and Perfect Image makes it clear they want you to succeed when using it as well as making sure your experience is successful.&lt;br /&gt;- Be very gentle with your skin the first 3-5 days after application of this product.  Do not SCRUB, rough-up or use harsh cleansers on your skin. Gently pat dry your skin and use a mild, high quality face soap for those first few days after the application.&lt;br /&gt;- Use a good quality moisturizer on your face for the the first few days as well.  You won&#x27;t &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; in the literal sense but you will notice &amp;#34;flakes&amp;#34; (almost like dandruff) that fall off onto your clothes and may gather up on areas of your face.&lt;br /&gt;- For those who know they are sensitive skin users, definitely purchase a lotion with Glycolic acid in it (10% of less).  This will greatly decrease any possible sensitivity when starting with Level1 on this product since your skin will have a chance to acclimate to it.</li>
            <li> For best results mix with vitamin c cream consider one of the ones featured on amazon)  which helps activate the product quicker and feels smoother...</li>
            <li> After working in or around the medical community for the past 20 years, I am usually  reserved in my enthusiasm for a product or procedure until I actually witness or experience them myself.  This peel is without question the most effective I have ever found without a prescription.  It&#x27;s so strong, actually, that I&#x27;m a bit surprised it&#x27;s available here.  READ UP onHOW to use this product properly. It is 4-5 times stronger than the average peel. I am not a physician, but can share with you the process that works for me as instructed by professionals in the industry.  Cleanse skin prior to use. Use soft cotton pads/balls to apply the gel ( may be used on various areas of the body that need refreshing ie forehead, cheeks, chin, nose, neck, chest, top of hands, elbows and knees etc.) Avoide tender areas of skin such as eyelids and around the eyes as well as genital areas. Leave on for no longer than 5 minutes! Use a cool fan on your face as the &#x27;burning&#x27; intensifies. Wipe off with soft cotton pads/balls drenched in ice water. It will feel heavenly. (I like to have a bowl of cold water to slip my face into after I&#x27;ve wiped away the gel.) Moisturize the skin with a non hypoallergenic moisturizer that is free from perfumes that may irritate the skin. Areas of the skin may be red for the first 24-48 hours. Do not expose your face or treated area to sun for 24-36 hours. Wear sunscreen. Repeat no sooner than every 2-3 weeks. Bottom line however, talk to your doctor or dermatologist if you have sensitive skin or issues prior to using this product. It is not your typical 15% glycolic pad.</li>
            <li> Holy cow! My face has never been better. It&#x27;s softer..glowing and malasma is fading. I recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this product, and have stepped up from the 30%. I am in FL, so I don&#x27;t have the dry feel afterwards that other reviewers note, but I DO peel slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will use this product in the future, will also add in the Lactic Acid peel from their lineup. Very pleased with this purchase and my priors from Perfect Image:product is good, shipping is quick and well packaged.</li>
            <li> This is a great peel!  I absolutely LOVE it.  I had been using the 30%, but unfortunately, dropped the bottle and it shattered.  I decided to try this stronger peel and it&#x27;s awesome!  If you&#x27;ve had peels before and are comfortable with the sting, this is your product.</li>
            <li> Need a more aggressive peel</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t cause any harm, but I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference either.  There was no peeling and no improvement in skin texture or appearance.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. Results were noticeable in 24 hours!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time user and I purchased this product and followed the instructions exactly as written. Luv it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product. I&#x27;ve tried a million different types and this one blows the rest out of the water.</li>
            <li> This product has already saved my at least $200. In most day spas this a glycol peel is at least an $40 add on for the face. I also like to use it on my elbows and knees to maintain an even skin tone on my caramel colored African- American skin.&lt;br /&gt;Some spas will look at you like you have two heads, if you ask for it on your knees and elbows :-D&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to someone who has received professional peels before by a dermatologist or spa in the past. That way you know the professional procedure and actual amount of time to leave the mask on and also the Percentage that works best for you. 50% is WAY too high of a percentage to start off with on virgin skin.&lt;br /&gt;My Skin Tip:&lt;br /&gt;If you go to a nice spa and have this done ask what percentage they are using on you and take a look at the take home products they try to sell you.&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend that 2 times a year you receive some dermaplaning by a REAL professional. It really helps all beauty products penetrate deep into the skin and work better. It also helps make-up application glide smoothly and set SO beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I have tried the 30% peel from Perfect Image and felt I needed a little more (I think my skin got used to it).  This percentage did the trick. Now I can switch off between both, seasonally. Winter in NY requires more exfoliation so moisturizer can be absorbed better. ;-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied this peel on many occasions to treat acne and post-inflammatory hyper pigmentation (PIH).  The glycolic is probably the best out of all of the Perfect Image peels that I&#x27;ve used in the past 2-3 years---and I&#x27;ve used every peel in their skin-care line except the papaya and pineapple. (e.g., TCA, salicylic, glycolic/LEVEL 1 &amp; 2, the lactic acid).  Best thing is there&#x27;s no downtime. The changes are subtle but you&#x27;ll notice a difference.  My hyper pigmentation is slowly but surely fading, faster than it would if I allowed my skin to heal on its own.  Do not expect overnight results.  With consistent use, there will be a noticeable change.  Your skin will definitely glow, you&#x27;ll have softer skin, and if you have acne marks like I did, they will eventually lighten up.</li>
            <li> It truly peals away your hair.</li>
            <li> Product worked well to eliminate some of the redness resulting from roseacea.  The only problem is that the fix is temporary and you need to perform repeated applications.  The product is fairly gentle on the skin due to the green tea extract.  I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Excellent Glycolic Peel, especially for an at home peel.  This peel does an outstanding job of brightening my skin and giving it a boost when it is getting dull.</li>
            <li> I love this product it really does wonders on my acne and as well as on my acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;Glycolic Acid 50% Gel Peel - Enhanced with Retinol &amp; Green Tea Extract (Professional Skin Peel)1 ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kashish Gupta</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel great but it hurts when it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of the Glycolic 50% gel peel not knowing what to expect. Sure it has a four star rating, but not very many reviews, so I was a bit skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise the product is actually really effective! I suffer through bouts of cystic acne and this peel is able to penetrate my dermis enough to dry out my pimples. Those pesky zits end up flattening out within the next 24 hours after using this peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend following the directions enclosed to the tee for the best results. I personally soak a fan brush with water and squeeze out a dropper full of the peel onto the brush then apply it onto my face. This probably dilutes the gel slightly but it makes it easier to apply. First time users, be sure to have a makeshift fan handy, trust me, you&#x27;ll need it. The stinging can be a little harsh and uncomfortable but it&#x27;s worth the struggle. Be sure to rinse your face thoroughly with water or something pH neutralizing after waiting the recommended amount of time. Moisturizing is imperative. I use a hydrating serum immediately after rinsing and drying, followed by a moisture therapy night cream. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to-peel.  Use this peel at least 4 times a month.  Very happy with results and would purchase again. Skin looks glowing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the lower percentage peel and decided to upgrade to the 50%.  Warning!  I have tough skin on my face and can take the higher percentage.  That said, I decided to experiment and use the 50% on my décolletage area where age shows first.  I am 74 yrs old and have pretty good skin but several freckles in that area due to sun exposure.  I applied the 50% Gel Peel on my chest...it stung and itched, unlike on my face.  But I let it sit for 5 minutes, fanning myself, then removed it with several splashes of cold water.  I repeated the process for 3 days and I must say my chest area looks smooth and rejuvenated.  I ordered more product to repeat the process until I am completely satisfied.  But so far, so good.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any results from using this product. I have done more than one applications. I stings or tingle on the skin but I am not sure what that&#x27;d about because there are no visible changes. I was disappointed by this product especially because it&#x27;s 50% in strength.</li>
            <li> I started out using the 30% solution of this product and then upgraded to the 50%, once I finished.  The sting was intense at first and I could only stand one minute, just barely.  However, now I can keep it on the complete 2 minutes, with less intense sting.  Be sure and follow directions and use a good moisturizer and  your sunscreen.  I have used it on my neck, but only once, as it caused a lot of itching for days afterwards (so I no longer use it on my neck)  and I do not apply it above my upper lip or very close to my eyebrows, as that caused itching as well.  I apply it  once a week and my skin is radiant afterwards.  My cheeks, especially look more youthful. I haven&#x27;t seen any real reductions of wrinkles, although, I have seen some reduction in the fine lines around my eyes, so I am giving this product 4 stars, instead of 5!  I think this is a great product and I do recommend it, but please follow the directions closely and use a very good moisturizer and apply it several times the day you use this product.  And, sunscreen is a must.</li>
            <li> Burns so much had to remove immediately.</li>
            <li> I have graduated to 3 and half minutes with this peel. I use a blow dryer on cool the entire time and witch hazel seems to stop the stinging after a cold water rinse. With time, I hope my age spots start to diminish.</li>
            <li> Used it 3 times with no results what so ever save your money I wish I did.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Be sure to start with the Level 1 peel first. The other option, which I have tried, is to apply the Level 2 product, but only briefly at first, perhaps for one minute. Avoid the lips and corners of your nose. Rinsing with copious amounts of cold water after the peel is very soothing. Initial results (day 1) is very soft and smooth skin. Days 2-4 will look a bit rough, as you shed dead layers of skin. Mild lotions will help with your appearance during this phase. Remember, no picking at dead skin, stay out of the sun and use a sensitive-skin sunscreen. By day 5 you&#x27;ll look great! Repeat once every week or two, as the results are cumulative. I am a 50 year-old male who had lots of sun growing up on the beach in SoCal, yet I&#x27;m often mistaken for someone in their mid 30&#x27;s. Word of caution: if you use retinol, you may want to discontinue its use (several days prior) while using this product due to increased skin irritation.</li>
