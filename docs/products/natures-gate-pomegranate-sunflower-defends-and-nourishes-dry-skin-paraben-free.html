            <li>I LOVE how this lotion smells.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love Nature&#x27;s Gate Pomegranate Sunflower hand soap.  </li>
            <li>This lotion smells better than anything else in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a lotion that would actually keep my skin feeling good all day, and I found it!</li>
            <li>The Pomegranate smells nice and the lotion is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Then the Pomegranate Sunflower and its Fabulous also.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t enjoy.</li>
            <li>Took 10 minutes to clean lotion off the pump bottle.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a wonderfully rich lotion that does absorb quickly.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this lotion.  </li>
            <li>they super moisturize without greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I then bought the Acai which smells a little stronger but is great.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>After I showered was the first time I used this lotion.</li>
            <li>First, it arrived in sealed plastic.</li>
            <li>Whole Foods stopped carrying it!</li>
            <li>Love the scent,  reminds me of a ruby red grapefruit!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, leaves no residue on skin, smells heavenly, moisturizes and even though it&#x27;s more expensive than most lotions</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance although I usually prefer no fragrance products, this has a light and non obtrusive one.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>We really like it.  </li>
            <li>Nature&#x27;s Gate lotions all seem to work well, but some &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; tend to have too much fragrance.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not tired of the smell yet.</li>
            <li>I can even apply a small amount to my face at night before bed and it feels great the next morning.</li>
            <li>It absorbs in very quickly, and in my opinion it is not very greasy which is another reason to use this lotion.</li>
            <li>Decent ingriendents compared to a lot of products.</li>
            <li>I live where it is hot and humid most of the time and don&#x27;t want a thick lotion.</li>
            <li>It is not very heavy- just the right thickness to moisturize your skin and be lightweight at the same time.</li>
            <li>I am particularly impressed with how it deeps my feet from drying out and cracking during the cold, dry winter weather.</li>
            <li>It also has natural ingredients and leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fond of Nature&#x27;s Gate products and buy them regularly.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li>The only lotion I&#x27;ve found that really moisturizes.</li>
            <li>The Pomegranate Sunflower blend really does nourish my naturally dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I did notice that when I put it on my legs before bed it felt a little sticky, but that could be more due to the humidity than anything.</li>
            <li>My family has very dry skin and the pomegranate sunflower really defends and nourishes our skin.  </li>
            <li>My first purchase of Nature&#x27;s gate lotion was at my local grocery store, I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a light pleasing scent and is not too thick.</li>
            <li>This one absorbs almost completely in about 10 or so minutes, but I tend to use it only at night because I personally can still feel it on my hands, and that annoys me.  </li>
            <li>No dry feeling at all after applying this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I am not usually a lotion user but have found this very pleasant and helpful for my hands especially in cold weather to relieve dryness.</li>

            <li> The best Lotion I have ever used!  It&#x27;s light, leaves no residue on skin, smells heavenly, moisturizes and even though it&#x27;s more expensive than most lotions it&#x27;s worth every penny. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My first purchase of Nature&#x27;s gate lotion was at my local grocery store, I have very dry skin. I ended up loving Nature&#x27;s gate Oatmeal&lt;br /&gt;formula, so i decided to give this Pomegranate a try. The Pomegranate smells nice and the lotion is very moisturizing. Some days I add a drop of Vitamin e oil to it and it works even better.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with the smell of this lotion. It smells fruity with a hint of flowers! It&#x60;s like a perfume and a lotion all in one! After I showered was the first time I used this lotion. It has a perfect consistency for a lotion. It is not very heavy- just the right thickness to moisturize your skin and be lightweight at the same time. It absorbs in very quickly, and in my opinion it is not very greasy which is another reason to use this lotion. It keeps your hands and skin from drying out, so this is perfect for use in the winter time when your skin starts crackling. Sometimes, I like to apply it to my face after I cleanse to provide moisturization. Ultimately, this lotion is great for keeping your skin moisturized, with a nice scent, and the price is just too great!</li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s gate makes the best scents for their products.  My family has very dry skin and the pomegranate sunflower really defends and nourishes our skin.  Also it last all day.</li>
            <li> Smells great, moisturizes really well without being greasy, and no toxic chemicals. I&#x27;ve been using Nature&#x27;s Gate for several years now and will continue.</li>
            <li> First, it arrived in sealed plastic. Lotion was everywhere in said plastic. Took 10 minutes to clean lotion off the pump bottle.  Every place I put it on looks great! The  pump itself is one you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find. They did not skimp on the length as all other lotion \\&quot;companies\\&quot; do. My conclusion: should be packaged better. But I could not take a star off for that. I am 58 and my skins looks wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Almost 2 months later: it worked well until the weather changed. My hands feel dry all the time. Perhaps \\&quot;we\\&quot; need lotion that actually absorbs into the skin. I think this lotion stays atop the skin which makes it look better. I will have to keep searching for that perfect lotion. How hard can that be for the \\&quot;experts\\&quot;?</li>
            <li> On here it claims this is alcohol-free, and it&#x27;s not! I got this for my brother who cannot have any products containing alcohol in it. Not only does it have alcohol, it has 2 types!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: So looks like they added an alcohol to the ingredients (I looked it over several times before buying just in case) but still claims to be alcohol-free!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer and remains on throughout the day. Not oily..which is a good thing. Hate Whole Foods stopped carrying it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE Nature&#x27;s Gate lotions! they super moisturize without greasy feeling. I bought the tea tree at a grocery a few months back. Loved it. Then bought the glow - LOVE- which is the best self tanner Ive used. Then the Pomegranate Sunflower and its Fabulous also. Great scent. I then bought the Acai which smells a little stronger but is great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE how this lotion smells.  It also has natural ingredients and leaves my skin soft.  I did notice that when I put it on my legs before bed it felt a little sticky, but that could be more due to the humidity than anything.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this lotion.  I was looking for a lotion that would actually keep my skin feeling good all day, and I found it! No dry feeling at all after applying this lotion.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s creamy, goes on a little greasy at first but absorbs quickly,  at least for me. Love the scent,  reminds me of a ruby red grapefruit!  (Yummy) My hands stay nice &amp; hydrated till I wash them again! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> the item is opened during delivering. also the cap is broken and I don&#x27;t know whether the material was changed. when I try it I don&#x27;t feel it is good as the one I used to use(same brand).</li>
            <li> Love that there are no nasty chemicals, smells good and clean, and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fond of Nature&#x27;s Gate products and buy them regularly. This lotion has a light pleasing scent and is not too thick. I live where it is hot and humid most of the time and don&#x27;t want a thick lotion. I use it daily. Leaves my skin soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Hydrating and the smell is good. Decent ingriendents compared to a lot of products.</li>
            <li> The lotion smells nice and feels nice on my skin. However, when it arrived it was sealed in a plastic bag and the dispenser pump was broken. I had to dig around inside the bottle to retrieve the tube. I can still use it, I will just have to pour it into my hand. I just have no way to keep it sealed now. I will have to figure something out. A little irritating, but tolerable. &#x3D;-/</li>
            <li> Good hand lotion.  Isn&#x27;t oily and soaks into skin.  I keep it next to the kitchen sink and use after all handwashings.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and all natural.  Good moisturizing lotion, not greasy.  We really like it.  Good price too</li>
            <li> It stays on your skin and works so well.  The only lotion I&#x27;ve found that really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> The Pomegranate Sunflower blend really does nourish my naturally dry skin.  I am particularly impressed with how it deeps my feet from drying out and cracking during the cold, dry winter weather.</li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate lotions all seem to work well, but some &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; tend to have too much fragrance.  This one is a pleasing scent compared to their others.</li>
            <li> One star off for the smell.  Four stars for the lotion itself.</li>
            <li> I am not usually a lotion user but have found this very pleasant and helpful for my hands especially in cold weather to relieve dryness. Love the fragrance although I usually prefer no fragrance products, this has a light and non obtrusive one.</li>
            <li> I love Nature&#x27;s Gate Pomegranate Sunflower hand soap.  The smell is intoxicating.  So when I saw the same scent in a hand lotion, I knew I had to have it, and I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a wonderfully rich lotion that does absorb quickly.  Since I&#x27;m one of those people who hates the feeling of lotion on my hands, I&#x27;m extremely fussy about the hand lotions I use.  This one absorbs almost completely in about 10 or so minutes, but I tend to use it only at night because I personally can still feel it on my hands, and that annoys me.  However, I would definitely recommend this lotion and I do use it regularly and will be buying it again.  It&#x27;s a great lotion and most people who are fond of lotions will definitely enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate products usually score five stars with me. I haven&#x27;t tried one product of theirs I didn&#x27;t enjoy. This lotion smells wonderful to me and is very rich and moisturizing. I can even apply a small amount to my face at night before bed and it feels great the next morning. One bottle lasts a few months in my house with daily use.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells better than anything else in my opinion. I&#x27;ve used it for a year and I&#x27;m not tired of the smell yet. I buy these in bulk.</li>
