            <li>SO CUTE!  </li>

            <li>Original Sprout has a customer for life now here, I&#x27;m so happy to recommend this to friends and family.</li>
            <li>It would have been better for it to be odorless.</li>
            <li>His hair spikes and isn&#x27;t crunchy :)  </li>
            <li>Love this line...</li>
            <li>I now have to unscrew the top every time I use it</li>
            <li>It is best described as a smell of wet or mildewed cardboard.  </li>
            <li>We love the balm because it works and is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Since I loved it so much, I decided to give this balm a try.</li>
            <li>Pros: great, light scent; made my daughter&#x27;s naturally frizzy hair sleek.&lt;br</li>
            <li>rinses easily.</li>
            <li>The other (OLT) products have a wonderful light smell or no fragrance at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This is supposed to be phytoestrogen free...</li>
            <li>the last kind of gel we used- think it was watermelon or some kind of   soda smell.</li>
            <li>Let me just say that I LOVE LOVE this company&#x27;s clean and clear hair gel.  </li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t use   sweet smelling stuff anymore because my son got stung in the face with   </li>
            <li>This product is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I splurge on this because it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Love using natural products on him &amp; the whole fam.</li>
            <li>The packaging and name are cute, and it arrived as promised very shortly after I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s hair finally looks cute, now that the stubborn waves are under control, he had the Einstein thing going on before.  </li>
            <li>thanks to Jenny (my friend) for recommending kids products that work wonders.</li>
            <li>But beware if you add too much you will have to start the process over.</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft now - and its highly bleached.</li>
            <li>It might be ok for an adult, but no one wants to smell this on a little sweet baby.  </li>
            <li>Been using it on my boy since he was a new born.</li>
            <li>but my body is super sensitive to those and within 4 days of use, I experienced bad breast swelling and tenderness.</li>
            <li>I have not tried the other scented one yet (tahitian whatnot?), because I like the clean and soothing scent this one has.</li>
            <li>Bought it to use on my 9 month old grandson.</li>
            <li>He also has sensitive skin and he has never had a problem using this gel.</li>
            <li>As far as working, I suppose it keeps the hair in place, but it gives the look of ummm lard or something like it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this stuff since my son was 12 months old, he&#x27;s now 2.</li>
            <li>I absolutely hate overbearing fragrances for infants, so Original Little Sprouts products seemed perfect b/c</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find this product, as you can&#x27;t find baby hair balm in any of the big (or small) stores.  </li>

            <li> I was very excited to find this product, as you can&#x27;t find baby hair balm in any of the big (or small) stores.  </li>
            <li> So naturally it will mess up his hair, but all I need to do is style it back up with only my fingers and it will still hold.</li>
            <li> It does the work: the style stays all day long.  </li>
            <li> My son has a ton of cow licks in his hair, this is the only product I have found that can manage them.</li>
            <li> You only need to apply a little and can blow on the hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and continue to return to this one.</li>
            <li> When I turned the cap (the part you push down so the shampoo comes out into your hand), it didn&#x27;t release and ended up breaking off.</li>
            <li> Would not finish using much less buy again</li>
            <li> To address some other reviews, the consistency is somewhat greasy but add a little water and it thins it out a little.</li>
            <li> This product worked well on my infant son&#x27;s hair, but the smell is quite distinct and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty inconvenient.</li>
            <li> The jar usually lasts me 6 months and that&#x27;s with styling his hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I hate writing a bad review, but after the fantastic experience with the hair gel, I&#x27;m just hoping the company will read this and do something to bring this product up to the level of their gel.</li>
            <li> Your hands are sticky and it was worse on his hair.</li>
            <li> With normal shampoos and conditioners, bleached hair looks and feels awful.</li>
            <li> : have to use a ton; expensive</li>
            <li> No matter how little I use, her hair gets greasy and looks awful.  </li>
            <li> However, it stinks so bad.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t decide whether I like or hate the smell</li>
            <li> This balm may work well, but the smell is very unpleasant, sort of like Bag Balm.   </li>
            <li> Oh my god, it smells so horrible.  </li>

            <li> great shampoo. rinses easily.</li>
            <li> This was sticky gooey. Bought it to use on my 9 month old grandson. Your hands are sticky and it was worse on his hair. Would not finish using much less buy again</li>
            <li> This balm may work well, but the smell is very unpleasant, sort of like Bag Balm.   &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I was very excited to find this product, as you can&#x27;t find baby hair balm in any of the big (or small) stores.  The packaging and name are cute, and it arrived as promised very shortly after I ordered it.  However, it turned my baby&#x27;s hair into a grease-fest.  No matter how little I use, her hair gets greasy and looks awful.  I don&#x27;t use it at all.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> My son has always had spiked hair.  This stuff will even hold through his nap. He also has sensitive skin and he has never had a problem using this gel. Love It!!</li>
            <li> It does the work: the style stays all day long.  However, it stinks so bad.  It doesn&#x27;t have the pleasant smell that you would expect from a baby product.  It would have been better for it to be odorless.</li>
            <li> My son is 10 months and I love this stuff!  His hair spikes and isn&#x27;t crunchy :)  SO CUTE!  I can&#x27;t decide whether I like or hate the smell... works great though!</li>
            <li> Great suff!  We are using the shampoo (must have) too, and the cream is totally amazing.  The balm is perfect for keeping hair in place all day.  Love using natural products on him &amp; the whole fam. My son&#x27;s hair finally looks cute, now that the stubborn waves are under control, he had the Einstein thing going on before.  Love this line... thanks to Jenny (my friend) for recommending kids products that work wonders. Jill</li>
            <li> My Granddaughter loves this shampoo. It smells delicious!</li>
            <li> Let me just say that I LOVE LOVE this company&#x27;s clean and clear hair gel.  It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.  Since I loved it so much, I decided to give this balm a try. Oh my god, it smells so horrible.  It might be ok for an adult, but no one wants to smell this on a little sweet baby.  I was so disappointed.

I hate writing a bad review, but after the fantastic experience with the hair gel, I&#x27;m just hoping the company will read this and do something to bring this product up to the level of their gel.</li>
            <li> This is a great priduct!!! Love it!</li>
            <li> i would like to sell it in my salon.</li>
            <li> This company says that its products are 100% vegetarian, but this balm contains lanolin.  Lanolin comes from sheep&#x27;s wool, and is NOT a vegetarian ingredient.</li>
            <li> Best kids shampoo smells great and no chemicals. Been using it on my boy since he was a new born.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate overbearing fragrances for infants, so Original Little Sprouts products seemed perfect b/c they were not over-bearing.  The other (OLT) products have a wonderful light smell or no fragrance at all.  This product worked well on my infant son&#x27;s hair, but the smell is quite distinct and unpleasant. I hope that the marketing division of the company is suggesting a change in this case.  It is best described as a smell of wet or mildewed cardboard.  It is totally un-baby-like.  What were they thinking?</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be phytoestrogen free...but my body is super sensitive to those and within 4 days of use, I experienced bad breast swelling and tenderness. It&#x27;s a shame because this product made my hair feel real nice</li>
            <li> The shampoo worked well for my bi-racial children&#x27;s hair, however, I had an issue with the bottle. When I turned the cap (the part you push down so the shampoo comes out into your hand), it didn&#x27;t release and ended up breaking off. I now have to unscrew the top every time I use it and it&#x27;s pretty inconvenient.</li>
            <li> We love the balm because it works and is fragrance free. We don&#x27;t use   sweet smelling stuff anymore because my son got stung in the face with   the last kind of gel we used- think it was watermelon or some kind of   soda smell. This works the best and doesn&#x27;t attract bugs.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff since my son was 12 months old, he&#x27;s now 2. To address some other reviews, the consistency is somewhat greasy but add a little water and it thins it out a little. But beware if you add too much you will have to start the process over. My son has a ton of cow licks in his hair, this is the only product I have found that can manage them. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and continue to return to this one. The jar usually lasts me 6 months and that&#x27;s with styling his hair everyday. You only need to apply a little and can blow on the hair and it holds the style, no blow drying necessary. My son likes to rub his blanket on his head.. So naturally it will mess up his hair, but all I need to do is style it back up with only my fingers and it will still hold. This product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Pros: great, light scent; made my daughter&#x27;s naturally frizzy hair sleek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: have to use a ton; expensive</li>
            <li> I am a university student. I splurge on this because it is worth it. My hair is super soft now - and its highly bleached. With normal shampoos and conditioners, bleached hair looks and feels awful. I have been on a perfect hair brand hunt since I started dying my hair and this is it, the holy grail, mecca, atlantis, I&#x27;ve found it! I feel great using it because there is nothing damaging or unnatural in it. Original Sprout has a customer for life now here, I&#x27;m so happy to recommend this to friends and family. I have not tried the other scented one yet (tahitian whatnot?), because I like the clean and soothing scent this one has. You wont regret this purchase at all!!</li>
