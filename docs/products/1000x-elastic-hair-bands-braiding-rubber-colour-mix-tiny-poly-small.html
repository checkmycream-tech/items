            <li>Perfect for my use.</li>
            <li>They work great!  </li>
            <li>These hair bands are great!</li>
            <li>I am very happy.</li>
            <li>Work great.  </li>
            <li>I love them for girls ponytails and braids!</li>
            <li>Glad that I found them here!</li>
            <li>They probably cost more to ship than make!</li>
            <li>and i really liked this hair elastics because they are durable and strong</li>
            <li>Not snag free at all</li>
            <li>But they work great and don&#x27;t pull my toddlers&#x27; hair as much as a standard rubber band.</li>
            <li>It is great if you need tiny rubber bands.  </li>
            <li>super stretchy and do not break easily.</li>
            <li>These were perfect for the job, plenty cheap and arrived much sooner that expected (though note; it is coming from China and that takes a while.)</li>
            <li>Overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li>and when i do hair twists in my hair they DO NOT break for days at a time....very good for full head corn rolls and even front to middle corn rolls..</li>
            <li>Very hard to break and stay in my daughters hair perfectly for over a week!</li>
            <li>I appreciated the quick delivery so that I didn&#x27;t have to wait to get started with my idea.</li>
            <li>These &amp;#34;hairbands&amp;#34; came very fast in the mail.  </li>
            <li>was hard to find these colors, so I am happy with them.</li>
            <li>I use them on my dog and they hold on pretty good, don&#x27;t break easily and the colors are pretty, yellow, red and blue.</li>
            <li>Received quickly.. seems to have more yellow than other colors..</li>
            <li>I lost half the bag by the time I was able to form a knot.  </li>
            <li>No negative surprises.  </li>
            <li>They are very stretchy and don&#x27;t break easily - I would guess they will stretch about as wide as a tennis ball, although they are smaller than the circumference of my finger generally.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my 1 year old daughter&#x27;s pigtails.</li>
            <li>These came shipped directly from China.</li>
            <li>They do tend to snag frequently in my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>They work but are much too large for my little dog&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>But they hold very well and did not snap as much as others that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>Good for what you pay but be aware some elastics are very thin and others thick and not on purpose , its just an inconsistency.</li>
            <li>I thought, and I was right, that if I had a small rubber band it would be easier.  </li>

            <li> Not great when used as hair elastics for little girls.  </li>

Other than that my two year old has elastics to last years !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit to add&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are rubber, so in other words tears from your toddler when you remove them. Not snag free at all but we still use them.</li>
            <li> Ive baught these before and when i do hair twists in my hair they DO NOT break for days at a time....very good for full head corn rolls and even front to middle corn rolls..</li>
            <li> Part of an art project. I appreciated the quick delivery so that I didn&#x27;t have to wait to get started with my idea.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 1 year old daughter&#x27;s pigtails. If I wrap them several times, they hold her hair even through naps and usually come out without pulling her hair. They stretch out after a couple uses, but of course that&#x27;s why I bought 1000. They are very stretchy and don&#x27;t break easily - I would guess they will stretch about as wide as a tennis ball, although they are smaller than the circumference of my finger generally. Perfect for my use.</li>
            <li> They work but are much too large for my little dog&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> was hard to find these colors, so I am happy with them.</li>
            <li> I am using them to band together copper wire lengths for making jewelry. Works well.</li>
            <li> I recently discovered &amp;#34;ice candy&amp;#34; and I have a heck of a time tying off those little plastic bags.  Between my arthritis and neurapathy I lost half the bag by the time I was able to form a knot.  I thought, and I was right, that if I had a small rubber band it would be easier.  These were perfect for the job, plenty cheap and arrived much sooner that expected (though note; it is coming from China and that takes a while.)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find these in the store anymore. I love them for girls ponytails and braids! They work great!  Glad that I found them here!</li>
            <li> Received quickly.. seems to have more yellow than other colors.. super stretchy and do not break easily. I wish there were more/different colors. I use them in my 3 daughter&#x27;s hair and would like a variety. Overall a good purchase.</li>
            <li> These came shipped directly from China. They probably cost more to ship than make! But they work great and don&#x27;t pull my toddlers&#x27; hair as much as a standard rubber band.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself because i braid my hair often and i really liked this hair elastics because they are durable and strong</li>
            <li> These hair bands are great! I use them on my dog and they hold on pretty good, don&#x27;t break easily and the colors are pretty, yellow, red and blue.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed! Very hard to break and stay in my daughters hair perfectly for over a week!</li>
            <li> Not great when used as hair elastics for little girls.  It is great if you need tiny rubber bands.  Took a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;hairbands&amp;#34; came very fast in the mail.  They do tend to snag frequently in my daughters hair. But they hold very well and did not snap as much as others that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> What a deal!!  No negative surprises.  Work great.  I am very happy.</li>
