            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any bristle fallout, which is something I wanted in a brush, but didn&#x27;t expect to get as every brush I&#x27;ve ever owned had some degree of fallout.</li>
            <li>The company reached out thereafter I received my brush to see if everything was resolved and if I was happy with my order.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cake on the powder, which is great.  </li>
            <li>and it didnt work as great.  </li>
            <li>It is a great addition to your makeup  applicators.</li>
            <li>Works great for applying liquid foundation.</li>

            <li>Just as good as the sigma F80.  </li>
            <li>The perfect tool for someone who likes a smooth blended-no-makeup look.  </li>
            <li>Good brush.</li>
            <li>Good price .</li>
            <li>A good brush,  but needs to be replaced somewhat frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Daughter loved this brush...great quality</li>
            <li>It feels so smooth, and blends perfectly.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>But I bought this one instead as the reviews were equally as good</li>
            <li>Just as good as the name brands.  </li>
            <li>This is the best my foundation has looked in years, so even and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I used the brush for the first time today, I was very happy with the result, it gives great coverage and should be a good addition to my collection.</li>

            <li>/&gt; All in all I am very pleased that I ended up with this brush and brand</li>
            <li>But, its also great for blush, or powder ( this is why I need a couple more)  </li>
            <li>I like that the brush allowed me to easily apply my foundation without any streaking giving me a more polished and flawless look.</li>
            <li>When I do my makeup I want to achieve a flawless finish (who doesn&#x27;t, right?)</li>
            <li>Very handy and very soft on my face, it blended my foundation beautifully!</li>
            <li>It works a million times better damp!</li>
            <li>I have to say that of all the brushes I have this is my favorite foundation brush!</li>

            <li>Nice quality brush, LOVE it!</li>
            <li>This brush is absolutely amazing for applying foundation.</li>
            <li>Great brush, this applied my foundation smooth and to an airbrush finish.</li>

            <li>The brush is amazing.</li>
            <li>This brush is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I liked that just like that brushes from the set, it comes packaged in a plastic sleeve inside a box.</li>
            <li>I loved that the foundation sat onto the top of the bristles and didn’t absorb into the bristles.</li>
            <li>and it was nice and dense.</li>
            <li>It really gives me an airbrush and flawless look.</li>
            <li>This brush is great and makes foundation application nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I found that it works best if i push the product (my foundation) into my skin rather than stipple it around as it was moving my product around too much when I was stippling it out.  </li>
            <li>The brush handle is a nice size and fits nicely in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nice brush for nice price, I like the fact that the handle is fat.  </li>
            <li>This one is a nicely textured, in-between brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is actually really good and the customer service is even better.</li>
            <li>I let them know that I really liked the brush for powder</li>
            <li>I honestly could not be happier</li>
            <li>It picks up both liquid and cream products nicely.</li>
            <li>Best one I&#x27;ve had by far!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen it in many youtube makeup tutorials and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>

            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I also gave the brush a thorough washing to make sure it would not fall a part after washing.  </li>
            <li>They advised me to dampen the brush, and that it should work better that way.  </li>
            <li>but I love the texture and the softness of</li>
            <li>I ended up ordering more for my daughters, since they were trying to immediately steal it from me.  </li>

            <li>I am so glad I made this purchase</li>
            <li>and I just purchased a couple more for my friends since it is such a great deal!</li>
            <li>The Flat Top Kabuki is a great brush!</li>
            <li>I was amazed as to how fast I received it!!!!</li>
            <li>It is just as good ( maybe better) than my sigma that costs twice as much!  </li>
            <li>Nice easy to grip handle that is comfortable too.  </li>
            <li>Nice medium to full coverage</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve taken pretty good care of it</li>
            <li>Thank you for creating a superior product at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Loved it at first</li>
            <li>This brush so far hasn&#x27;t shed any bristles and spreads foundation beautifully.</li>
            <li>Soft, and beautiful airbrush coverage with just a stroke.  </li>
            <li>,  I love that the way it handles and makes applying make up easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and works great.</li>
            <li>I particularly liked that it was so quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very soft , Very Amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes boxed in cute packaging, this brush is high quality and a great addition to your makeup brush collection or great for people just starting out.</li>
            <li>It’s definitely the perfect brush to use with medium to full coverage foundations.</li>
            <li>I do own many different foundation brushes, Chanel, Bobbi Brown, Make up Forever, Hourglass and even my beloved</li>
            <li>soft yet resilient amd seems to be a great travel brush.  </li>
            <li>After looking at the page I decided to go ahead and purchase because it was a good deal, not expecting much.</li>
            <li>Good quality dense bristles so blends makeup very well</li>
            <li>blends out my foundation or bb cream really good without sucking up too much of my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>I am able to use LESS of my foundation and it still covers perfectly.</li>
            <li>Best foundation brush I&#x27;ve had in a long time!!!!</li>
            <li>I have two of them, and own a large amount of makeup brushes from many brands.</li>
            <li>The brush length is perfect for applying foundation and the synthetic fibers are soft but not so much that they flatten out.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to blend the make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice quality.</li>
            <li>Super soft and the application of my powder foundation went on beautifully.</li>
            <li>The hairs of my Marc Jacob&#x27;s are softer and denser but overall this Keshima brush deposits the foundation just as beautifully</li>
            <li>The flat top kabuki brush by Keshima is a great brush.</li>
            <li>The flat top is a must for applying compressed powder foundation as it makes great contact with the foundation then blends out so well on the skin.</li>
            <li>Hands down one of the best brushes I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Love love love my new Keshima brush!</li>
            <li>Just as good as mac and better than my bare mineral brushes.</li>
            <li>Edit: Very happy until it broke in half.</li>
            <li>but if it does fall apart its a quick fix!</li>
            <li>This brush is so soft and has made me very happy so far!</li>
            <li>Lovely soft brush, good price too and quick delivery</li>
            <li>but I found that your guy&#x27;s brush is 10x better than the sigma brush, do you guys have more styles of the kabuki brushes because I will definitely buy more and review them!</li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely buy more :) Thank you!</li>
            <li>I am really impressed with this little brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This little foundation brush is truly the best.  </li>
            <li>Best little brush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Its a nice brush, could be a little denser but for the price it works great.</li>
            <li>I am a huge makeup fan, and brushes are a necessity.</li>
            <li>and although I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks now, I haven&#x27;t experienced any &amp;#34;escapee&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Great brush, I have a larger kabuki brush for my foundation but wanting one like this for my blush.</li>
            <li>Fabulous customer service.  </li>
            <li>A fabulous foundation brush.  </li>
            <li>The  foundation goes on smoothly unlike any brushes I had before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for stippling and it&#x27;s universal!</li>
            <li>great product especially for the price!!!</li>
            <li>I must join the rest of the reviewers and admit that this brush if fantastic.  </li>
            <li>and it performed fabulously on both.  </li>
            <li>if fantastic but</li>
            <li>Smooth even Coverage.</li>
            <li>When I showed it to my daughter she liked it so much I ordered one for her too.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great brush without having to spend a lot of money, then this one is a definite must to add to your collection.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great brush for applying foundation.</li>
            <li>Smooth application and coverage area.</li>
            <li>The size of the bristles give you precise control.</li>
            <li>I use it to apply bronzer and it looks so smooth, never streaky.</li>
            <li>I noticed immediately that my foundation was going on evenly and smooth.</li>
            <li>No shedding and leaves my makeup in a smooth finish on my skin.</li>
            <li>yet firm allowing me to get that perfect matte finish.</li>
            <li>It applies the foundation so smooth and even</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft bristles are amazing!</li>
            <li>I have used the coastal scents flat top buffer and loved it, but I think maybe this one is taking over.</li>
            <li>Thank you Keshima you have totally shown me the light!!!</li>
            <li>I will  Definitely consider buying more brushes from Keshima!!</li>
            <li>so I was excited to review</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth picking up!</li>
            <li>if keshima comes out with eye brushes i will be the first to purchase them. :)</li>
            <li>I ordered this brush because it went on sale significantly.</li>
            <li>I am in no shape or form familiar with cosmetics/tools.</li>
            <li>I love my flat top brush!</li>
            <li>It washes nicely and had very soft, densely packed bristles.</li>
            <li>I didn’t own any Flat Top Kabuki brushes</li>
            <li>Keshima brush, I liked the brow brush alot and got a 20% off which I used to get the flat top kabuki.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, when I searched for a flat top kabuki brush, I was looking for the Sigma (after all I&#x27;d heard about it).</li>
            <li>I help out with special occasions.</li>
            <li>It is a very soft brush and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Great item, works as expected.</li>
            <li>I got to say this brush is very dense which I love.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better than high end sigma foundation brush!</li>
            <li>Full disclosure:  </li>
            <li>This flat top kabuki brush is super soft and it feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>When I opened the box my first impression was it is a decent size, nice handle and</li>
            <li>Love my new Kabuki brush!</li>
            <li>Seller quickly sent another one.</li>
            <li>For quick cleaning, I rub the brush on a bar of Dove soap and rinse.</li>
            <li>This brush is so soft and it delivers perfect coverage with minimal foundation.</li>
            <li>The more expensive brushes are not always the best brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased a wide assortment of brushes over the years and this brush is the best so far.</li>
            <li>Arrived quick.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be looking for more brushes from Keshima in the future, since I&#x27;m having a thought of changing most of my brushes.</li>
            <li>Another important detail is that the product arrived exactly on time.</li>
            <li>However, even if it had been full price, this brush would be worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It washed and dried beautifully.  </li>
            <li>SUPER high quality feel!!!  </li>
            <li>And the shipping was super fast!!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite makeup brush.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s half the price and works great.  </li>
            <li>You bristles are very soft and allow for a smooth application!</li>
            <li>Very soft top.</li>
            <li>I love how soft the bristles are!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>I have bought this item twice now, absolutely love it, gives even coverage and the bristles are extremely soft!</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be back to buy more products from&lt;br /&gt;Keshima!</li>
            <li>I definitely want to try more Keshima brushes!</li>
            <li>I love that this brush is make of super soft synthetic fibers.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and very soft.</li>
            <li>Though I have all types of high end makeup brushes from department stores and major makeup lines, this brush is the most loved so far.</li>
            <li>Makes application even, smooth and fast.</li>
            <li>I use the firmness of the brush to apply foundation to my face, and it applies very evenly and lightly.</li>
            <li>Never used a kabuki for liquid foundation/cc cream - got to say it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Completely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This has been by far my FAVORITE foundation brush.</li>
            <li>Its worth buying.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t worth it to me at any price.</li>
            <li>I use it to apply my mineral powder foundation, and the coverage is so much better than my old brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very dense and a shorter synthetic top which makes application much easier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s firm, but soft.. perfect for blending.</li>
            <li>So far I love this brush...</li>
            <li>worth it), and it makes my foundation routine faster.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li>I did not know this brand, but after this experience I will gladly test the other products and l will for sure recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but the rounds you buy at Target -- I&#x27;d cut them in half and toss them after a bit) and wanted to get a nice brush but was balking at the prices of the &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; brushes ($50 range!).  </li>
            <li>I have used one other flat top brush, but this one is denser and more effective.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping with amazon prime and love the soft quality bristles of my flat top kabuki brush!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase and will definitely be buying more brushes in the future.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very sturdy in design so the top isn&#x27;t just going to fall off (which has happened to me way more than I would like), the brush head is super soft, and I love the long handle design since most brushes of this type are short and stubby.</li>
            <li>I normally use sigma but noticed the good reviews and saw that it looked similar.  </li>
            <li>Easy to blend, soft, and doesn&#x27;t shed!</li>
            <li>I love my new Keshima Flat Top</li>
            <li>The brush is super soft and the application of my&lt;br /&gt;foundation was smooth and even.</li>
            <li>I like it better than my bare minerals kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>The makeup went on flawlessly and the bristles aren&#x27;t to hard or to soft.</li>
            <li>and with a flat top brush is so much easier to blend and smooth out the foundation on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is wonderfully soft and thick, an excellent product.</li>
            <li>The soft bristles feel like silk against my skin and make for easy application.  </li>
            <li>So soft, very dense and most of all..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft yet dense that it makes applying liquid foundation easy.</li>
            <li>Very soft bristles and a comfortable handle.</li>
            <li>really love how the bristles on this brush are short, making the brush fairly dense but really soft at the same time.</li>
            <li>I still was not obsessed with it.</li>
            <li>Larger size in diameter, allows for more area of coverage.</li>
            <li>I have finally had a chance to use this brush and it is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever used one to apply foundation</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and applies my make up evenly and smooth.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>So this was a first for me.  </li>
            <li>This is the first brush I&#x27;ve owned that I didn&#x27;t have to toss out for one reason or another.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more of these.</li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>Thanks for the opportunity!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and applies makeup smoothly.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this brush was to apply my liquid foundation</li>
            <li>This is my first experience using a brush to apply foundation</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>and I hope you will create more eye brushes with the same quality and affordable price as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>will definitely be purchasing more for my brush collection.</li>
            <li>Very well made brush!  </li>
            <li>I really like this brush!</li>
            <li>The first brush I replaced because the bristles started pushing in, so the brush had a concave shape.</li>
            <li>Firstly I must admit I am not a makeup artist.</li>
            <li>first stipple my make up on</li>
            <li>If my husband allows me ;) ...</li>
            <li>Based on the other reviews, I gave this brush a try, and I love it!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>I have very dry and flaky skin, using this brush does not peel away any dry skin and applies liquid foundation brilliantly.</li>
            <li>It allows my (liquid) foundation to very evenly be blended, and leaves no little brush hairs on your face like I&#x27;ve experienced with other brushes.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the sigma flat top brush</li>
            <li>For better cleaning, I soak the brush in water and olive oil and after about ten minutes, rinse really well with hot water.</li>
            <li>I love how flat and sturdy it is.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Keshima flat top kabuki, it looked closest to the sigma F80 kabuki I&#x27;ve been dying for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this flat top Kabuki brush for two weeks now, it&#x27;s wonderful!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they said to use a flat top brush.</li>
            <li>I was contacted via email by one of the co-founders of KESHIMA to share my thoughts on the flat top Kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>After trying sponges and &#x27;paint-like&#x27; foundation brushes I decided to move on to a flat top synthetic foundation brush.</li>
            <li>When I purchased the&lt;br /&gt;Keshima Flat Top Kabuki brush...</li>
            <li>Flat Top Kabuki Brush By Keshima &amp;#x2605; Premium Foundation Brush, Buffing Brush, Blending Brush, Face Brush]]</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Super soft bristles!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SUPER soft and very sturdy!</li>
            <li>But not buying it until I&#x27;ve tried others first and absolutely have to.</li>
            <li>I finally have a great foundation brush since my other brush became discontinued.</li>
            <li>I have personally enjoyed using my new Keshima Flat top brush on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>Very, very happy I decided to buy this brush over the more expensive ones by other brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a brush that would apply my makeup as best as possible because I have deep acne scars on my cheeks and this brush helps me apply makeup onto my face while not getting caked around my scars like other brushes have done.</li>
            <li>This brush is super soft and it just feels like silk on my face.</li>
            <li>It is super soft and my mineral powder goes on evenly.</li>
            <li>just super soft to my face</li>
            <li>Super soft</li>
            <li>its super soft and works well for my blush..</li>
            <li>super soft and bristles dont fall out.</li>
            <li>I previously was using sponges (not the fancy kind</li>
            <li>After having a slight issue with my original brush, they very quickly sent a replacement.</li>
            <li>This is a great small but very dense and soft kabuki brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used one, but she apparently has and was BEYOND excited to add it to her brush collection for her clients.</li>
            <li>I used it to apply my Bare Minerals original foundation.</li>
            <li>more smooth, however don t know how long it will last</li>
            <li>brush handle came loose, I contacted this seller (Better Living Solutions) and they immediately send me a replacement.  </li>
            <li>It feels very much like a high end brush to me.  </li>
            <li>Feel very high quality and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like when flat top kabuki brushes have long bristles and are too wide because it&#x27;s harder to blend under the eyes, around the nose and mouth, but this brush is perfect!</li>
            <li>I will certainly be ordering more in the near future..</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very well made</li>
            <li>Very dense for number of fibers, which keeps the bristles from bending.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really dislike the brush.</li>
            <li>but the make up doesn&#x27;t spread very evenly, the hairs on the brush are all over the place, it sheds...</li>
            <li>Started to seem very warn out after maybe a month.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to any one looking for a kabuki brush!</li>
            <li>I never realized how much foundation I was using applying it with my fingers.  </li>
            <li>and the handle is soo much shorter  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>so I bought it because I didn&#x27;t have much to lose.</li>
            <li>You must try this brush to really appreciate it.  </li>
            <li>She said she probably uses it too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it for bronzer, and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I use it with liquid foundation and it Blends and applies makeup very well and gives an airbrush look.</li>
            <li>and my skin looked so smooth and airbrushed that I did not have to go back and touch up any areas with concealer.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t really make reviews but this one, I must say deserves to have one..</li>
            <li>ordered my first flat top kabuki brush on a whim (just to get a free shipping with my other order)..</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>thanks  </li>
            <li>It is dense and applies my liquid foundation really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>Made foundation application much easier..</li>
            <li>I love it so far, and would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>My knowledge on makeup brushes and makeup products is a result of trial and error when I do my own everyday makeup.</li>
            <li>I look  forward to purchasing other Keshima brushes in the near future; did I mention shipping was fast, I&#x27;m definitely a happy customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not tough on them by ANY means.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a few different flat topped brushes and have to say this is the best i&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>The flat top is very dense and soft.</li>
            <li>Defiantly worth the buy and will continue to be the only Flat Top Kabuki Brush</li>
            <li>The main reason why I bought this one was due to so many positive comments.</li>
            <li>Better than any other brand..</li>
            <li>but it soaks up a lot more makeup than my other brushes.</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing every other Keshima brush available!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited about my next purchase with your company!</li>
            <li>This is a really great brush- firm enough to fill in all the fine lines, but soft enough not to irritate your face.</li>
            <li>and i cant wait to try my new high quality kabuki brush for the first time.</li>
            <li>liked the size for my t zone application, but I have pigmentation issues on my cheeks and found that this brush was a bit small</li>
            <li>Live this brush!  </li>
            <li>Thanks again, will purchase again when I need a new one.</li>
            <li>I can only hope that more people come back and edit their reviews.</li>
            <li>this one!&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is very soft and very densely packed.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and makes applying my powder mineral foundation a lot easier!</li>
            <li>Very soft and did not leave any brush hairs on my face!</li>
            <li>I think the trick is to just put a little light amount on the brush at a time, a little goes a long way and looks nice and smooth, not cakey.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I find this brush highly comparable to each of those brands.</li>
            <li>After looking in High St, stores for what I wanted I choose to look online as I was not prepared to pay what they were asking.</li>
            <li>the kabuki brush is not hard but steady enoght that doesnt scratch you</li>
            <li>I like using a fresh, clean brush everyday, washing all once a week....</li>
            <li>This kabuki brush is so soft and gentle</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter as a beginner piece to her brush collection, she wants to become a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and blends makeup very well!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is soft and the foundation blends very well.</li>
            <li>Pretty much exactly the same as my sigma f80, will never waste money on that one again</li>
            <li>Easily worth double the price.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft, yet just dense enough to give the right amount of coverage.</li>
            <li>Since I received the brush, it became my new go to foundation brush.</li>
            <li>and I can say it looks and feels as brand new</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft brush</li>
            <li>the fibers are very soft.</li>
            <li>The brush is high quality, and extremely soft.</li>
            <li>Very surprised by the quality of the brush for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it with Bare Minerals ready foundation which is compressed powder (I think) in compact form.  </li>
            <li>This brush is so soft!</li>
            <li>Sooo soft!</li>
            <li>My first product from this brand and it wont be my last.</li>
            <li>so soft!</li>
            <li>so I usually do not use it.</li>
            <li>I simple stipple some more on then buff VERY  lightly so as not to remove the first layer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Short enough to directly blend the makeup and have more control over there smaller areas of your face.</li>
            <li>Once dried, applying my liquid foundation was easy.</li>
            <li>My kids didn&#x27;t want to give it back to me because it was so soft ;-)  </li>
            <li>I clean it daily with a daily brush cleaning spray and it&#x27;s ready for the next use and does not shed.</li>
            <li>After a few uses I can now say it is extremely easy to get a natural look, no hairs have come off the brush and because of the completely flat top only 1 or 2 pumps of my liquid foundation go a long way.</li>
            <li>was a little worried that a couple reviews said it absorbed too much product</li>
            <li>I love this brush, I was a little apprehensive about buying this brush because of the price I thought maybe it wouldn&#x27;t do the job properly</li>
            <li>I have never owned a flat-top kabuki brush before, but this one has set a very high standard for me.</li>
            <li>The bristles are really soft but dense so it evenly distributes the foundation.</li>
            <li>I purchased it for my 13 year old daughter and as she puts it &amp;#34;It&#x27;s 5-stars cool&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The brush is soft, sturdy and applies her liquid foundation evenly.</li>
            <li>The brush is so soft and dense, which made it so easier to put on my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>The touch of the brush is soo soft yet durable.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to everyone looking for a professional finish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and blends my foundation&lt;</li>
            <li>The bristles are dense but still silky soft.</li>
            <li>which really surprised me.</li>
            <li>However I was highly surprised when this item arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised how soft the brush is</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to use twice as much foundation to achieve the same look.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s alright, but I probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li>Soft as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>Soft natural fibers.  </li>
            <li>make my foundation looks natural 👏</li>
            <li>Soft bristles didn&#x27;t irritate my face or shed like some cheaper ones do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly soft</li>
            <li>soft..</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference in the results with the application using the brush over applying with my fingers.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and mixes well with foundation and bb cream.</li>
            <li>It is extremely soft and distributes the product all over my face in a uniform manner.</li>
            <li>I use it at lease a couple times a week and wash it after every use and  so far it has not shed.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s been great.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised at the coverage it provided without shedding.</li>
            <li>Soft but dense bristles.</li>
            <li>So soft and blends makeup like a dream.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and dense, and I like the size of the width and height of the bristles.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and dense.  </li>
            <li>The Brussels are soft, but don&#x27;t fold when buffing your foundation on.</li>
            <li>It is so soft.  </li>
            <li>the bristles are soft and seem to be of quality</li>
            <li>Brush is soft and the bristles stay put</li>
            <li>I will absolutely purchase any and all of Keshima brushes in the future.</li>
            <li>So soft and dense..</li>
            <li>I hope it last, we&#x27;ll have to wait after a few more uses.(fingers crossed)..</li>
            <li>I was sorta skeptical about how good this brush would be when I was ordering it but as soon as I opened the box I could tell it was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gave me a really full coverage, and I had to use far less product than I do with the brushes I was using.</li>
            <li>I had been gently washing them approximately once per week (using them at most, twice per week) with mild soap and water, laying flat to air dry.</li>
            <li>I was able to get full coverage in the difficult areas such as around my nose and under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The liquid sits right on the top, due to the amount of bristles there are, and even a little product now goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This brush uses just a little foundation and applies full coverage without any streaks and it applies it evenly.  </li>
            <li>Washed once and seems to be high quality that will last.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush instead of the one bare minerals offered to go with their new bare skin liquid makeup</li>
            <li>Especially for people with a less than smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to use (spend a few minutes on YouTube looking up how to use it properly --</li>
            <li>and it actually worked a bit better than my other more expensive kabukis.  </li>
            <li>I had been using the Real Techniques stippling brush for years but felt that my liquid foundation was travelling through the brush, down to the second layer of bristles, therefore wasting product and not getting as much on my face.</li>
            <li>My main thing is that it never applied my Bare Minerals powder make up that well, and it hasn&#x27;t lasted very long.</li>
            <li>I use it with my bare minerals foundation.</li>
            <li>I use it to apply my bare minerals bareskin foundation, and it works perfectly&lt;</li>
            <li>(I use with Bare Minerals) or for blending bronzer / blush.</li>
            <li>It spreads foundation on evenly and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks or bare patches.</li>
            <li>I have had this for several months and have had no issues with this brush so far.</li>
            <li>purchased Bare Essentials makeup and their brush was just too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and definitely dense with bristles.</li>
            <li>I have Bare Mineral brush</li>
            <li>Feels so soft, like a feather being brushed across your face.</li>
            <li>This brush barely used any of my product, so that in itself is a win/win situation for my wallet.</li>
            <li>My first impression is the brush is a bit small but very soft, I bough it to use with mac studio fix powder.</li>
            <li>and I will absolutely consider buying other brushes from here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought cheap make-up brushes before and wasted the little money I&#x27;d spent so was determined to &#x27;up my game&#x27; and am delighted with the Keshima brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is so soft to the touch and it feels like the much more expensive ones you find at Sephora.</li>
            <li>Pretty close to impossible to find a better product for those price.</li>
            <li>I generally spend big money on cosmetic brushes.  </li>
            <li>Had a few issues with the first brush that was sent.</li>
            <li>but I checked my brush this morning and there was no product at all past a few millimeters of the top of the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be afraid to try, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>

            <li> It’s great to apply liquid and cream products.</li>
            <li> I also liked that it gave my foundation a flawless and almost invisible look on my skin.</li>
            <li> Great</li>
            <li> Great for burnishing in foundation or blush.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s honestly the best my foundation has ever applied.</li>
            <li> Great quality.  </li>
            <li> so happy</li>
            <li> It works great with mineral foundation as well as liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> and it does a great job of applying foundation evenly.</li>
            <li> Unless you are a diva and need makeup applied hourly, this brush is a great one.  </li>
            <li> This is a great quality brush.</li>
            <li> Great Kabuki brush</li>
            <li> great price - great brush.</li>

            <li> I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This brush is great.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any bristle fallout, which is something I wanted in a brush, but didn&#x27;t expect to get as every brush I&#x27;ve ever owned had some degree of fallout.</li>
            <li> The company reached out thereafter I received my brush to see if everything was resolved and if I was happy with my order.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cake on the powder, which is great.  </li>
            <li> and it didnt work as great.  </li>
            <li> It is a great addition to your makeup  applicators.</li>
            <li> Works great for applying liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> you get a great quality foundation brush.</li>

            <li> It fit perfectly in my compact and it distributed the foundation evenly.</li>
            <li> Good brush all around.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the sigma F80.  </li>
            <li> The perfect tool for someone who likes a smooth blended-no-makeup look.  </li>
            <li> Good brush.</li>
            <li> Good price .</li>
            <li> A good brush,  but needs to be replaced somewhat frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Daughter loved this brush...great quality</li>
            <li> It feels so smooth, and blends perfectly.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> But I bought this one instead as the reviews were equally as good</li>
            <li> Just as good as the name brands.  </li>
            <li> This is the best my foundation has looked in years, so even and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I used the brush for the first time today, I was very happy with the result, it gives great coverage and should be a good addition to my collection.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more brushes from this company and would recommend this brush to anyone who needs a good stripling foundation brush!</li>
            <li> Perfect stiple brush to use with mousse foundation &amp; get the job done quickly.</li>

            <li> Very pleased with my Keshima Kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt; All in all I am very pleased that I ended up with this brush and brand</li>
            <li> But, its also great for blush, or powder ( this is why I need a couple more)  </li>
            <li> I like that the brush allowed me to easily apply my foundation without any streaking giving me a more polished and flawless look.</li>
            <li> When I do my makeup I want to achieve a flawless finish (who doesn&#x27;t, right?)</li>
            <li> Very handy and very soft on my face, it blended my foundation beautifully!</li>
            <li> It works a million times better damp!</li>

            <li> This brush is absolutely amazing for applying foundation.</li>
            <li> Great brush, this applied my foundation smooth and to an airbrush finish.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>

            <li> The brush is amazing.</li>
            <li> This brush is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I liked that just like that brushes from the set, it comes packaged in a plastic sleeve inside a box.</li>
            <li> I loved that the foundation sat onto the top of the bristles and didn’t absorb into the bristles.</li>
            <li> and it was nice and dense.</li>
            <li> It really gives me an airbrush and flawless look.</li>
            <li> This brush is great and makes foundation application nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I found that it works best if i push the product (my foundation) into my skin rather than stipple it around as it was moving my product around too much when I was stippling it out.  </li>
            <li> The brush handle is a nice size and fits nicely in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nice brush for nice price, I like the fact that the handle is fat.  </li>
            <li> This one is a nicely textured, in-between brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is actually really good and the customer service is even better.</li>
            <li> I let them know that I really liked the brush for powder</li>
            <li> I honestly could not be happier</li>
            <li> It picks up both liquid and cream products nicely.</li>
            <li> Best one I&#x27;ve had by far!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen it in many youtube makeup tutorials and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>

            <li> Beautiful high quality brush.</li>

            <li> I also gave the brush a thorough washing to make sure it would not fall a part after washing.  </li>
            <li> They advised me to dampen the brush, and that it should work better that way.  </li>
            <li> but I love the texture and the softness of</li>

            <li> I am so glad I made this purchase</li>
            <li> and I just purchased a couple more for my friends since it is such a great deal!</li>
            <li> The Flat Top Kabuki is a great brush!</li>
            <li> I was amazed as to how fast I received it!!!!</li>
            <li> It is just as good ( maybe better) than my sigma that costs twice as much!  </li>
            <li> Nice easy to grip handle that is comfortable too.  </li>
            <li> Nice medium to full coverage</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve taken pretty good care of it</li>
            <li> Thank you for creating a superior product at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Loved it at first</li>
            <li> This brush so far hasn&#x27;t shed any bristles and spreads foundation beautifully.</li>
            <li> Soft, and beautiful airbrush coverage with just a stroke.  </li>
            <li> ,  I love that the way it handles and makes applying make up easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and works great.</li>
            <li> I particularly liked that it was so quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very soft , Very Amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes boxed in cute packaging, this brush is high quality and a great addition to your makeup brush collection or great for people just starting out.</li>
            <li> It’s definitely the perfect brush to use with medium to full coverage foundations.</li>
            <li> I do own many different foundation brushes, Chanel, Bobbi Brown, Make up Forever, Hourglass and even my beloved</li>
            <li> soft yet resilient amd seems to be a great travel brush.  </li>
            <li> After looking at the page I decided to go ahead and purchase because it was a good deal, not expecting much.</li>
            <li> Good quality dense bristles so blends makeup very well</li>
            <li> blends out my foundation or bb cream really good without sucking up too much of my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I am able to use LESS of my foundation and it still covers perfectly.</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush I&#x27;ve had in a long time!!!!</li>
            <li> I have two of them, and own a large amount of makeup brushes from many brands.</li>
            <li> The brush length is perfect for applying foundation and the synthetic fibers are soft but not so much that they flatten out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to blend the make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice quality.</li>
            <li> Super soft and the application of my powder foundation went on beautifully.</li>
            <li> The hairs of my Marc Jacob&#x27;s are softer and denser but overall this Keshima brush deposits the foundation just as beautifully</li>
            <li> The flat top kabuki brush by Keshima is a great brush.</li>
            <li> The flat top is a must for applying compressed powder foundation as it makes great contact with the foundation then blends out so well on the skin.</li>
            <li> Hands down one of the best brushes I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Love love love my new Keshima brush!</li>
            <li> Just as good as mac and better than my bare mineral brushes.</li>
            <li> Edit: Very happy until it broke in half.</li>
            <li> but if it does fall apart its a quick fix!</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and has made me very happy so far!</li>
            <li> Lovely soft brush, good price too and quick delivery</li>
            <li> but I found that your guy&#x27;s brush is 10x better than the sigma brush, do you guys have more styles of the kabuki brushes because I will definitely buy more and review them!</li>
            <li> I love it and will definitely buy more :) Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with this little brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This little foundation brush is truly the best.  </li>
            <li> Best little brush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Its a nice brush, could be a little denser but for the price it works great.</li>
            <li> I am a huge makeup fan, and brushes are a necessity.</li>
            <li> and although I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks now, I haven&#x27;t experienced any &amp;#34;escapee&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great brush, I have a larger kabuki brush for my foundation but wanting one like this for my blush.</li>
            <li> Fabulous customer service.  </li>
            <li> A fabulous foundation brush.  </li>
            <li> The  foundation goes on smoothly unlike any brushes I had before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for stippling and it&#x27;s universal!</li>

            <li> so I was excited to review</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth picking up!</li>
            <li> if keshima comes out with eye brushes i will be the first to purchase them. :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush because it went on sale significantly.</li>
            <li> I am in no shape or form familiar with cosmetics/tools.</li>
            <li> I love my flat top brush!</li>
            <li> It washes nicely and had very soft, densely packed bristles.</li>
            <li> I didn’t own any Flat Top Kabuki brushes</li>
            <li> Keshima brush, I liked the brow brush alot and got a 20% off which I used to get the flat top kabuki.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, when I searched for a flat top kabuki brush, I was looking for the Sigma (after all I&#x27;d heard about it).</li>
            <li> I help out with special occasions.</li>
            <li> It is a very soft brush and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great item, works as expected.</li>
            <li> I got to say this brush is very dense which I love.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even better than high end sigma foundation brush!</li>
            <li> Full disclosure:  </li>
            <li> This flat top kabuki brush is super soft and it feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box my first impression was it is a decent size, nice handle and</li>
            <li> Love my new Kabuki brush!</li>
            <li> Seller quickly sent another one.</li>
            <li> For quick cleaning, I rub the brush on a bar of Dove soap and rinse.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and it delivers perfect coverage with minimal foundation.</li>
            <li> The more expensive brushes are not always the best brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a wide assortment of brushes over the years and this brush is the best so far.</li>
            <li> Arrived quick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be looking for more brushes from Keshima in the future, since I&#x27;m having a thought of changing most of my brushes.</li>
            <li> Another important detail is that the product arrived exactly on time.</li>
            <li> However, even if it had been full price, this brush would be worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It washed and dried beautifully.  </li>
            <li> SUPER high quality feel!!!  </li>
            <li> And the shipping was super fast!!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite makeup brush.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s half the price and works great.  </li>
            <li> You bristles are very soft and allow for a smooth application!</li>
            <li> Very soft top.</li>
            <li> I love how soft the bristles are!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I have bought this item twice now, absolutely love it, gives even coverage and the bristles are extremely soft!</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be back to buy more products from&lt;br /&gt;Keshima!</li>
            <li> I definitely want to try more Keshima brushes!</li>
            <li> I love that this brush is make of super soft synthetic fibers.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and very soft.</li>
            <li> Though I have all types of high end makeup brushes from department stores and major makeup lines, this brush is the most loved so far.</li>
            <li> Makes application even, smooth and fast.</li>
            <li> I use the firmness of the brush to apply foundation to my face, and it applies very evenly and lightly.</li>
            <li> Never used a kabuki for liquid foundation/cc cream - got to say it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Completely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This has been by far my FAVORITE foundation brush.</li>
            <li> Its worth buying.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t worth it to me at any price.</li>
            <li> I use it to apply my mineral powder foundation, and the coverage is so much better than my old brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dense and a shorter synthetic top which makes application much easier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s firm, but soft.. perfect for blending.</li>
            <li> So far I love this brush...</li>
            <li> worth it), and it makes my foundation routine faster.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> I did not know this brand, but after this experience I will gladly test the other products and l will for sure recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but the rounds you buy at Target -- I&#x27;d cut them in half and toss them after a bit) and wanted to get a nice brush but was balking at the prices of the &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; brushes ($50 range!).  </li>
            <li> I have used one other flat top brush, but this one is denser and more effective.  </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping with amazon prime and love the soft quality bristles of my flat top kabuki brush!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase and will definitely be buying more brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very sturdy in design so the top isn&#x27;t just going to fall off (which has happened to me way more than I would like), the brush head is super soft, and I love the long handle design since most brushes of this type are short and stubby.</li>
            <li> I normally use sigma but noticed the good reviews and saw that it looked similar.  </li>
            <li> Easy to blend, soft, and doesn&#x27;t shed!</li>
            <li> I love my new Keshima Flat Top</li>
            <li> The brush is super soft and the application of my&lt;br /&gt;foundation was smooth and even.</li>
            <li> I like it better than my bare minerals kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> The makeup went on flawlessly and the bristles aren&#x27;t to hard or to soft.</li>
            <li> and with a flat top brush is so much easier to blend and smooth out the foundation on my skin.</li>
            <li> It is wonderfully soft and thick, an excellent product.</li>
            <li> The soft bristles feel like silk against my skin and make for easy application.  </li>
            <li> So soft, very dense and most of all..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft yet dense that it makes applying liquid foundation easy.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles and a comfortable handle.</li>
            <li> really love how the bristles on this brush are short, making the brush fairly dense but really soft at the same time.</li>
            <li> I still was not obsessed with it.</li>
            <li> Larger size in diameter, allows for more area of coverage.</li>
            <li> I have finally had a chance to use this brush and it is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever used one to apply foundation</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and applies my make up evenly and smooth.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> So this was a first for me.  </li>
            <li> This is the first brush I&#x27;ve owned that I didn&#x27;t have to toss out for one reason or another.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more of these.</li>
            <li> Haha!</li>
            <li> Thanks for the opportunity!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and applies makeup smoothly.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this brush was to apply my liquid foundation</li>
            <li> This is my first experience using a brush to apply foundation</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> and I hope you will create more eye brushes with the same quality and affordable price as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> will definitely be purchasing more for my brush collection.</li>
            <li> Very well made brush!  </li>
            <li> I really like this brush!</li>
            <li> The first brush I replaced because the bristles started pushing in, so the brush had a concave shape.</li>
            <li> Firstly I must admit I am not a makeup artist.</li>
            <li> first stipple my make up on</li>
            <li> If my husband allows me ;) ...</li>
            <li> Based on the other reviews, I gave this brush a try, and I love it!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I have very dry and flaky skin, using this brush does not peel away any dry skin and applies liquid foundation brilliantly.</li>
            <li> It allows my (liquid) foundation to very evenly be blended, and leaves no little brush hairs on your face like I&#x27;ve experienced with other brushes.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the sigma flat top brush</li>
            <li> For better cleaning, I soak the brush in water and olive oil and after about ten minutes, rinse really well with hot water.</li>
            <li> I love how flat and sturdy it is.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Keshima flat top kabuki, it looked closest to the sigma F80 kabuki I&#x27;ve been dying for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this flat top Kabuki brush for two weeks now, it&#x27;s wonderful!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they said to use a flat top brush.</li>
            <li> I was contacted via email by one of the co-founders of KESHIMA to share my thoughts on the flat top Kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> After trying sponges and &#x27;paint-like&#x27; foundation brushes I decided to move on to a flat top synthetic foundation brush.</li>
            <li> When I purchased the&lt;br /&gt;Keshima Flat Top Kabuki brush...</li>
            <li> Flat Top Kabuki Brush By Keshima &amp;#x2605; Premium Foundation Brush, Buffing Brush, Blending Brush, Face Brush]]</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Super soft bristles!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SUPER soft and very sturdy!</li>
            <li> But not buying it until I&#x27;ve tried others first and absolutely have to.</li>
            <li> I finally have a great foundation brush since my other brush became discontinued.</li>
            <li> I have personally enjoyed using my new Keshima Flat top brush on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> Very, very happy I decided to buy this brush over the more expensive ones by other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a brush that would apply my makeup as best as possible because I have deep acne scars on my cheeks and this brush helps me apply makeup onto my face while not getting caked around my scars like other brushes have done.</li>
            <li> This brush is super soft and it just feels like silk on my face.</li>
            <li> It is super soft and my mineral powder goes on evenly.</li>
            <li> just super soft to my face</li>
            <li> Super soft</li>
            <li> its super soft and works well for my blush..</li>
            <li> super soft and bristles dont fall out.</li>
            <li> I previously was using sponges (not the fancy kind</li>
            <li> After having a slight issue with my original brush, they very quickly sent a replacement.</li>
            <li> This is a great small but very dense and soft kabuki brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used one, but she apparently has and was BEYOND excited to add it to her brush collection for her clients.</li>
            <li> I used it to apply my Bare Minerals original foundation.</li>
            <li> more smooth, however don t know how long it will last</li>
            <li> brush handle came loose, I contacted this seller (Better Living Solutions) and they immediately send me a replacement.  </li>
            <li> It feels very much like a high end brush to me.  </li>
            <li> Feel very high quality and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like when flat top kabuki brushes have long bristles and are too wide because it&#x27;s harder to blend under the eyes, around the nose and mouth, but this brush is perfect!</li>
            <li> I will certainly be ordering more in the near future..</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very well made</li>
            <li> Very dense for number of fibers, which keeps the bristles from bending.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really dislike the brush.</li>
            <li> but the make up doesn&#x27;t spread very evenly, the hairs on the brush are all over the place, it sheds...</li>
            <li> Started to seem very warn out after maybe a month.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to any one looking for a kabuki brush!</li>
            <li> I never realized how much foundation I was using applying it with my fingers.  </li>
            <li> and the handle is soo much shorter  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> so I bought it because I didn&#x27;t have much to lose.</li>
            <li> You must try this brush to really appreciate it.  </li>
            <li> She said she probably uses it too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it for bronzer, and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> I use it with liquid foundation and it Blends and applies makeup very well and gives an airbrush look.</li>
            <li> and my skin looked so smooth and airbrushed that I did not have to go back and touch up any areas with concealer.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t really make reviews but this one, I must say deserves to have one..</li>
            <li> ordered my first flat top kabuki brush on a whim (just to get a free shipping with my other order)..</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> thanks  </li>
            <li> It is dense and applies my liquid foundation really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> Made foundation application much easier..</li>
            <li> I love it so far, and would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> My knowledge on makeup brushes and makeup products is a result of trial and error when I do my own everyday makeup.</li>
            <li> I look  forward to purchasing other Keshima brushes in the near future; did I mention shipping was fast, I&#x27;m definitely a happy customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not tough on them by ANY means.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few different flat topped brushes and have to say this is the best i&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The flat top is very dense and soft.</li>
            <li> Defiantly worth the buy and will continue to be the only Flat Top Kabuki Brush</li>
            <li> The main reason why I bought this one was due to so many positive comments.</li>
            <li> Better than any other brand..</li>
            <li> but it soaks up a lot more makeup than my other brushes.</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing every other Keshima brush available!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited about my next purchase with your company!</li>
            <li> This is a really great brush- firm enough to fill in all the fine lines, but soft enough not to irritate your face.</li>
            <li> and i cant wait to try my new high quality kabuki brush for the first time.</li>
            <li> liked the size for my t zone application, but I have pigmentation issues on my cheeks and found that this brush was a bit small</li>
            <li> Live this brush!  </li>
            <li> Thanks again, will purchase again when I need a new one.</li>
            <li> I can only hope that more people come back and edit their reviews.</li>
            <li> this one!&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is very soft and very densely packed.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and makes applying my powder mineral foundation a lot easier!</li>
            <li> Very soft and did not leave any brush hairs on my face!</li>
            <li> I think the trick is to just put a little light amount on the brush at a time, a little goes a long way and looks nice and smooth, not cakey.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I find this brush highly comparable to each of those brands.</li>
            <li> After looking in High St, stores for what I wanted I choose to look online as I was not prepared to pay what they were asking.</li>
            <li> the kabuki brush is not hard but steady enoght that doesnt scratch you</li>
            <li> I like using a fresh, clean brush everyday, washing all once a week....</li>
            <li> This kabuki brush is so soft and gentle</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter as a beginner piece to her brush collection, she wants to become a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and blends makeup very well!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is soft and the foundation blends very well.</li>
            <li> Pretty much exactly the same as my sigma f80, will never waste money on that one again</li>
            <li> Easily worth double the price.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft, yet just dense enough to give the right amount of coverage.</li>
            <li> Since I received the brush, it became my new go to foundation brush.</li>
            <li> and I can say it looks and feels as brand new</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft brush</li>
            <li> the fibers are very soft.</li>
            <li> The brush is high quality, and extremely soft.</li>
            <li> Very surprised by the quality of the brush for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it with Bare Minerals ready foundation which is compressed powder (I think) in compact form.  </li>
            <li> This brush is so soft!</li>
            <li> Sooo soft!</li>
            <li> My first product from this brand and it wont be my last.</li>
            <li> so soft!</li>
            <li> so I usually do not use it.</li>
            <li> I simple stipple some more on then buff VERY  lightly so as not to remove the first layer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Short enough to directly blend the makeup and have more control over there smaller areas of your face.</li>
            <li> Once dried, applying my liquid foundation was easy.</li>
            <li> My kids didn&#x27;t want to give it back to me because it was so soft ;-)  </li>
            <li> I clean it daily with a daily brush cleaning spray and it&#x27;s ready for the next use and does not shed.</li>
            <li> After a few uses I can now say it is extremely easy to get a natural look, no hairs have come off the brush and because of the completely flat top only 1 or 2 pumps of my liquid foundation go a long way.</li>
            <li> was a little worried that a couple reviews said it absorbed too much product</li>
            <li> I love this brush, I was a little apprehensive about buying this brush because of the price I thought maybe it wouldn&#x27;t do the job properly</li>
            <li> I have never owned a flat-top kabuki brush before, but this one has set a very high standard for me.</li>
            <li> The bristles are really soft but dense so it evenly distributes the foundation.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my 13 year old daughter and as she puts it &amp;#34;It&#x27;s 5-stars cool&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The brush is soft, sturdy and applies her liquid foundation evenly.</li>
            <li> The brush is so soft and dense, which made it so easier to put on my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> The touch of the brush is soo soft yet durable.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to everyone looking for a professional finish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and blends my foundation&lt;</li>
            <li> The bristles are dense but still silky soft.</li>
            <li> which really surprised me.</li>
            <li> However I was highly surprised when this item arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised how soft the brush is</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to use twice as much foundation to achieve the same look.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s alright, but I probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Soft as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> Soft natural fibers.  </li>
            <li> make my foundation looks natural 👏</li>
            <li> Soft bristles didn&#x27;t irritate my face or shed like some cheaper ones do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly soft</li>
            <li> soft..</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference in the results with the application using the brush over applying with my fingers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and mixes well with foundation and bb cream.</li>
            <li> It is extremely soft and distributes the product all over my face in a uniform manner.</li>
            <li> I use it at lease a couple times a week and wash it after every use and  so far it has not shed.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s been great.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised at the coverage it provided without shedding.</li>
            <li> Soft but dense bristles.</li>
            <li> So soft and blends makeup like a dream.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and dense, and I like the size of the width and height of the bristles.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and dense.  </li>
            <li> The Brussels are soft, but don&#x27;t fold when buffing your foundation on.</li>
            <li> It is so soft.  </li>
            <li> the bristles are soft and seem to be of quality</li>
            <li> Brush is soft and the bristles stay put</li>
            <li> I will absolutely purchase any and all of Keshima brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> So soft and dense..</li>
            <li> I hope it last, we&#x27;ll have to wait after a few more uses.(fingers crossed)..</li>
            <li> I was sorta skeptical about how good this brush would be when I was ordering it but as soon as I opened the box I could tell it was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gave me a really full coverage, and I had to use far less product than I do with the brushes I was using.</li>
            <li> I had been gently washing them approximately once per week (using them at most, twice per week) with mild soap and water, laying flat to air dry.</li>
            <li> I was able to get full coverage in the difficult areas such as around my nose and under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The liquid sits right on the top, due to the amount of bristles there are, and even a little product now goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This brush uses just a little foundation and applies full coverage without any streaks and it applies it evenly.  </li>
            <li> Washed once and seems to be high quality that will last.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush instead of the one bare minerals offered to go with their new bare skin liquid makeup</li>
            <li> Especially for people with a less than smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to use (spend a few minutes on YouTube looking up how to use it properly --</li>
            <li> and it actually worked a bit better than my other more expensive kabukis.  </li>
            <li> I had been using the Real Techniques stippling brush for years but felt that my liquid foundation was travelling through the brush, down to the second layer of bristles, therefore wasting product and not getting as much on my face.</li>
            <li> My main thing is that it never applied my Bare Minerals powder make up that well, and it hasn&#x27;t lasted very long.</li>
            <li> I use it with my bare minerals foundation.</li>
            <li> I use it to apply my bare minerals bareskin foundation, and it works perfectly&lt;</li>
            <li> (I use with Bare Minerals) or for blending bronzer / blush.</li>
            <li> It spreads foundation on evenly and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks or bare patches.</li>
            <li> I have had this for several months and have had no issues with this brush so far.</li>
            <li> purchased Bare Essentials makeup and their brush was just too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and definitely dense with bristles.</li>
            <li> I have Bare Mineral brush</li>
            <li> Feels so soft, like a feather being brushed across your face.</li>
            <li> This brush barely used any of my product, so that in itself is a win/win situation for my wallet.</li>
            <li> My first impression is the brush is a bit small but very soft, I bough it to use with mac studio fix powder.</li>
            <li> and I will absolutely consider buying other brushes from here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought cheap make-up brushes before and wasted the little money I&#x27;d spent so was determined to &#x27;up my game&#x27; and am delighted with the Keshima brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft to the touch and it feels like the much more expensive ones you find at Sephora.</li>
            <li> Pretty close to impossible to find a better product for those price.</li>
            <li> I generally spend big money on cosmetic brushes.  </li>
            <li> Had a few issues with the first brush that was sent.</li>
            <li> but I checked my brush this morning and there was no product at all past a few millimeters of the top of the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to try, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I was using a flat make-up brush and didn&#x27;t like the way it left my foundation looking streaky.</li>
            <li> However, Honesty and integrity mean more to me than a small discount.</li>
            <li> I recently just purchased this kabuki brush because the one that I had started to get a little too old and just gross.</li>
            <li> Although this brush is on the small side, it works really well with my IT CC cream foundation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush has a flat head of synthetic bristles, which are dense.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t stay flat.</li>
            <li> The brush has a flat head of synthetic bristles, which are dense.</li>
            <li> So I am expecting this brush to last a long time.</li>
            <li> it is so soft and my expensive foundation stays at the top and does not soak into the brush creating waste.  </li>
            <li> This wet method only seems to work for the liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I used this gem on both my liquid foundations and my Eve Long compact foundation</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft yet the brush is designed so that it is firm.</li>
            <li> I just recieved my brush a few days ago so far..</li>
            <li> Now, I will never go back to using my fingers nor will I ever use any other type of brush.</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t shed a single bristle that I have seen.  </li>
            <li> but I have yet to see one loose fiber (thankfully), and the way it blends is truly pro.</li>
            <li> The ferrules are loose as can be without falling off; and the bristles?</li>
            <li> The handle is already loose</li>
            <li> I will definitely recommend this product to other people!</li>
            <li> I could not live without this brush!</li>
            <li> This brush is a little smaller than the Sigma F80 Kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> Although the handle is shorter on this brush, than I thought it would be so application requires a little extra work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely soft, like a little fluffy bunny tail.</li>
            <li> it is not to hard not to soft.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find brushes that I like and that I can use with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like traditional stippling brushes as I find them not comfortable against my skin.</li>
            <li> As for the other types of foundation, I wouldnt recommend you use this brush for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I decided to give his brush a try.  </li>
            <li> The bristles also don&#x27;t fall out like on other brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was extremely prompt as well..</li>
            <li> No regrets or negative things to say about it.</li>
            <li> but I think I was just too use to my other one.</li>
            <li> It creates a natural look with little effort--and I am not talented at doing makeup.</li>
            <li> Typically a few fibers will come out which is expected.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t want to put it down.</li>
            <li> This brush lost less fibers than the brushes I&#x27;ve paid $58 a piece for.</li>
            <li> I typically use brushes by beauty junkees and sigma</li>
            <li> I find that I use less foundation too.</li>
            <li> 2 stars off because the bristles could have been half inch longer and the handle could have been 1inch longer.</li>
            <li> Bought this based on previous reviews.</li>
            <li> This brush performs as well as my Sigma F80 but cost half the price.  </li>
            <li> but does shead a little</li>
            <li> It does put it on a little heavy, but once it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li> Did have a few out of place hairs tho.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product a couple days before christmas and it arrived at my house few days before the est arrival date.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy feeling on my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it almost everyday to apply&lt;br</li>
            <li> So fluffy and distributes my foundation evenly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It used to take me forever to blend all the streaks out of my foundation with a tapered foundation brush that the cosmetic counter sold me, my foundation always felt painted on and I hated the fact that sponges ate up more foundation than it put on my face.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have washed it a few times and I haven&#x27;t noticed any fall out of the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Kept this brush because I don&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of return.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money elsewhere...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as hard as my other brush</li>
            <li> There is no fine lines, no stripes.</li>
            <li> There was very little shedding - a quality brush for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Im not sure</li>
            <li> Use it everyday for my face powder and sometimes blush!</li>
            <li> This brush works as well (if not better) than some of the &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; brushes I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s brush or the foundation (or a combination of both) --</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past week.</li>
            <li> I usually struggle getting my mineral foundation to buff in and blend</li>
            <li> Well at least I dont.</li>
            <li> The brush was thick and they didn&#x27;t skimp on the fibers at all.</li>
            <li> I hate taking my high end brushes out in my pocket book just for shine control.  </li>
            <li> but it had a slight angle to it which made it difficult to swirl on my mineral foundation.</li>
            <li> This little brush packs some power!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be the only one. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed, but it still works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars, and ordering the rest of the set, you can&#x27;t go wrong with these Keshima brushes.</li>
            <li> On one, the bristles literally began falling out in clumps, rendering one completely useless.</li>
            <li> I will order the rest of the set, you can&#x27;t go wrong with these Keshima brushes</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used some expensive brushes before and have always had fall out but not with this brush!</li>
            <li> Im not saying that its a bad brush by any means, because its NOT.</li>
            <li> I have never, NEVER been as disappointed in a makeup brush brand as I have with these.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this brush. I&#x27;m using it with Bare Minerals ready foundation which is compressed powder (I think) in compact form.  The bristles are really soft but dense so it evenly distributes the foundation. It&#x27;s also very well made and although I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks now, I haven&#x27;t experienced any &amp;#34;escapee&amp;#34; hairs. I have found the perfect brush and can now stop searching.  I will be purchasing a second one for my travel bag.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my 13 year old daughter and as she puts it &amp;#34;It&#x27;s 5-stars cool&amp;#34;.  She truly does like it a lot and is working to convince her mother and some friends to purchase it as well.  The brush is soft, sturdy and applies her liquid foundation evenly.</li>
            <li> ***Update***&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I tried this brush with different foundations. Everything from liquid, to cream, to powder. I still was not obsessed with it. I could not for the life of me understand all the hype. On a whim one day I decided to spritz this brush with water before using. OMG!!! It works a million times better damp! Now it actually applies my foundation without sucking it all up. Nice medium to full coverage thats not streaky. I actaully like this brush now, because I can get a nice smooth application of foundation on in about 2 minutes. This wet method only seems to work for the liquid foundation. As for the other types of foundation, I wouldnt recommend you use this brush for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is ok. For some reason I thought it would be bigger, fuller, and softer? Im not saying that its a bad brush by any means, because its NOT. Its great with getting the product on my face (liquid foundation), and evening out my tone. I still go over with a damp beauty blender afterwards though. Im not sure if maybe its the foundation I&#x27;m using thats the issue? After I try this with a few different foundations, Ill come back and update this review to be fair.</li>
            <li> Larger size in diameter, allows for more area of coverage. Very dense for number of fibers, which keeps the bristles from bending. Perfect stiple brush to use with mousse foundation &amp; get the job done quickly.</li>
            <li> Love my new Kabuki brush! I&#x27;ve seen it in many youtube makeup tutorials and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. Use it everyday for my face powder and sometimes blush! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I&#x27;m so glad that I bought this brush. It is one of the best brush in my collection. The brush is so soft and dense, which made it so easier to put on my liquid foundation. I will definitely remember this brand and thank you to the seller for having it available.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This brush is very good quality, the bristles do not fall out when applying makeup, and helps spread foundation evenly on the face. I would highly recommend this brush to anyone. This brush is a perfect gift!</li>
            <li> Perfect size sooooo soft blends my powder foundation beautifully I love it... Did have a few out of place hairs tho.</li>
            <li> As soon as I swirled this brush in my foundation powder and it touched my face , I didn&#x27;t want to put it down. This flat top kabuki brush is super soft and it feels great on my skin. It fit perfectly in my compact and it distributed the foundation evenly. yay for this Brush from Keshima!</li>
            <li> LOVE THE PRODUCT AND PACKAGING&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> best foundation brush ever. Easy to blend, soft, and doesn&#x27;t shed! Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I liked that just like that brushes from the set, it comes packaged in a plastic sleeve inside a box. I didn’t own any Flat Top Kabuki brushes so I was excited to review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush has a flat head of synthetic bristles, which are dense. I liked that it gave me a flawless and streak-free finish. It’s great to apply liquid and cream products. This brush is absolutely amazing for applying foundation. I particularly liked that it was so quick and easy to use. I loved that the foundation sat onto the top of the bristles and didn’t absorb into the bristles. I also liked that it gave my foundation a flawless and almost invisible look on my skin. I have to say that of all the brushes I have this is my favorite foundation brush! It’s definitely the perfect brush to use with medium to full coverage foundations.</li>
            <li> I have finally had a chance to use this brush and it is my favorite. A+++</li>
            <li> Excellent item I love it!!!</li>
            <li> my wife is very satisfied with product quality and speed of delivery.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product a couple days before christmas and it arrived at my house few days before the est arrival date. The touch of the brush is soo soft yet durable. Its in perfect condition and i cant wait to try my new high quality kabuki brush for the first time. I would recommend to everyone looking for a professional finish. Merry Christmas everyone! Xox</li>
            <li> As a cosmetologist and lover of makeup I always look for brushes. One can never have enough, even as I have probably 50. This brush was very impressive for the price. Once I received it I looked at it and it was nice and dense. The brush was thick and they didn&#x27;t skimp on the fibers at all. I washed the brush before using like I do with all of them. Typically a few fibers will come out which is expected. This brush lost less fibers than the brushes I&#x27;ve paid $58 a piece for. Once dried, applying my liquid foundation was easy. This brush didn&#x27;t leave patches or brush lines on my face. It gave my skin a flawless finish. It&#x27;s extremely soft, like a little fluffy bunny tail. I&#x27;m very happy with this brush and will be buying more in the future. *Sample provided for testing and review*</li>
            <li> I really dislike the brush. I feel like I&#x27;ve taken pretty good care of it but the make up doesn&#x27;t spread very evenly, the hairs on the brush are all over the place, it sheds... My main thing is that it never applied my Bare Minerals powder make up that well, and it hasn&#x27;t lasted very long. Started to seem very warn out after maybe a month.</li>
            <li> WORKS PERFECTLY WITH ANY LIQUID MAKE UP</li>
            <li> I love this brush as it goes on smoothly with my foundation and it is now a part of my makeup kit!</li>
            <li> Excellent soft brush leaves foundation completely flawless fully washable</li>
            <li> Never used a kabuki for liquid foundation/cc cream - got to say it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this brush works awesome with my foundation!!</li>
            <li> Works amazing! I use it with my bare minerals foundation. Thank you for making such a great product at a great price</li>
            <li> Awesome brush .. Better than any other brand.. a must have..</li>
            <li> Had a few issues with the first brush that was sent. Seller quickly sent another one. Great item, works as expected. Easy to clean. Good brush all around.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time! Tried it once and it applies great!</li>
            <li> I can already tell I&#x27;m going to love this&lt;br /&gt;brush. The brush is super soft and the application of my&lt;br /&gt;foundation was smooth and even. It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy feeling on my skin&lt;br /&gt;which is the best part! I really love this purchase!</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and has made me very happy so far!</li>
            <li> Lovely soft brush, good price too and quick delivery</li>
            <li> I received it about 1-2 weeks ago and I love it! I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the sigma flat top brush but I found that your guy&#x27;s brush is 10x better than the sigma brush, do you guys have more styles of the kabuki brushes because I will definitely buy more and review them!</li>
            <li> The Flat Top Kabuki is a great brush! I&#x27;ve used it almost everyday to apply&lt;br /&gt;my foundation since I&#x27;ve received it. It&#x27;s soft and blends my foundation&lt;br /&gt;flawlessly!</li>
            <li> love this brush it is not to hard not to soft.</li>
            <li> Great but does shead a little</li>
            <li> Great foundation brush!!!!</li>
            <li> I used the brush for the first time today, I was very happy with the result, it gives great coverage and should be a good addition to my collection.</li>

            <li> I love it!!! Gives me that flawless look!</li>

            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase and will definitely be buying more brushes in the future. Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> I recently just purchased this kabuki brush because the one that I had started to get a little too old and just gross. I read the reviews and gave it a shot. I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this brush! It applies so evenly and gives you a flawless finish! I will definitely recommend this product to other people! Completely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Better than f80 sigma brush!.. I love it and will definitely buy more :) Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a great small but very dense and soft kabuki brush.  Great for burnishing in foundation or blush. Fabulous customer service.  Nathan is on top of everything and they truly want you satisfied.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to try, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I bought 4 of the Keshima Kabuki brushes and absolutely love them!  ..Foundation goes on flawlessly and The Keshima brush and handle are just the right size for perfect comfort and control and there is absolutely no shedding!...I like using a fresh, clean brush everyday, washing all once a week....I will certainly be ordering more in the near future..</li>
            <li> I love my flat top brush! It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever used one to apply foundation and it&#x27;s honestly the best my foundation has ever applied. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I use it every time I put on my foundation. I love how soft the bristles are! So fluffy and distributes my foundation evenly. Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> A fabulous foundation brush.  Spreads evenly and thoroughly.  Great quality.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Works well for applying foundation. Great value!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I had another brand before this one and the bristles came out after a month or so. This brush is super soft and it just feels like silk on my face. The bristles are dense but still silky soft. The brush does excellent coverage with liquid foundation. It blends perfectly and is super easy to clean. For quick cleaning, I rub the brush on a bar of Dove soap and rinse. For better cleaning, I soak the brush in water and olive oil and after about ten minutes, rinse really well with hot water. I&#x27;ve had the brush now for about two months and there is no wear and tear at all...excellent brush. I have recommended this brush to all of my girlfriends!</li>
            <li> Excellent brush at a great price!</li>
            <li> Where has this been all my life? This brush is so soft and it delivers perfect coverage with minimal foundation.</li>
            <li> The brush is awesome. I love how flat and sturdy it is. It really gives me an airbrush and flawless look. Look forward to ordering more brushes.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Kabuki brush!I&#x27;m so happy I found this makeup brush! It is very soft and makes applying my powder mineral foundation a lot easier! I was using a foundation brush but it had a slight angle to it which made it difficult to swirl on my mineral foundation. This Kabuki brush makes it so easy to swirl on my mineral foundation! I love that this brush is make of super soft synthetic fibers. I can tell the brush is well make because I did not experience any bristles/fibers falling out at all which really surprised me. I&#x27;ve used some expensive brushes before and have always had fall out but not with this brush! This brush is so wonderful! I highly recommend it to any one looking for a kabuki brush!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Keshima flat top kabuki, it looked closest to the sigma F80 kabuki I&#x27;ve been dying for. But not buying it until I&#x27;ve tried others first and absolutely have to. I got to say this brush is very dense which I love. It&#x27;s so soft and applies my make up evenly and smooth. I have used the coastal scents flat top buffer and loved it, but I think maybe this one is taking over. I hope it last, we&#x27;ll have to wait after a few more uses.(fingers crossed).. I am not a make up artist, have self taught myself everything I know, which works for me and family &amp; friends I help out with special occasions. I do try many brushes. The more expensive brushes are not always the best brushes.</li>
            <li> I love your brush. I think I&#x27;ve found my holy grail. The  foundation goes on smoothly unlike any brushes I had before. Thanks again, will purchase again when I need a new one.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. It helps my foundation go on so much  better and gives me more coverage than just using my finger. It is a very soft brush and very easy to clean. I look forward to purchasing more brushes from this company.</li>
            <li> This has been by far my FAVORITE foundation brush. I use it for both liquid and powder. It blends so well and doesn&#x27;t absorb a lot of the product as applied. I finally have a great foundation brush since my other brush became discontinued. This brush works as well (if not better) than some of the &amp;#34;designer&amp;#34; brushes I have purchased in the past. I will repurchase again!</li>
            <li> Great brush, this applied my foundation smooth and to an airbrush finish. It washes nicely and had very soft, densely packed bristles. It&#x27;s definitely worth picking up!</li>
            <li> I actually love this brush! It is hard to find brushes that I like and that I can use with my sensitive skin. This brush works wonderfully - it&#x27;s perfect! I bought it because of the discount because I don&#x27;t have a lot to spend on brushes - I am now going to look at the rest of your products! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> This brush is great and makes foundation application nice and smooth. It works great with mineral foundation as well as liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  It is super soft and my mineral powder goes on evenly. My makeup looks great!!!</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with this little brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush was advertised on my Facebook news feed with a promo code...so of course I clicked on it. After looking at the page I decided to go ahead and purchase because it was a good deal, not expecting much. However I was highly surprised when this item arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love how the bristles on this brush are short, making the brush fairly dense but really soft at the same time. I was able to wash and sanitize this brush with no shedding so that&#x27;s a plus and hopefully the brush continues to have no shedding. I have since used this brush to apply liquid foundation and I was really impressed with the results. I typically use brushes by beauty junkees and sigma and I find this brush highly comparable to each of those brands. I will repurchase from this brand in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did purchase this item with a discounted promo code that was advertised on my facebook feed and I am in no way obligated to review this item.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how soft the brush is and it does a great job of applying foundation evenly. I never used a brush for foundation before this and I&#x27;m glad this was what I started with.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush! The bristles are very soft. I love using this with my pressed powder foundation; it provides great coverage.</li>
            <li> Although this brush is on the small side, it works really well with my IT CC cream foundation. I love it. :-)</li>
            <li> This brush is incredible. I am going to order another to have on hand! Perfect for foundation (I use with Bare Minerals) or for blending bronzer / blush. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Great brush! it applies foundation flawlessly and is very soft even after cleaning :) the price is amazing and im looking forward to getting more keshima brushes!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this flat top Kabuki brush for two weeks now, it&#x27;s wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;It used to take me forever to blend all the streaks out of my foundation with a tapered foundation brush that the cosmetic counter sold me, my foundation always felt painted on and I hated the fact that sponges ate up more foundation than it put on my face.&lt;br /&gt;This brush blends within seconds with literally no touchups when I get into the car!&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried that a couple reviews said it absorbed too much product but I checked my brush this morning and there was no product at all past a few millimeters of the top of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars, and ordering the rest of the set, you can&#x27;t go wrong with these Keshima brushes.</li>
            <li> I love this brush . Does wonders</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Just as good as the sigma F80.  The quality is awesome</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few different flat topped brushes and have to say this is the best i&#x27;ve used.  Soft and dense and works perfectly with my stick foundation.</li>
            <li> I am loving this brush! It&#x27;s great for stippling and it&#x27;s universal!</li>
            <li> Very soft brush but it soaks up a lot more makeup than my other brushes. I&#x27;ve had to use twice as much foundation to achieve the same look.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s alright, but I probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> just super soft to my face but at the same time, practical to apply my make up!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS BRUSH!  Super soft and it hasn&#x27;t shed a single bristle that I have seen.  Waiting to save up to purchase the set!</li>
            <li> Ok, I have never used a brush to apply my foundation before.  So this was a first for me.  I have to say I love this brush!!  I never realized how much foundation I was using applying it with my fingers.  This brush uses just a little foundation and applies full coverage without any streaks and it applies it evenly.  I will definitely order again.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> Its a nice brush, could be a little denser but for the price it works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as part of a promotion.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with it.  I use it for my mineral foundation and it works quite well.  No fall out and seems to spread the foundation evenly.</li>
            <li> Absolutely best brush for liquid make-up. It&#x27;s the second time I have bought this product. The flat top is very dense and soft. Only drawback, I am washing my brushes weekly and the stem is made of a wooden material, so the paint peels off the stem.</li>
            <li> I love the density of this brush.  I found that it works best if i push the product (my foundation) into my skin rather than stipple it around as it was moving my product around too much when I was stippling it out.  I ordered the actual stippling brush after I got this and can&#x27;t wait to try it out too! great product especially for the price!!!</li>
            <li> My first impression is the brush is a bit small but very soft, I bough it to use with mac studio fix powder. The brush handle is a nice size and fits nicely in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the size for my t zone application, but I have pigmentation issues on my cheeks and found that this brush was a bit small so it took longer to achieve an even coverage&lt;br /&gt;This is my 2nd Keshima brush, I liked the brow brush alot and got a 20% off which I used to get the flat top kabuki.</li>
            <li> Best foundation brush I&#x27;ve had in a long time!!!! Makes application even, smooth and fast.</li>
            <li> Soft as a baby&#x27;s butt. Love it.</li>
            <li> I must join the rest of the reviewers and admit that this brush if fantastic.  I do own many different foundation brushes, Chanel, Bobbi Brown, Make up Forever, Hourglass and even my beloved Marc Jacobs Face ll, but I feel that this one is better.  The hairs of my Marc Jacob&#x27;s are softer and denser but overall this Keshima brush deposits the foundation just as beautifully and the handle is soo much shorter  that I no longer hit my make up mirror.  This little foundation brush is truly the best.  I used this gem on both my liquid foundations and my Eve Long compact foundation and it performed fabulously on both.  I don&#x27;t use mineral foundations therefor I can&#x27;t give an opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brush handle came loose, I contacted this seller (Better Living Solutions) and they immediately send me a replacement.  Not only this brush if fantastic but the customer service is superb.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Love love love my new Keshima brush! My makeup glides on so beautifully and this brush is absolutely perfect for blending and contouring. Will be purchasing every other Keshima brush available!</li>
            <li> I LOVE my brush, the quality of the brush was outstanding for the price! I plan on buying the entire brush collection! You bristles are very soft and allow for a smooth application!</li>
            <li> Very happy with not only this product, but with the customer service. After having a slight issue with my original brush, they very quickly sent a replacement. The replacement brush is flawless. I am a huge makeup fan, and brushes are a necessity. The coverage this brush provides is like nothing I&#x27;ve used before. It allows my (liquid) foundation to very evenly be blended, and leaves no little brush hairs on your face like I&#x27;ve experienced with other brushes. I highly recommend this brush! *I did receive this brush at a promotional price. However, Honesty and integrity mean more to me than a small discount. I will be repurchasing from this company as I am very happy with the product and customer service*</li>
            <li> I have bought this item twice now, absolutely love it, gives even coverage and the bristles are extremely soft! I have very dry and flaky skin, using this brush does not peel away any dry skin and applies liquid foundation brilliantly. I could not live without this brush! Defiantly worth the buy and will continue to be the only Flat Top Kabuki Brush I will ever use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot Keshima + Amazon!</li>
            <li> Good quality dense bristles so blends makeup very well</li>
            <li> Pretty much exactly the same as my sigma f80, will never waste money on that one again</li>
            <li> Beautifully made brush.  Soft natural fibers.  Nice easy to grip handle that is comfortable too.  The perfect tool for someone who likes a smooth blended-no-makeup look.  I can&#x27;t wear makeup without it.</li>
            <li> This brush meets all the requirements of a perfect foundation brush. The brush length is perfect for applying foundation and the synthetic fibers are soft but not so much that they flatten out. This is the first brush I&#x27;ve owned that I didn&#x27;t have to toss out for one reason or another. It spreads foundation on evenly and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks or bare patches. I am able to use LESS of my foundation and it still covers perfectly. I used to use my fingers and couldn&#x27;t imagine using a brush because I thought the brush would absorb all the foundation--not so! Now, I will never go back to using my fingers nor will I ever use any other type of brush. In fact, I ordered TWO and bookmarked the page!!!</li>
            <li> This kabuki brush is so soft and gentle I love it my makeup looks stunning make my foundation looks natural 👏🏼😁</li>
            <li> Hands down one of the best brushes I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Unless you are a diva and need makeup applied hourly, this brush is a great one.  It is soft yet resilient amd seems to be a great travel brush.  I hate taking my high end brushes out in my pocket book just for shine control.  This gives me everything I need without worry.</li>
            <li> Great brush! I like it better than my bare minerals kabuki brush. Soft bristles didn&#x27;t irritate my face or shed like some cheaper ones do.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I DID have a coupon code for this which made it cheaper so I bought it because I didn&#x27;t have much to lose. However, even if it had been full price, this brush would be worth every penny. I&#x27;ve used tons of brushes during my makeup life and this one is, by far, one of the best. It&#x27;s incredibly soft but I have yet to see one loose fiber (thankfully), and the way it blends is truly pro. I love this and want to buy more of their products.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter as a beginner piece to her brush collection, she wants to become a professional makeup artist. It is wonderfully soft and thick, an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Great&lt;br /&gt;Density is just right&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;Definetly order again from this seller</li>
            <li> Amazing product. .so soft..I love it.</li>
            <li> My kids didn&#x27;t want to give it back to me because it was so soft ;-)  Great brush!  Must Have!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the brush! The soft bristles feel like silk against my skin and make for easy application.  I&#x27;ve purchased a wide assortment of brushes over the years and this brush is the best so far. I&#x27;m excited about my next purchase with your company! Thank you for creating a superior product at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Best brush I have ever had!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite makeup brush. Easy to clean and very soft.</li>
            <li> Love how my foundation goes on with this brush!</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my wife and she loves it!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a brush to use with liquid foundation that didn&#x27;t cost $50.00.  After reading other reviews, I decided to give his brush a try.  Wow, what a difference in the results with the application using the brush over applying with my fingers.  Never again will I apply foundation without this brush... it is so soft and my expensive foundation stays at the top and does not soak into the brush creating waste.  Just buy it already...</li>
            <li> Smooth even Coverage. I use this brush with Dior Airflash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been testing this out since I got it and I must say that I love it. I feel like I&#x27;ve been living under a rock! Thank you Keshima you have totally shown me the light!!!</li>
            <li> Love this brush! It is perfect for applying my liquid foundation. Not sure if it&#x27;s brush or the foundation (or a combination of both) -- but my makeup has NEVER lasted on my face longer than it has when applied using this brush. Will definitely be buying more of these.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Great price and great brush!</li>
            <li> this blends my foundation flawlessly and without streaks. i am very pleased!</li>
            <li> This brush is excellent.  I would&#x27;nt use anything else.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping with amazon prime and love the soft quality bristles of my flat top kabuki brush! Perfect for applying liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> Good brush. It blends well the product on your skin. Worths the price.</li>
            <li> Very soft , Very Amazing. Good price . Its worth buying.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, I was a little apprehensive about buying this brush because of the price I thought maybe it wouldn&#x27;t do the job properly but I&#x27;m super happy I followed my gut and made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Live this brush!  Great quality!</li>
            <li> I love this brush !!! Never in my life has my face looked so flawless .. Wish I would have found this sooner !!!</li>
            <li> I love my new Keshima Flat Top Kabuki!&lt;br /&gt;It applies my liquid foundation flawlessly and I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> This is a great quality brush. I find myself reaching for this brush over my more expensive brushes. i am very happy with this purchase and the price is awesome.</li>
            <li> You must try this brush to really appreciate it.  I have used one other flat top brush, but this one is denser and more effective.  This is simply an outstanding brush.  It creates a natural look with little effort--and I am not talented at doing makeup.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she said she LOVES it! She said she probably uses it too much. Haha! But she is very happy with it!! We will be using these products again in the future.</li>
            <li> Loved it at first but it didn&#x27;t stay flat. The brush spread out and the hairs clumped together even after cleaning the brush. I&#x27;m a little disappointed, but it still works.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush after sales lady at department store suggested buying a brush to apply my foundation.  Makes all the difference in how your face looks and feels.  Great brush, love how it applies my makeup.  Am thinking of giving this brush to my daughters as presents.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> I received it and I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s super soft bristles are amazing! Thanks for the opportunity!</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It&#x27;s so soft and applies makeup smoothly.</li>
            <li> SUPER high quality feel!!!  This is an amazingly great brush!  It feels very much like a high end brush to me.  I&#x27;m using it for bronzer, and it works very well.  I&#x27;m thinking about another for my primer and foundation too!</li>
            <li> Nice quality brush, LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush in mid-July, 2014; it&#x27;s now March 2015. I have two of them, and own a large amount of makeup brushes from many brands. I have never, NEVER been as disappointed in a makeup brush brand as I have with these. They aren&#x27;t worth it to me at any price. I had been gently washing them approximately once per week (using them at most, twice per week) with mild soap and water, laying flat to air dry. Not tough on them by ANY means. Both have simply fallen apart. The ferrules are loose as can be without falling off; and the bristles? Falling out. On one, the bristles literally began falling out in clumps, rendering one completely useless. I&#x27;ve thrown both in the trash. Never again! Very disappointed. I can only hope that more people come back and edit their reviews. I can&#x27;t be the only one. :(</li>
            <li> I like this brush, I just have to get use to it. It&#x27;s soft and mixes well with foundation and bb cream.</li>
            <li> I bought the Kabuki brush alone, and it is excellent. I have never owned a flat-top kabuki brush before, but this one has set a very high standard for me. The bristles are soft yet the brush is designed so that it is firm. I use the firmness of the brush to apply foundation to my face, and it applies very evenly and lightly. I am a convert to the kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> Really great foundation brush! It&#x27;s even better than high end sigma foundation brush! Seller sincerely sent e-mail to buyers to ask for feedbacks, really nice business of Keshima. Hoping the seller still keep up the quality and the price! :)</li>
            <li> Great brush! I use it with liquid foundation and it Blends and applies makeup very well and gives an airbrush look.</li>
            <li> The brush is absolutely amazing. It is extremely soft and distributes the product all over my face in a uniform manner. I did not know this brand, but after this experience I will gladly test the other products and l will for sure recommend this product. Another important detail is that the product arrived exactly on time. Again I&#x27;m happy with my purchases at Amazon, one of my favorite companies.</li>
            <li> I love it. I use it to apply my mineral powder foundation, and the coverage is so much better than my old brush. I find that I use less foundation too.</li>
            <li> I have had this for several months and have had no issues with this brush so far. I use it at lease a couple times a week and wash it after every use and  so far it has not shed. The first time I used this brush was to apply my liquid foundation and my skin looked so smooth and airbrushed that I did not have to go back and touch up any areas with concealer.  This brush&lt;br /&gt;gives me similar results to when I use my beauty blender to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush instead of the one bare minerals offered to go with their new bare skin liquid makeup it&#x27;s half the price and works great.  The makeup went on flawlessly and the bristles aren&#x27;t to hard or to soft. The bristles also don&#x27;t fall out like on other brushes. When I showed it to my daughter she liked it so much I ordered one for her too.</li>
            <li> Best little brush I have ever owned. Use it for my foundation and will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Great Kabuki brush,  I love that the way it handles and makes applying make up easy.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft! I have an addiction to all things makeup and makeup brushes. I use this too put powered on my face. I have washed it a few times and I haven&#x27;t noticed any fall out of the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes boxed in cute packaging, this brush is high quality and a great addition to your makeup brush collection or great for people just starting out.</li>
            <li> great price - great brush.</li>
            <li> I really love this brush. I bought it to apply and buff out sunless tanner. It&#x27;s really great. No bristles fell out at all. I would definitely purchase another one to use with my makeup.</li>
            <li> The flat top kabuki brush by Keshima is a great brush. It helps to apply foundations with a flawless finish. The bristles are very soft, yet just dense enough to give the right amount of coverage. If you are looking for a great brush without having to spend a lot of money, then this one is a definite must to add to your collection.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great brush for applying foundation. It does put it on a little heavy, but once it&#x27;s on it&#x27;s easy to blend the make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice quality.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best make-up brushes I have ever owned! It applies all your liquid foundation beautifully and flawlessly. This is a must for foundation application! Get yourself one!!!</li>
            <li> I love it!  This is my first experience using a brush to apply foundation&lt;br /&gt;and I am hooked!  The brush is soft and blends makeup very well!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased Bare Essentials makeup and their brush was just too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;This brush was a great deal and is good quality!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was extremely prompt as well.. good experience all around!</li>
            <li> Nice brush for nice price, I like the fact that the handle is fat.  This brush is a little smaller than the Sigma F80 Kabuki brush. 2 stars off because the bristles could have been half inch longer and the handle could have been 1inch longer. Kept this brush because I don&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of return.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Perfect for me!</li>
            <li> excellent brush at an excellent price</li>
            <li> love this brush and works well..its super soft and works well for my blush..</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and definitely dense with bristles. I am no pro at using/applying makeup but I watched a make-up tutorial on how to apply foundation and they said to use a flat top brush. I like that the brush allowed me to easily apply my foundation without any streaking giving me a more polished and flawless look.</li>
            <li> I was sorta skeptical about how good this brush would be when I was ordering it but as soon as I opened the box I could tell it was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very sturdy in design so the top isn&#x27;t just going to fall off (which has happened to me way more than I would like), the brush head is super soft, and I love the long handle design since most brushes of this type are short and stubby.</li>
            <li> Order this product for my daughter since she is a makeup addict ... :) she loves it the kabuki brush is not hard but steady enoght that doesnt scratch you</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t really make reviews but this one, I must say deserves to have one..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered my first flat top kabuki brush on a whim (just to get a free shipping with my other order).. And I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m looking for. So soft, very dense and most of all.. NO FALL OUT. The length of the handle is perfect for me. Just so you know, I ordered another one yesterday and I can&#x27;t wait to have it delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More power to you and I hope you will create more eye brushes with the same quality and affordable price as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> The brush is amazing. It&#x27;s very dense and a shorter synthetic top which makes application much easier. I adore it! The quality is very nice as well and the design is great. I will definitely be recommending your line!</li>
            <li> Sooo soft! I&#x27;ve bought cheap make-up brushes before and wasted the little money I&#x27;d spent so was determined to &#x27;up my game&#x27; and am delighted with the Keshima brush. Good value and no shedding!</li>
            <li> absolutely love this brush. dense and does not shed upon initial wash. will definitely be purchasing more for my brush collection. if keshima comes out with eye brushes i will be the first to purchase them. :)</li>
            <li> I was amazed as to how fast I received it!!!! And I love it!!! Very handy and very soft on my face, it blended my foundation beautifully! I will be ordering more brushes soon! Have a blessed day!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my Keshima Kabuki brush. A very good buy.m</li>
            <li> It was great. Works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Arrived quick.  Very soft top.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing! It&#x27;s so soft yet dense that it makes applying liquid foundation easy. It distributes product perfectly. I also use this brush to blend my concealer. I love it so far, and would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have personally enjoyed using my new Keshima Flat top brush on a daily basis.  Since I received the brush, it became my new go to foundation brush. It delivers a flawless finish with both foundation and BB creams.  I look  forward to purchasing other Keshima brushes in the near future; did I mention shipping was fast, I&#x27;m definitely a happy customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blessings,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesica</li>
            <li> Love this brush!! I use it to put on my foundation and it goes on flawlessly! Airbrush finish. I will  Definitely consider buying more brushes from Keshima!! Thank you Keshima brushes!!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush through a recommendation of my friend. So far, it&#x27;s been great.&lt;br /&gt;It blends out my foundation or bb cream really good without sucking up too much of my liquid foundation. Thank you. I&#x27;ll be looking for more brushes from Keshima in the future, since I&#x27;m having a thought of changing most of my brushes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush because it went on sale significantly. I really like it. I had no expectation for it, but I&#x27;m so glad I have it. It&#x27;s firm, but soft.. perfect for blending. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful and beautiful and lightweight hand</li>
            <li> Very, very happy I decided to buy this brush over the more expensive ones by other brands. It&#x27;s very soft and works great. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past week. No regrets or negative things to say about it.</li>
            <li> Very well made brush!  My daughters love using it.  Smooth application and coverage area.</li>
            <li> Best Kabuki brush I have ever owned! Easily worth double the price.</li>
            <li> LOVE this brush! It&#x27;s SUPER soft and very sturdy!</li>
            <li> I love it. Nothing more to say. Just buy it. Pretty close to impossible to find a better product for those price. Just as good as mac and better than my bare mineral brushes.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.. Looking forward to getting more brushes from this company..</li>
            <li> I really like this brush! Pleasantly surprised at the coverage it provided without shedding. Soft but dense bristles. My first product from this brand and it wont be my last.</li>
            <li> Brush is well made and applies/ blends foundation quite nice, very pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li> Edit: Very happy until it broke in half. I am on my 2nd keshima brush,  and the two halves separated. The first brush I replaced because the bristles started pushing in, so the brush had a concave shape. A good brush,  but needs to be replaced somewhat frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old review: Good quality brush. Very soft bristles and a comfortable handle. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This brush is great. So soft and blends makeup like a dream. The bristles are soft and dense, and I like the size of the width and height of the bristles. Short enough to directly blend the makeup and have more control over there smaller areas of your face. The size of the bristles give you precise control. I don&#x27;t like when flat top kabuki brushes have long bristles and are too wide because it&#x27;s harder to blend under the eyes, around the nose and mouth, but this brush is perfect!</li>
            <li> I love it!!! My makeup goes on smoother and it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing liquid foundation. Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> So far I love this brush...super soft and bristles dont fall out.</li>
            <li> Great quality brush! Gave this to my sister in law (a makeup artist) and she squealed when she saw it! I&#x27;ve never used one, but she apparently has and was BEYOND excited to add it to her brush collection for her clients.</li>
            <li> I love it, it&#x27;s an amazing brush!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush. I use it daily with my Mac Face and Body foundation. It gives a flawless look.</li>
            <li> Bought this based on previous reviews. I was using a flat make-up brush and didn&#x27;t like the way it left my foundation looking streaky. I don&#x27;t like traditional stippling brushes as I find them not comfortable against my skin. This one is a nicely textured, in-between brush. It applies my makeup evenly and doesn&#x27;t leave it looking streaky or stippled. For me, it gives my makeup an almost airbrushed quality. I haven&#x27;t experienced any bristle fallout, which is something I wanted in a brush, but didn&#x27;t expect to get as every brush I&#x27;ve ever owned had some degree of fallout. I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of this brush.</li>
            <li> Daughter loved this brush...great quality</li>
            <li> This little brush packs some power!!! I purchased this brush as a holdover until I could reorder my favorite brush by Sigma, but I don&#x27;t think I need the Sigma brush any longer! This brush so far hasn&#x27;t shed any bristles and spreads foundation beautifully.</li>
            <li> This brush is AMAZING. It feels so smooth, and blends perfectly. I use it to apply bronzer and it looks so smooth, never streaky. I highly recommend this product, well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  I generally spend big money on cosmetic brushes.  I want my brushes to perform well.  This brush performs as well as my Sigma F80 but cost half the price.  I have used the brush with liquid foundation and with powder foundation.  I also gave the brush a thorough washing to make sure it would not fall a part after washing.  It washed and dried beautifully.  The bristles are soft and dense.  The head is a perfect size.  I was able to get full coverage in the difficult areas such as around my nose and under my eyes.  I will be purchasing more brushes from this company and would recommend this brush to anyone who needs a good stripling foundation brush!</li>
            <li> great brush--gives great coverage with out giving too much, have been using it every day since receiving it! thanks  RSE</li>
            <li> This brush is actually really good and the customer service is even better. I had a couple issues ordering initially and the company got back to me promptly to assist.  The company reached out thereafter I received my brush to see if everything was resolved and if I was happy with my order.  I let them know that I really liked the brush for powder and it actually worked a bit better than my other more expensive kabukis.  It doesn&#x27;t cake on the powder, which is great.  However, I tried using it for liquid and it didnt work as great.  They advised me to dampen the brush, and that it should work better that way.  I dampened with Urban Decay fix bc that was the only spray bottle I had handy, and it worked perfectly thereafter.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it is great for buffing foundation onto your face, it does a fantastic job blending the foundation.  The Brussels are soft, but don&#x27;t fold when buffing your foundation on. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a really great brush- firm enough to fill in all the fine lines, but soft enough not to irritate your face. A good quality, non-shedding brush!</li>
            <li> I have Bare Mineral brush but I love the texture and the softness of Keshima brush The brush has a flat head of synthetic bristles, which are dense. I noticed immediately that my foundation was going on evenly and smooth.I will order the rest of the set, you can&#x27;t go wrong with these Keshima brushes</li>
            <li> This brush is terrific.  It is so soft.  I ended up ordering more for my daughters, since they were trying to immediately steal it from me.  It is a great addition to your makeup  applicators.</li>
            <li> Feels so soft, like a feather being brushed across your face. It&#x27;s now my favorite brush to apply my foundation. Good quality. Buffs to perfection. :)</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful. I use it with my Estee Lauder Doublewear and it goes on flawlessly. Much better than the $45 brush that I bought from Estee Lauder. Boy I wish that I could get my money back from them!</li>
            <li> I do like the brush, definitely do not regret the buy.  It&#x27;s not as hard as my other brush but I think I was just too use to my other one.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! Works great for applying liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! We all want brushes that just get the job done, but dont want to pay $20 or $30 plus bucks for them. Well at least I dont. This is a definitely must have brush. Its so soft and leaves my face looking so flawless and airbrushed. Very happy I got this brush. And the shipping was super fast!!</li>
            <li> I was contacted via email by one of the co-founders of KESHIMA to share my thoughts on the flat top Kabuki brush. Firstly I must admit I am not a makeup artist. My knowledge on makeup brushes and makeup products is a result of trial and error when I do my own everyday makeup. After trying sponges and &#x27;paint-like&#x27; foundation brushes I decided to move on to a flat top synthetic foundation brush. When I do my makeup I want to achieve a flawless finish (who doesn&#x27;t, right?) and with a flat top brush is so much easier to blend and smooth out the foundation on my skin. There is no fine lines, no stripes. Moreover, because it is synthetic it lays the product onto the skin without wasting it. After looking in High St, stores for what I wanted I choose to look online as I was not prepared to pay what they were asking. I wanted something more affordable. The main reason why I bought this one was due to so many positive comments. Someone compared it to the Sigma F80 so I thought for this price might as well have it. And I do not regret my decision. When I opened the box my first impression was it is a decent size, nice handle and the fibers are very soft. After a few uses I can now say it is extremely easy to get a natural look, no hairs have come off the brush and because of the completely flat top only 1 or 2 pumps of my liquid foundation go a long way. Today I cleaned my brush and I can say it looks and feels as brand new and no hairs came off . So I am expecting this brush to last a long time. Personally I think it is a cracking deal for the price you get a great quality foundation brush. If Keshima does an angled brush for contouring/highlight I will be getting it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, when I searched for a flat top kabuki brush, I was looking for the Sigma (after all I&#x27;d heard about it). But I bought this one instead as the reviews were equally as good and this was cheaper! I&#x27;m a student so every penny counts, and I&#x27;m glad I got this one!&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is very soft and very densely packed. I had been using the Real Techniques stippling brush for years but felt that my liquid foundation was travelling through the brush, down to the second layer of bristles, therefore wasting product and not getting as much on my face. This brush is better. The liquid sits right on the top, due to the amount of bristles there are, and even a little product now goes a long way. Although the handle is shorter on this brush, than I thought it would be so application requires a little extra work.&lt;br /&gt;I first stipple my make up on and then I am able to buff my foundation on which in turn, makes it look better on the skin, almost as if I am not wearing any make up. If I need any extra coverage I simple stipple some more on then buff VERY  lightly so as not to remove the first layer.&lt;br /&gt; All in all I am very pleased that I ended up with this brush and brand and I will absolutely consider buying other brushes from here.</li>
            <li> It works.  Just as good as the name brands.  So why spend more?</li>
            <li> Excellent brush! Love the way my makeup looks after using this brush for application!</li>
            <li> Love this brush. May make up looks flawless.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this brush.  It is dense and applies my liquid foundation really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already recommended it to two of my friends.</li>
            <li> so soft! blends very nicely</li>
            <li> I just recieved my brush a few days ago so far.. for the price this thing is fabulous!! and it buffs my face into perfection every morning !! the bristles are soft and seem to be of quality</li>
            <li> This brush is incredible! No shedding and leaves my makeup in a smooth finish on my skin. Feel very high quality and the packaging is lovely. I will be purchasing this make up brush again for its quality and affordability.</li>
            <li> I am in no shape or form familiar with cosmetics/tools. For years I have&lt;br /&gt;been trying to get that perfect matte foundation look. I have been using a&lt;br /&gt;loose powder brush that seemed to always clump up. When I purchased the&lt;br /&gt;Keshima Flat Top Kabuki brush...I believed I had finally struck GOLD!!! Its&lt;br /&gt;soft yet firm allowing me to get that perfect matte finish. It buffs and&lt;br /&gt;evens out my powder foundation perfectly. I honestly could not be happier&lt;br /&gt;with the results. I&#x27;ll definitely be back to buy more products from&lt;br /&gt;Keshima! ...If my husband allows me ;) ...</li>
            <li> I am in love with that brush! Best one I&#x27;ve had by far!! It applies the foundation so smooth and even, i do not have a brush that can even compare to this one! Definitely will be ordering from y&#x27;all again!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brush!  Soft, and beautiful airbrush coverage with just a stroke.  LIke a luxury puff on the end of a stick..  I normally use sigma but noticed the good reviews and saw that it looked similar.  It is just as good ( maybe better) than my sigma that costs twice as much!  Flat top Kabuki is a wonderful kind of brush and is perfect for blending foundation..  I pump it on the brush and it will not &amp;#34;sink&amp;#34; in the brush.  But, its also great for blush, or powder ( this is why I need a couple more)  This is my go to all purpose brush... and I am hooked  !  Don&#x27;t waste your money elsewhere... I am a makeup addict and If I say this is great.... its great!</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush on Thursday night with  standard shipping. It was delivered to my door Saturday.  The brush is high quality, and extremely soft. I used it to apply my Bare Minerals original foundation. It worked better than I could have hoped! It gave me a really full coverage, and I had to use far less product than I do with the brushes I was using. Overall I am very impressed. I definitely want to try more Keshima brushes! [[ASIN:B00JLAOP3S Flat Top Kabuki Brush By Keshima &amp;#x2605; Premium Foundation Brush, Buffing Brush, Blending Brush, Face Brush]]</li>
            <li> Beautiful high quality brush. The flat top is a must for applying compressed powder foundation as it makes great contact with the foundation then blends out so well on the skin. So glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I really love this brush! It is soft and the foundation blends very well. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing brush! I&#x27;ve been looking for a brush that would apply my makeup as best as possible because I have deep acne scars on my cheeks and this brush helps me apply makeup onto my face while not getting caked around my scars like other brushes have done. I would totally recommend this brush! Especially for people with a less than smooth skin. It is absolutely perfect!</li>
            <li> Very surprised by the quality of the brush for the price. Very soft and did not leave any brush hairs on my face!</li>
            <li> Great brush for foundation .</li>
            <li> This is a great brush, and the price is right.  Full disclosure:  I&#x27;m not a make-up artist.  I&#x27;m just a regular person.  I previously was using sponges (not the fancy kind but the rounds you buy at Target -- I&#x27;d cut them in half and toss them after a bit) and wanted to get a nice brush but was balking at the prices of the &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; brushes ($50 range!).  Based on the other reviews, I gave this brush a try, and I love it!  Easy to use (spend a few minutes on YouTube looking up how to use it properly -- worth it), and it makes my foundation routine faster.  Brush is soft and the bristles stay put (as in they don&#x27;t come out and stick to your face).  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> All I can say is &amp;#34;WOW!!!&amp;#34; What a great foundation brush!!! I usually struggle getting my mineral foundation to buff in and blend so I usually do not use it. Today I took a chance with it and OMG!!! I finally know what it&#x27;s like to have an airbrushed look!! This brush barely used any of my product, so that in itself is a win/win situation for my wallet. I will absolutely purchase any and all of Keshima brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> This brush works so well! This is the best my foundation has looked in years, so even and smooth.  I think the trick is to just put a little light amount on the brush at a time, a little goes a long way and looks nice and smooth, not cakey.  Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Great Product! Fast Shipping. Very Happy</li>
            <li> Lovely brush, great price no mega quick delivery! Love!</li>
            <li> Made foundation application much easier..more smooth, however don t know how long it will last</li>
            <li> Nice brush and makes my foundation look flawless!</li>
            <li> Great Brush! The bristles are dense, but not TOO dense. It picks up both liquid and cream products nicely. I&#x27;ve actually taken a like to using it for my cream contour. There was very little shedding - a quality brush for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! Though I have all types of high end makeup brushes from department stores and major makeup lines, this brush is the most loved so far. I have been using my fingers to apply my foundation for years and finally decided to try this foundation brush for a trial. I am 100% satisfied.  It makes my foundation look absolutely flawless!  I clean it daily with a daily brush cleaning spray and it&#x27;s ready for the next use and does not shed. I am so glad I made this purchase and I just purchased a couple more for my friends since it is such a great deal!</li>
            <li> Amazing brush!! So soft and dense.. I used my Kat VonD foundation with these brush and it was flawless!</li>
            <li> Super soft bristles!  Applies liquid foundation beautifully. Doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb it. Applies evenly. Washed once and seems to be high quality that will last. The handle is already loose but if it does fall apart its a quick fix!</li>
