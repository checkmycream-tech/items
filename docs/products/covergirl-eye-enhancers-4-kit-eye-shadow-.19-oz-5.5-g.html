            <li> This color combo is great...my collection of shadows is complete!</li>
            <li> The colors are really strong and look really well with anything</li>
            <li> I love the different shades and it stays on well.  Does not rub off easily.  I hate that Amazon makes me type x amount of words.  Who&#x27;s review is this?  I don&#x27;t have a lot to say about it.  It&#x27;s eyeshadow for crying out loud.</li>
            <li> This quad is probably my favorite of Cover Girl&#x27;s collection, because I wear so much purple. My skin seems to absorb powder after about six hours, and I have to refresh it, but that&#x27;s pretty good staying power for any powder eyeshadow. This combination of purples is stylish enough for day or evening wear. I will definitely keep buying this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is durable but light enough to carry around in a purse.</li>
            <li> vivid color and smooth application...extremely happy with purchase and price I got it at!</li>
            <li> Both cover girl eye shadows that I ordered were not well packaged and came with one of the colors completely broken up and unusable.&lt;br /&gt;The remaining three colors are just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is a nice color palette that&#x27;s not easy to find in stores.  It&#x27;s a great value for a 4-color kit.</li>

            <li> Eye shadows are a beautiful color. I have green eyes so they look very nice. Delivered quickly. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I never received compliments on my eye shadow until I started using this set.  I highly recommend it!  I fear they have discontinued it as it is hard to find.</li>
            <li> Love love cover girl makeup I will only use and buy there makeup I&#x27;ve loved them for along time there makeup gos on smooth and easy  love cover girl</li>
            <li> Same comments as I gave for Blossoms 257 colors packet...excellent all the way around. I would buy this item again.</li>
            <li> I wish the colors went on a little brighter. I actually have to dampen the colors to get the color I want out of them.</li>
            <li> Complements from my hairdresser and make up artist.&lt;br /&gt;Great for green eyes.</li>
            <li> I do love the colors and the stay-on quality of this product.</li>

            <li> Not as highly pigmented as I thought.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a good many years. I have never been dissapointed with the colors and the way that this eye shadow glides on. It stays put until you take it off. I use the dark purple the most, and when I need an extra boost I&#x27;ll use the others too. I am completely sastified with this product. Very easy to use too!!</li>
            <li> I only have been able to use 2 of the 4 colors because 2 colors were smashed to powder during shipping from Amazon.  The 2 colors that I have been able to use look great with my light skin.  The color fades with a few hours.</li>
            <li> love the name &amp;#34;ice princess&amp;#34;.  very flattering for daily wear, soft color.</li>
            <li> I love the different hues and they are not overwhelming. The eye shadow shipped on time and it was sealed.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this eye shadow. They go well with most of my outfits. I received complements when I wear this eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Bought for 13 year daughter to have fun with her girlfriends during sleepovers &amp; we both ended up loving it :) her eyes are baby blue &amp; mine are a golden brown.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I use it quite a lot when I put on my makeup. I appreciate getting it from you.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You.</li>
            <li> Love the rich colors.  They seem to last longer on me than most eye shadows. Just what I needed</li>
