            <li>It really works I just there was more product because then it becomes kind of pricey to keep using it.  </li>

            <li>But I did see a huge difference on my thighs and abdomen.  </li>
            <li>Too soon for an accurate evaluation.  </li>

            <li>No big dimple looking craters lol.</li>

            <li>I like that the cream absorbs into my skin quickly.</li>
            <li>I really like the light scent of this cream, I like scents that are light and not too powerful.</li>
            <li>but I honestly think I see a difference it goes on easy and once dry</li>
            <li>Great cream, can feel it tingling.&lt;br /&gt;After a few applicationa skin felt tighter and firmer.</li>
            <li>Worth a try</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Runs out quick, need bigger jar, pump would be better.</li>
            <li>This burns your skin if you have sensitive skin, do not use, it turned my skin bright red and irritated it a lot.  </li>
            <li>Honestly after skin looses its elasticity I really feel like there&#x27;s nothing that&#x27;s going to shrink skin back without surgery.</li>
            <li>I love this cream, not only is it working miracles on me but its not at all greasy and absorbs right into my skin, and the smell is to die for.</li>
            <li>Decided I should order 2 more and that should give me Time enough to see if it works I don&#x27;t see any real improvement</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had it long to tell for sure .</li>
            <li>and I really like the results I see.</li>
            <li>I recommend this cream to anyone that wants firmer looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I ordered one bottle and didn&#x27;t see much results ....</li>
            <li>Nothing really.  </li>
            <li>I also liked how fast this product shipped out and reached me in a few days since I live in Hawaii.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell of the product</li>
            <li>It also have a decent scent.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The areas that I wanted the most help with was my butt, so thatâ€™s the area that I started applying the cream a few times a day.</li>
            <li>I think all cellulite creams are pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks firmer and my cellulite is becoming less noticeable.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong</li>
            <li>I rubbed it on my thighs and really anywhere above my knee on my legs.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this Cellulite Firming Cream from LeBlanc WellBeing for anyone who wants to get rid of their cellulite.</li>
            <li>I have 3 kids, and recently lost 40+ pounds and feel like I am ready to be in a bikini</li>
            <li>Wow, my skin is starting to look amazing after just a few short days</li>
            <li>To me, that tingle means that it&#x27;s doing some kind of slow magic behind my legs</li>
            <li>This is a very thin cream which works perfect for me because I don&#x27;t like heavy creams.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it doesn&#x27;t stink and it leaves a cool feeling for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I take a shower at night, use a dry brush to get my skin ready for the cream, then apply the cream.</li>
            <li>First of all it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling sticky like other creams.  </li>
            <li>I truly believe it&#x27;s going to work wonders on these sweet little dimples!</li>
            <li>Makes skin soft, not sure I&#x27;ve seen much difference in cellulite.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days now and truly feel a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see what a few weeks will do to make my cellulite disappear and make my skin smoother.</li>

            <li> , that is how bad it was.</li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t worked for me.  very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Like most women out there, after having 3 kids I have some areas that could use some toning up.  I have never tried a Cellulite cream before and saw this cream was being offered at a great promotional price. After about a week of using, i have noticed some areas tight in up from the cream.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a your skin feeling sticky and it rubs in very well.&lt;br /&gt;Other than the smell, this is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this cream and I am really excited for the results.  I have received this product at a great price for my complete and honest review.  I have been using this cream for 1 week and I&#x27;m liking it. This is a very thin cream which works perfect for me because I don&#x27;t like heavy creams. It also has a light scent to it, the scent doesn&#x27;t linger, it goes away. It also has a slight tingle when I put this cream on, not stinging or uncomfortable, just a slight tingle. To me, that tingle means that it&#x27;s doing some kind of slow magic behind my legs and it&#x27;s working. It&#x27;s really too soon to tell because my cellulite hasn&#x27;t disappeared, but I can feel that this cream is doing something good. I&#x27;ve purchased other products for cellulite and it just felt like I was putting lotion on, this cream is completely different from that.  I&#x27;m being patient and will be faithful in applying this cream in the areas that I want to improve. I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days now and truly feel a difference in my skin. I know that it is going to take a few weeks to really see the difference, but the skin on my thighs and bum feels moist and tight. The smell is a little strong but you get used to it. Even though I got in on a promtion and paid a little less, this is worth every bit of $25. Great deal! I rub this on after my shower in the morning and before bed at night. I truly believe it&#x27;s going to work wonders on these sweet little dimples! Will report back with a pic of my bum soon... ðŸ˜œ</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like to exercise but want my legs to look good. I&#x27;ve been losing weight but there&#x27;s still some areas that don&#x27;t look great to me. So when I was offered this Cellulite Firming Cream from LeBlanc WellBeing for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I ordered a jar immediately! It arrived and I instantly started using it. I think it&#x27;s more like a gel than a cream, but either way it&#x27;s very refreshing on my skin. I rubbed it on my thighs and really anywhere above my knee on my legs. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and my legs feel great! They are smoother and softer and they look great! No big dimple looking craters lol. There&#x27;s still some signs of cellulite, but it&#x27;s not as defined. I definitely recommend this Cellulite Firming Cream from LeBlanc WellBeing for anyone who wants to get rid of their cellulite.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought other cellulite creams from Amazon and I think this one works much better. I had some stretch marks that were growing and red and using this cream they we no longer red! You need to drink plenty of water to help it work, but I love water so this is not a problem for me. I haven&#x27;t used it twice a day every day and have already seen improvement in less than a week. Definetly going to continue using this. Great moisture where I apply it.</li>
            <li> I have 3 kids and I want firmer looking skin now. I just started using this cellulite firming cream and I really like the results I see. I like that the cream absorbs into my skin quickly. It actually makes my skin a bit shinny also. I take a shower at night, use a dry brush to get my skin ready for the cream, then apply the cream. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing more results with this cream the longer I use this. I really like the light scent of this cream, I like scents that are light and not too powerful. I like also that a little bit of cream goes a long ways. I have used this cream for a bit and it still looks like I have a lot left in the jar. I recommend this cream to anyone that wants firmer looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product at a discount for giving my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I ordered one bottle and didn&#x27;t see much results .... Decided I should order 2 more and that should give me Time enough to see if it works I don&#x27;t see any real improvement but my skin is a lot softer. Will finish out these two bottles and that&#x27;s probably it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long to tell for sure . I think its a good product</li>
            <li> I have 3 kids, and recently lost 40+ pounds and feel like I am ready to be in a bikini, that was until I put one on and saw all the stretch marks, saggy skin, blemishes, cellulite, ugh I couldnâ€™t stand it. I have been trying all kinds of creams, and then I got an amazing opportunity. I got to try the Cellulite Firming Cream for a great price for my honest feedback! I was so excited to be trying this great cream. The areas that I wanted the most help with was my butt, so thatâ€™s the area that I started applying the cream a few times a day. Wow, my skin is starting to look amazing after just a few short days, I cant wait to see what I am going to look like. I love this cream, not only is it working miracles on me but its not at all greasy and absorbs right into my skin, and the smell is to die for. Thank you LeBlanc WellBeing for making a product that WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell of the product but it doesn&#x27;t smell horrible. I do see a difference in my thighs from using this product. My skin feels and looks firmer and my cellulite is becoming less noticeable. Overall I do feel like this is a decent product for anything looking to get cellulite to appear less and for your skin to be firmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased, honest review.</li>
            <li> Obviously the people that are writing good reviews had some kind of discount or free product for trying it.  This burns your skin if you have sensitive skin, do not use, it turned my skin bright red and irritated it a lot.  People were asking me why my legs were so red, that is how bad it was.</li>
            <li> Makes skin soft, not sure I&#x27;ve seen much difference in cellulite. Runs out quick, need bigger jar, pump would be better.</li>
            <li> It really works I just there was more product because then it becomes kind of pricey to keep using it.  But I did see a huge difference on my thighs and abdomen.  cellulite has diminished and my skin feels firmer.  I just ordered another container.</li>
            <li> Have not noticed any change.</li>
            <li> I put this cream on my upper arms and could feel it firming the area almost immediately.  It feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li> I could not tell any difference in my skin after one jar. I would like to continue with another jar just to give it a fair chance but not at $25 a jar. Honestly after skin looses its elasticity I really feel like there&#x27;s nothing that&#x27;s going to shrink skin back without surgery.</li>
            <li> Great cream, can feel it tingling.&lt;br /&gt;After a few applicationa skin felt tighter and firmer.</li>
            <li> Love this and it works so well my daughter uses it now.</li>
            <li> No skin irritation. Seems like a good product. Worth a try</li>
            <li> This product has definitely been formulated to drastically reduce the appearance of cellulite with firmer, tighter looking skin. My skin&#x27;s youthfulness has taken a time train and gone back about 10years!  I have witnessed the diminishing appearance of dimples. And all with a risk free obligation! So what did I have to lose? Nothing really.  As promised it dramatically reduces the appearance of cellulite, smoothes the look of deep furrows and striations, while fading the appearance of purple and red discoloration.  As you can tell I am a very happy camper right now!</li>
            <li> I have used this now for several days. I was Leary but I honestly think I see a difference it goes on easy and once dry isn&#x27;t noticeable it does have a bit of an odor but after it&#x27;s applied I no longer notice it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but I don&#x27;t notice a big difference.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I ordered this cream, but am glad I decided to try it.  I can say that I saw improvement after only a few applications.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what a few weeks will do to make my cellulite disappear and make my skin smoother.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost 2 weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement yet. On the plus side, it doesn&#x27;t stink and it leaves a cool feeling for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;m noticing a difference after a short time.</li>
            <li> This cellulite firming cream is awesome I use it on my legs. I thought that I wasnt going to like the smell but it actually smells good. A little of this cellulite firming cream from  LeBlanc WellBeing goes a long way. I also use it on my breast for my stretch marks.  Its been about a week and I can see it looks better. I also liked how fast this product shipped out and reached me in a few days since I live in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> I used twice a day and did not see any change to my skins texture. I even purchased cellulite massager.</li>
            <li> Works as described. Thanks:)</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tested the cream for 5 days now. First of all it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling sticky like other creams.  We also feel definite skin toning in the areas that we&#x27;ve applied it to. Well worth the money. We highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Too soon for an accurate evaluation.  I will continue using and order more of the cream.</li>
            <li> I think all cellulite creams are pretty much the same. The best thing about this one is that it spreads on really nice &amp; dries quickly. It also have a decent scent.</li>
