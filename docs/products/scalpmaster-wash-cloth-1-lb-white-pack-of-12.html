            <li>nice product for the price..slightly thinner than dept. store shares</li>
            <li>Nice size</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want overly soft or fluffly, so they were perfect for what i needed</li>
            <li>very light weight</li>
            <li>i use to find what i wanted at ka mart many years ago at that time</li>
            <li>thread tend to fall apart in the wash, but generally pleased for the price.</li>
            <li>I use 3-5 of these per day in her care and am glad I found them at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>How many more words do they need to say that?</li>
            <li>3 more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking of buying more and just storing them in my linen closet against the day that something happens....</li>
            <li>I received my order and I just love the wash clothes.</li>
            <li>The receiver of this stack of wash cloths was pleased and grateful.</li>
            <li>Glad I got it.</li>
            <li>Glad to have found these on-line:) Might get some more soon.</li>
            <li>Returned as soon as I was able to touch them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;because</li>
            <li>to Target and got twice as many in much better quality for about 60% of the price.</li>
            <li>Perfect complement to Proactiv Facial Cleanser users.  </li>
            <li>, I would like to order more soon.</li>
            <li>These are soft all around, a good weight, dries faster than the heavier ones, and surprisingly good quality.</li>
            <li>I will reorder, for sure.</li>
            <li>I have had shop rags with more softness.</li>
            <li>I love these towels.</li>
            <li>more purchases of this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not fancy and you wouldn&#x27;t put them out for show or give them to house guests, but they&#x27;re wonderful shower washcloths for personal use.</li>
            <li>nice clean washcloths</li>
            <li>pretty good quality</li>
            <li>By the time I need it, to wipe off foam or clean up some part of my face, it&#x27;s pleasantly scented without being overpowering and leaves me smelling barber shop fresh.</li>
            <li>the positive side, they are a good size.</li>
            <li>Holds soap well, feels good on the body and rinses fast.  </li>
            <li>But they wear out very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to bleach.</li>
            <li>Those from a few years ago are still wonderful, didn&#x27;t shrink, and I wanted more to have extras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are good, quality, decent sized wash clothes.</li>
            <li>For the price, 12 clothes suited me fine.</li>
            <li>Quality and price fine.</li>
            <li>I particularly wanted white wash clothes to be sure I got all my makeup off, and these wash cloths are perfect.</li>
            <li>but so far so good these are fine in my book.</li>
            <li>They are cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Great for facial, scrubbing, and washing.</li>
            <li>big,not too thick &amp; great for all types of cleaning,also at a very good price,wash and dry nice also,got a cleaning job get these</li>
            <li>/&gt;These aren&#x27;t worth the hassle of returning, but amazon!  </li>
            <li>Some are so bulky you can&#x27;t clean your ears.</li>
            <li>One super wash cloth would not have filled the need.</li>
            <li>To call this a wash cloth is a travesty, unless it was used to clean livestock or advertised as a defoliator.</li>
            <li>of course, the price was right!</li>
            <li>At first I thought that they may be too light, but I was mistaken, they are just fine</li>
            <li>Just note, they are QUITE abrasive and must be used gently, but i would def get them again. :)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need a full dozen so will use some for household cleanup.</li>
            <li>These are only good to be used as scrubbing rags around the house, garage or shop.</li>
            <li>THey were not bad but also not what i wanted , they were thinner than the ones you can buy with your bath towels and hand towels</li>
            <li>Not a bad product</li>
            <li>These wash cloths are pretty scratchy and would be fine for cleaning up around the house, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it on your face.</li>
            <li>They are adequate for the job I have for them, which is household rag.  </li>
            <li>very glad I chose these hand towels simple</li>
            <li>I was very happy with these as well as the towels we bought... not too thick, not too thin, perfect for the purpose I needed.</li>
            <li>Either reviewers rating these highly got washcloths far superior to mine, or their reviews are fraudulent.</li>
            <li>Originally i thought these were garbage because after first washing, strings were hanging off of them</li>
            <li>I had to go back and check to make sure I hadnt accidentally bought rags!  </li>
            <li>I love the new washcloths -- just the right size and thickness for my needs.</li>
            <li>I used to get an equivalent at a big box store but they substituted a kind that felt like they cut a wash cloth off of the hand towels.</li>
            <li>, just right.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re exceedingly scratchy right out of the bag, and I can read through them even before they&#x27;ve been washed, and (c)  </li>
            <li>At this price I&#x27;ll just buy a whole slew more when they wear out and use the old ones as rags.</li>
            <li>These are the same kind I was given to use when in hospital a decade ago, which pretty much took the skin off my face.  </li>
            <li>I wanted this pack of white wash clothes to replace some of my others in addition to having nice new ones for guests!  </li>
            <li>they made good rags, but little else.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>i may be back for more too</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how they after first washing.</li>
            <li>This stack of wash cloths was exactly what I ordered for this family in need.</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li>These Wash Clothes are very helpful!  </li>
            <li>There are many to be used gradually but you will always have enough!  </li>
            <li>Very truly!</li>
            <li>but they appear to be exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>These wash cloths are exactly that.</li>
            <li>cotton is soft, but the quality not as good as expected...</li>
            <li>I was mislead by the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>4/5 stars because they really shrank after the first wash.</li>
            <li>nice big  easy to clean with not too thick but</li>
            <li>when wet,  the fibers are quite long and do a great job washing.</li>
            <li>These towels were pure junk.</li>
            <li>They are thin, and not the softest but perfect on the daily for the hot summer days.</li>
            <li>The old ones were getting pretty worn out!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a great fan of blade shaving, both double and single edged, and without something to wipe up the water and, occasionally, the blood, these are the right size for all my shaving needs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased packets of wash clothes before and am usually fairly satisfied, however, these are rough and scratchy and really can&#x27;t be used as face clothes.  </li>
            <li>Paper towels are not much worse.  </li>
            <li>Description is very misleading.</li>
            <li>I was very dissappointed in this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Arrived in a very timely manner.  </li>
            <li>I got thanks</li>
            <li>Fast Ship.  </li>
            <li>Very inferior quality.  </li>
            <li>; Moisten with water; Wrap in foil and warm in low  oven heat - very low - for restaurant style &amp;#34;after dining on BBQ&amp;#34; type cleansing and freshing cloths.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Not very soft but durable and easy to wash.</li>
            <li>first time it was ok, but the second order was cheap, thin, some sheets are odd looking and good for one time use.</li>
            <li>the very soft ones don&#x27;t provide enough friction to get your skin really clean and gently exfoliated.</li>
            <li>They will make perfectly good cleaning rags, but I think the are a bit harsh for personal use.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these wash clothes.</li>
            <li>I wanted something a little softer but these are okay for the money</li>
            <li>Soft wipe moisture fix me so real</li>
            <li>real soft not hard on skin.</li>
            <li>Much more user friendly than the thick, big ones.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for my daughter who has a hard time wringing out thick ones and this one is perfect for her.</li>
            <li>My wife has advanced multiple sclerosis and I have been her only caretaker for years.  </li>
            <li>They look more like small shop towels.  </li>
            <li>I love these washcloths, simply because they are thin and great for cleaning little ears, and even big ones.  </li>
            <li>Not too heavy and easily usable.</li>
            <li>They are a little rough, which is a nice exfolient.</li>
            <li>Bigger, thicker ones require too much soap, and</li>
            <li>Not a fluffy, soft cloth.</li>
            <li>They have washed well so far and are just what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>they look like someone bleached out their old washcloths and then sent them to me.  </li>
            <li>Rated generously at first as three star only because of low price.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve read any of my other reviews about household items, I usually buy them through Amazon when I need something in the next couple of days, but don&#x27;t want to make a trip to the store if I can find it at a good price.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what was expected.  </li>
            <li>The products received have different labels and are somewhat different - but overall are pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>Thin, scratchy, large and cheap.  </li>
            <li>but they were stark white in color and looked were cheap in quality.</li>
            <li>They are just average washcloths, maybe even a little thinner than most.</li>
            <li>Ordered these as one part of a larger Xmas gift for my sister with a 2 month old baby.</li>
            <li>I ordered these to replace my old, dingy and scratchy wash cloths but these are no different...</li>
            <li>They were made out of thin material, but they work okay.</li>
            <li>These are not bright white but more of a dingy &amp;#34;well used&amp;#34; looking cloth.  </li>
            <li>They are rough and cheap and not surged like in the photo but folded over and sewn down.  </li>
            <li>Actually, I have two stacks of these; My housekeeper has the other batch in the kitchen where she does everything from strain pasta-when the strainer cannot be found-to clean up the minor messes that are part of any kitchen.</li>
            <li>I got these the other day and washed them and they are perfect sized, not too thick or too thin.  </li>
            <li>Uneven texture and even places that were so threadbare you could see right through them.</li>
            <li>These are a nice size, not too thick but still fluffy and absorbent.</li>
            <li>It really was not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By the time you wash the first few, you have a lot more!&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>now  there getting to old and falling apart , i wanted some that after using on your face you can squeeze out and dry and use for a day or so again  </li>
            <li>Wash &amp; dry well and are soft.</li>
            <li>cloth- went to Costco and got the real thing for 20% less</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t have the energy to exchange them, so I&#x27;m just going to keep them to wash my dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went</li>
            <li> nice product for the price..slightly thinner than dept. store shares</li>
            <li> Nice size</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want overly soft or fluffly, so they were perfect for what i needed</li>
            <li> very light weight</li>
            <li> i use to find what i wanted at ka mart many years ago at that time</li>
            <li> thread tend to fall apart in the wash, but generally pleased for the price.</li>
            <li> I use 3-5 of these per day in her care and am glad I found them at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> How many more words do they need to say that?</li>
            <li> 3 more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of buying more and just storing them in my linen closet against the day that something happens....</li>
            <li> I received my order and I just love the wash clothes.</li>
            <li> The receiver of this stack of wash cloths was pleased and grateful.</li>
            <li> Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Glad to have found these on-line:) Might get some more soon.</li>
            <li> Returned as soon as I was able to touch them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;because</li>
            <li> to Target and got twice as many in much better quality for about 60% of the price.</li>
            <li> Perfect complement to Proactiv Facial Cleanser users.  </li>
            <li> , I would like to order more soon.</li>
            <li> These are soft all around, a good weight, dries faster than the heavier ones, and surprisingly good quality.</li>
            <li> I will reorder, for sure.</li>
            <li> I have had shop rags with more softness.</li>
            <li> I love these towels.</li>
            <li> more purchases of this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not fancy and you wouldn&#x27;t put them out for show or give them to house guests, but they&#x27;re wonderful shower washcloths for personal use.</li>
            <li> nice clean washcloths</li>
            <li> pretty good quality</li>
            <li> By the time I need it, to wipe off foam or clean up some part of my face, it&#x27;s pleasantly scented without being overpowering and leaves me smelling barber shop fresh.</li>
            <li> the positive side, they are a good size.</li>
            <li> Holds soap well, feels good on the body and rinses fast.  </li>
            <li> But they wear out very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to bleach.</li>
            <li> Those from a few years ago are still wonderful, didn&#x27;t shrink, and I wanted more to have extras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are good, quality, decent sized wash clothes.</li>
            <li> For the price, 12 clothes suited me fine.</li>
            <li> Quality and price fine.</li>
            <li> I particularly wanted white wash clothes to be sure I got all my makeup off, and these wash cloths are perfect.</li>
            <li> but so far so good these are fine in my book.</li>
            <li> They are cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Great for facial, scrubbing, and washing.</li>
            <li> big,not too thick &amp; great for all types of cleaning,also at a very good price,wash and dry nice also,got a cleaning job get these</li>
            <li> /&gt;These aren&#x27;t worth the hassle of returning, but amazon!  </li>
            <li> Some are so bulky you can&#x27;t clean your ears.</li>
            <li> One super wash cloth would not have filled the need.</li>
            <li> To call this a wash cloth is a travesty, unless it was used to clean livestock or advertised as a defoliator.</li>
            <li> of course, the price was right!</li>
            <li> At first I thought that they may be too light, but I was mistaken, they are just fine</li>
            <li> Just note, they are QUITE abrasive and must be used gently, but i would def get them again. :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need a full dozen so will use some for household cleanup.</li>
            <li> These are only good to be used as scrubbing rags around the house, garage or shop.</li>
            <li> THey were not bad but also not what i wanted , they were thinner than the ones you can buy with your bath towels and hand towels</li>
            <li> Not a bad product</li>
            <li> These wash cloths are pretty scratchy and would be fine for cleaning up around the house, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it on your face.</li>
            <li> They are adequate for the job I have for them, which is household rag.  </li>
            <li> very glad I chose these hand towels simple</li>
            <li> I was very happy with these as well as the towels we bought... not too thick, not too thin, perfect for the purpose I needed.</li>
            <li> Either reviewers rating these highly got washcloths far superior to mine, or their reviews are fraudulent.</li>
            <li> Originally i thought these were garbage because after first washing, strings were hanging off of them</li>
            <li> I had to go back and check to make sure I hadnt accidentally bought rags!  </li>
            <li> I love the new washcloths -- just the right size and thickness for my needs.</li>
            <li> I used to get an equivalent at a big box store but they substituted a kind that felt like they cut a wash cloth off of the hand towels.</li>
            <li> , just right.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re exceedingly scratchy right out of the bag, and I can read through them even before they&#x27;ve been washed, and (c)  </li>
            <li> At this price I&#x27;ll just buy a whole slew more when they wear out and use the old ones as rags.</li>
            <li> These are the same kind I was given to use when in hospital a decade ago, which pretty much took the skin off my face.  </li>
            <li> I wanted this pack of white wash clothes to replace some of my others in addition to having nice new ones for guests!  </li>
            <li> they made good rags, but little else.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> i may be back for more too</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how they after first washing.</li>
            <li> This stack of wash cloths was exactly what I ordered for this family in need.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li> These Wash Clothes are very helpful!  </li>
            <li> There are many to be used gradually but you will always have enough!  </li>
            <li> Very truly!</li>
            <li> but they appear to be exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> These wash cloths are exactly that.</li>
            <li> cotton is soft, but the quality not as good as expected...</li>
            <li> I was mislead by the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> 4/5 stars because they really shrank after the first wash.</li>
            <li> nice big  easy to clean with not too thick but</li>
            <li> when wet,  the fibers are quite long and do a great job washing.</li>
            <li> These towels were pure junk.</li>
            <li> They are thin, and not the softest but perfect on the daily for the hot summer days.</li>
            <li> The old ones were getting pretty worn out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a great fan of blade shaving, both double and single edged, and without something to wipe up the water and, occasionally, the blood, these are the right size for all my shaving needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased packets of wash clothes before and am usually fairly satisfied, however, these are rough and scratchy and really can&#x27;t be used as face clothes.  </li>
            <li> Paper towels are not much worse.  </li>
            <li> Description is very misleading.</li>
            <li> I was very dissappointed in this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Arrived in a very timely manner.  </li>
            <li> I got thanks</li>
            <li> Fast Ship.  </li>
            <li> Very inferior quality.  </li>
            <li> ; Moisten with water; Wrap in foil and warm in low  oven heat - very low - for restaurant style &amp;#34;after dining on BBQ&amp;#34; type cleansing and freshing cloths.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Not very soft but durable and easy to wash.</li>
            <li> first time it was ok, but the second order was cheap, thin, some sheets are odd looking and good for one time use.</li>
            <li> the very soft ones don&#x27;t provide enough friction to get your skin really clean and gently exfoliated.</li>
            <li> They will make perfectly good cleaning rags, but I think the are a bit harsh for personal use.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these wash clothes.</li>
            <li> I wanted something a little softer but these are okay for the money</li>
            <li> Soft wipe moisture fix me so real</li>
            <li> real soft not hard on skin.</li>
            <li> Much more user friendly than the thick, big ones.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter who has a hard time wringing out thick ones and this one is perfect for her.</li>
            <li> My wife has advanced multiple sclerosis and I have been her only caretaker for years.  </li>
            <li> They look more like small shop towels.  </li>
            <li> I love these washcloths, simply because they are thin and great for cleaning little ears, and even big ones.  </li>
            <li> Not too heavy and easily usable.</li>
            <li> They are a little rough, which is a nice exfolient.</li>
            <li> Bigger, thicker ones require too much soap, and</li>
            <li> Not a fluffy, soft cloth.</li>
            <li> They have washed well so far and are just what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> they look like someone bleached out their old washcloths and then sent them to me.  </li>
            <li> Rated generously at first as three star only because of low price.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve read any of my other reviews about household items, I usually buy them through Amazon when I need something in the next couple of days, but don&#x27;t want to make a trip to the store if I can find it at a good price.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what was expected.  </li>
            <li> The products received have different labels and are somewhat different - but overall are pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> Thin, scratchy, large and cheap.  </li>
            <li> but they were stark white in color and looked were cheap in quality.</li>
            <li> They are just average washcloths, maybe even a little thinner than most.</li>
            <li> Ordered these as one part of a larger Xmas gift for my sister with a 2 month old baby.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to replace my old, dingy and scratchy wash cloths but these are no different...</li>
            <li> They were made out of thin material, but they work okay.</li>
            <li> These are not bright white but more of a dingy &amp;#34;well used&amp;#34; looking cloth.  </li>
            <li> They are rough and cheap and not surged like in the photo but folded over and sewn down.  </li>
            <li> Actually, I have two stacks of these; My housekeeper has the other batch in the kitchen where she does everything from strain pasta-when the strainer cannot be found-to clean up the minor messes that are part of any kitchen.</li>
            <li> I got these the other day and washed them and they are perfect sized, not too thick or too thin.  </li>
            <li> Uneven texture and even places that were so threadbare you could see right through them.</li>
            <li> These are a nice size, not too thick but still fluffy and absorbent.</li>
            <li> It really was not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By the time you wash the first few, you have a lot more!&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> now  there getting to old and falling apart , i wanted some that after using on your face you can squeeze out and dry and use for a day or so again  </li>
            <li> Wash &amp; dry well and are soft.</li>
            <li> cloth- went to Costco and got the real thing for 20% less</li>
            <li> These things, on the other hand, are both absorbent and just rough enough to be gently exfoliating.</li>
            <li> with out them going sour , when they hang in the bathroom and can not dry , they go sour failrly fast</li>
            <li> and I expect the pack to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Not as bulky as a full sized heavy material usually found in larger washcloths.</li>
            <li> and i like a less soft towel.</li>
            <li> Nice size, not too thick and not too thin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to rate these with only a single star because (a) they&#x27;re 11x11 inches, not 12x12 as stated, (b)</li>
            <li> Now hopefully they will hold up for a long time...</li>
            <li> They are coarse and not very absorbant</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve washed and dried them and had not trouble.</li>
            <li> The have some loose threads on the edges, but after being laundered there are no apparent flaws.</li>
            <li> They are very rough, thin, turn grey in one wash, and wear quickly.</li>
            <li> i do not think the the towels i received is the same towels in the photo, my towels has no softness and sharp corners.</li>
            <li> I do not even want to use it to dry my hands or swipe the kitchen.</li>
            <li> I dislike really big, soft, thick wash cloths.  </li>
            <li> NOT to thick and very soft!</li>
            <li> Maybe fine for a big man or an extremely dirty child, but women will find&lt;br /&gt;the rough texture unpleasant/</li>
            <li> Soft enough to wash your face &amp; tough enough to wash your pot &amp; pans.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize, although I should have, that these are spa sized towels, considerably larger than an average home washcloth.  </li>
            <li> At first they seem too flimsy and thin to be used for shower wash cloths.</li>
            <li> They were of good quality, thick enough but not too thick that it was difficult to hold.</li>
            <li> I like the texture ...not too coarse, not too fluffy.</li>
            <li> They are also rough on my skin.  </li>
            <li> These washclothes were just as I expected.  </li>
            <li> They have a rough texture, even when wet.  </li>
            <li> total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Rough texture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;O.K. for washing not much, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been looking for wash cloths that aren&#x27;t so cheap and thin but not too thick for ages.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the large, thick wash cloths that usually come with sets of towels.</li>
            <li> Course exfoliation is not good for every day (or ever if you have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> had gotten two other sets from somewhere else</li>
            <li> Very very rough material.  </li>
            <li> Very rough texture.  </li>
            <li> But what is more annoying: they are not absorbing water all all.</li>
            <li> A little rough feel.</li>
            <li> Do not order from this seller, and this item is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> The aren&#x27;t even good for cleaning since they shrink horribly.</li>
            <li> YOGA instructor uses these warmed and scented with Lavendar for us at wind down of class.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> They are stiff and rough.  </li>
            <li> But I think they should charge less money for them</li>
            <li> They are not very soft or thick.  </li>
            <li> The item I received looked nothing like the picture, as the wash cloths were very thin and had brown, yellow and blue stains on them.</li>
            <li> Save yourself some money and trouble and grab a couple packs of these.  </li>
            <li> The material is thin and will not last.  </li>
            <li> Then after I were washed and dried before I used them I realized they were stronger than I thought.</li>
            <li> amazon.com says I purchased a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I still have a few</li>
            <li> Very disappointed not even suitable to wash a car.</li>
            <li> Towels are larger than expected which is awkward.</li>
            <li> so harsh that it scratches the skin!</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m preparing my water for shaving I put in a small amount of after shave in it and then put the corner of one of these in the water.</li>
            <li> and I need a small towel to answer whatever the problem is; These will do it.</li>
            <li> Thin, rough fabric.</li>
            <li> Very surprised bad quality, thin, seethrouth woven pieces, crinkled seriously, not white, greyish color tone, yellow and brown bad yarn dots allover.  </li>
            <li> But unless some people are getting different cloths than others, these wash cloths are very poor quality.</li>
            <li> So hard and scratchy, I was not able to use them.</li>
            <li> I work in excavation, so needless to say I get pretty dirty and</li>
            <li> very poor quality, small and rough texture</li>
            <li> A washcloth that is not too plush or has scratchy decorative or hard, thick edges.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, thin, rough would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> but they are still to thick for me .</li>
            <li> A bit thin and small for any hard work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough bad things about them.  </li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t bad either but future buyers should know what they are getting.</li>
            <li> too expensive to be rags, don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
            <li> Thicker than cheap-o rags but not too thick!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I like thin washcloths.  </li>
            <li> The cloths are so thin you can see through them.</li>
            <li> These are thin and dingy.</li>
            <li> These wash cloths are so thin you can see through them.  </li>
            <li> and they said they were thin</li>
            <li> Too thin and scratchy for face cloths.  </li>
            <li> They were paper thin.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for thin but relatively-soft washcloths to use on my face.</li>
            <li> Thin but fluffs up after washing.</li>
            <li> I hate the synthetic puff balls all the rage today, and regular washcloths are too plushy and don&#x27;t drink up water well.</li>
            <li> The material is thin but that&#x27;s what I want for my purposes.</li>
            <li> They came dirty, hard, and scratchy.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find Bargains Today , but this Purchase was just that !</li>
            <li> Mass of uncut threads.</li>
            <li> Once washed I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Sorry guys.  </li>
            <li> It is sometimes difficult to find a wash cloth without buying a towel to go with it.</li>
            <li> These are very thin and flimsy wash clothes.</li>
            <li> These wash cloths are very thin.  </li>
            <li> These were just want i wanted very thin</li>
            <li> VERY THIN FOR A WASH CLOTH -USING</li>
            <li> They are small and I hate them.  </li>
            <li> these washcloths arrived dirty, dingy, and reeking of bleach.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t ever be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> horrible do not buy  like sandpaper ..</li>
            <li> Worst purchase made from Amazon.</li>
            <li> CRAP!!!</li>
            <li> Probably the worst product I&#x27;ve ever purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li> rips everywhere, terrible material.</li>
            <li> The cloths were terrible!</li>
            <li> These are terrible!  </li>

            <li> Exactly as described.  I work in excavation, so needless to say I get pretty dirty and these cloths are perfect for getting all the dirt and grime off.</li>
            <li> I use these in the shower to wash my body. very light weight when wet,  the fibers are quite long and do a great job washing. I will not buy another brand of wash clothes ever again.</li>
            <li> horrible do not buy  like sandpaper .. and i like a less soft towel.</li>
            <li> I love the new washcloths -- just the right size and thickness for my needs.</li>
            <li> i do not think the the towels i received is the same towels in the photo, my towels has no softness and sharp corners.</li>
            <li> These are a great wash cloth for the price! I love them! I go through a lot of wash cloths and these are an excellent buy!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for wash cloths that aren&#x27;t so cheap and thin but not too thick for ages.  I got these the other day and washed them and they are perfect sized, not too thick or too thin.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Now hopefully they will hold up for a long time...only time will tell.  Updating review to add that after all this time they have still held up nicely.</li>
            <li> THey were not bad but also not what i wanted , they were thinner than the ones you can buy with your bath towels and hand towels but they are still to thick for me . i use to find what i wanted at ka mart many years ago at that time i bough 4 doz . now  there getting to old and falling apart , i wanted some that after using on your face you can squeeze out and dry and use for a day or so again  with out them going sour , when they hang in the bathroom and can not dry , they go sour failrly fast</li>
            <li> Originally i thought these were garbage because after first washing, strings were hanging off of them E-VER-Y-WHERE….I cut them off and figured i&#x27;d have to do so after each washing. But to my pleasant surprise, they were just fine! I use 1-2 each day for face washing and am very pleased! Just note, they are QUITE abrasive and must be used gently, but i would def get them again. :)</li>
            <li> what can you say they are good face cloths</li>
            <li> I ordered these wash cloths for my mother to use in our guest bathroom. When they came I cracked up, I ordered my mother kitchen rags!  It&#x27;s my fault as I should&#x27;ve realized that &amp;#34;scalp master&amp;#34; is probably a medical brand of cloths....they&#x27;re pretty good quality if you don&#x27;t plan to use them as face cloths.  4/5 stars because they really shrank after the first wash.</li>
            <li> cotton is soft, but the quality not as good as expected...thread tend to fall apart in the wash, but generally pleased for the price.</li>
            <li> My wife has advanced multiple sclerosis and I have been her only caretaker for years.  I use 3-5 of these per day in her care and am glad I found them at Amazon.  For my usage they are as good it gets.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I like thin washcloths.  Some are so bulky you can&#x27;t clean your ears.</li>
            <li> i no towel expert but so far so good these are fine in my book. i just needed a good size washcloth that i can use in the shower and these will do. and theyre affordable so i dont mind. i dont need any fancy 7000 thread towel from saturn. just something basic and i got it with this. i may be back for more too</li>
            <li> Wash &amp; dry well and are soft.</li>
            <li> These are just fine and for the price, a great deal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the large, thick wash cloths that usually come with sets of towels. I buy my towels by the piece and keep a stock of white wash cloths on the shelf for daily use. I purchased two dozen of these washcloths to replace some I bought 17 years ago. The old ones were getting pretty worn out! These are a nice size, not too thick but still fluffy and absorbent. Best of all, the price is very affordable.</li>
            <li> perfect for many purpose around the house.</li>
            <li> These are cheap and the perfect size.  I dislike really big, soft, thick wash cloths.  Bigger, thicker ones require too much soap, and the very soft ones don&#x27;t provide enough friction to get your skin really clean and gently exfoliated. When it comes to wash cloths, I think it is one of those cases where the cheaper route also happens to be the optimal route.  Save yourself some money and trouble and grab a couple packs of these.  If you must, save the one or two &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; wash cloths you probably have from towel sets and gifts for those times when you have picky guests.</li>
            <li> Got these to shower up at the gym. The have some loose threads on the edges, but after being laundered there are no apparent flaws. I like the texture ...not too coarse, not too fluffy. I didn&#x27;t need a full dozen so will use some for household cleanup.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my bathrooms. How many more words do they need to say that? 3 more, I guess.</li>
            <li> nice clean washcloths</li>
            <li> These wash cloths are pretty scratchy and would be fine for cleaning up around the house, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it on your face.</li>
            <li> These are very thin and flimsy wash clothes. They are also rough on my skin.  Paper towels are not much worse.  It really was not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, they are a good size.</li>
            <li> so harsh that it scratches the skin!</li>
            <li> These washclothes were just as I expected.  Nice size, not too thick and not too thin, just right.  I&#x27;ll be having 7 house guests soon and needed extra.  Good product description.</li>
            <li> These wash cloths are described as one hundred per cent cotton yet what I received were 86/14 polyester/cotton. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Soft enough to wash your face &amp; tough enough to wash your pot &amp; pans.  Nice product.</li>
            <li> These wash cloths feel like sandpaper.  They are stiff and rough.  The material is thin and will not last.  They are cheaply made.  Would not recommend to anyone.  Will use them for rags.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize, although I should have, that these are spa sized towels, considerably larger than an average home washcloth.  They are adequate for the job I have for them, which is household rag.  They work great.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t even make good polishing rags. They are coarse and not very absorbant so I just threw them in the garage in the rag bin and used  them to wipe off grease etc from my bikes.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed not even suitable to wash a car. Poor quality, thin, rough would not recommend to anyone. Description is very misleading.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with these as well as the towels we bought... not too thick, not too thin, perfect for the purpose I needed.</li>
            <li> I was very dissappointed in this purchase.  The cloths are so thin you can see through them. Plus they aren&#x27;t 100% cotton!</li>
            <li> big,not too thick &amp; great for all types of cleaning,also at a very good price,wash and dry nice also,got a cleaning job get these</li>
            <li> I would use these to change or check my oil, but that&#x27;s it. But I don&#x27;t think they soak up anything. They are almost abrasive. Who the heck would use these to wash their bodies? I was mislead by the positive reviews. But unless some people are getting different cloths than others, these wash cloths are very poor quality. Do not be a fool. They suck.</li>
            <li> They were made out of thin material, but they work okay.</li>
            <li> A little rough feel. We&#x27;ll see how they after first washing. Also will see what longevity is in our rental property.</li>
            <li> A stack of these sits by the basin on my vanity. I&#x27;m a great fan of blade shaving, both double and single edged, and without something to wipe up the water and, occasionally, the blood, these are the right size for all my shaving needs. As I&#x27;m preparing my water for shaving I put in a small amount of after shave in it and then put the corner of one of these in the water. By the time I need it, to wipe off foam or clean up some part of my face, it&#x27;s pleasantly scented without being overpowering and leaves me smelling barber shop fresh. Actually, I have two stacks of these; My housekeeper has the other batch in the kitchen where she does everything from strain pasta-when the strainer cannot be found-to clean up the minor messes that are part of any kitchen. I&#x27;m thinking of buying more and just storing them in my linen closet against the day that something happens....and I need a small towel to answer whatever the problem is; These will do it.</li>
            <li> excellent quality of face cloths, great in the wash machine as well</li>
            <li> I received my order and I just love the wash clothes. I&#x27;m using one on them now. Good item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a blessed day.</li>
            <li> I am a 24/7 caregiver and they work quite well for what I needed. Not as bulky as a full sized heavy material usually found in larger washcloths.</li>
            <li> One super wash cloth would not have filled the need. This stack of wash cloths was exactly what I ordered for this family in need. The receiver of this stack of wash cloths was pleased and grateful.</li>
            <li> I wanted something a little softer but these are okay for the money and I will find use for them.</li>
            <li> Have been looking for these types of wash cloths, finally found it here. Great for facial, scrubbing, and washing. Thanks</li>
            <li> very poor quality, small and rough texture</li>
            <li> These are thin and dingy.</li>
            <li> Very very rough material.  I use them for dust rags.</li>
            <li> These wash cloths are so thin you can see through them.  They wouldn&#x27;t even make a good cleaning rag. The picture makes them appear good quality but they are not.  They are the poorest quality I have found anywhere.</li>
            <li> Way overrated as five star. Mass of uncut threads. Shapes from squares to trapezoids. Should be described by Amazon as \\&quot;seconds\\&quot;, instead of \\&quot;Deluxe\\&quot;. Rated generously at first as three star only because of low price.  After using the washcloths, I lower my rating to one star. They are very rough, thin, turn grey in one wash, and wear quickly. If could have returned for refund including shipping and cost to return, would have done so. Gave rest of stack away for use as rags. Worst purchase made from Amazon. Either reviewers rating these highly got washcloths far superior to mine, or their reviews are fraudulent.</li>
            <li> These wash cloths are very thin.  I bought them to wash my husband.  They do the job, and I can throw them away.  This is my second order.</li>
            <li> CRAP!!! I use these as rags now...</li>
            <li> Probably the worst product I&#x27;ve ever purchased from Amazon. So hard and scratchy, I was not able to use them. Uneven texture and even places that were so threadbare you could see right through them. These towels were pure junk. We just threw them away.</li>
            <li> These were just want i wanted very thin but i wanted texture to exfoliate my face.  These are perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I had gotten two other sets from somewhere else and they said they were thin but they were not.  These are perfect just what i wanted.</li>
            <li> Nice to have so many on hand for a good price. The quality is about what you&#x27;d expect for the cost. Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> These are really nice wash clothes. I used to get an equivalent at a big box store but they substituted a kind that felt like they cut a wash cloth off of the hand towels. Glad to have found these on-line:) Might get some more soon.</li>
            <li> Good for the price. But they wear out very quickly.</li>
            <li> For the price, 12 clothes suited me fine. They are thin, and not the softest but perfect on the daily for the hot summer days.</li>
            <li> Washed them as soon as they came in and they already have strings pulling apart. I plan on using for cleaning so it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> they made good rags, but little else.  Too thin and scratchy for face cloths.  Not at all what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what was expected.  I didn&#x27;t want overly soft or fluffly, so they were perfect for what i needed</li>
            <li> Arrived in a very timely manner.  Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The quality of the wash cloths are very good. At first they seem too flimsy and thin to be used for shower wash cloths. Then after I were washed and dried before I used them I realized they were stronger than I thought.</li>
            <li> Returned as soon as I was able to touch them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;because they felt like cheese cloth- went to Costco and got the real thing for 20% less</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Do not order from this seller, and this item is not worth the price. Ordered these as one part of a larger Xmas gift for my sister with a 2 month old baby. The item I received looked nothing like the picture, as the wash cloths were very thin and had brown, yellow and blue stains on them. I honestly don&#x27;t have the energy to exchange them, so I&#x27;m just going to keep them to wash my dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went to Target and got twice as many in much better quality for about 60% of the price.</li>
            <li> nice big  easy to clean with not too thick but not too then just right for what I needed them for best ones I got thanks</li>
            <li> Crappy towels. wouldnt buy again. rips everywhere, terrible material. will last 2 washes</li>
            <li> Scalpmaster is a good name for these cloths. The cloths were terrible! They were paper thin. I would have been embarrassed to have them hanging in my bathroom  - I felt as though I had been scalped by buying them. I had to send them back</li>
            <li> At first I thought that they may be too light, but I was mistaken, they are just fine and I expect the pack to last a long time.</li>
            <li> nice product for the price..slightly thinner than dept. store shares but we like them and would probably buy again</li>
            <li> Love these wash cloths!  They are so cheap in price, I can use them for anything!!  And not worry about anything!  Great quality, Great seller!!</li>
            <li> no problems/nice product</li>
            <li> Great value and product.  Perfect complement to Proactiv Facial Cleanser users.  Any benzoyl peroxide based facial and/or body cleanser...white cleansing towels are a must.  2nd purchase with this seller and they last and last.  Very good exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;Another use for another batch of these white towels:  Roll 1st; Moisten with water; Wrap in foil and warm in low  oven heat - very low - for restaurant style &amp;#34;after dining on BBQ&amp;#34; type cleansing and freshing cloths.&lt;br /&gt;My YOGA instructor uses these warmed and scented with Lavendar for us at wind down of class.&lt;br /&gt;Very verstatile and excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Holds soap well, feels good on the body and rinses fast.  I highly recommend these wash clothes.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Once washed I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> Perfect for kitchen use.</li>
            <li> I like these.  Not too heavy and easily usable.</li>
            <li> These Wash Clothes are very helpful!  There are many to be used gradually but you will always have enough!  By the time you wash the first few, you have a lot more!&lt;br /&gt;They are very comfortable and they do their job!  We&#x27;ve had no problem with them.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve washed and dried them and had not trouble.</li>
            <li> Very surprised bad quality, thin, seethrouth woven pieces, crinkled seriously, not white, greyish color tone, yellow and brown bad yarn dots allover.  I have to return them.  I do not even want to use it to dry my hands or swipe the kitchen.</li>
            <li> Towels are larger than expected which is awkward. But what is more annoying: they are not absorbing water all all. Could not return it so I&#x27;m stuck with them...</li>
            <li> These wash cloths look nothing like the picture.  They are rough and cheap and not surged like in the photo but folded over and sewn down.  They are small and I hate them.  They look more like small shop towels.  I kept them only because I was having company and needed something.</li>
            <li> Scalpmaster Wash cloths are good fabric I like it, I would like to order more soon. Very truly! Mary</li>
            <li> The picture showed that they should have rounded corners which I needed to do crocheted edges on.  They arrived  and were squared corners, so instead of returning them, I just donated to a charity</li>
            <li> Fast Ship.  Quality Product</li>
            <li> From the picture i thought they were cream in color but they were stark white in color and looked were cheap in quality.</li>
            <li> Very cheep, non fluffy towels using them as rags not a face cloth. too expensive to be rags, don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
            <li> wonderful hand towels - a joy to use - a great value very glad I chose these hand towels simple</li>
            <li> I was hoping for thin but relatively-soft washcloths to use on my face. These are like sandpaper despite several washings. I feel that the product description is misleading. Course exfoliation is not good for every day (or ever if you have sensitive skin). These are only good to be used as scrubbing rags around the house, garage or shop.</li>
            <li> I had bought these towels before (from another seller).  These are a bit smaller than I remember, but they are working well for me.&lt;br /&gt;And of course, the price was right!</li>
            <li> Not very soft but durable and easy to wash. They are what I was looking for (I use them as facial towels ONLY). I wouldn&#x27;t set these out for guests.</li>
            <li> Finally found it! A washcloth that is not too plush or has scratchy decorative or hard, thick edges. These are soft all around, a good weight, dries faster than the heavier ones, and surprisingly good quality. Five stars for a solid product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased packets of wash clothes before and am usually fairly satisfied, however, these are rough and scratchy and really can&#x27;t be used as face clothes.  They will make perfectly good cleaning rags, but I think the are a bit harsh for personal use.</li>
            <li> Sorry guys.  Very rough texture.  Maybe fine for a big man or an extremely dirty child, but women will find&lt;br /&gt;the rough texture unpleasant/</li>
            <li> Very inferior quality.  Thin, rough fabric.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter who has a hard time wringing out thick ones and this one is perfect for her.</li>
            <li> Thin, scratchy, large and cheap.  Returned them,</li>
            <li> These are good, quality, decent sized wash clothes. I like them. But I think they should charge less money for them</li>
            <li> These are good for the price.  Nice size and they do the job.  They have a rough texture, even when wet.  Not a fluffy, soft cloth.</li>
            <li> Perfect ply!  Delivered promptly.  Quite happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I wanted this pack of white wash clothes to replace some of my others in addition to having nice new ones for guests!  They&#x27;re perfect!!!</li>
            <li> good utility cloths for the price</li>
            <li> I bought these to use for removing my face cleaner twice daily. They are a little rough, which is a nice exfolient. They are also holding up well in the washer and dryer. I will reorder, for sure.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product twice. first time it was ok, but the second order was cheap, thin, some sheets are odd looking and good for one time use. total waste of money.  DON\\&quot;T buy this product. it is hit and miss.</li>
            <li> These washcloths are perfect. NOT to thick and very soft!</li>
            <li> They were of good quality, thick enough but not too thick that it was difficult to hold. The size of the cloth was good.</li>
            <li> I bought these for one of our infant classrooms at our daycare.  They are not very soft or thick.  They are just average washcloths, maybe even a little thinner than most.</li>
            <li> I have had shop rags with more softness. This product could be used to sand wood. To call this a wash cloth is a travesty, unless it was used to clean livestock or advertised as a defoliator.</li>
            <li> Rough texture. Not the best quality.</li>
            <li> Would like to have returned them but there was no paperwork with the shipment to use to make the return for credit.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted!! Perfect! I love these towels. They are the only ones I will ever buy. Customer service is 5 stars as well. You won&#x27;t ever be disappointed. Thank you for a wonderful product and superior service. 👍🏼 Barbarita</li>
            <li> I had to throw all of these away. They came dirty, hard, and scratchy. Even after washing them.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive. Thin but fluffs up after washing. For the price, very nice.</li>
            <li> Ordered this to make a project.  Have not used the cloths yet but they appear to be exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a washcloth with which I could wash body parts in the shower.  A bit thin and small for any hard work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;O.K. for washing not much, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more purchases of this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
            <li> I love these washcloths, simply because they are thin and great for cleaning little ears, and even big ones.  Much more user friendly than the thick, big ones.  They have washed well so far and are just what I was looking for.  At this price I&#x27;ll just buy a whole slew more when they wear out and use the old ones as rags.</li>
            <li> good cloth to use for face or body real soft not hard on skin.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve read any of my other reviews about household items, I usually buy them through Amazon when I need something in the next couple of days, but don&#x27;t want to make a trip to the store if I can find it at a good price. These wash cloths are exactly that. Quality and price fine.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not fancy and you wouldn&#x27;t put them out for show or give them to house guests, but they&#x27;re wonderful shower washcloths for personal use. I hate the synthetic puff balls all the rage today, and regular washcloths are too plushy and don&#x27;t drink up water well. These things, on the other hand, are both absorbent and just rough enough to be gently exfoliating. I like &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> Easy to bleach. I have 4 kids (three of them are boys and they make big messes) so these are my kitchen clean-up rags. Perfect thickness... Thicker than cheap-o rags but not too thick! Have been washed over and over with no fraying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to rate these with only a single star because (a) they&#x27;re 11x11 inches, not 12x12 as stated, (b) they&#x27;re exceedingly scratchy right out of the bag, and I can read through them even before they&#x27;ve been washed, and (c)  these are NOT the same washcloths amazon.com says I purchased a few years ago.  Those from a few years ago are still wonderful, didn&#x27;t shrink, and I wanted more to have extras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These aren&#x27;t worth the hassle of returning, but amazon!  Do something about your quality control.  These are terrible!  These are the same kind I was given to use when in hospital a decade ago, which pretty much took the skin off my face.  I still have a few (they sent me home with some to pad an incision).  I can&#x27;t say enough bad things about them.  The aren&#x27;t even good for cleaning since they shrink horribly.</li>
            <li> Received the wash clothes today. They are very nice and I would recommend them to all!!!!</li>
            <li> these washcloths arrived dirty, dingy, and reeking of bleach.  the have spots on them.  they look like someone bleached out their old washcloths and then sent them to me.  I had to go back and check to make sure I hadnt accidentally bought rags!  yikes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product twice. The products received have different labels and are somewhat different - but overall are pretty much the same. The material is thin but that&#x27;s what I want for my purposes. If you&#x27;re looking for a plush washcloth, keep looking.</li>
            <li> It is sometimes difficult to find a wash cloth without buying a towel to go with it. I particularly wanted white wash clothes to be sure I got all my makeup off, and these wash cloths are perfect. They also stay white after they&#x27;ve been washed!</li>
            <li> Soft wipe moisture fix me so real</li>
            <li> VERY THIN FOR A WASH CLOTH -USING FOR CLEANING</li>
            <li> Not a bad product but they are misrepresented and future buyers should know what they are getting. These are not bright white but more of a dingy &amp;#34;well used&amp;#34; looking cloth.  They stink when you get them too. These are not a &amp;#34;generous 12&amp;#34; x 12&amp;#34; but are closer to 9&amp;#34; x 9&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t need them for salon use but for house guests.  I wanted what was pictured and described.  I ordered these to replace my old, dingy and scratchy wash cloths but these are no different...just smaller.  I will admit these are softer than what I was replacing and have a sturdy border.  The price isn&#x27;t bad either but future buyers should know what they are getting.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and just what I wanted.  I use these instead of napkins and paper towels (for anything and everything you can think of).  I would definitely order these again.</li>
            <li> Perfect size- not to bulky and not threadbare like many of these you can get in&lt;br /&gt;bulk at the stores.</li>
            <li> This Wash Cloth is a Very Good product ! I had about run out of what I had , and saw this Product on Amazon ! I think that 12 Wash Clothes is a Great Bargain , and They are really good ! It is very hard to find Bargains Today , but this Purchase was just that ! A Great Bargain for Me !</li>
