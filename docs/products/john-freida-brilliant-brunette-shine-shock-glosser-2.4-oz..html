            <li>I love the way it feels and smells.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I put most of it on my ends, then apply excess to the roots.</li>
            <li>Keeps your hair shiny and healthy looking and for those with fine hair it helps with tangles.</li>
            <li>If you put it on your hair when soaking wet it works best.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair shiny, silky and free of static.  </li>
            <li>It works best in wet hair.  </li>
            <li>A tiny pea size amount rubbed between the palms is enough to give my hair beautiful sheen and a great fragrance all day.  </li>
            <li>The after style application makes a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I was so upset not to find it in local stores any more, but thrilled when I was able to get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This made my hair clump together in parts and appear greasy instead of smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>This is how I always use this product, and it always makes me look fabulous.</li>
            <li>It is light, you don&#x27;t feel your hair all greasy.</li>
            <li>Makes my wavy hair shiny, controlled, but still light and springy.  </li>
            <li>Might not work the same for everyone, but I&#x27;m a happy brunette.</li>
            <li>adds perfect shine to dull hair</li>
            <li>I use a lot of hair products and rotate favorites fairly often, so I do actually use this.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product,</li>
            <li>I have been looking for products that will help it to look healthy until it actually *becomes* healthy.</li>
            <li>After a couple of uses you start seeing the results with a nice healthy shine to your hair but nothing extreme.</li>
            <li>I have semi- fine long hair, and it makes it look healthy and strong while giving it the right amount of shine.</li>
            <li>It really reflects light well so</li>
            <li>and it frankly isn&#x27;t worth the money.   </li>
            <li>I have other things that make more shine, and this does weigh the hair down just a tad, but I think that&#x27;s good for me having fine hair</li>
            <li>Arrived exactly on time.  </li>
            <li>So, what&#x27;s the difference exactly?  </li>
            <li>(I think showering in the morning is more American, hence the invention of leave-in-conditioners?)  </li>
            <li>Go with the Luminous Glaze and enjoy soft, silky, and well-behaved hair.  </li>
            <li>Another bonus--the first two days after I used it, two people (one was my husband) asked me if I had colored my hair, which I had not.  </li>
            <li>This product does  exactly what it advertises -- brings shine to your hair.</li>
            <li>Used many products, but this one is the only one.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m blonde and i like the slightly darker tone the brilliant brunette gives my hair so that the layers show up more and the blonde has some depth to it.</li>
            <li>You get more in the bottle, and even though it takes an extra step during your shower, the results are really stunning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that it works the best on soaking wet hair, not towel dried.</li>
            <li>Great for touch ups before going out at night, but not good for all day wear.</li>
            <li>But for a straight, sleek flat ironed look...this stuff is magic.</li>
            <li>I use my fingers to get individual strands here and there, and then smooth my palms over my hair starting at the top of my ears.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find it for a long time.  </li>
            <li>When I shower in the morning, my hair feels dry and there&#x27;s static.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair super soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>This products works great with my very thick hair.</li>
            <li>Not to mention it was much cheaper</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also warn against curling hair after using this product b/c in my case, my hair won&#x27;t hold curl very well with this in it.  </li>
            <li>I have straight shoulder-length brown hair.</li>
            <li>they do so much to add body and shine.</li>
            <li>This brand of glosser really works.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- adds very noticeable shine and color dimension</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>Very silky.</li>
            <li>It does nothing good for my thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>If you are a morning-showerer, this gloss is a quick and easy way to tame those flyaways.  </li>
            <li>But a teeeny bit of Brunette Shine Shock (for those old enough, remember \\&quot;A little dab will do you\\&quot;) brings my hair back to wonderful life.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always getting compliments on my shiny, healthy dark brown hair and this product has a lot to do with it.  </li>
            <li>it helps it stay down more.</li>
            <li>I live in Texas so the humidity can really friz out your hair.</li>
            <li>If you want a nice, consistent shine for long dark hair, I would recommend you use the Luminous Glaze instead.  </li>
            <li>I always use it when my hair needs a high gloss look.  </li>
            <li>While this product does is not enough by itself to volumize and condition my fine, curly hair, it softens it in a way that nothing else I&#x27;ve tried seems to--and my bathroom vanity is crowded with different products I have bought for this purpose.  </li>
            <li>The new product is loaded with silicones.</li>
            <li>When you wash your hair at night, your roots have 8+ hours to replenish oil, so I normally wake up with soft, self-styling hair.  </li>
            <li>I specifically ordered this product in the packaging pictured because this is the old formulation of the glosser, rather than the new formulation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, the new formula, rather than the old formula as pictured, was shipped.</li>
            <li>You can avoid looking greasy if you stay far, far away from your roots.</li>
            <li>It only gets greasy if you use too much.</li>
            <li>I had a small tube of Brilliant Brunette that I had been using sparingly for the past 4 years and recently ran out.</li>
            <li>It always makes my natural hair color pop.</li>
            <li>Adds shine and makes my thick hair more manageable.</li>
            <li>I tried wet, dry, a little and a lot, and it never gave me good results.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- very slippery and easy to apply to hair, but a bit messy and can stain your skin if you aren&#x27;t careful</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to matter how little I used, the result was always the same (I have fine hair).    </li>
            <li>I have long straight hair, and I find that it helps me manage the frizz and flyaways all day.  </li>
            <li>I love this product but have had a hard time finding it at any local retailer or drug store.</li>
            <li>It does not work miracles, but when used along with John Frieda frizz ease leave in conditioner on my coarse, thick, wavy, hair, I notice improved texture, reduced frizz and tangles, and more shine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely a product to avoid if you&#x27;re trying to steer clear of silicone.</li>
            <li>It really did not provide the anti-frizz that I expected.</li>
            <li>the John Frieda Satan Shine and finally have control over the frizz this humid climate puts in my naturally curly hair.    </li>
            <li>shine is apparently all over hair, not just surfaces</li>
            <li>I use it in addition to my curl product to tame my curls and it adds just the right luster.  </li>
            <li>I have used the most expensive to the cheapest gloss and this is the only one that leaves my dry, thin, colored hair soft, smooth and very manageable.</li>
            <li>For those of us with thick full hair...</li>
            <li>I have dull, curly hair, and this stuff does a fairly decent job of brightening it up a bit, although it doesn&#x27;t quite live up to the hype on the package.</li>

            <li> Adds shine and makes my thick hair more manageable.</li>
            <li> I tried wet, dry, a little and a lot, and it never gave me good results.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- very slippery and easy to apply to hair, but a bit messy and can stain your skin if you aren&#x27;t careful</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to matter how little I used, the result was always the same (I have fine hair).    </li>
            <li> I have long straight hair, and I find that it helps me manage the frizz and flyaways all day.  </li>
            <li> I love this product but have had a hard time finding it at any local retailer or drug store.</li>
            <li> It does not work miracles, but when used along with John Frieda frizz ease leave in conditioner on my coarse, thick, wavy, hair, I notice improved texture, reduced frizz and tangles, and more shine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely a product to avoid if you&#x27;re trying to steer clear of silicone.</li>
            <li> It really did not provide the anti-frizz that I expected.</li>
            <li> the John Frieda Satan Shine and finally have control over the frizz this humid climate puts in my naturally curly hair.    </li>
            <li> shine is apparently all over hair, not just surfaces</li>
            <li> I use it in addition to my curl product to tame my curls and it adds just the right luster.  </li>
            <li> I have used the most expensive to the cheapest gloss and this is the only one that leaves my dry, thin, colored hair soft, smooth and very manageable.</li>
            <li> For those of us with thick full hair...</li>
            <li> I have dull, curly hair, and this stuff does a fairly decent job of brightening it up a bit, although it doesn&#x27;t quite live up to the hype on the package.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this glosser for 5 years now, it works on my thick but fine hair to tame the frizziness and give it shine and a soft hold.  </li>
            <li> Really enhances the natural shine and lifts highlights in dull brown hair!</li>
            <li> It either does nothing or makes my hair look greasy and awkwardly flat in some areas and poofy in the others.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hard a hard time finding it lately, so I&#x27;m glad to see it here.</li>
            <li> Plus, it really clung to the parts I applied, but the underlying hair looked dull.  </li>
            <li> It lasted quite a long time.</li>
            <li> It did not WOW me.</li>
            <li> I put quite a bit in my long thick hair and have not yet accidentally put too much or made it look greasy like some products do.</li>
            <li> But beware, it can be a bit heavy and gunky unless you water it down and REALLY spread it around.  </li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, be sure to use it sparingly or it will be heavy and weight your hair down.  </li>
            <li> (only apply to areas of hair you&#x27;ll see, like top layers of hair and ends)&lt;br /&gt;- adds a subtle shine to otherwise dull hair (not going to be as glossy as a mirror, but a slight shine)&lt;br /&gt;- does not volumize, soften, or texture hair (be careful, it can end up like styling wax if you don&#x27;t water it down)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to get out the shower, applythis gloss, then dry it with a blowdryer and hope it doesn&#x27;t rub off at night.  </li>
            <li> Dry hair?  </li>
            <li> I do notice the shine in it once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> Or, after the hair is dry, you can mix it with water in your hands and rub it through your hair, but if you don&#x27;t mix it with water it can be gummy.  </li>
            <li> i apply it to my damp hair after the shower and when its dry i go ahead and straighten my hair</li>
            <li> This product definitely made my hair shine and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used to have to wet my hair, blow dry it and then add in some type of glosser...which always ended up making my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair is black and I am always looking for that extra shine.</li>
            <li> and I used an amount just smaller than the size of a dime (sometimes even less).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even found that my hair is less greasy the next day when I use it...</li>
            <li> I have some grey and this product seems to tone down the grey and darken up the brown.</li>
            <li> after I style it (flat iron)-a little goes a long way, otherwise it can look greasy.</li>
            <li> I use the tiniest amount, a pea sized or even smaller (a little bit goes a VERY long way!).</li>
            <li> I have tried with wet hair, dry hair, both!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- thick, clear gel type that you slather on palms and apply to hair</li>
            <li> takes a while to apply in the shower, plus you have to work carefully</li>
            <li> I never use it on wet hair, I put a nickel sized amount in my palm and rub my hands together, then run my ends between my palms.</li>
            <li> This tube, when used about every day, can last me a few months.</li>
            <li> I use it when my hair is wet &amp;</li>
            <li> I usually use a tiny amount on wet hair and let it dry.</li>
            <li> In other words, I did not get the item that I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is labeled \\&quot;glosser\\&quot;, while the other is a \\&quot;glaze.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other shine products, and they all made my hair look stringy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at the store with the other Frieda products.  </li>
            <li> I use it with other volumizers, thermal protectors, and conditioners.  </li>
            <li> one thing - it doesn&#x27;t stay all day long, at least not on my long hair, so touch-ups are needed.</li>
            <li> I added a few drops of water to it when I applied it to dry hair.</li>
            <li> So I tried this Shine Shock Glosser... using a tiny amount when my hair is still damp adds a little shine, but if I use it when my hair is dry, it just makes my hair look greasy and makes it feel icky.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a hair product which would help tame the dry frizzies of winter.  </li>
            <li> It instantly changes my hair from looking dull to hydrated and shiny.</li>
            <li> a dark brown, shampoo like consistency</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s no longer sold in stores.</li>
            <li> The next morning, I noticed my hair felt thick and waxy.  </li>
            <li> will add slight volume without thickening or weighing down, softens like a conditioner, and tames flyways</li>
            <li> /&gt;- may stain your towels brown unless you rinse all of it out and use a black towel for hair only&lt;</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m looking for something less oily that I can wear all day.</li>
            <li> It seems expensive for such a small tube, but I only had to use a very tiny bit of it, even though I have long, very thick hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- apply to wet hair after getting out of shower, then follow up with usual styling process</li>
            <li> Depends on a few things...</li>
            <li> Put about a nickel size in the psalm of your hands, work ends to roots in your towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give you that greasy heavy look.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally thin, wavy and grey.  </li>
            <li> Due to medication I&#x27;ve been on for the past 2 years I&#x27;ve had trouble with seriously thinning hair</li>
            <li> this just leaves your hair feeling heavy and dull.</li>
            <li> I bought a small bottle of this years ago and still have it.</li>
            <li> I usually use it along with garnier frizz control serum.</li>
            <li> I have tried two bottles of this stuff over the past couple years...</li>
            <li> One small tube lasts a year for me.</li>
            <li> Brush through and style as usually.</li>
            <li> This is not the product I expected as I confused it with another John Frieda type of gloss, but I ended up liking this when I discovered it made my hair  </li>
            <li> I have hair that is about a quarter of an inch past my shoulders</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that within 6 hours of application, the areas of my hair that I applied the product to became oily and limp.</li>
            <li> then a small amount</li>
            <li> not sure how that works,</li>
            <li> My hair can look dull, drippy and</li>
            <li> I have thick curly/wavy hair and put about a nickel size dab in my palm just after getting out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> but I have a lot of hair which makes it look thick.</li>
            <li> I hate John Frieda&#x27;s products in general, but this one really sucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not a great product; just not for every hair type.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- a bit difficult to work into hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;- takes a mere minute to apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would be too expensive to apply this gloss to every bit of my mid-back length hair</li>
            <li> When you put the product on your fingers and rub, it has this weird texture.</li>
            <li> look like I had expensive highlights done.</li>
            <li> Impossible to find sometimes in my area.</li>
            <li> I happened to find it online and stocked up but it will be gone someday, too bad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A great item and looking for more boxes.my wife loves this product and using it three times a week in her hair.</li>
            <li> I specifically ordered this product in the packaging pictured because this is the old formulation of the glosser, rather than the new formulation. Although the products share the same name, they are different items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the new formula, rather than the old formula as pictured, was shipped. The new product is loaded with silicones. It feels like it, it looks like it, and it says so on the ingredients list, which is NOT the ingredients list on Amazon&#x27;s product page. In other words, I did not get the item that I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a product to avoid if you&#x27;re trying to steer clear of silicone. Moreover, you won&#x27;t get the one pictured or described here.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Adds shine and makes my thick hair more manageable. Impossible to find sometimes in my area. Not to mention it was much cheaper</li>
            <li> Fantastic product with a great price!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  I have thick curly/wavy hair and put about a nickel size dab in my palm just after getting out of the shower.  If you put it on your hair when soaking wet it works best.  The shine is fabulous, the curls look beautiful and makes for great second day hair also.</li>
            <li> I live in Texas so the humidity can really friz out your hair. On top of that, I have very fine hair. I take my showers at night and apply this product after I get out of the shower. My hair air drys overnight but it looks fantastic! I used to have to wet my hair, blow dry it and then add in some type of glosser...which always ended up making my hair look greasy. Now my hair looks healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> Brilliant Brunette is the best hair care product I have used. I was so upset not to find it in local stores any more, but thrilled when I was able to get it on Amazon. My hair can look dull, drippy and oh so want to be covered up. But a teeeny bit of Brunette Shine Shock (for those old enough, remember \\&quot;A little dab will do you\\&quot;) brings my hair back to wonderful life.   [[ASIN:B000GCZZZC John Frieda Brilliant Brunette Shine Shock, Leave On Perfecting Glosser 2.4 oz (68 g)]]</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find this products on store shelves anymore but I still love it!  I&#x27;m always getting compliments on my shiny, healthy dark brown hair and this product has a lot to do with it.  I always use it when my hair needs a high gloss look.  It really reflects light well so in pictures, my hair looks outstanding!  If you have thin hair, be sure to use it sparingly or it will be heavy and weight your hair down.  For those of us with thick full hair...you&#x27;ve got nothing to worry about.  I&#x27;d also warn against curling hair after using this product b/c in my case, my hair won&#x27;t hold curl very well with this in it.  But for a straight, sleek flat ironed look...this stuff is magic.</li>
            <li> I have straight shoulder-length brown hair. Due to medication I&#x27;ve been on for the past 2 years I&#x27;ve had trouble with seriously thinning hair and it is finally regrowing... I have been looking for products that will help it to look healthy until it actually *becomes* healthy. I love the John Frieda lines... they do so much to add body and shine. So I tried this Shine Shock Glosser... using a tiny amount when my hair is still damp adds a little shine, but if I use it when my hair is dry, it just makes my hair look greasy and makes it feel icky.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not a great product; just not for every hair type.</li>
            <li> It really did not provide the anti-frizz that I expected. It also made my hair look and feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Great for winter time.  Leaves hair shiny, silky and free of static.  Helps me get through the winter hair time.</li>
            <li> I use this along with the John Frieda Satan Shine and finally have control over the frizz this humid climate puts in my naturally curly hair.    [...]  rpvh@windstream.net  [...]</li>
            <li> I apply a dime-sized dab of this to my towel-dried hair after shampoo and conditioner.  It does add some shine and helps the hair look more moisturized.  My hair is naturally thin, wavy and grey.  I color it brunette and perm it every 6 months for fuller curls.  This product keeps the curls looking their best.  I do use a curl enhancer on top of this product but THIS is the product that produces the shine.</li>
            <li> This made my hair clump together in parts and appear greasy instead of smooth and shiny. I tried wet, dry, a little and a lot, and it never gave me good results.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this glosser for 5 years now, it works on my thick but fine hair to tame the frizziness and give it shine and a soft hold.  it doesn&#x27;t build up in your hair, you just brush and out it comes. i&#x27;m blonde and i like the slightly darker tone the brilliant brunette gives my hair so that the layers show up more and the blonde has some depth to it. one thing - it doesn&#x27;t stay all day long, at least not on my long hair, so touch-ups are needed.</li>
            <li> Best gloss ever. Why would John Freida discontinue a TOP product.  Hmmmm....</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly on time.  Five stars.</li>
            <li> This brand of glosser really works. I have used the most expensive to the cheapest gloss and this is the only one that leaves my dry, thin, colored hair soft, smooth and very manageable. Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased both this Shine Shock and the John Frieda Liquid Shine Luminous Glaze. [[ASIN:B000P9B3R0 John Frieda Brilliant Brunette Liquid Shine Luminous Color Glaze-6.5 oz (192 ml)]] I figured between the two of them, one should work out nicely.  This one is labeled \\&quot;glosser\\&quot;, while the other is a \\&quot;glaze.\\&quot;  So, what&#x27;s the difference exactly?  And which one should I buy?  Depends on a few things...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHOCK SHINE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- apply to wet hair after getting out of shower, then follow up with usual styling process&lt;br /&gt;- thick, clear gel type that you slather on palms and apply to hair&lt;br /&gt;- a bit difficult to work into hair (only apply to areas of hair you&#x27;ll see, like top layers of hair and ends)&lt;br /&gt;- adds a subtle shine to otherwise dull hair (not going to be as glossy as a mirror, but a slight shine)&lt;br /&gt;- does not volumize, soften, or texture hair (be careful, it can end up like styling wax if you don&#x27;t water it down)&lt;br /&gt;- does not add color&lt;br /&gt;- takes a mere minute to apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LIQUID SHINE GLAZER:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- in shower, shampoo and condition, then rub in glaze and keep in shower cap for 3-5 mins, then rinse&lt;br /&gt;- a dark brown, shampoo like consistency that you lather all over hair&lt;br /&gt;- very slippery and easy to apply to hair, but a bit messy and can stain your skin if you aren&#x27;t careful&lt;br /&gt;- shine is apparently all over hair, not just surfaces&lt;br /&gt;- adds very noticeable shine and color dimension&lt;br /&gt;- will add slight volume without thickening or weighing down, softens like a conditioner, and tames flyways&lt;br /&gt;- takes a while to apply in the shower, plus you have to work carefully&lt;br /&gt;- may stain your towels brown unless you rinse all of it out and use a black towel for hair only&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It depends on what you&#x27;re going for.  I take a shower at night and wash my hair every day (I have Japanese hair that produces it&#x27;s own oil), so putting this gloss in my hair is a pain.  I have to get out the shower, applythis gloss, then dry it with a blowdryer and hope it doesn&#x27;t rub off at night.  The next morning, I noticed my hair felt thick and waxy.  Plus, it really clung to the parts I applied, but the underlying hair looked dull.  It would be too expensive to apply this gloss to every bit of my mid-back length hair (the bottle is a bit larger than travel size).  If you want a nice, consistent shine for long dark hair, I would recommend you use the Luminous Glaze instead.  You get more in the bottle, and even though it takes an extra step during your shower, the results are really stunning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gloss would be great for people who shower in the morning.  When you wash your hair at night, your roots have 8+ hours to replenish oil, so I normally wake up with soft, self-styling hair.  When I shower in the morning, my hair feels dry and there&#x27;s static.  It just hasn&#x27;t had time to recover and re-condition itself.  (I think showering in the morning is more American, hence the invention of leave-in-conditioners?)  If you are a morning-showerer, this gloss is a quick and easy way to tame those flyaways.  But beware, it can be a bit heavy and gunky unless you water it down and REALLY spread it around.  It won&#x27;t moisture or soften your hair either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So depends on what type of hair/lifestyle you have.  Oily hair?  Shower and night?  Go with the Luminous Glaze and enjoy soft, silky, and well-behaved hair.  Dry hair?  Shower in the morning?  Have flyaways and frizz?  This Shine Shock is your better choice.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair but I have a lot of hair which makes it look thick. I&#x27;ve tried other shine products, and they all made my hair look stringy or greasy. This product smells great! I never use it on wet hair, I put a nickel sized amount in my palm and rub my hands together, then run my ends between my palms. I use my fingers to get individual strands here and there, and then smooth my palms over my hair starting at the top of my ears. You can avoid looking greasy if you stay far, far away from your roots. This is how I always use this product, and it always makes me look fabulous.</li>
            <li> It is light, you don&#x27;t feel your hair all greasy. What I don&#x27;t like is the fact that is a 3 pack. At times I just need one, because it lasts for over 4 or 5 months.</li>
            <li> I have dull, curly hair, and this stuff does a fairly decent job of brightening it up a bit, although it doesn&#x27;t quite live up to the hype on the package. It seems expensive for such a small tube, but I only had to use a very tiny bit of it, even though I have long, very thick hair. It lasted quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought a small bottle of this years ago and still have it. I like it enough to not have thrown it away. Keep in mind I use a lot of hair products and rotate favorites fairly often, so I do actually use this. I usually use a tiny amount on wet hair and let it dry. It only gets greasy if you use too much. I usually use it along with garnier frizz control serum. I have long, fine, curly hair. I do notice the shine in it once it&#x27;s dry. I have other things that make more shine, and this does weigh the hair down just a tad, but I think that&#x27;s good for me having fine hair it helps it stay down more.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Gives my hair a healthy and shiny appearance and smooths any frizzy ends.  I only wish the company would not have discontinued the product they used to carry exclusively for blondes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product to give my color-treated hair shine.  I use it in addition to my curl product to tame my curls and it adds just the right luster.  Wish I could find it in retail stores.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years now, with my greying hair it appears to return some color to it, plus a shine which is needed, won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  It makes my hair super soft and shiny.  I have long straight hair, and I find that it helps me manage the frizz and flyaways all day.  This tube, when used about every day, can last me a few months.</li>
            <li> I have tried two bottles of this stuff over the past couple years...and it frankly isn&#x27;t worth the money.   I hate John Frieda&#x27;s products in general, but this one really sucks. When you put the product on your fingers and rub, it has this weird texture. It does nothing good for my thick, wavy hair. I have tried with wet hair, dry hair, both! It either does nothing or makes my hair look greasy and awkwardly flat in some areas and poofy in the others.  DO NOT RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really work. the gloss that they have for use in the shower is a much better product and you get more for your money. this just leaves your hair feeling heavy and dull.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at the store with the other Frieda products.  I have not been able to find it for a long time.  I love this product.  A tiny pea size amount rubbed between the palms is enough to give my hair beautiful sheen and a great fragrance all day.  One small tube lasts a year for me.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a hair product which would help tame the dry frizzies of winter.  While this product does is not enough by itself to volumize and condition my fine, curly hair, it softens it in a way that nothing else I&#x27;ve tried seems to--and my bathroom vanity is crowded with different products I have bought for this purpose.  I use it with other volumizers, thermal protectors, and conditioners.  It works best in wet hair.  Or, after the hair is dry, you can mix it with water in your hands and rub it through your hair, but if you don&#x27;t mix it with water it can be gummy.  Another bonus--the first two days after I used it, two people (one was my husband) asked me if I had colored my hair, which I had not.  I have some grey and this product seems to tone down the grey and darken up the brown.</li>
            <li> Best hair product ever!  Makes my wavy hair shiny, controlled, but still light and springy.  Cannot find enough of it.</li>
            <li> After a couple of uses you start seeing the results with a nice healthy shine to your hair but nothing extreme. i apply it to my damp hair after the shower and when its dry i go ahead and straighten my hair and then you can see a nice shine to your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product but have had a hard time finding it at any local retailer or drug store.</li>
            <li> This products works great with my very thick hair. I love how shiny and sleak my hair looks after using this.</li>
            <li> I can not find this in stores anymore, so I was very very happy to find it on amazon. This is awesome stuff for you brunettes! Put about a nickel size in the psalm of your hands, work ends to roots in your towel dried hair. Brush through and style as usually. Doesn&#x27;t give you that greasy heavy look. Keeps your hair shiny and healthy looking and for those with fine hair it helps with tangles. Great hair product!</li>
            <li> This product does  exactly what it advertises -- brings shine to your hair. I purchased it in a grocery store when I was  on vacation in Oregon. I needed to find a replacement for a discontinued product I used for years.  Please don&#x27;t discontinue this item -- it works!</li>
            <li> This is not the product I expected as I confused it with another John Frieda type of gloss, but I ended up liking this when I discovered it made my hair  look like I had expensive highlights done. Might not work the same for everyone, but I&#x27;m a happy brunette.</li>
            <li> My hair is black and I am always looking for that extra shine. This product was just okay. It did not WOW me.</li>
            <li> adds perfect shine to dull hair</li>
            <li> I had a small tube of Brilliant Brunette that I had been using sparingly for the past 4 years and recently ran out. I could not find it anywhere in the store and was so worried it was a discontinued item! So relieved to find it on Amazon - of course. Leaves your hair silky and shiny and tames fly-aways. Really enhances the natural shine and lifts highlights in dull brown hair! Don&#x27;t know what I would do without it! I love the way it feels and smells. Doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue on your hands. Very silky.</li>
            <li> This product definitely made my hair shine and a little bit goes a long way. I have hair that is about a quarter of an inch past my shoulders and I used an amount just smaller than the size of a dime (sometimes even less). It works best on damp hair. I added a few drops of water to it when I applied it to dry hair. My biggest complaint is that within 6 hours of application, the areas of my hair that I applied the product to became oily and limp. Great for touch ups before going out at night, but not good for all day wear. It didn&#x27;t seem to matter how little I used, the result was always the same (I have fine hair).    Not a bad product, but I&#x27;m looking for something less oily that I can wear all day.</li>
            <li> The only glosser I will use. It does the job. Used many products, but this one is the only one.</li>
            <li> I think I will buy more! It does not work miracles, but when used along with John Frieda frizz ease leave in conditioner on my coarse, thick, wavy, hair, I notice improved texture, reduced frizz and tangles, and more shine. I put quite a bit in my long thick hair and have not yet accidentally put too much or made it look greasy like some products do.</li>
            <li> ..just as the name describes. I absolutely love this stuff. It always makes my natural hair color pop. I use it when my hair is wet &amp; then a small amount after I style it (flat iron)-a little goes a long way, otherwise it can look greasy. The after style application makes a huge difference in my hair. It instantly changes my hair from looking dull to hydrated and shiny. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s no longer sold in stores.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great, however I think it might be discontinued.  Quite alot of John Frieda gets discontinued, then we have to find something like it.  I happened to find it online and stocked up but it will be gone someday, too bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shine Shock for about 10 years! Literally! I have semi- fine long hair, and it makes it look healthy and strong while giving it the right amount of shine. I&#x27;ve found that it works the best on soaking wet hair, not towel dried. I use the tiniest amount, a pea sized or even smaller (a little bit goes a VERY long way!). I put most of it on my ends, then apply excess to the roots. It also can be used with another product without it getting greasy (i.e. root lifter). I&#x27;ve even found that my hair is less greasy the next day when I use it...not sure how that works, but I&#x27;m not complaining! I&#x27;ve hard a hard time finding it lately, so I&#x27;m glad to see it here. Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This did nothing for me.</li>
