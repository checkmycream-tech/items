            <li>The medium color is very light.</li>
            <li>I received a bunch of Mary Kay products as a gift and have enjoyed trying them out.  </li>
            <li>This product was ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s most definitely the best one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t have asked for better.  </li>
            <li>I love Marykay Cosmetics</li>
            <li>and I just love the coverage I get with this.</li>
            <li>I use it to cover breakouts and under eye circles and it does the trick better then any drug store concealer I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>This concealer is ok...</li>
            <li>pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li>she loved it and it got here super fast!  </li>
            <li>I have really dark circles and this is the best concealer out there!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more true to an ivory color.</li>
            <li>Great products especially the basics like wash, moisture, concealer and foundation.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy that this was delivered in only 4 days.</li>
            <li>The Concealer was way to Light for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>This shade is too light.</li>
            <li>and it was fantastic.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s almost too light for me.</li>
            <li>Love the product, came right away</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have super light skin</li>
            <li>The reason I love this concealer so much is because of the consistency of coverage.</li>
            <li>so i just use it for highlighting and it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for such a good price!</li>
            <li>°°° I highly recommend their foundation also:-)</li>
            <li>This is a great concealer if you have really dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of covering up dark circles.</li>
            <li>It also lasts a long time and is a good value for the money</li>
            <li>Whatever the reason, I ordered this on a whim and remember why I liked MK back when.</li>
            <li>But it wasn&#x27;t the right shade</li>
            <li>And it was the right shade.</li>
            <li>Too many of the concealers on the market today are very light and give little coverage.</li>
            <li>Coverage is decent, but there are far better products out there.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>And it seems to cover under eye circles and blemishes pretty well.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I have pale skin and dark circles, and this is the best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Covers anything up really really</li>
            <li>so it really brightens up my under eyes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>And fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I love the way it covers my dark circles under my eyes as well as any blemish that I may get</li>
            <li>Coverage it good, goes on kind of thick but doesn&#x27;t look thick or patchy on your skin.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>so I will need to try it a few more times but</li>
            <li>will last a LONG time!! :)</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>And wow!</li>
            <li>For anyone who has the slightest tan, this concealer would look very unnatural especially under the eyes.</li>
            <li>but I buy this because it&#x27;s light enough to cover the dark and still blend well with my foundation.</li>
            <li>Exactly what  I expected.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>I have several dark spots and it covers up very well.  </li>

            <li> from what I can tell A LITTLE BIT REALLY GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> I like how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> and I mean really well.</li>
            <li> (The other is their Ultimate mascara.)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry and give the appearance of wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> this is not worth 13$ its way tiny and you have to apply quite a bit for it to show up...</li>
            <li> next tim I will get a little darker color.</li>
            <li> The shade was a lot lighter than expected.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> but it is still thick enough to last all day.</li>
            <li> It is a thicker concealer so a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> I choose a slightly lighter color then my skin</li>
            <li> Received my order within a few days of placing my order.</li>
            <li> The concealer covers well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy like some others on the market.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay has a few products that I will continue to buy forever -- and this is one of them.  </li>
            <li> I remember using Mary Kay&#x27;s Signature Concealer a few years ago</li>
            <li> I usually use it, and if I don&#x27;t, friends wonder how I got the spots.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this concealer for anyone trying to hide those ugly age spots.</li>
            <li> The liquid was very thick.</li>

            <li> High quality. I highly recommend it!! It is as good as announced. If i need another one, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> The reason I love this concealer so much is because of the consistency of coverage. Too many of the concealers on the market today are very light and give little coverage. This one does it all and I go the extra mile to find it.</li>
            <li> I have several dark spots and it covers up very well.  I usually use it, and if I don&#x27;t, friends wonder how I got the spots.  Will keep using.</li>

            <li> This product was ok. I used it a couple of times and that&#x27;s about it. The shade was a lot lighter than expected. The liquid was very thick. This might work well for others, but not for me.</li>
            <li> Exactly what  I expected.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember why I stopped using Mary Kay. Perhaps it was the MLM thing. Whatever the reason, I ordered this on a whim and remember why I liked MK back when. Great products especially the basics like wash, moisture, concealer and foundation.&lt;br /&gt;This concealer actually hides discoloration well without making my face feel like a cake.</li>

            <li> Wow! I bought the ivory 2 because the seller was suggested it to me. But it wasn&#x27;t the right shade so i just use it for highlighting and it&#x27;s not bad at all. And this time i bought the beige one. And it was the right shade. And wow! It covers a lot of my blemishes and acne scars. I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> Great coverage, I use this every day and my skin does not break out for this product.</li>
