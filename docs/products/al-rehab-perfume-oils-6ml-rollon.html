    <ol>
            <li>Great product!.</li>
            <li>Al-Rehab oils are the best.</li>
            <li>Perfect rating from me.</li>
            <li>Just wonderful!</li>
            <li>I have a friend who has been wearing Jasmine and smells so wonderful that I wanted to try it.  </li>
            <li>Now I just put a dot on and its great!  </li>
            <li>I think all of Al-Rehab&#x27;s fragrances are very very strong!!  </li>
            <li>IT SMELLED SOOOOOOOOO GOOD!</li>
            <li>Beautiful heavenly smell.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is beautiful.</li>
            <li>lol.  </li>
            <li>But, leaving the bottle uncapped in the bathroom makes a great air freshener.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing!</li>
            <li>More like a chemically air freshener(at best).</li>
            <li>Roll on application method; Great smell of Jasmine(just like the flowers that we have in our backyard); Fragrance lasts all day; Just ordered 5 more to give friends and family!</li>
            <li>I love Jasmine and have tried all brands this is a very good one.  </li>
            <li>Considering the price, it&#x27;s a good deal, but the fragrance is not to my liking.</li>
            <li>I like what I bought, I would advise others to purchase, thank you to everyone who is working for our good, that the goods come before us, once again thank you for everything.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this one.</li>
            <li>I am sure for some it works great</li>
            <li>I still got 5 because I love this product!</li>
            <li>First... the seller Al-Rehab is excellent!!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This perfume is just WAY TOO overwhelming!</li>
            <li>Sincerely recommend it to my friends!</li>
            <li>I kept the rose scent.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s all about the dose - medicine and poison kind of thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great and useful for us to do good by</li>
            <li>beautiful and true to its claim</li>
            <li>It honestly smells like insecticide.</li>
            <li>But surprisingly did not cause a headache as most perfumes do.</li>
            <li>Honest company and quality product.</li>
            <li>he said what was I wearing smells nice</li>
            <li>they even said I smell nice</li>
            <li>that is kind of ??????</li>
            <li>They are nice scents but pungent.  </li>
            <li>GOOD FLORAL SMELL very sweet not chemicals but</li>
            <li>Very strong fragrance .</li>
            <li>this is very strong.  </li>
            <li>Love you guys! :-)</li>
            <li>However, it is extremely strong!  </li>
            <li>Strong and lovely!</li>
            <li>However I thought this one was more unisex</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>This is about the 5th fragrance I have bought, and plan to buy more, soon.  </li>
            <li>My sister and I love jasmine fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I am planning to buy more, but I will keep it for myself this time.</li>
            <li>I love perfumed oils</li>
            <li>I love the smell, though.  </li>
            <li>I am sure mosquitoes would run from it and it would kill cockroaches.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when I wear this.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t shop anywhere else for my precious Jasmine Oil that I wear on my skin as perfume.</li>
            <li>I will most cerainly purchase from them again and recommend that you give ths company a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s becaus</li>
            <li>This is a lovely, long-lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>But the item was OK for the price.</li>
            <li>If you like the smell of flowers you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;ve heard so many people rave about the smell and if this is it, I can see why.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>I love jasmine scent bu</li>
            <li>and she chose this and the Lovely perfume oil.  </li>
            <li>All these oils are nice, clean smelling.  </li>
            <li>It has a wonderful smell, lasts long</li>
            <li>While I was in line I could smell this sweet, warm, alluring smell.</li>
            <li>I love most of the oils but this one was so strong and so sweet</li>
            <li>but it was just way too strong for me.</li>
            <li>Although strong, this scent is a singular scent.</li>
            <li>Extremely strong, floral scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong, but I like that with jasmine.</li>
            <li>This Jasmine oil is really, really strong.</li>
            <li>This product is WAY too strong to wear as a perfume.</li>
            <li>The smell is too strong &amp; doesn&#x27;t resemble the scent of jasmine at all.</li>
            <li>so if you like really strong perfume</li>
            <li>this is just too strong for me.</li>
            <li>If you are not a fan of strong scents, as I sometimes am, try White Musk which is a very light and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Their aromas however are huge.  </li>
            <li>a sharp sweet flower smell very good if you like jasmine like me</li>
            <li>Her exact words were &amp;#34;Who doesn&#x27;t love jasmine?&amp;#34;  Since she lives in another state I haven&#x27;t smelled it.  </li>
            <li>understand that some oils can have a reaction with certain skin types, but I felt confident as I have been using perfume oils for years.</li>
            <li>He made it right in a minute!</li>
            <li>its amazing scent not overpowering the scent is soft flowey</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t buy if you are looking for a light fresh scent .</li>
            <li>I actually bought this product for myself but when my sister tried it and loved it, I gave it to her.  </li>
            <li>The only perfumes I use are flower scents, so I was delighted to find this.  </li>
            <li>Really sweet smell</li>
            <li>The price was very low and the reviews were good, so, i took a chance.</li>
            <li>Too strong, had a headache by the end of first day.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing again from this seller who shipped product quickly.</li>
            <li>The price seems high :)</li>
            <li>Will definitely want more soon!</li>
            <li>He usually never notices most oils.  </li>
            <li>first of all, .just inhale when unscrewing the cap!  </li>
            <li>i bought 3 oils &amp; loved the other 2( Full &amp; Roses)so</li>
            <li>These are the kind of perfumes that when you were a little girl, you saw all those lovely perfume bottles on your grandma&#x27;s dresser.  </li>
            <li>so I told him Jasmin perfume oil he really liked it,he said its not too strong like other scent that gives headaches</li>
            <li>just like jasmines &amp; incredibly fresh.</li>
            <li>but the fresh scent just never came through.</li>
            <li>right?.  </li>
            <li>It has great staying power and a very little goes on to be noticed all day.</li>
            <li>Other than that it was a good price and ships fast!</li>
            <li>mean the smell is beautiful, but the intensity of it is like a toxic paint or roach killer.</li>
            <li>This oil is VERY strong, it lasts a pretty long time too!  </li>
            <li>Love it!!!!Buying my second one tomorrow.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with this brand</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Pretty scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad i&#x27;ve finally found a perfume oil that I like.</li>
            <li>First off they are</li>
            <li>Very nice, long lasting jasmine oil.</li>
            <li>not too long so that you are committed for a couple of days though :)</li>
            <li>all.floral sweet stuff not heavy or spicy</li>
            <li>This oil is very pleasant, but a very little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Only put on a dab though it can be very​ strong if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>strong jasmine smell &amp; last for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Waaaaaay toooooo strong for personal fragrance!</li>
            <li>Sensual Jasmine scent, a strong deep floral, might not be for every lady.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Pure fragrance.</li>
            <li>The roll on is nice, but it only take a tiny bit - I put on a lot the first day and almost smothered.  </li>
            <li>It was cheap enough to risk a try; but will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this but just didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>; are much truer to the scent</li>
            <li>their customer service rep that I spoke to really cared.</li>
            <li>Very concentrated.</li>
            <li>No one wants to put it on their skin.</li>
            <li>So I wasnt feeling very optimistic when I tried this on.</li>
            <li>Much stronger than predicted.</li>
            <li>I was very nervous when I ordered this.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t understand how they can sell such a high quality product for such a reasonable price, but I&#x27;m not arguing.  </li>
            <li>You only need to use a little as this stuff is strong and potent.</li>
            <li>it is high quality but very bed smell.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and it stays with you a long time.  </li>
            <li>and I wanted something more definitely feminine,  even though I usually gravitate towards more masculine fragrances.</li>
            <li>I was expecting this particular oil to smell like the discontinued fragrance from Bath and Body Works called, &amp;#34;Night Blooming Jasmine&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I tried several scents in the Al-Rehab essential oil perfumes, and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t wear more than a tiny tiny dab.</li>
            <li>i had high hopes 4 Jasmin.</li>
            <li>This is a highly scented product.  </li>
            <li>I like Jasmin, usually, but this one is quite potent ... a bit much for me.</li>
            <li>Very strong, not very pleasant smell</li>
            <li>Seriously Im very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>Its very strong, I only have to put on a little.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>and I could even smell it on me first thing in the morning of the next day a \\&quot;WHOLE\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I like it but its a little strong so be cautious in your use.  </li>
            <li>This scent, (and others that I have purchased) remind me of old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>The scent changes after direct application to the skin.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive like me, don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li>I bought this mainly to add to sachets and such.  </li>
            <li>Well i was so excited the next day to put it on, boy was i let down.</li>
            <li>I definitely do not recommend this product - I couldn&#x27;t wash it off fast enough.</li>
            <li>A lot of perfume products have too many scents that overwhelm each other in one little bottle.</li>
            <li>It is in a small bottle, so if you tire of scents quickly like I do, I suggest buying the company&#x27;s three suggested scents that offered below the one product.</li>
            <li>At first there is a faint odd smell the first time you put it on (only the first time though)).  </li>
            <li>I have put a little under my pillow case (on the pillow itself) and been rewarded with a very relaxing sniff every time I turn over.</li>

            <li> lol.  </li>
            <li> But, leaving the bottle uncapped in the bathroom makes a great air freshener.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> More like a chemically air freshener(at best).</li>
            <li> Roll on application method; Great smell of Jasmine(just like the flowers that we have in our backyard); Fragrance lasts all day; Just ordered 5 more to give friends and family!</li>

            <li> I kept the rose scent.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s all about the dose - medicine and poison kind of thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great and useful for us to do good by</li>
            <li> beautiful and true to its claim</li>
            <li> It honestly smells like insecticide.</li>
            <li> But surprisingly did not cause a headache as most perfumes do.</li>
            <li> Honest company and quality product.</li>
            <li> he said what was I wearing smells nice</li>
            <li> they even said I smell nice</li>
            <li> that is kind of ??????</li>
            <li> They are nice scents but pungent.  </li>
            <li> GOOD FLORAL SMELL very sweet not chemicals but</li>
            <li> Very strong fragrance .</li>
            <li> this is very strong.  </li>
            <li> Love you guys! :-)</li>
            <li> However, it is extremely strong!  </li>
            <li> Strong and lovely!</li>
            <li> However I thought this one was more unisex</li>
            <li> Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is about the 5th fragrance I have bought, and plan to buy more, soon.  </li>
            <li> My sister and I love jasmine fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I am planning to buy more, but I will keep it for myself this time.</li>
            <li> I love perfumed oils</li>
            <li> I love the smell, though.  </li>
            <li> I am sure mosquitoes would run from it and it would kill cockroaches.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I wear this.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t shop anywhere else for my precious Jasmine Oil that I wear on my skin as perfume.</li>
            <li> I will most cerainly purchase from them again and recommend that you give ths company a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s becaus</li>
            <li> This is a lovely, long-lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> But the item was OK for the price.</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of flowers you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve heard so many people rave about the smell and if this is it, I can see why.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> I love jasmine scent bu</li>
            <li> and she chose this and the Lovely perfume oil.  </li>
            <li> All these oils are nice, clean smelling.  </li>
            <li> It has a wonderful smell, lasts long</li>
            <li> While I was in line I could smell this sweet, warm, alluring smell.</li>
            <li> I love most of the oils but this one was so strong and so sweet</li>
            <li> but it was just way too strong for me.</li>
            <li> Although strong, this scent is a singular scent.</li>
            <li> Extremely strong, floral scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong, but I like that with jasmine.</li>
            <li> This Jasmine oil is really, really strong.</li>
            <li> This product is WAY too strong to wear as a perfume.</li>
            <li> The smell is too strong &amp; doesn&#x27;t resemble the scent of jasmine at all.</li>
            <li> so if you like really strong perfume</li>
            <li> this is just too strong for me.</li>
            <li> If you are not a fan of strong scents, as I sometimes am, try White Musk which is a very light and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Their aromas however are huge.  </li>
            <li> a sharp sweet flower smell very good if you like jasmine like me</li>
            <li> Her exact words were &amp;#34;Who doesn&#x27;t love jasmine?&amp;#34;  Since she lives in another state I haven&#x27;t smelled it.  </li>
            <li> understand that some oils can have a reaction with certain skin types, but I felt confident as I have been using perfume oils for years.</li>
            <li> He made it right in a minute!</li>
            <li> its amazing scent not overpowering the scent is soft flowey</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy if you are looking for a light fresh scent .</li>
            <li> I actually bought this product for myself but when my sister tried it and loved it, I gave it to her.  </li>
            <li> The only perfumes I use are flower scents, so I was delighted to find this.  </li>
            <li> Really sweet smell</li>
            <li> The price was very low and the reviews were good, so, i took a chance.</li>
            <li> Too strong, had a headache by the end of first day.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing again from this seller who shipped product quickly.</li>
            <li> The price seems high :)</li>
            <li> Will definitely want more soon!</li>
            <li> He usually never notices most oils.  </li>
            <li> first of all, .just inhale when unscrewing the cap!  </li>
            <li> i bought 3 oils &amp; loved the other 2( Full &amp; Roses)so</li>
            <li> These are the kind of perfumes that when you were a little girl, you saw all those lovely perfume bottles on your grandma&#x27;s dresser.  </li>
            <li> so I told him Jasmin perfume oil he really liked it,he said its not too strong like other scent that gives headaches</li>
            <li> just like jasmines &amp; incredibly fresh.</li>
            <li> but the fresh scent just never came through.</li>
            <li> right?.  </li>
            <li> It has great staying power and a very little goes on to be noticed all day.</li>
            <li> Other than that it was a good price and ships fast!</li>
            <li> mean the smell is beautiful, but the intensity of it is like a toxic paint or roach killer.</li>
            <li> This oil is VERY strong, it lasts a pretty long time too!  </li>
            <li> Love it!!!!Buying my second one tomorrow.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with this brand</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Pretty scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad i&#x27;ve finally found a perfume oil that I like.</li>
            <li> First off they are</li>
            <li> Very nice, long lasting jasmine oil.</li>
            <li> not too long so that you are committed for a couple of days though :)</li>
            <li> all.floral sweet stuff not heavy or spicy</li>
            <li> This oil is very pleasant, but a very little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Only put on a dab though it can be very​ strong if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> strong jasmine smell &amp; last for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Waaaaaay toooooo strong for personal fragrance!</li>
            <li> Sensual Jasmine scent, a strong deep floral, might not be for every lady.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Pure fragrance.</li>
            <li> The roll on is nice, but it only take a tiny bit - I put on a lot the first day and almost smothered.  </li>
            <li> It was cheap enough to risk a try; but will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this but just didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> ; are much truer to the scent</li>
            <li> their customer service rep that I spoke to really cared.</li>
            <li> Very concentrated.</li>
            <li> No one wants to put it on their skin.</li>
            <li> So I wasnt feeling very optimistic when I tried this on.</li>
            <li> Much stronger than predicted.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous when I ordered this.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t understand how they can sell such a high quality product for such a reasonable price, but I&#x27;m not arguing.  </li>
            <li> You only need to use a little as this stuff is strong and potent.</li>
            <li> it is high quality but very bed smell.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and it stays with you a long time.  </li>
            <li> and I wanted something more definitely feminine,  even though I usually gravitate towards more masculine fragrances.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this particular oil to smell like the discontinued fragrance from Bath and Body Works called, &amp;#34;Night Blooming Jasmine&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I tried several scents in the Al-Rehab essential oil perfumes, and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t wear more than a tiny tiny dab.</li>
            <li> i had high hopes 4 Jasmin.</li>
            <li> This is a highly scented product.  </li>
            <li> I like Jasmin, usually, but this one is quite potent ... a bit much for me.</li>
            <li> Very strong, not very pleasant smell</li>
            <li> Seriously Im very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> Its very strong, I only have to put on a little.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> and I could even smell it on me first thing in the morning of the next day a \\&quot;WHOLE\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I like it but its a little strong so be cautious in your use.  </li>
            <li> This scent, (and others that I have purchased) remind me of old lady perfume.</li>
            <li> The scent changes after direct application to the skin.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive like me, don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly to add to sachets and such.  </li>
            <li> Well i was so excited the next day to put it on, boy was i let down.</li>
            <li> I definitely do not recommend this product - I couldn&#x27;t wash it off fast enough.</li>
            <li> A lot of perfume products have too many scents that overwhelm each other in one little bottle.</li>
            <li> It is in a small bottle, so if you tire of scents quickly like I do, I suggest buying the company&#x27;s three suggested scents that offered below the one product.</li>
            <li> At first there is a faint odd smell the first time you put it on (only the first time though)).  </li>
            <li> I have put a little under my pillow case (on the pillow itself) and been rewarded with a very relaxing sniff every time I turn over.</li>
            <li> Last all day long even into the next day.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, which may not be a full plus since it makes it a little heavy.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, too.</li>
            <li> but they do not last as long as this and are not roll on.</li>
            <li> This role-on bottle will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> They are pure perfume and contain no alcohol so a very little goes a long long way.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, everything is so strong it makes me nauseous.</li>
            <li> I tried the oil  and noted it has a very old  and heavy smell, reminds me of my grandmothers toilet water.  </li>
            <li> I ignored the negative reviews for this oil, cause I really like Jasmin and the price</li>
            <li> Smells strangely metallic scent and not at all floral.</li>
            <li> I will give 5 star... lost long</li>
            <li> As the old saying goes, a little goes a very  long way.  </li>
            <li> Customer Service went above and beyond when I received my first bottle and at least half had leaked out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I wear it almost every single day.</li>
            <li> the shipping charge is not reduced they charge separate shipping and send it in single box...</li>
            <li> Bottle lid was loose when it arrived in the mail.</li>
            <li> I want to smell like jasmin and not jasmin plus twenty other scents.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this perfume!  </li>
            <li> I had already tried two other perfume oils by Auric blends</li>
            <li> The other night I put on a dab to go to bed</li>
            <li> so im not sure how this compares to actual jasmine</li>
            <li> I just trow it away, gave me headache not true to jasmine</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t least very long.  </li>
            <li> I will never wear it again -- a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> a q-tip(it smelled weird at first, hard to describe the smell really not good though), waited about 10 mins &amp; OMG</li>
            <li> But a small caveat--use very little of it on you or any place else.  </li>
            <li> so bad, I really did.</li>
            <li> almost unbelievably so-</li>
            <li> Use a SMALL drop ( and I mean small).  </li>
            <li> At least it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY, THIS OIL LITERALLY SMELLS LIKE JASMINE SCENTED MOTHBALLS.  </li>
            <li> Smells like mothballs, seriously it does.</li>
            <li> I wish they would reduce the shipping cost when ordering multiples, but they don&#x27;t unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Not happy!</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> you put it on and you get ill, and have to wash it off</li>
            <li> I do not use it, as every my friend asked me not to use it, because they feel uncomfortable of it.</li>
            <li> It has a very unpleasant scent to me, one I&#x27;m no able to place.</li>
            <li> It smells very fake..</li>
            <li> too bad....</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> It smells very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or what, but the bottle I just received smelled terrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible, nauseating chemical spell.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying perfume oil., but this is without a doubt the worst smelling PERFUME OIL I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.</li>
            <li> It smelled horrible on me, i don&#x27;t know or understand why</li>
            <li> NASTY STUFF !!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Roll on application method; Great smell of Jasmine(just like the flowers that we have in our backyard); Fragrance lasts all day; Just ordered 5 more to give friends and family! I wish they would reduce the shipping cost when ordering multiples, but they don&#x27;t unfortunately. I still got 5 because I love this product!</li>
            <li> I tried the oil  and noted it has a very old  and heavy smell, reminds me of my grandmothers toilet water.  don&#x27;t buy if you are looking for a light fresh scent .</li>
            <li> Bottle lid was loose when it arrived in the mail. Everything smelled like Jasmin for a week. Not happy!</li>
            <li> I have stopped wearing my perfumes because of this! Love it!!!!Buying my second one tomorrow. It has a wonderful smell, lasts long, even bees like it!People ask me what i&#x27;m wearing all the time! I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Pure fragrance. Strong and lovely!</li>
            <li> Does not smell like jasmine at all.  It was cheap enough to risk a try; but will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> All these oils are nice, clean smelling.  However I thought this one was more unisex and I wanted something more definitely feminine,  even though I usually gravitate towards more masculine fragrances. Did not smell Jasmine in this one.  Maybe my nose was overwhelmed because I had ordered and tried several of these at once. These oils bloom on the skin over an extended period so you must wait some time to decide whether you like it.</li>
            <li> Too strong, had a headache by the end of first day.</li>
            <li> First... the seller Al-Rehab is excellent!!  All of the scents I ordered were wrapped well and definitely arrived on time.  I think the problem is just me and my personal taste and chemistry.  I think all of Al-Rehab&#x27;s fragrances are very very strong!!  They are pure perfume and contain no alcohol so a very little goes a long long way.  Unfortunately, everything is so strong it makes me nauseous. This scent, (and others that I have purchased) remind me of old lady perfume. These are the kind of perfumes that when you were a little girl, you saw all those lovely perfume bottles on your grandma&#x27;s dresser.  You just had to try them all at once, right?.  Well... this is what this smells like.  I was expecting this particular oil to smell like the discontinued fragrance from Bath and Body Works called, &amp;#34;Night Blooming Jasmine&amp;#34;.  This smells NOTHING like that. So if you are looking for something similar to that scent..keep looking because this is not it!  I do not know what would soften this up some but it was just way too strong for me. I really wanted to like this but just didn&#x27;t.  Sorry</li>
            <li> Not my favorite. The scent changes after direct application to the skin.</li>
            <li> Smells strangely metallic scent and not at all floral. Considering the price, it&#x27;s a good deal, but the fragrance is not to my liking.</li>
            <li> I love Jasmine and have tried all brands this is a very good one.  It smells hood and lasts, I would buy again.</li>
            <li> A lot of perfume products have too many scents that overwhelm each other in one little bottle. Although strong, this scent is a singular scent. I want to smell like jasmin and not jasmin plus twenty other scents. If you are not a fan of strong scents, as I sometimes am, try White Musk which is a very light and pleasant scent. It is in a small bottle, so if you tire of scents quickly like I do, I suggest buying the company&#x27;s three suggested scents that offered below the one product.</li>
            <li> It has a very unpleasant scent to me, one I&#x27;m no able to place. I scrubbed my arms several times in order to wash it away. At least it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Extremely strong, floral scent.  I like Jasmin, usually, but this one is quite potent ... a bit much for me.</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY, THIS OIL LITERALLY SMELLS LIKE JASMINE SCENTED MOTHBALLS.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS COLOGNE UNLESS YOU HAVE A LARVAE INFESTATION!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried several scents in the Al-Rehab essential oil perfumes, and this is my favorite.  Its very strong, I only have to put on a little.  But it smells heavenly.  Definitely getting this one again!</li>
            <li> I bought this just to try but it just is not for me.  I just don&#x27;t like it so I gave it to my sister....lol.  I kept the rose scent.</li>
            <li> It smells very fake..for the price I just trow it away, gave me headache not true to jasmine, I do not recommend it</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Only put on a dab though it can be very​ strong if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I ignored the negative reviews for this oil, cause I really like Jasmin and the price was low. Now after I got it today...The price seems high :) Seriously Im very sensitive to smells so the problem is probably mine, not the product&#x27;s. If you are sensitive like me, don&#x27;t get it. I felt the smell thru the box! And was about to throw up, sorry.&lt;br /&gt;I mean the smell is beautiful, but the intensity of it is like a toxic paint or roach killer. So it&#x27;s all about the dose - medicine and poison kind of thing.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who loves it.  Her exact words were &amp;#34;Who doesn&#x27;t love jasmine?&amp;#34;  Since she lives in another state I haven&#x27;t smelled it.  All the Al Rahab fragrances I have tried are of superlative quality.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t understand how they can sell such a high quality product for such a reasonable price, but I&#x27;m not arguing.  This is about the 5th fragrance I have bought, and plan to buy more, soon.  Great product!.</li>
            <li> My sister and I love jasmine fragrance.  I actually bought this product for myself but when my sister tried it and loved it, I gave it to her.  I am planning to buy more, but I will keep it for myself this time.</li>
            <li> I love perfumed oils and I have several. This is my first experience with this brand and I won&#x27;t be buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;It smells heavenly in the bottle, but the moment it touched my skin it smelled rancid. What a disappointment!&lt;br /&gt;I admit that the pricing may have determined my purchase. It is well priced- almost unbelievably so- and I should have paid attention to my misgivings.&lt;br /&gt;I understand that some oils can have a reaction with certain skin types, but I felt confident as I have been using perfume oils for years. I am going to stick to my regulars from now on!</li>
            <li> I did not like this perfume oil at all because it smelled like rubbing alcohol with a hint of jasmine.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly to add to sachets and such.  I love the smell, though.  It&#x27;s strong, but I like that with jasmine.</li>
            <li> The only perfumes I use are flower scents, so I was delighted to find this.  Will definitely want more soon!</li>
            <li> Really sweet smell like.the.flower but i.think something is.mixed with it. GOOD FLORAL SMELL very sweet not chemicals but a sharp sweet flower smell very good if you like jasmine like me all.floral sweet stuff not heavy or spicy</li>
            <li> Al-Rehab oils are the best. Beautiful heavenly smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great and useful for us to do good by</li>
            <li> Horrible, nauseating chemical spell.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this one.Long lasting.</li>
            <li> Very strong, not very pleasant smell</li>
            <li> beautiful and true to its claim</li>
            <li> This Jasmine oil is really, really strong. I was looking for something that had a lighter scent, and this is not it! A little goes a long way with this perfume!  Other than that it was a good price and ships fast!</li>
            <li> I love it! strong jasmine smell &amp; last for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> unwearable, I recommend tossing it. cant believe anyone would use it. . Like perfume with body odor! recommend tossing it. you put it on and you get ill, and have to wash it off</li>
            <li> The product smells just like Jasmine!  However, it is extremely strong!  You can&#x27;t wear more than a tiny tiny dab.</li>
            <li> This product is WAY too strong to wear as a perfume. It is actually obnoxious.But, leaving the bottle uncapped in the bathroom makes a great air freshener. Long lasting, too.</li>
            <li> I like it but its a little strong so be cautious in your use.  It lasts a long time, which may not be a full plus since it makes it a little heavy.  I have to say the &amp;#34;floral scents....premium grade fragrance oils&amp;#34; are much truer to the scent but they do not last as long as this and are not roll on.</li>
            <li> This oil is very pleasant, but a very little goes a long way.  The roller applicator helps control the amount used. The fragrance lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying perfume oil., but this is without a doubt the worst smelling PERFUME OIL I have ever had the misfortune to encounter. It honestly smells like insecticide. I am sure mosquitoes would run from it and it would kill cockroaches. save your money and your time and avoid this company&#x27;s products. This was going to be a stocking stuffer for my teenage granddaughter, but , since I value her opinion of me, no way would I gift her with this stinky stuff.</li>
            <li> The scent comes in a roll-on container. The bottle was oily &amp; the label seemed worn-off(used product?) before i even opened it. The smell is too strong &amp; doesn&#x27;t resemble the scent of jasmine at all. More like a chemically air freshener(at best). The price was very low and the reviews were good, so, i took a chance. It smells very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Very strong fragrance . But surprisingly did not cause a headache as most perfumes do.</li>
            <li> I like what I bought, I would advise others to purchase, thank you to everyone who is working for our good, that the goods come before us, once again thank you for everything. I still continue to communicate with you.</li>
            <li> This perfume is just WAY TOO overwhelming! I washed my wrists three times and still couldn&#x27;t get rid of the smell. My hunch is that it would even cover up skunk smell. I will never wear it again -- a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and it stays with you a long time.  I get so many compliments when I wear this.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this oil so bad, I really did. I read the reviews before hand but decided to see for myself.  i bought 3 oils &amp; loved the other 2( Full &amp; Roses)so i had high hopes 4 Jasmin. As soon as i got the oil i tested it on a q-tip(it smelled weird at first, hard to describe the smell really not good though), waited about 10 mins &amp; OMG IT SMELLED SOOOOOOOOO GOOD! just like jasmines &amp; incredibly fresh. Well i was so excited the next day to put it on, boy was i let down. It smelled horrible on me, i don&#x27;t know or understand why but the fresh scent just never came through. won&#x27;t be buying this one again.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. I wear it almost every single day. Customer Service went above and beyond when I received my first bottle and at least half had leaked out of the bottle. I had a replacement within 3 days after talking to them over the phone. Honest company and quality product. I wouldn&#x27;t shop anywhere else for my precious Jasmine Oil that I wear on my skin as perfume. Perfect rating from me. I will most cerainly purchase from them again and recommend that you give ths company a try. I have not been disappointed. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s becaus this business is personally owned and operated and their customer service rep that I spoke to really cared. He made it right in a minute! Love you guys! :-)</li>
            <li> Very concentrated. This role-on bottle will last me a long time. The fragrance is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Smells like mothballs, seriously it does. I can&#x27;t even give it away. No one wants to put it on their skin. So....it sits on my dresser still in the box. NASTY STUFF !!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Wow! Wore this as a perfume oil and my coworkers literally coughed and gagged! One woman said it burned her nose! A patient of mine started coughing and his eyes were tearing! Waaaaaay toooooo strong for personal fragrance!</li>
            <li> This is a highly scented product.  Use a SMALL drop ( and I mean small).  Pretty scent. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely, long-lasting fragrance. It has great staying power and a very little goes on to be noticed all day.</li>
            <li> I just received this Jasmin perfume oil its amazing scent not overpowering the scent is soft flowey the name says it all.Its a roll on,I wore it at my house and went out to pick my mails from my mail box the mailman was there he noticed my scent he said what was I wearing smells nice so I told him Jasmin perfume oil he really liked it,he said its not too strong like other scent that gives headaches I said no it smells like Jasmin he said yeah I agree,later while I was picking my mail from the box two of my neighbors came to pick up their mails they even said I smell nice so I told everyone what it was and where they can get it from,amazon thank you for everything.</li>
            <li> I love most of the oils but this one was so strong and so sweet even my husband begged me not to wear it again.  He usually never notices most oils.  I am sure for some it works great and it is as advertised, just not for me.</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t least very long.  But the item was OK for the price.</li>
            <li> Very nice, long lasting jasmine oil.</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of flowers you&#x27;ll love this. I had already tried two other perfume oils by Auric blends and I did not like them. So I wasnt feeling very optimistic when I tried this on. I put some on and went to the store. While I was in line I could smell this sweet, warm, alluring smell. I almost leaned over and asked the cashier what perfume she was wearing when I realized that it was probably me smelling like that,lol. The other night I put on a dab to go to bed just so I could smell it before I went to bed. I&#x27;ve never smelled jasmine before so im not sure how this compares to actual jasmine but i&#x27;ve heard so many people rave about the smell and if this is it, I can see why. It also reminds me of someone who just stepped out of the shower and their skin smells just like soap. I&#x27;m so glad i&#x27;ve finally found a perfume oil that I like.</li>
            <li> Just wonderful! Sensual Jasmine scent, a strong deep floral, might not be for every lady.&lt;br /&gt; I will be purchasing again from this seller who shipped product quickly.</li>
            <li> The oil smells just like jasmine. I only hope that it has staying power and can last throughout the day. I do reapply fragrance throughout the day. I also like that this does not contain alcohol. UPDATE: The oil has staying power. The fragrance of the oil lasted all day and I could even smell it on me first thing in the morning of the next day a \\&quot;WHOLE\\&quot; twenty fours hours after I applied it. You only need to use a little as this stuff is strong and potent. It even left the fragrance it my car. UPDATE: The oil has staying power. Last all day long even into the next day.</li>
            <li> For me......first of all, .just inhale when unscrewing the cap!  But a small caveat--use very little of it on you or any place else.  As the old saying goes, a little goes a very  long way.  I have put a little under my pillow case (on the pillow itself) and been rewarded with a very relaxing sniff every time I turn over.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or what, but the bottle I just received smelled terrible. It was so stinky, it smelled like a jasmine flower that had been sprayed by a skunk. I definitely do not recommend this product - I couldn&#x27;t wash it off fast enough.</li>
            <li> Much stronger than predicted.</li>
            <li> This oil is VERY strong, it lasts a pretty long time too!  not too long so that you are committed for a couple of days though :)</li>
            <li> Love this perfume ... but the sad part... my wife took it from me.... too bad....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this product to any one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I found one thing, I ordered three product from the same company/supplier and the shipping charge is not reduced they charge separate shipping and send it in single box... that is kind of ??????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the product... I will give 5 star... lost long</li>
            <li> I was very nervous when I ordered this. I have a friend who has been wearing Jasmine and smells so wonderful that I wanted to try it.  So I found this product.  What can I say?  At first there is a faint odd smell the first time you put it on (only the first time though)).  But the fragrance lasts almost all day and is divine!  The roll on is nice, but it only take a tiny bit - I put on a lot the first day and almost smothered.  Now I just put a dot on and its great!  Sincerely recommend it to my friends!</li>
            <li> this is very strong.  so if you like really strong perfume it&#x27;s ok.  I love jasmine scent bu this is just too strong for me.</li>
            <li> and she chose this and the Lovely perfume oil.  First off they are tiny .2 ounce is dinky.  Their aromas however are huge.  They are nice scents but pungent.  A dip will definitely do you.  I took the packing slip to work to shred a couple of days after we received the perfumes and still smelled up my office.</li>
            <li> it is high quality but very bed smell. I do not use it, as every my friend asked me not to use it, because they feel uncomfortable of it.</li>
