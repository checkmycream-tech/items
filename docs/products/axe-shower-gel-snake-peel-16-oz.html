    <ol>
            <li>Makes my husband smell great!</li>
            <li>but I think this is the best one .</li>
            <li>Anyways, it would be a perfect rating</li>
            <li>All the AXE scents are great</li>
            <li>It smells great, leaves me feeling refreshened after using it, and my girlfriend, well she loves the smell also.</li>
            <li>Great liquid soap</li>
            <li>and it smells great.  </li>
            <li>Great product all around.  </li>
            <li>So happy to be able to get them here for a great price.  </li>
            <li>Great for those who like a warm, spicy, ginger-y scent.</li>
            <li>It was at this time I started dating my wife and she loved the smell too.</li>
            <li>It smells good and has some rocks and gravel in the mix</li>
            <li>Good name too.</li>
            <li>Nice shampoo&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and he also likes the &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; in it as it exfoliates his skin nicely.</li>
            <li>AND SURFING , GREAT TO CLEAN &amp; SMELLS HANDSOME</li>
            <li>The best gel with its fragrance, scrubbing action and feel.</li>
            <li>It is an exfoliating scrub, very fine grained.</li>
            <li>Putting aside, for the moment, the Axe marketing promises of the uncontrollable attention of attractive women, the Snake Peel gel is an effective product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I found that all the ones that come in clear bottles are of better quality (notably more concentrated/luxurious with \\&quot;goodies\\&quot; in them), and this is the best and most \\&quot;luxurious\\&quot; of them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For years, this has been my favorite of all Axe scents.</li>
            <li>What can I say this is one of my favorite smells by axe</li>
            <li>His comment when buying his Axe products....make sure it has 2 women on it instead of</li>
            <li>so I could use it more discreetly.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, and I love the bonus exfoliating scrubbing stuff.  </li>
            <li>add in some others for variety, but I have been using this scent as my favorite since the stuff came out (almost 10 years ago?).  </li>
            <li>This is honestly my favorite shower gel.</li>
            <li>Axe Shower Gel, Snake Peel, 16 Fluid Ounce is an awesome shower gel.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Or so I&#x27;m told.. :)</li>
            <li>LOVE this smell.  </li>
            <li>My man smells amazing when he uses this and he loves that it gets him &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; clean with the exfoliating beads.</li>
            <li>very satisfied and buy this product consistently.  </li>
            <li>The grit in this is good if you do manual labor as it cleans very well.</li>
            <li>I found the abrasive to be mild, but suitable for the purpose.  </li>
            <li>The product works fine, but I am not a fan of the scent.</li>
            <li>I can see why they call this snake peel because its like getting new fresh skin it smells great.</li>
            <li>1 lol (referring to the back of the label).</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve got this on subscribe for my boyfriend, actually finding it at any of the stores around us is spotty, plus the price on here is great</li>
            <li>that the original size was 12 oz.  </li>
            <li>Price was good compared to our local stores.</li>
            <li>Other than the the smell is great.</li>
            <li>Once I came back to this product, my wife was very happy and the scent brought back memories for her.</li>
            <li>The smell is like fresh citrus and another earthy scent that I can&#x27;t put a finger on.</li>
            <li>This is a well balanced mixture of botanical and exfoliation If you can buy in bulk its worth it.</li>
            <li>This is by FAR my favorite Axe shower gel.  </li>
            <li>I use several of these scents, doesnt break me out even with my sensitive skin and smells great.</li>
            <li>My husband has previously used this product and loved it.</li>
            <li>Only downside is that I feel like this was meant to replace AXE Fever, and Axe Fever was my favorite shower gel.</li>
            <li>Had to order on Amazon &#x27;cause this scent isn&#x27;t available in the stores near me on the east coast.</li>
            <li>I am not normally picky when it comes to body-wash scents and this one had such great reviews that I decided to purchase it without having done so before.  </li>
            <li>He says he doesn&#x27;t care much which fragrance, but when I stocked him up with a variety, I noticed he went to and is using this one first.</li>
            <li>Clean smelling and just a bare hint of the scent you choose.  </li>
            <li>It cleans very well.</li>
            <li>I have gotten it much cheaper before (in a 6-pack</li>
            <li>This is ok product, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again due to the scent</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s gritty and gets you clean</li>
            <li>x older 12oz) shipped from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved this product, used it for years, but lately it&#x27;s gotten more expensive, &amp; no longer available in subscribe &amp; save as well.  </li>
            <li>I really wish I had sniffed different products at the store first.  </li>
            <li>Some of the Axe shower gels are pretty weak/watery in strength or just your standard flowery/musky smell.  </li>
            <li>boyfriend swears by this stuff for keeping his skin clear, and likes the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft without feeling greasy or lotiony.</li>
            <li>Bought this and the new Old Spice Wolfthorn scented body wash at the same time and there&#x27;s no comparison.</li>
            <li>This one wins hands down.</li>
            <li>The current common size is now 33% more &#x3D; 16oz.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally I love the smell of it on him too... but wouldn&#x27;t mind if it was a little less fragranced</li>
            <li>When I was single years ago and this was new, I used it all the time.</li>

            <li> When I was single years ago and this was new, I used it all the time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a close second right behind deep space.</li>
            <li> :&#x27;( I feel like a total hypocrite using the product, but I am a very good smelling hypocrite -.-</li>
            <li> With luck, you can find it at a local drugstore which will likely be cheaper as they are often on sale, but this scent is harder to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Love the scent, Nostalgic!</li>
            <li> I guess it comes down to personal taste</li>
            <li> You can feel it smoothing rough skin after just 2-3 uses.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is that I cannot transfer it to a pump bottle because the beads and scrubbing goodies plug them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, note that Amazon&#x27;s price at the time of this writing is not very good, even with their Add-on pricing.  </li>
            <li> Removing dead skin and leaving you refreshed.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT EVERYDAY AND WON&#x27;T</li>
            <li> It has a lighter scent, not so heavy on the musk.</li>
            <li> Then they go down into the water system where they never dissolve and further pollute our poor earth mother!</li>
            <li> but, Why on Earth does AXE add little plastic beads into their products!?</li>
            <li> but they could be made of something that is bio-degradable, these beads are made of little bits of PLASTIC!</li>
            <li> I could not find AXE Snake Peel  at the usual retail outlets and if I could not at this price.</li>
            <li> This has become hard to find in our town.</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> This smells awful.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great for those who like a warm, spicy, ginger-y scent. For years, this has been my favorite of all Axe scents.</li>
            <li> What can I say this is one of my favorite smells by axe it&#x27;s a close second right behind deep space. The smell is like fresh citrus and another earthy scent that I can&#x27;t put a finger on.</li>
            <li> My husband has previously used this product and loved it. We cannot find it locally.</li>
            <li> This is a well balanced mixture of botanical and exfoliation If you can buy in bulk its worth it. Removing dead skin and leaving you refreshed. I guess it comes down to personal taste but for now its axe.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo&lt;br /&gt;I have never seeb this one in any Wal-Mart</li>
            <li> It cleans very well. Only downside is that I feel like this was meant to replace AXE Fever, and Axe Fever was my favorite shower gel.</li>

            <li> My husband loves Axe products. This is one of his fave body washes because he said the smell isn&#x27;t too overpowering and he also likes the &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; in it as it exfoliates his skin nicely. His comment when buying his Axe products....make sure it has 2 women on it instead of 1 lol (referring to the back of the label).</li>
            <li> My man smells amazing when he uses this and he loves that it gets him &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; clean with the exfoliating beads.</li>

Leaves my skin feeling soft without feeling greasy or lotiony.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this product. When I was single years ago and this was new, I used it all the time. It was at this time I started dating my wife and she loved the smell too. Well for whatever reason I started using cheaper stuff. Once I came back to this product, my wife was very happy and the scent brought back memories for her.</li>
            <li> This is by FAR my favorite Axe shower gel.  I love the smell, and I love the bonus exfoliating scrubbing stuff.  Some of the Axe shower gels are pretty weak/watery in strength or just your standard flowery/musky smell.  I found that all the ones that come in clear bottles are of better quality (notably more concentrated/luxurious with \\&quot;goodies\\&quot; in them), and this is the best and most \\&quot;luxurious\\&quot; of them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I add in some others for variety, but I have been using this scent as my favorite since the stuff came out (almost 10 years ago?).

The current common size is now 33% more &#x3D; 16oz.  Occasionally, you can find a bonus +50% size (18oz).</li>
            <li> I can see why they call this snake peel because its like getting new fresh skin it smells great. All the AXE scents are great but I think this is the best one .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this product, used it for years, but lately it&#x27;s gotten more expensive, &amp; no longer available in subscribe &amp; save as well.  Unfortunately, so have many others that I like, so it may be just time to downgrade</li>
            <li> This is honestly my favorite shower gel. It smells great, leaves me feeling refreshened after using it, and my girlfriend, well she loves the smell also.</li>
            <li> The product works fine, but I am not a fan of the scent. It seems like all Axe products, they over-do the perfume.  This is ok product, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again due to the scent</li>
            <li> TWO BOYS 15 &amp; 18 USE THIS PRODUCT EVERYDAY AND WON&#x27;T USE ANYTHING ELSE.&lt;br /&gt;BASEBALL AND SURFING , GREAT TO CLEAN &amp; SMELLS HANDSOME</li>
            <li> Bought for son who only likes Axe products. He says he doesn&#x27;t care much which fragrance, but when I stocked him up with a variety, I noticed he went to and is using this one first. It is an exfoliating scrub, very fine grained. It has a lighter scent, not so heavy on the musk. He can use the body sprays after without clash. Price was good compared to our local stores.</li>
            <li> This stuff is not for your niece Veronica.  It smells good and has some rocks and gravel in the mix so you know the bugs and tar are coming off of your body.  It is invigorating and like all Axe gels the smell stays close to the skin and is distinctive.  Clean smelling and just a bare hint of the scent you choose.  I like the smell of Snake Peel.  Good name too.</li>
            <li> The grit in this is good if you do manual labor as it cleans very well. Other than the the smell is great.</li>
            <li> Axe Shower Gel, Snake Peel, 16 Fluid Ounce is an awesome shower gel.  I use several of these scents, doesnt break me out even with my sensitive skin and smells great.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, Nostalgic! Had to order on Amazon &#x27;cause this scent isn&#x27;t available in the stores near me on the east coast. Anyways, it would be a perfect rating but, Why on Earth does AXE add little plastic beads into their products!? Yes it&#x27;s gritty and gets you clean but they could be made of something that is bio-degradable, these beads are made of little bits of PLASTIC! Then they go down into the water system where they never dissolve and further pollute our poor earth mother! :&#x27;( I feel like a total hypocrite using the product, but I am a very good smelling hypocrite -.-</li>
            <li> Putting aside, for the moment, the Axe marketing promises of the uncontrollable attention of attractive women, the Snake Peel gel is an effective product at a reasonable price.  I found the abrasive to be mild, but suitable for the purpose.  I recommend combining the use of Snake Peel with the blue side of the Buf-Puf Double-Sided Body Sponge for those of us with tougher hides.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Great liquid soap and it cleans your skin too.  You can feel it smoothing rough skin after just 2-3 uses.  and it smells great.  Or so I&#x27;m told.. :)</li>
            <li> LOVE this smell.  Great product all around.  very satisfied and buy this product consistently.  My teenage son loves it too and steals it from me every chance he gets.</li>
            <li> I am not normally picky when it comes to body-wash scents and this one had such great reviews that I decided to purchase it without having done so before.  I really wish I had sniffed different products at the store first.  This smells awful.  Seriously.  It smells as if they took every scent they had and mixed them all together.  It does actually work as a body wash, so I gave it two stars.</li>
            <li> Bought this and the new Old Spice Wolfthorn scented body wash at the same time and there&#x27;s no comparison. This one wins hands down. Recommended and I&#x27;ll be buying again in the future.</li>
