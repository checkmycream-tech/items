            <li> Glue was dried up, product is terrible, and had to throw the brush away after one use. Nails sent were garbage and all in all i regret wasting my money on it.. CRAP!!</li>
            <li> Good enough for beginers wished it came with brushes!!</li>
            <li> I received my stuff today and had everything BUT the brush, nails and The finger.....</li>
            <li> Im really in love with it i got it con time&lt;br /&gt;AMAZON its amazing  muaxx</li>
            <li> Well some of the items where spilled in the box and got on some of the other things in the box so it messed up some stuff.</li>
            <li> The kit was great! I really liked the amount of materials I had. The only issue with this kit is that the brush was way too small.</li>
            <li> Missing items out of my package very upset how am I supposed to do my nails with no glue and brush ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜ </li>
            <li> They helped when I had issues. The set was great.</li>
            <li> it was missing items not what I thought it would be. The acrylic bush was terrible. the product it self I rated very below grade.</li>
            <li> I recieved my package but im a little dissapointed that i only recieved the white tips and not the clear i think you should get what u order and what is supposed to be included</li>
            <li> Everything is as is stated..</li>
            <li> Nails don&#x27;t even stick. The aryrcle brush is too small. Aryrcle doesn&#x27;t smooth out drys too quick in clumps. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> The acrylic powders (pink, white, clear) they sent me is differ from the others in the picture and they contain a very minute amount , and I only received my white tips there is no clear tips </li>
            <li> Not what I expected...  very cheap and no instruction and took a very long to ship.</li>
            <li> Comes early... Everything is in it . But the acrylic and powder is soooo cheap . Dries too quickly so when you put it on your nail is really bumpy and not smooth . Looks nasty and ugly after the whole procedure.</li>
            <li> The package came quickly. The nails are thin and cheaply made. When it came both bottles of glue had either dried up or spilled out so I had to go by some more glue.</li>
            <li> Loved it, it came 5 days before the day it said it would be here. I got everything it shows on the pictures. One of the little glitters was spilling but I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Most of the items were damaged the drill stopped working after.a week</li>
            <li> Glue was completely dried and hard.! And contains less than 100 nails. Powders were completely spilled. Wouldnt recommend.</li>
            <li> Great!!!!!! I love it</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect I ordered the product for my grand daughter and she just loved it thsnk you</li>
            <li> love it save a lot of money</li>
            <li> The pink clear and white powder was deformed and wouldn&#x27;t open and the glue dried shut.</li>
            <li> the glue nail came dry .. everything is much smaller then what it looks like.. I&lt;br /&gt;really regret spending my money on these garbage... so disappointed</li>
            <li> I love the kit. For the price i really cant complain. I was missing the clear nails. And the acrylic powder is cheap but this is a great beginner kit if your just learning. Oh and it took forever to get here. Ordered it a few days after christmas and I got it February 2nd.</li>
            <li> Everything came in good condition. A couple rhinestones had fallen out of the container, but other than that every included item was as it should be. However, I didn&#x27;t get a brush. The description says a Sable brush will be included, but I didn&#x27;t get one. I think I got an extra file instead. Overall a good purchase for the price, I just wish the brush had been included.</li>
            <li> Very nice kit some things I couldn&#x27;t use because it was for my 10 year step daughter but for an adult it would be perfect</li>
            <li> Great! But did not received an acrylic brush :(</li>
