            <li> I am a chef, and between the dry weather and constantly washing my hands and washing dishes at work, my hands get so dry they start to bleed.</li>
            <li> The gloves are dry and brittle, with almost no moisturizer.</li>

            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> But by wearing these to bed once or twice a week I was able to eliminate the awful cracking/redness and have normal hands again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommend to buy and use after a hard day of walking and standing long</li>
            <li> We had a really harsh winter this year and my hands suffered.  </li>
            <li> This is obviously a different seller and I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My wife had a terrible skin situation which made it very difficult to use her hands.</li>

            <li> It is ok, but the one size makes it very large on my hands.  I much prefer the spa sensorial but those are almost non-existent at this point.</li>
            <li> Pamper me now!!! Perfect for spa parties</li>
            <li> These moisturizing gloves made my dry hands feel smooth and soft. I accidentally fell asleep with them and on and my hands stayed soft and smooth longer than with the 30 minute treatment. Shared with my sister and she ordered a case.</li>

            <li> absolutely wonderful. makes hands so soft and smooth. even gVE SOME TO MY DUGHTER AND HE LOVES THEM TOO.</li>
            <li> The gloves work well and when I&#x27;m done with them I use them when I&#x27;m washing dishes: an added bonus because the moisturizers left in the glove continue to soften my hands during chores.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay the socks are better</li>
            <li> Used after a hard day for fifteen minutes I liked the effect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to buy and use after a hard day of walking and standing long</li>

            <li> I am a chef, and between the dry weather and constantly washing my hands and washing dishes at work, my hands get so dry they start to bleed. Many lotions I&#x27;ve used make my hands start to burn and itch, so it was a huge relief to find these gloves. Just 30 minutes of wearing them and my crocodile skin has gone away!</li>
            <li> These are great and I  like them a lot.</li>
            <li> My wife had a terrible skin situation which made it very difficult to use her hands. These saved the day. While she did use some heavy duty gloves to remoisturize her hands, these gloves allowed her to do many everyday tasks, such as putting gas in the car and sorting through the mail.</li>
            <li> love it and also the moisturizing socks. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> These do a really good and quick job of moisturizing hands and mine were mega-dry and cracked.  It only takes 30 minutes per session.</li>
            <li> These gloves are an easy way to condition your hands at the end of the day.  A friend gave me a pair in a gift basket.  I in turn ordered 24 more on Amazon.  .</li>
            <li> They are OK but not great. My hands just felt like I spent too long in the pool. I was hoping for something much richer. I will continue to use what I have but wont buy again</li>
            <li> These will not work for dermatitis, eczema or psoriasis. They are plastic and contain ingredients that will irritate these conditions.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product before, and loved it.  This is obviously a different seller and I am very disappointed.  The gloves are dry and brittle, with almost no moisturizer. Total waste of money.</li>
