            <li>Certainly better than Crest 3-D&#x27;s version of teeth whitening.</li>

            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave teeth with that sensitve feeling I have experienced with other toothpaste products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a great product like the other Colgate products.</li>
            <li>Great Whitening and fast shipping and the only toothpaste that I use!</li>

            <li> /&gt;As long as you are careful and don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, this product may work well for you.</li>
            <li> , it also doesn&#x27;t bother my teeth as I have very sensitive teeth, I overall like the product , if your&#x27;re looking to mailing your white teeth or maybe whiten up a few shades than this is your product!</li>
            <li> After using for a few weeks his teeth look like they could have been professionally cleaned.</li>

            <li> but now the toothpaste is just like any other.</li>
            <li> But now it&#x27;s expensive and does not whiten teeth like the first batch.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of using a dark colored towel to get off the residue and the towel got bleached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But no more whitening strips.</li>
            <li> And no more expensive teeth whitening kits.</li>
            <li> And w/I the horrible sensitivity I got from Crest white strips!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for some time.</li>
            <li> I mix it with regular toothpaste and there has been a noticeable difference&lt;br /&gt;in the brightness of my teeth.  I would recommend this item.  The vendor&lt;br /&gt;was right on time with it as well.  What could be better!&lt;br /&gt;Linda M.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a tea drinker so my teeth tend to get discolored.  I was happy to find whitening toothpaste that seems to work for most folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I like this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It works.  I noticed my teeth getting whiter and brighter after only a week of use.&lt;br /&gt;* It makes my mouth tingle, so I feel that my teeth are getting clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this product contains hydrogen peroxide (the bleach), you do need to be careful when you wipe your mouth or get the toothpaste on your hands.  I made the mistake of using a dark colored towel to get off the residue and the towel got bleached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as you are careful and don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth, this product may work well for you.</li>
            <li> Great taste, great price.</li>
            <li> Great Whitening and fast shipping and the only toothpaste that I use! Shipping was fast and was a great was to stock up while deployed to Afghanistan! Doesn&#x27;t leave teeth with that sensitve feeling I have experienced with other toothpaste products. When used in conjunction with the mouthwash my teeth were a noticable several shades whiter and brighter! Wife (Dental Hygenist) is also very happy with my dental health with this combo!</li>
            <li> It really works to lighten stains, and tastes good. Also a good buy compared to stores.</li>
            <li> In just 2-3 brushings, you will notice significantly more brightness &amp; whiteness of your teeth.  This is GREAT stuff!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My teeth have never been as white as this toothpaste has made them!! I don&#x27;t even recognize my own teeth when I look in the mirror. Works much better than any other whitening  product I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
            <li> Works as fast as promised. I&#x27;m very pleasantly surprised. And w/I the horrible sensitivity I got from Crest white strips!</li>
            <li> This is the big size.. Great deal.</li>
            <li> Certainly better than Crest 3-D&#x27;s version of teeth whitening.</li>
            <li> I am a coffee and wine drinker, I love the way this toothpaste makes my teeth clean and remains white. I am only buying this type of toothpaste, been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Yes this toothpaste is more expensive than most others. But no more whitening strips. This is truly an amazing product that works, and fast. And no more expensive teeth whitening kits. Plus no time wasted finding time to use them, because you&#x27;ll get the same results by simply doing what you normally would do: brush your teeth twice a day. I will never go back to another toothpaste. It is a paste not a gel, and have used better tasting ones as it is a kind of strong toothpaste, and your basic mint flavor, so probably not good for toddlers. But the end result is worth it! Love it! Fantastic product...</li>
            <li> We have used this toothpaste since it first came out. I have shared it with other family members. Everyone likes the way it cleans and how it makes your teeth feel. We just really like it a lot and will continue to use it. It&#x27;s just a great product like the other Colgate products.</li>
            <li> Really whitens! My husbands teeth were stained by cigarette smoking and coffee. After using for a few weeks his teeth look like they could have been professionally cleaned. I love it too, definitely see a difference and haven&#x27;t noticed any sensitivity problems.</li>
            <li> I love it , it keeps my teeth super whitel</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect some miracle change with this product for instance whitening it by 4 shades, this product will not achieve that, maybe over time it will but this product is more of a maintain your teeth white after you have whitened them with a tooth whitener product, it doesn&#x27;t have the best taste either when it enters your mouth but it does make it feel clean after every usage, it also doesn&#x27;t bother my teeth as I have very sensitive teeth, I overall like the product , if your&#x27;re looking to mailing your white teeth or maybe whiten up a few shades than this is your product!</li>
            <li> Something has changed with the Optic White.  Could really see a difference with the first batch but now the toothpaste is just like any other.</li>
            <li> TOOTHPASTE IS AWESOME....pricing on Amazon needs to be better!!</li>
            <li> I feel the same as the former writer..This was great and whitened my teeth. But now it&#x27;s expensive and does not whiten teeth like the first batch.</li>
            <li> very happy,  beat running to store and great price I would order again. quick and easy I would advice everyone to buy here</li>
