            <li>/&gt;Review: I am a licensed hair stylist and I must say that this is an absolutely AMAZING shampoo!!</li>
            <li>I think it smells great, and although the shampoo knots my hair up, the conditioner is AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li>I have used the shampoo and conditioner for about 1 week and find it to be incredibly conditioning.  </li>
            <li>the box was a bit damaged but the product inside was in perfect shape and has worked great.</li>
            <li>The shampoo made my hair incredibly tangled.</li>
            <li>this is a good one, but keep in mind what works for one person may not work for another!</li>
            <li>It smells good though!</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my niece and she loved it!</li>
            <li>Good luck ladies and gents!</li>
            <li>I hope some of you have gotten longer, beautiful hair since I made the review.</li>
            <li>The products smell good, and leave my hair feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>Transaction went great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy either way but will not purchase again.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s really happy with it because she had been expressing some concerns about the fineness of her hair and that it was thinning.. but not anymore    </li>
            <li>But this isn&#x27;t uncommon</li>
            <li>So it is great for washing your hair</li>
            <li>and the smell is great,</li>
            <li>I have color treated hair and it doesn&#x27;t do a great job at conditioning my hair</li>
            <li>And happy growing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>lol</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>

            <li>I was stunned and quite happy.</li>
            <li>and I think they&#x27;re great</li>
            <li>I thought everything was great until I thoroughly studied the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>it was great.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this is the best shampoo ever.</li>
            <li>I know her hair looks great.</li>
            <li>began using this product about a month ago, and although I have not done any measurements I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>It smells great</li>
            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>works great.</li>
            <li>They were very nice about it and promptly refunded my money</li>
            <li>this is a very nice product.</li>
            <li>if the code I was given doesn&#x27;t work for you just email them, they are very nice and helpful</li>
            <li>It foams up very nicely</li>
            <li>and I think it smells very nice.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>This is amazing stuff!</li>
            <li>:) &lt;3</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut my hair into a pixi style and I liked it for a day!</li>
            <li>Love this product it is awesome.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome at making your hair healthy.</li>
            <li>I liked it!</li>
            <li>The hair gets kind of unbreakable!</li>
            <li>Good luck to you!! :)</li>
            <li>If you choose to use this product any way, the smell is somewhat pleasant  </li>
            <li>I used it to review it first an loved it! :D</li>
            <li>The product smells wonderful, but I have fine hair and it often made my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li>Over all it is a good product</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it felt this good</li>
            <li>It is important t use both the Shampoo and Conditioner together for best results.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this product years ago</li>
            <li>good hair makes you feel good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about couple of days that i have been using this shampoo and conditioner and already seeing really good results.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a good sign.</li>
            <li>Suds good.</li>
            <li>A good example of the dangers of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Cocamide DEA is your children&#x27;s bubble bath.</li>
            <li>I choose this product because I have watched a lot of YouTube videos and the people that have tried it themselves loved the product.</li>
            <li>I would of gave it a good go</li>
            <li>no complains about the shipping, i got it on time and all good.</li>
            <li>The shampoo dries out my hair, the conditioner weighs it down--not a good combination for my scalp/hair type.</li>
            <li>good product but never worked for me.</li>
            <li>Good luck people.</li>
            <li>I also take a multi vitamin and drink lots of H2O. Good luck ladies/gents.</li>
            <li>loved it will buy again</li>
            <li>I have baby hairs growing at a fairly rapid rate.  </li>
            <li>but surprisingly my boyfriend loves the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>shine, thickness, gorgeous all around.</li>
            <li>This will insure that you are applying the product on your scalp really good.</li>
            <li>Massage it in really good and then rinse it all out.</li>
            <li>but it smell good in my opinion, but</li>
            <li>and I have to say I have grown a good length just by looking at the roots.</li>
            <li>Some were good</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the good news.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Those were good 6 inches.</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and conditioned after use, and it smells awesome throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I just started the biotin &amp; MSM which are thought to both work together for hair growth in an exceptional way.</li>
            <li>About 7 people have asked if I got hair extentions which is really great :).....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner since February, and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>I am NOT an employee of Nisim, just a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the results.</li>

            <li>I already am in love with this product!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>I just hope I can afford to buy more soon!</li>
            <li>Love it, and I can&#x27;t wait for my hair to start growing!</li>
            <li>Makes your hair so healthy looking!</li>
            <li>Will write more on the growth in about six weeks!</li>
            <li>there are many variables involved in having a really beautiful healthy head of hair</li>
            <li>( I had an itchy, oily scalp before ), more manageable, and pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li>My hair grew about an inch or so each month which was amazing</li>
            <li>I have heard amazing things about this product</li>
            <li>and you can buy at the hairdressers that worked great with fabulous results.</li>
            <li>smells amazing</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if I was looking for an amazing smelling hair product</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own...</li>
            <li>I really liked this product</li>
            <li>I tried many conditioners but they were never as good as this one. .</li>
            <li>The hair growth is nice, but not for the price of my hair falling out.</li>
            <li>Love this system you get good results</li>
            <li>Have been using Fast shampoo and conditioner for about one month now and have noticed hair growth and thickening that I am very happy with!</li>
            <li>It was at this point that I began using FAST shampoo and conditioner and am very happy with the results!</li>
            <li>plus it smells so good :)</li>
            <li>it looked nice after 1st use.</li>
            <li>She is thrilled</li>
            <li>, I tried every kind of oil, shampoo, and cream.</li>
            <li>The shampoo smelled nice.</li>
            <li>Overpriced, to be honest.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is really nice and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I did not rate this product, because I did not purchase it, but I just thought I would say a lot of the comments are saying there hair grew 1-2 inches in a month, but my hair grows about 1-2 inches a month on its own, so Idk how this is helping, it seems all</li>
            <li>Please use at your own cautions.&lt;br /&gt;Ok</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice shampoo</li>
            <li>I liked what I saw and decided to give it a&lt;br /&gt;Try.</li>
            <li>This stuff gives you that kind of dryness.</li>
            <li>I first bought it because all of the wonderful reviews, i went through two bottles thinking that it needed more time and to be honest</li>
            <li>Great product and worth the price!</li>
            <li>It sounded really good but maybe too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff, ordering more!</li>
            <li>The smell was nothing impressive but still fresh and clean</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>My hair felt soft and it was shiny, an the best part my hair grew 1 1/2 inch in a month.</li>
            <li>extracts\\&quot; in an attractive, earth-tonish, environmentally friendly bottle, is a safe and healthy choice for washing hair.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel thicker ( I have very fine hair).</li>
            <li>so my hair is very fine.</li>
            <li>Sulfate is the subject of great controversy and the cause of the greatest concern to many scientists.</li>
            <li>glad i got it because my hair feels amazing:)</li>
            <li>HAPPY NEW YEARS!!!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with FAST!!!</li>
            <li>I am very perplexed about this product.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly it conditions really well!!</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner smell pleasant, very clean, and fresh.</li>
            <li>I was super excited for this product, thinking it was going to be great for my hair and give it a boost in its hair growth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference!</li>
            <li>I waited two months before writing this review because I wanted it to be accurate!  </li>
            <li>so glad.</li>
            <li>and my hair grows slower then most, but I was looking forward to this product</li>
            <li>and I am hoping to get the same beautiful results as I did then!</li>
            <li>Every time I take a shower, I noticed my hair falling out way more than it used to be..  </li>
            <li>I felt like my hair was growing faster, but was sure I was making it up until my boyfriends daughter (age 4) said it had.</li>
            <li>I love dying my hair, and decided to start bleaching it for colors.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>/&gt;But, in the end i&#x27;m still satisfied and will continue to use this</li>
            <li>it made it grow faster and longer, but my hair isnt fuller or healthy..</li>
            <li>it really helped my hair to look healthy and grow about a 1\\&quot; but it looks great</li>
            <li>it was that my hair started falling out more.</li>
            <li>I doubt I&#x27;ll be ordering more of this product after it&#x27;s finished.</li>
            <li>So I purchased this because so many reviews were giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I am hoping to see more growth as an added bonus :)</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I found this product, bought it, and fell in love.</li>
            <li>I have noticed hair growth and it looks really healthy.</li>
            <li>and i noticed that it&#x27;s more shinier and more manageable</li>
            <li>My senior year I got extensions, but those seemed to damage my hair more than it was worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>F.A.S.T is just fabulous!</li>
            <li>Only the very best hair stylists in Chicago can even do my hair and most of them have like 30 yrs of experience and owns salons themselves.</li>
            <li>it will break off for most of us.</li>
            <li>I think the company (Nisim) must have worked on the scent, because it is quite lovely.</li>
            <li>recommended. :)</li>
            <li>I am completely IN LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li>It feels so light and soft which is wonderful considering</li>
            <li>:) but overall, great shampoo and conditioner, TRY IT!</li>
            <li>SO FIVE STARS FROM ME :)</li>
            <li>I received F.A.S.T. in a very timely manner and the product is great.  </li>
            <li>My hair was just touching the tops of my shoulders.</li>
            <li>The healthier your body is, the more efficiently it will operate - and grow that</li>
            <li>feel I should let future buyers know that this product, while wonderful, can fade hair color.  </li>
            <li>Healthy hair will grow faster than using this product which dries out your hair</li>
            <li>but I decided that my hair would be able to handle it.</li>
            <li>I should have known better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li>But it sure didn&#x27;t do anything for hair loss or growing your hair longer or thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have some lighter carmel highlights in my hair, so I will be able to see my growth.</li>
            <li>I noticed that many people mentioned that a lot of their hair fell out</li>
            <li>and I do feel that it has been growing more since I have been using it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>And then to top t off i havnt seen a change in my hair grown at all, but i will still give it a try for another 30 days to see.</li>
            <li>the more I use it the more</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li>Awesome I look like a blonde Jesus.</li>
            <li>After the first use, I noticed a remarkable difference in the appearance of my hair.</li>
            <li>I sooooooooo love this shampoo</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I switched or thought something else would bring better results, however I learned my lesson and it won&#x27;t happen again.</li>
            <li>and it was ok,</li>
            <li>It gives me more appointment oriented haircuts, also.  </li>
            <li>Using the shampoo for my first time was amazing!</li>
            <li>I really love this shampoo and conditioner set, I think it did wonders for my hair</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the relaxing medicinal spa scent and gel like consistency of the cream.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>My hair feels more stronger</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo &amp; Conditioner for growing hair fast.</li>
            <li>I had better luck with mane n tail.</li>
            <li>but overall it was great !</li>
            <li>Okay so i just bought f.a.s.t.</li>
            <li>I tried to put more shampoo thinking</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This time, however, I will learn from my mistakes! :)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;then again I didn&#x27;t buy it for the smell&amp;#34; It smells like most shampoo that doesn&#x27;t have perfume in it.</li>
            <li>will stop my hair from breaking off therefore making it longer :)</li>
            <li>I ordered one more shampoo but skipped the conditioner-it doesn&#x27;t do much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair has become a bit more healthier and has grown about .75 of an inch.</li>
            <li>&quot; that is \\&quot;average\\&quot; to most people.  </li>
            <li>Looks to me more like 1/4\\&quot; based on the line I see.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner are ok and I will continue to use it up</li>
            <li>It says what it does :)</li>
            <li>Just as described and will purchase from again! :)</li>
            <li>I just ordered some more</li>
            <li>Not too sure.</li>
            <li>I still have to wait and see if more hair grows out and if existing hair grows as promised.</li>
            <li>VO5 SHAMPOO WORKS BETTER AND IS 95% CHEAPER</li>
            <li>The smell is okay.</li>
            <li>Then use a more moisturized conditioner that works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair texture is more of a &#x27;Z&#x27; pattern than it is an &#x27;S&#x27; pattern.</li>
            <li>love it a lot..</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells while I&#x27;m using it; the way my hair smells afterwards.</li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy, hydrated and with volume.  </li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>I am glad I read the review that stated it strips the color out of color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo and conditioner because i had to cut my hair because of chemical damage more than 5 months ago.</li>
            <li>I&lt;br /&gt;Proceeded to darken it allow my hair to become healthy again.</li>
            <li>This product is magic</li>
            <li>When I did use aussie 3 minute repair conditioner however the results were even better.</li>
            <li>and I just ordered more to keep it growing.</li>
            <li>Alright so I read many reviews before purchasing.</li>
            <li>She loves it, so I love it as well.</li>
            <li>and I think it gave me more split ends than I had before</li>
            <li>better--</li>
            <li>my co-workers were able to tell a difference when they had not seen me for a week.</li>
            <li>Maybe if the bottles had lasted longer I would have noticed more of  a difference over more time.</li>
            <li>I see people mostly mentioning how it dries your hair out.</li>
            <li>product works for me, and I love it.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft, so shiny and healthy looking, and extremely beautiful.</li>
            <li>She read that it had a foul smell, but honestly it just has a really clean fragrance...</li>
            <li>So far so good, and I am also very pleased with product and am going to stick to it to observe results.</li>
            <li>I tried to ignore it because, after the first wash, my hair felt SO GOOD.</li>
            <li>it lathered pretty well and worked good</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li>This product is good, I just got it, my first time using it, when i rinsed out the shampoo</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited about this shampoo and conditioner that I&#x27;ve told everyone I know about it!</li>
            <li>i was so excited!</li>
            <li>Nisim FAST just didn&#x27;t do it for me, it was a good shampoo and does help hair growth but just has too many chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>But it is great for growing out your hair naturally!</li>
            <li>so I guess there really is no miricle here because what good does it do if it&#x27;s growing in at the roots but breaking off at the ends!?!?</li>
            <li>light, refreshing flowery smell.   </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;great, makes my hair feel healthy, shiny, tangle free, but</li>
            <li>the smell is great and naturally is straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>it really feels good on your scalp though</li>
            <li>its soft and smooth and shiny and looks very healthy!</li>
            <li>and it hasn&#x27;t even been a full month yet!</li>
            <li>but overall it is a good product!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this product, after many years of looking for things to help with my hair growth.</li>
            <li>My hair has grown out very quickly.</li>
            <li>After using this product my hair was easy to comb.</li>
            <li>Makes it feel really healthy and clean.</li>
            <li>and I actually liked FAST a lot more.</li>
            <li>Being that I dye my hair, it is easy to see the growth line at the root.  </li>
            <li>Leaving soft &amp; tangle free, with a great scent.</li>
            <li>it also has a really strong scent</li>
            <li>:) I will update review in about couple of weeks but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t care for the smell (like strong laundry detergent).</li>
            <li>when i first started using this stuff i liked it</li>
            <li>It is full of vitamins to help your scalp become healthy with massaging it and</li>
            <li>The conditioner makes my hair very smooth and soft :) I even received compliments about how healthy and smooth my hair looked :)</li>
            <li>My hair type is fine (but I have a lot of hair).</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been fine.</li>
            <li>, I thought the smell was fine.</li>
            <li>and Caucasians were fine.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>But you guys should know that this is not some super magical product.</li>
            <li>anyone wants to ask me more about this product before considering buying it; please do!</li>
            <li>Almost any new shampoo/conditioner you buy is going to make your hair feel good, (unless it&#x27;s really cheap stuff )because it always happens when you switch products.</li>
            <li>All of that stopped after the very first use!</li>
            <li>I could see a huge difference in my hair after one use.  </li>
            <li>I have seen a huge improvement from this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for two weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any huge change to my hair growth yet.  </li>
            <li>Title says it all, but to explain it breifly; its cheap shampoo that was put in a bottle that claims to help you grow or keep hair that you have.</li>
            <li>Taking biotin supplements with this will help, and you can get them cheap over-the-counter.  </li>
            <li>But this product is Great overall.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner is amazing because my hair is so much manageable after i use it.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>it was worth the harmless side effects i love this product.</li>
            <li>No matter my skin is amazing thanks to these products</li>
            <li>In fact, my hair felt so silky smooth after I used it.</li>
            <li>It is used so freely by manufacturers as it is a cheap detergent that produces a lot of foam and bubbles which we all equate with cleansing.</li>
            <li>I thought hey, why not see if they sell hair growth products on here for cheap?</li>
            <li>also wanted to mention Nisim has come out with a sulfate, paraben free verison</li>
            <li>code I used for the free samples:&lt;br /&gt;FAST</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The natural oils are really good for your hair.</li>
            <li>For some background information, you should know that I used to have long, beautiful hair that reached all the way to my waist.</li>
            <li>Soon after, I began to straighten my naturally curly hair (in an effort to fit in and look good).</li>
            <li>anything natural gets points from me and it smells so good will stick on your hair .</li>
            <li>I have been  using this shampoo for a month-so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far I have had good observed results using the conditioner and shampoo.</li>
            <li>I am very happy that brought FAST because with in a week my hair actually grew</li>
            <li>It really works!!!  </li>
            <li>hairs\\&quot; have grown back and the best part is the hair is growing back strong and not breaking off!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, noticed a huge difference!</li>
            <li>(my hair was like 1/8 of an inch long lol)</li>
            <li>But i&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>My hair grew significantly faster and looked heathly while using it.</li>
            <li>Although she said it was well worth it!</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the product.</li>
            <li>For me, the conditioner worked great for ALL of my hair, so long as I used a leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I imagine that cocktail in the bottle that promotes hair growth may not be friendly to color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for about 15 years now, and most of those have been home dye jobs, so my hair was pretty frizzy.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to order this.</li>
            <li>and I was really excited.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and believe it does help my hair grow faster plus it looks healthier than it had in the past 5 months.</li>
            <li>I noticed the first wash that my scalp looked healthy</li>
            <li>Worth a try!</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean after I use it.</li>
            <li>, it smells clean after.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product not really expecting much, but I was greatly surprized!</li>
            <li>&quot; felt clean.</li>
            <li>The smell is clean and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>, THIS PRODUCT MAKES MY HAIR FEEL SO SILKY AND STAYS CLEAN WAY LONGER THEN</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced dry hair like everyone else, but then again, I like to apply moisturizer to my hair the minute I get out the shower.</li>
            <li>but I like it because the shampoo feels like it strips your hair clean and the conditioner renutritions it</li>
            <li>It smells nice and makes my hair feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Great value, although it will dry your hair out.</li>
            <li>Also, my hair feels more manageable and it is very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>if its not greasy it&#x27;s still clean.</li>
            <li>Getting long, healthy hair takes time and patience for people like me who&#x27;s hair just wont grow at all!!</li>
            <li>I have gone a more clean and pure way and am now using Renpure 14 day keratin treatment shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Shipping was excellent came the next day without paying for next day arrival and the product itself is fantastic will deffinetly be ordering more very soon!</li>
            <li>amazing results so far.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t say my hair felt softer but it stayed normal, smelled good and grew fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>People were giving it 5 stars based on the fact their hair was so much silkier, and healthy.</li>
            <li>I have never come across a product that I love this much.</li>
            <li>full length hairs with the follicle attached (STILL...2 MONTHS after I stopped using it.)</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the shampoo &amp; conditioner smelled.</li>
            <li>I loved this combo so much, I came back to order more.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found any shampoos or conditioners that have really made my hair feel and look...so healthy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s grown a full inch.</li>
            <li>I caucasian and bought this product for both my own hair and my 5 year old daughter who gave herself a haircut.  </li>
            <li>but it is true</li>
            <li>I give Nisim Fast three stars, though, because many have said it does work for them and though it did not work for me, I do not want to say that it does not work for everyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update after a full month of using.</li>
            <li>the FAST sulfate-free shampoo - Like that better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;BUT, I am not quite sure if it really helps my hair growth like they advertise.</li>
            <li>I googled FAST shampoo and many results came up.</li>
            <li>did I know how much I would come to love those two bottles.</li>
            <li>After 4 weeks of using both the shampoo and conditioner my hair grew a full inch.</li>
            <li>so I continued to do that and used this shampoo and conditioner every time I washed my hair for a full month.  </li>
            <li>Leave the FAST conditioner on for about 2 or more minutes and then rinse.</li>
            <li>and she got a full inch at the end of 28 days.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m loving this product, my mother has started using it too</li>
            <li>The FAST is much more affordable--</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had time to measure my hair to see if it really extend my hair lenghth , but one thing for sure about this shampoo is that it improves</li>
            <li>Stick with vitamins, deep conditioning treatments, a good shampoo and conditioner, use oils (I use jajobaoil) and drink lots of water.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s only fair</li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of a beauty salon but its not bad.</li>
            <li>I thought that a good way to keep track of how much hair was growing in a month using the shampoo and cond combo would be to measure the new gray hair growth.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and can really tell a difference with the way my hair feels silkier, smoother, and it really has grown!!</li>
            <li>My main issue with this product is that it made me LOSE more hair than grow hair.</li>
            <li>However, you will most likely lose more strands of hair in the shower for a week or two until your hair adjusts to the formula.  </li>
            <li>so I was pretty amazed that it lasted exactly a month (could have even done a day or two more).</li>
            <li>I have very thick,coarse,kind of poofy hair that already grows kind of fast.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Just make sure that you brush your hair more often on these days, than regular, so the oils and get to your ends.     </li>
            <li>I love this product and I&#x27;m definitely going to be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li>Over a year ago i got a perm, this damaged my hair tremendously.</li>
            <li>Since I am pregnant, I will be waiting until I deliver my baby to start my hair growth vitamins with this product to help keep my hair healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I give it 3 stars because my hair has grown quickly, but I might have to&lt;br /&gt;Cut</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably continue to use this product for a couple more months and then switch back to sulfate free shampoo!</li>
            <li>My hair felt nice and smelled good at least.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for healthy look.</li>
            <li>I thought long hair was the only beautiful kind, and that I couldn&#x27;t be completely pretty without it.</li>
            <li>Love it so far!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten such great results fun any so-called hair growth system as I did with Nissim Fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whenever I first tried this, it made my hair so silky and smooth</li>
            <li>I noticed the FIRST DAY I used it that it made my hair feel amazingly soft and light!!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased that my hair had finally reached my belly button.</li>
            <li>I used the FAST conditioner on top of another conditioner of my own, and the oils I put into my hair on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>It left my roots feeling very clean and oil-free; which is really great, especially during Summer.</li>
            <li>I took prenatal vitamins when I heard that they encouraged the growth of new cells, more specifically, hair cells.</li>
            <li>After 4 more weeks, not even a 1/4 inch of new growth.</li>
            <li>my hair has also got thicker and softer so use it great for black people.</li>
            <li>I would probably buy the FAST shampoo and conditioner again as I like how easy my hair is to handle after using it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time user and will continue to use both the shampoo and conditioner!  </li>
            <li>arnt they saposed to text this stuff on animals first!</li>
            <li>I first used this product about four years ago and it worked so well!</li>
            <li>The only thing I see as a downfall is my first lather isn&#x27;t very lathery (lol)</li>
            <li>, i have already used a whole bottle of both the shampoo and conditioner, no results!!</li>
            <li>BUT, overall, it has grown more than 2 inches!</li>
            <li>It really does work!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll update after I&#x27;ve used it for a month, but so far I&#x27;m super pleased.</li>
            <li>my hair is already extremely fine and straight</li>
            <li>worth it.</li>
            <li>I like this product, it makes my hair look so healthy and soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>all this is really worth the money.</li>
            <li>I believe the shampoo is worth it just for how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Nice to find a product that actually does what it claims.</li>
            <li>My hair loves it      - I rarely use heat on my hair and when I do, I use a heat defence product.      </li>
            <li>My hair grew a full inch in the first month, and its health has improved as well.</li>
            <li>This is the result of the effect of Propylene Glycol which is to repel important components necessary for healthy skin and scalp, including moisturizing water, and to act as a synthetic replacement for the moisture which the body cannot assimilate.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the price but don&#x27;t expect to have rapunzel hair overnight.</li>
            <li>Some people it may work for, but I have such damaged hair roots that it&#x27;s kind of a lost cause at this point.</li>
            <li>I actually had many, many people tell me how much faster my hair was growing after I started using this shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In terms of lengthening my hair, well I have to continue using both bottles, but so far I do see a difference :)</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the 25 bucks</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t say too much about how much my hair grew since i just started today, but i will continue using this just because of how healthy my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li>But I honestly I cannot wait to go back to no sulfate and organic shampoo</li>
            <li>It suds up pretty good and doesn&#x27;t make my hair dry.</li>
            <li>thanks to this AMAZING product, my hair is no down to my chest.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>atleast just to say, it worked, but no, very disappointed.</li>
            <li>However, the very first thing I noticed the first time I used</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wishes to get long, healthy hair faster!</li>
            <li>Short hair was cute, long hair was gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a lot of hair falling out while I am in the shower but not any other time which is good.</li>
            <li>one or the other is good.</li>
            <li>Dont give up on it right away.</li>
            <li>, I noticed that my hair fell out right before a growth spurt.  </li>
            <li>This stuff does work if you use it right.</li>
            <li>He was right</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>it does it right away..</li>
            <li>It dries mine out enough that it actually looks nice and healthy, and it&#x27;s still nice looking the next day.</li>
            <li>I look like Mr. Clean hahaha.</li>
            <li>BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES CLEAN YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li>Amazon definitely has the best pricing for this product but for me it is not worth the money.</li>
            <li>However this is a problem VERY EASY to solve applying  conditioners and deep treatments for you type of hair(DON&#x27;T use oil treatment on your scalp.</li>
            <li>and I really noticed a change even though I used it only twice a week :) extra hair growth with good scalp sensation?</li>
            <li>Happy to report my hair is able to be pulled back into a little stump.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very shiny, full and bouncy even if my hair wasn&#x27;t growing I would use this product.</li>
            <li>It has grown about what I expected to do and I am very pleased with that.</li>
            <li>Not sure if they truley worked or not, but is still a great shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Even my mom&#x27;s been using it and her hair is gorgeous and dark.</li>
            <li>hair appears strong and I don&#x27;t have to get my hair trimmed as often but that could be because I chopped most of my hair off due to damaged before I started using this product.</li>
            <li>the only positive thing is that it has a pretty nice smell...</li>
            <li>but it certainly works for me!</li>
            <li>But soon after I washed it I would blow dry it &amp; it was amazingly tame-able.</li>
            <li>So far it has given me results that I would say surpass my own natural process of hair growth, with diligent care (including supplements, hair trims, reducing heat to my hair).</li>
            <li>Nicely packaged, very neat &amp; simple.</li>
            <li>my daughter loves it and swears it is making her hair grow super fast.</li>
            <li>I bought this product hoping it would grow my hair out super fast like some people clamed it would.</li>
            <li>Every night, I would shower and shampoo like normal, but making sure to massage the product more carefully into my scalp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to try Nioxin instead because I heard that stuff works very very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As far as a shampoo and conditioner it was fine.</li>
            <li>and if you go to their facebook page and click the \\&quot;click here for special offers\\&quot; in red top mid of page you can get this set for $20 with free</li>
            <li>The shipping came relatively fast!</li>
            <li>I had only been using it for a month and someone that I hadn&#x27;t seen in about a month asked me if I had gotten hair extentions :)</li>
            <li>--NEVER in the shower--and from the first use, I was picking out tons of hair from the drain every time I showered.</li>
            <li>haha!</li>
            <li>How many times have you bought something only to find out</li>
            <li>and it really did!</li>
            <li>However, I only gave four stars because I think I am loosing my hair more.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly; shampooing twice, hot water, etc.</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>this might by the first time I&#x27;ve done it.</li>
            <li>This is my first Amazon purchased.</li>
            <li>I first was thinking about getting hair extensions but didn&#x27;t want to spend all that mula</li>
            <li>I used it for almost exactly two months.</li>
            <li>it takes my not-so-managable mane, and makes it soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li>Pretty Hair is Parched.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had read numerous reviews saying that it made people&#x27;s hair shed more and it was drying</li>
            <li>but now I have constant itching and flaking and on top of that</li>
            <li>Most people tend to think that a shampoo bottle whether sold in a health food store or not, which costs four times as much as a regular shampoo, with pictures of flowers and the labels \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; and \\&quot;herbal</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s put my hair in better shape.</li>
            <li>I overly used it the first time.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this product to keep my hair growing just as advertised- FAST!</li>
            <li>However, after using this shampoo for a month now I actually like the way it makes my hair feel better then</li>
            <li>First off,</li>
            <li>but I am just glad that it actually works.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I was hooked.</li>
            <li>so I know my exact growth rate to be 1/2 inch per month.</li>
            <li>I used it exactly as directed.</li>
            <li>We also take a daily biotin supplement to help our hair along just a bit more.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a dream and</li>
            <li>its seem to have many mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>An I would also use a leave in conditioner for extra moisture : )</li>
            <li>and i got it in the mail so fast!</li>
            <li>I bought this and after the first use I decided not to use it.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using FAST my family and friends have told me that my hair looks longer, after one week!</li>
            <li>First I have to say that all beauty items are subjective.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really to rave about this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in that goofy state between short and medium length</li>
            <li>Overall I love the shampoo and the conditioner</li>
            <li>I contacted the company directly to see if they could offer any free samples that way</li>
            <li>I purchased this about 2 months ago and my hair has really grown!</li>
            <li>i really think that whats in the bottle is not whats on the label!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much better product than you can buy at your local hair salon!</li>
            <li>I got this last week I have washed my hair three times sometimes more with</li>
            <li>AS THIS PRODUCT REALLY DOES NOT MAKE YOUR HAIR GROW!</li>
            <li>So when I first heard about this product I did not believe that it would work at all.</li>
            <li>After the first couple of times I thought it was alright.</li>
            <li>me tell you, my hair did grow and it happened within the first two weeks of using this product.</li>
            <li>so I could not continue as I did the first two week.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has just restored softness and health to my hair all around on top of actually helping it grow faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like my hair was growing any faster when I was using this consistently.</li>
            <li>My hair is growing so much faster!</li>
            <li>I had a big night coming up and didn&#x27;t want to lose latest wash-in color, so I waited to use it.</li>
            <li>I rated this 4 because I just used it for the first time</li>
            <li>pretty</li>
            <li>It really has been heaven sent for shedding hair!</li>
            <li>I think it works really well!</li>
            <li>I can now get most of my hair in some form of a ponytail (although it is a rather short one) and was even confident that I had enough length to get the layers</li>
            <li>I bought this and started using the first week of January</li>
            <li>I love this product it definitely works.</li>
            <li>The product did exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li>When I first started, it was at 3 1/2..</li>
            <li>I do suggest investing in a quality leave-in conditioner for the extra moisture for your ends if you do like to use heat (and of course a heat protectant) to keep your hair as healthy as possible. :)</li>
            <li>product and I will be back for more when I run out..</li>
            <li>It smells funny</li>
            <li>will say my hair grew about and inch within the first month.</li>
            <li>This most likely is contributing to the growth.</li>
            <li>I liked how it made my hair feel really silky and thicker, didnt dry my hair out or anything.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited that my own hair has grown quite a bit in the past month as well.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this product once so far, but it was amazing.</li>
            <li>even when my hair is back to my desired length, I will continue to order nisim fast because of how healthy my hair is.</li>
            <li>, afro/carribbean, dry, super thick hair and my hair really looks awesome now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s overall a good product I would definitely try it again</li>
            <li>This shampoo will only provide the fast growth, you need to complement it with conditioners to keep your hair healthy.</li>
            <li>There is a thick substance that covers your hair (is the best way I can think to describe it) when you shampoo and condition with this which actually increases the diameter of the hair follicle!</li>
            <li>However, it leaves my hair silky and healthy looking after each use and the conditioner is light enough to not weigh down my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Even my hubby uses it and his hair won&#x27;t stop growing and its super soft too!</li>
            <li>I did not notice any positive difference after two bottles of use.</li>
            <li>I started using fast shampoo and conditioner in July and for the first time \\&quot;what lil hair</li>
            <li>I receive compliments all the time about how healthy, shiny and long it is.</li>
            <li>I was using shampoos that was for long hair like Garnier Length &amp; Strength, the Mane&#x27;n Tail shampoo that I have used before many times, and even Alberto VO5 that has 5 vitamins -2 being Biotin &amp; Niacin that thickens and promotes hair growth.</li>
            <li>My hair grew pretty well fast.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to everyone that wants to grow there hair FAST!</li>
            <li>and I do believe I&#x27;ve seen some improvement with length and softer texture in my daughters hair as well as my own after only a few washes :)</li>
            <li>I actually purposely colored my hair so I can better document growth and my color stayed as vibrant as day one.</li>
            <li>My hair got cut REALLY short in 7th grade for locks of love, and now a sophomore in high school, it was shoulder length, but</li>
            <li>during this most recent summer, my hair was probably right at shoulder length, if not a little shorter.</li>
            <li>though I agree with most reviewers it does dry out your scalp.</li>
            <li>After just one use of this stuff, my hair was super silky &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>when you wash w/ this shampoo&amp;conditioner it gets SUPER soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>-  Yes, it did dry my hair out a bit, but not horribly so.  </li>
            <li>This product made my hair even more dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li>It most defiantly didn&#x27;t dry my hair out</li>
            <li>I noticed no extra growth more than normal.</li>
            <li>hair is coming back to normal and more....</li>
            <li>This product does dry out your hair so make sure you use a leave in conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li>Every one is different so is the texture and length of hair but this shampoo change it to bouncy, long, good smelling hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if you have to use a product like this for a certain amount of time before noticing a result</li>
            <li>I can say that my hair is certainly healthier and appears to be stronger than before.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that my hair was coming out in large amounts in the shower.</li>
            <li>My hair seems to be growing faster in certain areas</li>
            <li>I purcahsed this package back in August the first time i used to it really enjoyed how soft and silky my hair was.</li>
            <li>It seems like it&#x27;s working, but it hasn&#x27;t quite been a month yet, so I do want to continue this shampoo for a few more months!</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed with the product, the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the product did not live up to it&#x27;s name, as I said before it did not make my hair grow faster, but it did leave it shiny and smooth, which is never a bad thing in my book.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s abundant thanks to my black side.</li>
            <li>Overall, good for your hair and smells nice, but not sure it actually promotes growth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle and my hair has grown significantly since I first started using it.</li>
            <li>When I measured my hair from roots to the end of my new growth, I had 3 full inches of new hair growth.</li>
            <li>This provides a large margin of freedom for manufacturers to formulate their products without too much government interference.  </li>
            <li>I have a mix of coarse curly hair and fine stick straight hair.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who wants their hair to grow fast!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really write an accurate review because I only tried it twice.</li>
            <li>and I have already noticed a few amazing changes in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if its in my head or what, but this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I really hope this product works.</li>
            <li>After using these products, my hair felt waxy, and the stuff smelled like Nair (how ironic).  </li>
            <li>Update K so now its been 2 and 1/2 months since i have been using nisim&#x27;s FAST about 3-4 times per week, and yes it does make your hair grow</li>
            <li>I also really think that my hormones had somthing to do with the way it grew because the weeks that I was PMSing</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really shed all that much</li>
            <li>I was really fooled...</li>
            <li>My hair has always been really oily..</li>
            <li>Will have to wait and see whether or not the product really works.</li>
            <li>My hair really did grow a lot faster and healthier.</li>
            <li>Takes time but after 4 weeks, you can tell the hair has grown fast.</li>
            <li>I used Pantene Pro V before this product and my hair wouldn&#x27;t fall out as much.</li>
            <li>It was so brittle and lifeless that I couldn&#x27;t even really run my fingers through it.</li>
            <li>Eventually, I decided to give FAST a shot</li>
            <li>How ironic...</li>
            <li>My hair is so much easier to style</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much softer now.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li>But this is coming from someone who pays very close attention to her hair.</li>
            <li>In conclusion, the product didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>My hair has grown so much faster</li>
            <li>WHEN I CAME HOME LOOKED UP SOME FAST HAIR GROWTH PRODUCTS AND SEEN ALOT OF REVIEWS ON THIS ONE</li>
            <li>I did notice that my hair grew, but so much of my hair fell out while washing it that it made me regret using the shampoo.</li>
            <li>but once I repeat with the shampoo it lathers very easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like Renpure&#x27;s \\&quot;My</li>
            <li>I really like Garnier Sleek and Shine Smoothing Milk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>I didnt see much of a difference in length</li>
            <li>FAST shampoo is a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt my hair but it didn&#x27;t really help it either.</li>
            <li>So, I ordered the FAST shampoo and the conditioner.</li>
            <li>The rest of my hair needs as much oil and moisture that it can get.</li>
            <li>and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product!</li>
            <li>I have used PAUL MITCHELL AWAPUHI which are very pricey shampoos/conditioners</li>
            <li>and I dyed it a day before I received FAST in the mail,</li>
            <li>I believe massaging the scalp while washing your hair with any shampoo will promote fast hair growth, plus having patience and persistence.</li>
            <li>It drys out your hair to much.</li>
            <li>I order this once a month because it really does work.</li>
            <li>Very disapointed.</li>
            <li>but when i would use it i noticed way to much of my hair coming out too.</li>
            <li>so this stuff will probably help hair growth but get ready to shed and lose your edges and some of your hair.</li>
            <li>i had split ends, breaking, shedding and my ends were thinning out and very stringy.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think it really works on</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s made my hair so much healthier as well.</li>
            <li>I noticed that I didn&#x27;t lose as much hair...</li>
            <li>I also noticed that my hair felt engorged as opposed to stringy during the scrub (I could really use a product like this for another parts of my body).</li>
            <li>Thats when I came across a miracle- FAST Shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair has grown TWO INCHES since I have used FAST.</li>
            <li>I had a precise starting point</li>
            <li>so I know how much it grew.</li>
            <li>I was determined and very hopeful.</li>
            <li>leaves my hair soft, fresh and manageable.</li>
            <li>so I can really see how fast the roots are growing-</li>
            <li>i never had sooo much split ends in my life...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t grow much at all</li>
            <li>It absolutely works.</li>
            <li>I said yes, my hair grows fast.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely would recommend this for anyone who is looking to have their hair grow fast.</li>
            <li>I really works</li>
            <li>My daughter had a bit too much taken off the bottom at the hair dresser and was devastated.</li>
            <li>She used it faithfully every day and her hair has grown so much already.  </li>
            <li>Had a very severe haircut done because of damage.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in hair growth..</li>
            <li>my hair takes a while to start growing but when it does, it grows fast</li>
            <li>and I relax it because I just prefer straight hair all the time.</li>
            <li>I have been using Nisim FAST shampoo for about a week now.</li>
            <li>it will really grow my hair</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Very affordable as well.</li>
            <li>, once I got it I went straight to the shower to wash my hair.</li>
            <li>Who knows, I may end up giving FAST another try.</li>
            <li>I was really nervous about purchasing FAST</li>
            <li>what I did see was that my hair was really shiny and silky, but not oily, ,my sister even notices and even my friends.  </li>
            <li>But as soon as the month ended I stoped buying it because it was to much money I would have to be spending</li>
            <li>The downside is that it is VERY drying.</li>
            <li>Seeing the online reviews for FAST, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>I did not want to have to use twice as much conditioner.</li>
            <li>Also, no matter what I do I seem to get a layer of build-up on my scalp which really annoys me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>use the FAST shampoo as instructed, lathering, rinsing and then repeating.</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the speed of hair growth.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this stuff</li>
            <li>I really do believe it did really help hair growth at the beginning--</li>
            <li>Seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>My hair is growing fast</li>
            <li>I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Doing this routine really helped my hair grow fast with this product.</li>
            <li>and i really got scared.</li>
            <li>After using this shampoo/condtioner for one month it made me break out along my hairline and caused my ahir to become very brittle and poofy</li>
            <li>Will always use this shampoo and would HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>We tried this for my elderly mother and didn&#x27;t really notice a difference on her.</li>
            <li>but then I used this and it grew so fast</li>
            <li>This shampoo really cleanses hair really well.</li>
            <li>Fast works well where it supposed to it</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really know why I did but didn&#x27;t happen..</li>
            <li>I just used it today, but I will update when I have used the whole bottle, &amp; in that review I will leave the result, whether or whether not this product produces hair growth.</li>
            <li>literally, my hair grew so fast.</li>
            <li>I also really like the scent.</li>
            <li>No results but didn&#x27;t use the whole bottle</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t have to use it for too much longer.</li>
            <li>I wouldnt recommend this product to anyone who wants to grow their hair longer.</li>
            <li>That will get you much farther than this money sucking product.</li>
            <li>So I found another reputable stylist who fixed the cut although my hair was left even shorter.</li>
            <li>It was not only soft but seemed to have alot more body.</li>
            <li>In about a week, i got my products, earlier than expected, that&#x27;s always good.</li>
            <li>Loving this product I got the big bottles and use it every day and now my hair has grown a total of 4 inches!</li>
            <li>The more reviews i have read i do wish i had not wasted my money as i think the key to growing hair is all in your diet and stay away from using styling tools every day.</li>
            <li>I love my results so far, hopefully it keeps up in the future!</li>
            <li>lol I didnt even get through half the bottle!!!!</li>
            <li>I have very curly, frizzy, unruly hair but styled right with good product (by professionals that never give me the secret products they use..</li>
            <li>Feels so soft!!!</li>
            <li>I am hoping that this complete package formula will do the trick!!!</li>
            <li>, it felt so soft and made my hair feel like it came right out of the salon every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i was so excited to use this because i used to have pretty long hair, but it was split from all the dying</li>
            <li>Im hoping to get my hair long enough to cut next year and send to locks of love :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes to a huge foam with very little shampoo and it doesn&#x27;t take much conditioner to smooth your hair, but as a hair grower, it&#x27;s a no-go.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, I will continue to buy this product because even though it hasn&#x27;t made my hair grow faster, I do love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;ll never buy another shampoo other than this.</li>
            <li>I originally ordered the smaller shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time today and my hair is SOOO soft !</li>
            <li>I love the f.a.s.t. shampoo for helping with hair growth, and use it every other shampoo to supplement my biotin regimen.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for sure if it grew any faster than it would have with any other product.</li>
            <li>and now it&#x27;s almost back to it&#x27;s original length.</li>
            <li>Bodycare product manufacturers, on their own responsibility, use any raw material as a cosmetic ingredient and market the product.  </li>
            <li>As a young girl I had always had long hair, my mom made sure of it.</li>
            <li>Also, for the first go round, I was also using this in combinationof my favorite conditioners (Suave and VO5)</li>
            <li>There is nothing special about this product it is just regular shampoo</li>
            <li>come fast and is less money than with most dealers.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to read the good reviews on this product before purchasing NISIM F.A.S.T, so since my very horrible hair cut LAST July I have been looking for good products to promote hair growth.</li>
            <li>When I first used this product I could not believe how soft my hair was.</li>
            <li>I kid you not, I get compliments EVERY day now on how pretty my hair is and how soft it is.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really seem to make your hair grow any faster than normal.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair about every 3 days, and it&#x27;s very healthy and thick.</li>
            <li>Also my drain after every shower would be full of hair.. enough to clog it!</li>
            <li>One tip though, some people said it feels like it dries out their hair, and I want to tell you if you use it correctly, and only apply the shampoo to your scalp DIRECTLY, and do NOT bring it through your ends, you will be just fine.</li>
            <li>This shampoo kind of makes my hair coarse and dry, but I use Moroccan oil to help that!</li>
            <li>so my 12 oz bottles are about more than half way done.</li>
            <li>From the roots, I have noticed that there is considerably less build-up on my scalp, and there is definitely much more volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>This is why many people believe that black women hair do not grow.</li>
            <li>In less then another 20 days my hair grew more than before.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying a deep conditioning treatment that I left on for an hour once or twice a week to cope with the static.</li>
            <li>Like I said, this is only my second use of the products, but I love them.</li>
            <li>These \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products are primarily composed of synthetic chemicals mixed with some natural ingredients .         </li>
            <li>My short layers left me feeling like Mr. Bigglesworth (in Austin Powers) when I am striving to feel more like a Fembot.</li>
            <li>I did also do deep conditioning once a week as I was not only trying to grow my hair but keep it healthy to speed up results.</li>
            <li>I have to get my hair cut super short!</li>
            <li>I am going to buy a big bottle next time :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anybody who is trying to grow their hair.</li>
            <li>I am Black mixed with American, lol.</li>
            <li>A little challenging when one has color on their hair.  </li>
            <li>However, after leaving it in for a few minutes, and rinsing it out, i dried and styled my hair and it was so smooth and healthy already!</li>
            <li>With the tremendous growth of the natural products industry in recent years, it is no wonder that a whole new generation of \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; products is springing up in neighborhood drug and health food stores alike.</li>
            <li>However, I bought this product for a friend who had colored hair (natural brunette, gone purple) who said that this really stripped the purple out of her hair.</li>
            <li>I hope it helps because it really did clear up my scalp.</li>
            <li>Normally I have oily hair</li>
            <li>Now I find myself writing my own negative review.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve stopped straightening it since this product is recommended to use everyday, and I am actually comfortable wearing my hair curly now!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love the smell, but it wasn&#x27;t noticable once hair was dried.</li>
            <li>It dried out my hair and gave me more spilt ends.</li>
            <li>I decided to stop using the product and have returned to my normal shampoo and my hair is improving</li>
            <li>Further comments by Dr. Epstein criticized regulatory agencies and the cosmetic industry in the US for knowing that DEA \\&quot;reacts with nitrites in cosmetics to form another potent carcinogen, nitrosos/DEA\\&quot; and not taking any action to phase out its use although European governments and industries had done so already since the 1980&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>And I have noticed quicker growth than I normally would if I hadn&#x27;t used the product.</li>
            <li>However, if you use the conditioner after, then it renews your hair and makes it feel normal again.</li>
            <li>AS ANY NORMAL SHAMPOO WOULD AND</li>
            <li>First of all, you only want to really wash your scalp when using this product.</li>
            <li>I read some reviews and most of them said that it dried out their hair, not mines.</li>
            <li>As soon as I started using this, my hair felt healthier and within a few days, I saw progress. :)</li>
            <li>I actually bought both the shampoo and conditioner for 20$ which is not bad at all, since I usually spend more on my hair products.</li>
            <li>I had far less breakage and my hair looks stronger and has a lovely sheen....</li>
            <li>right now my hair is above my bra strap</li>
            <li>If you want long hair quick grab it now.</li>
            <li>and I have to straighten it all the time to tame it, which leds to more damage of course...</li>
            <li>The smell was okay, not offensive and not really strong either.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more in the future just to make sure I use for at least 6 months, since I have heard you should definitely see results by then.</li>
            <li>It does double your hair growth which is great, but hair grows so slowly in the first place that it will take a long time to tell the difference.</li>
            <li>i will use this product even when i get all my long hair back because its a decent price and everything is true about it!</li>
            <li>A Material Safety Data Sheet which \\&quot;contains written or printed material concerning a hazardous material as prescribed by law\\&quot;, including information \\&quot;needed to insure the safety and health of the user at all stages of manufacture, storage, use, and disposal\\&quot;, for SLS reports that it is harmful if inhaled, ingested, left on skin too long,  and it poses dangers to the eyes as it can accumulate in the tissues of the eye causing possible cataracts.          </li>
            <li>Did not like original FAST shampoo - extremely drying to my 4C natural hair</li>
            <li>(but my hair still looks a little longer because the back of my head is catching up.)</li>
            <li>so nothing new.</li>
            <li>(WTH is in this product??).I would be cautious if I was a new client.</li>
            <li>After I started using this stuff my hair has grown 2 inches since the week before new years.</li>
            <li>People may say, \\&quot;Oh you&#x27;re loosing hair because you are getting new growth\\&quot; --</li>
            <li>Not only does my hair grow about twice as fast, it has made my hair thicker, healthier, and much fuller.</li>
            <li>The price is much cheaper than on the actual product website, and the shipping is fast.</li>
            <li>If you wash your whole head with this product, your hair will feel very brittle (and I actually think this goes for non-blacks as well).</li>
            <li>i used two of this packs and - tadaaaa - my hair grew really fast, got thick and healthy</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft and seems healthier and for this reason I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I am highly recommending this product so far...</li>
            <li>I mean, it REALLY dries it out and on top of it all it strips your hair color</li>
            <li>But overall it was a really good product and hope to purchase it againg for the same price or a little  bit cheaper.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s completely transformed my hair!  </li>
            <li>I will be updating this post exactly one month from now to give my input and possibly change the rating.</li>
            <li>and I ignored the hair, figuring it was just because it hadn&#x27;t been brushed or something, but it has happened consistently.</li>
            <li>The first month I noticed about an inch of growth, the second month was also close to an inch.</li>
            <li>When you first use the shampoo, it will make your hair feel knotted and gross in the shower.</li>
            <li>My hair was permed for the first time, they left the chemicals on for 2 hours!!!</li>
            <li>I was completely devastated!</li>
            <li>The funny thing is, i have only used it four times!</li>
            <li>I am Caucasian with normal, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Be aware that this productts might work differently for everyone !</li>
            <li>but it did do what the product is ment to do my hair grew about an inch being that it was bearly touching my coller bone to now being past it.</li>
            <li>the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that I had to wash my hair with hot water that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it a 4 stars</li>
            <li>and my hair feels incredibly soft!</li>
            <li>I find the exact opposite.</li>
            <li>It was pretty gross.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner, not really sure if my hair is growing faster</li>
            <li>Literally 4-5 times more than usual.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is not hard on your hair and the conditioner makes your hair feel soo soft.</li>
            <li>For the price - I expected a pretty decent combo!</li>
            <li>I have tryed other products that have simaler claims that retail for more, its worth the extra expence because this stuff will dry your scalp, give you dangruff , make you pull your hair out!</li>
            <li>I went to have my hair cut by a new stylist and she completely wrecked my hair -</li>
            <li>so far it&#x27;s the first bottle and it wont be the last one....</li>
            <li>I first assume it was because I hadnt brushed my hair so it had built up, but after several times of large amounts of hair loss</li>
            <li>A little history, I was born a blonde, but as I got older my natural color became more of a chestnut brown.</li>
            <li>Now, If your hair is like mine, Fast shampoo will dry out your hair( using FAST conditioner don&#x27;t help).</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin straight hair, &amp; this makes my hair feel so soft &amp; silky.</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t fall out or dry, but it does rip chemical hair color right out.</li>
            <li>However, the FDA classifies cosmetic ingredients according to their degree of toxicity and prohibits the use of certain ingredients proven to be unsafe for use on humans such as certain colorants and some prohibited or restricted ingredients (such as hexachlorophene, mercury compounds, and chloroform).</li>
            <li>I also think the over all health of my hair improved a little, but there wasn&#x27;t a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It smells like a normal shampoo and doesn&#x27;t really do anything other than make your hair grow fast.</li>
            <li>You should be very proactive about the other products that you use in your hair (read the ingredients, actually know what they are), find out what works in your hair, experiment with different type of hair oils, find out what your roots are craving as well as your ends, find a really good thirst quenching leave-in conditioner if you&#x27;re prone to dry hair, let your hair air-dry as much as possible...</li>
            <li>I decided to give this nisim fast a try, not only does it make my hair soft</li>
            <li>My hair is back to the natural color looks much healthier</li>
            <li>Ever used a clarifying shampoo or a clear (no pearliness/creaminess)bodifying shampoo?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d use the Fast conditioner on and near my scalp, and deep condition the middle-to-ends with whatever goo moves you.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo and conditioner for my 18 year old daughter as she swore it was supposed to make hair grow.</li>
            <li>, my hair didn&#x27;t fall out ( i have color processed hair), my hair felt bouncy and soft, it showed results and this product works.</li>
            <li>and it makes your hair incredibly soft because it&#x27;s an AMINO TREATMENT.</li>
            <li>so i dont want to say it is completely from the shampoo</li>
            <li>faster accomplishes this buy wiping out all the natural oils and nutrients when you use it.</li>
            <li>So I decided to shave my head and just let it grow out natural.</li>
            <li>and she could not belive how much my hair had grown since she saw me last!</li>
            <li>I had one of the old bottles stored away and just rediscovered it, It was expired</li>
            <li>It was shiney and soft, but made it have a wierd texture.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The smell is kinda funky, like old women perfume BUT doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>Because of a very stressful event in my life and in turn not eating properly, my hair began to fall out and break off.</li>
            <li>My husband keeps complimenting me on how soft it is.</li>
            <li>I also deep condition after I use a heat styling tool which isn&#x27;t very often.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;wow your hair is getting long\\</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using it for nearly a month now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for about three months, the 1st month i didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference but the last 2 months</li>
            <li>The rest of my hair has seen about 3/4 of an inch of growth so far.</li>
            <li>I purchased FAST Shampoo and Conditioner to not only lengthen my hair but also improve its texture.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this shampoo/conditioner set actually makes your hair grow fast because I will not continue to use it to find out.</li>
            <li>Overall it really does work.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I was a natural hair color I would&#x27;ve seen some growth thru the month</li>
            <li>I tried pills, I tried natural supplements.</li>
            <li>I have just started to record the growth as far as length and hope to post the pictures on line.</li>
            <li>though I am writing this review a bit too early, I figured I&#x27;d add my 2 cents anyway.  </li>
            <li>Hair naturally grow 1/2 an inch once monthly and 6 inches within a year.</li>
            <li>wo is willing to change their shampoo and grow their hair long faster.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s something that would have to be fixed before purchasing again.</li>
            <li>not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if it does not help grow my hair,  then I&#x27;d much rather use a different shampoo set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It completely strips your hair of dye.. and it seemed like it even altered the natural hair color as well.</li>
            <li>So I buy the FAST system because it falls in the middle of the price gamut damit.</li>
            <li>It was a reasonable price so if it didn&#x27;t work, I would only be out $25.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo was very stripping, and the conditioner wasn&#x27;t enough to counteract it.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair</li>
            <li>It is shiny, soft and even feels thicker.</li>
            <li>I would recommend doing intense deep conditioning if you try this product.</li>
            <li>It really works, i can only speak for the mix girls</li>
            <li>I let it grow for some time naturally</li>
            <li>so I can see the darker hair thats grown in so far.</li>
            <li>And being a woman of color I wanted to find products to maximize my natural hair growth.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product directly off of the Nisim Canada website, and once my order was placed it took two days for delivery.</li>
            <li>I have used it twice so far</li>
            <li>I also wasn&#x27;t too comfortable with the amount of chemicals and sulfates in the shampoo, i have heavily processed hair and were looking for something to treat and make healthier.</li>
            <li>Nisim leaves my hair soft, i just leave the conditioner on for about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mostly she just complained that the conditioner made her hair feel a bit greasy afterwards.</li>
            <li>but i like it so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this weekly or something, and I just came out of the shower after using it once so far</li>
            <li>It makes my hair really soft and I can start to see changes in the length</li>
            <li>I have a whole foot left to grow!!</li>
            <li>it left my hair very tangled.</li>
            <li>Hair was however soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It also kinda smells like old-school setting lotion (like an old lady</li>
            <li>If you have evr met anybody who partakes in these sort of sports then you know we usually have kind of long hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally thick, healthy hair</li>
            <li>If you want to compare your hair to mine: I have thick, golden-brown, wavy hair that dries out if I don&#x27;t take care of it (i.e. heat styling), but mostly is soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>People with thicker hair can tolerate it better, but anyone with hair that isn&#x27;t really thick, DO NOT buy it.</li>
            <li>but right now my goal is to get me my big hair back</li>
            <li>Nisim worked for me, though the results weren&#x27;t as strong as i&#x27;d hoped for I did notice about an extra 2-3 cm a month when I was using it (my hair grows really slowly, on average hair grows 1/2 inch a month</li>
            <li>First of all, there is a misconception that black women hair do not grow as fast as non-blacks.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a little over a month and haven&#x27;t noticed a significant increase in length that I would give F.A.S.T. any credit for.</li>
            <li>At first, I noticed that my hair was getting dry from using it</li>
            <li>The first one I ever tried made my hair extremely dry which is why I was reluctant to try this one.</li>
            <li>so my hair was pretty dry to start with.</li>
            <li>I was at 3 inches of new growth on April 9, 2013 and two weeks later (April 23, 2013), I was at 4 inches of new growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have light brown hair but dye it blonde, I dyed it three days before I started using Fast, and usually it takes two to three weeks for my roots to start showing noticeably</li>
            <li>It smells good, not a strong smell but a faint clean smell.</li>
            <li>I have more black ppl hair than I have mixed girl or white people hair.</li>
            <li>First of all I am African American.</li>
            <li>Bodycare and cosmetic products are not considered medicines and are therefore not subject to FDA approval, nor does the FDA try to regulate the body care industry.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a diference in lenght in the first few weeks but</li>
            <li>just used this shampoo and conditioner combo for the first time today and my hair is very soft and there wasn&#x27;t as much breakage as there usually is.</li>
            <li>ends were very dry the first two times I washed so</li>
            <li>It really does grow fast, I just recommend every other day and you will a difference within a week!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you have similar hair as me, and I&#x27;m considering buying this set again!</li>
            <li>Nobody keeps the same hair forever, your hair naturally falls out over time as NEW hair grows in.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel hard at all, it actually feels soft after using the conditioner.</li>
            <li>i wear extentions, because i really wish i had long hair.</li>
            <li>&quot; it really did look long that day. .</li>
            <li>My hair has always been long and I had to cut much of it off</li>
            <li>But if the dryness gets excessive I&#x27;m going to have to lay off of it and return if I deem it to be fit to returning too.</li>
            <li>I did notice that it made my hair manageable because my hair was pretty rough.</li>
            <li>It is very likely that the ingredients list of the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoo will contain one of the following three chemical additives, as do all other regular shampoos, as one of its top three ingredients: DEA or Diethanolamine, Propylene Glycol, SLS or Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, and SLES or Sodium Laureth Sulfate.          </li>
            <li>The American Academy of Dermatologists, Inc. published a clinical review in January 1991 which implicated Propylene Glycol as a cause of a significant number of reactions and as a primary irritant to the skin even in low levels of concentrations.</li>
            <li>No significant quick hair growth  in-</li>
            <li>so I bought it for her to calm her down.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo system won&#x27;t grow your hair like the boy in The Peanut Butter Solution, but it may help give your hair a little boost in growing a little more than what your hair type normally does.  </li>
            <li>When I got my new bottle of conditioner, I began the routine again but this only lasted me about 8 or 9 days.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again only because I did not see any new growth within 2 months of using it.</li>
            <li>Comparing the new with the old, the only difference is the old products had emulsifying wax as an ingredient, I wonder why they excluded this from the current product?It also wasn&#x27;t labeled by \\&quot;Nisim\\</li>
            <li>and really course and dry.</li>
            <li>I used it for a month straight and all the negatives that people claimed like dry scalp, color stripping and foul smell did not come to pass for me.</li>
            <li>As a African- American Women who had the hardest time growing out my hair this product really helped.</li>
            <li>I used FAST shampoo &amp; conditioner according to the directions on the package, every single day give or take maybe two or three days.</li>
            <li>I am not claiming that this product did not work or does not work for some, but after two months of consistent use (I did not use any other hair shampoos or conditioners)</li>
            <li>This is a cause of concern, as SLS enters and maintains residual levels in the lungs, liver, and brain from skin contact,causing major problems in these areas.            </li>
            <li>As stated in other reviews the product lasted me exactly a month.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to the hairdresser in a few days to get my hair cut evenly then leaving it alone for good to let nature do its&#x27; thing and in a few years I&#x27;ll have long, lucious hair</li>
            <li>At first she used the shampoo AND conditioner every single day for the first month and then during the second month used it every other day.</li>
            <li>So IF FAST does dry out your hair, try adding that balm!</li>
            <li>it was because the CLEAN smell, no more than that,</li>
            <li>I used to have waist length, super thick, straight blonde hair.</li>
            <li>And also, it does dry out your hair a bit, but an extra conditioner, a hair mask at least once a week, and some leave in conditioner should keep your hair healthy, and definitely stay away from heat products as much as you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think they hay have helped the growing process, but in general they are not &amp;#34;miracle shampoo and conditioner&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I had my hair cut a week ago by the same stylist who fixed my hair</li>
            <li>apparently the hair dresser thought an 1.5 meant 4.5 inches</li>
            <li>First of all my hair was long the next 3 months it is up to my mid neck.</li>
            <li>Yet, do the companies using this marketing tool really have the integrity to carefully select their ingredients so that their claims are factual?</li>
            <li>However, I have been highlighting my hair to be blonde for nearly 20 years now.</li>
            <li>I had curly soft hair before a relaxer treatment that was intended for coarse hair and lost some hair at the nape of my neck and my temples.</li>
            <li>and it left it really soft.</li>
            <li>This is my second order so far.</li>
            <li>so I barely used this.</li>
            <li>it left my hair soft and also seemed to work--</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t get 1 inch in the next 4 weeks it cannot possibly be possible to grow hair faster than normal.</li>
            <li>I just did not want ANY more unnecessary hair loss.</li>
            <li>Phyto is kind of expensive</li>
            <li>It gives it a weird texture and feels kind of like hay.</li>
            <li>what I&#x27;ve started doing is apply thick cheap conditioner to my ends BEFORE I shampoo</li>
            <li>It worked at first and then about a few weeks into it my hair became dry and was breaking more then usual.</li>
            <li>I bought 4 things of this shampoon/conditioner and have used it for over a month and have noticied not a single difference in length in my hair!</li>
            <li>Second, the shampoo didn&#x27;t dry my hair out all that much</li>
            <li>I recieved my shampoo &amp; conditioner a few days ago, and used them right away.</li>
            <li>If you have dry hair or normal you will have issues with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I switched to WEN which has completely saved my hair, it grows at a normal pace but its how my hair feels and looks that make me never want to use any other brand of shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried for so long to get my hair back to its healthy state and just by using this product it seemed like all my hard work was stripped away from my hair.</li>
            <li>BUT AS FAR AS PAYING AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE TO FOR IT ,ITS NOT WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a frizzy hot mess.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see any difference from using this compared to using any other shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I got a perm two years ago and it left my hair VERY damaged and dry and nothing I did, from deep conditioners and repairing shampoos and conditioners, nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li>The only change I did see was how soft it left my hair.</li>
            <li>and my oily scalp did not dry out even with me washing every day...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had thick, full hair and now my hairline is receding along the corners on each side of my forehead and temples and my hair in general is THINNING.</li>
            <li>The diameter of my strands of hair are unbelievably thick, people say I have asian-like coarse hair (which is all about the diameter), but my hair isn&#x27;t strong like asian hair</li>
            <li>At first my hair seemed a little straw</li>
            <li>:) I don&#x27;t use it daily, as it says in the directions, but it still works extremely well and my hair has grown 75% faster as usual.</li>
            <li>It was feeling really dry and brittle and NOW it&#x27;s as soft as a feather!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve kind of experimented over the last few months, and came to the conclusion that you have to use it at LEAST every other wash to get real results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But since Ive used the shampoo and conditioner I have not had to put anything else in it to calm it down on straighten it!!</li>
            <li>I cut my hair super short this past Feb., and not it is Sept.</li>
            <li>She complained at first that the first month she noticed that her scalp would be dry and itchy but the second month it wasn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li>The conditioner really doesn&#x27;t seem like it is a deep enough moisturizer for dry hair, so I have been using a deep conditioning treatment (Infusium for damaged hair)twice a week.</li>
            <li>Two other ingredients that commonly find themselves at the top of the list of ingredients of your \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoo are Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) and its sister chemical Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES).</li>
            <li>Secondly, I have only used it for 5-6 weeks and can not really say how much longer it has grown..</li>
            <li>but it does - i barely used other conditioners with it and had no negative side effects.</li>
            <li>I am pretty heavy handed</li>
            <li>I used the shampoo the first day, and I scrubbed it in my scalp with a boar hair brush, and after my hair was dried, (notice she had no idea I had received this shampoo yet)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on a medication that seemed to have really slowed down my hair growth.</li>
            <li>Thus, there are many commonly used ingredients in cosmetics today with potential carcinogenic effects which have been so-far overlooked by the FDA and continue to be used in alarming proportions in daily cosmetic applications, even in \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products.         </li>
            <li>The middle of my hair was very short due to breakage and now the whole thing has evened out.</li>
            <li>it made my dry brittle hair, soft again</li>
            <li>Ever since I&#x27;ve been using this, I&#x27;ve had significantly less breakage, my hair&#x27;s been so much softer, and shinier</li>
            <li>I really like this product my hair falls out less</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to see maybe a quarter of an inch or half an inch of growth,</li>
            <li>I started taking pre-natal vitamins and biotin and got a whole inch and a half in about two months...</li>
            <li>, it made my hair knotty, thin, and breaks easily.</li>
            <li>I generally wear my hair in flat twists.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shampoo before but not long enough to see a difference.</li>
            <li>I died my hair in the beginning of summer(june) black (naturally brown) and when early August came, My roots still hadn&#x27;t grown in, by the time the beginning of september came</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian and was not \\&quot;blessed\\&quot; with the typical straight and silky hair.</li>
            <li>My hair has grown considerably and I have any used half the product so far.  </li>
            <li>I have semi thick, super wavey coarse hair.</li>
            <li>If you are a black woman, do not be afraid to wash your hair everyday to get the best results from this product.</li>
            <li>my normal L&#x27;Oreal shampoo and conditioner that I use.&lt;br /&gt;Using this shampoo and conditioner, trying to only washing my hair every other day, and taking &amp;#34;hair skin and nails&amp;#34; supplement, has made my hair grow 1.5 inches</li>
            <li>anyways I came to Amazon two months ago determined to find a solution to losing so much hair, and also it stops growing when it gets to a little below my shoulders.</li>
            <li>So, although I seem to be right back where I started, I know that in a few months I&#x27;ll be on my way to long hair again!</li>
            <li>That might not seem like a whole lot, but my hair normally grows less than half an inch per month.</li>
            <li>Then on top of that, the shampoo dried my hair out and made it feel hard and brittle.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes but was let down....  </li>
            <li>my hair felt a little dry, but very very.</li>
            <li>I would be bald completely because of the dryness and breakage but also overheating with flat irons and blow-dryers which I have to do every single time I wash</li>
            <li>So I guess if you have a bad home dye job this is a good set.</li>

            <li> I think it smells great, and although the shampoo knots my hair up, the conditioner is AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> I have used the shampoo and conditioner for about 1 week and find it to be incredibly conditioning.  </li>
            <li> the box was a bit damaged but the product inside was in perfect shape and has worked great.</li>
            <li> The shampoo made my hair incredibly tangled.</li>
            <li> this is a good one, but keep in mind what works for one person may not work for another!</li>
            <li> It smells good though!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my niece and she loved it!</li>

            <li> She&#x27;s really happy with it because she had been expressing some concerns about the fineness of her hair and that it was thinning.. but not anymore    </li>
            <li> But this isn&#x27;t uncommon</li>
            <li> So it is great for washing your hair</li>
            <li> and the smell is great,</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair and it doesn&#x27;t do a great job at conditioning my hair</li>

            <li> Honestly, this is the best shampoo ever.</li>
            <li> I know her hair looks great.</li>

            <li> :) &lt;3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my hair into a pixi style and I liked it for a day!</li>
            <li> Love this product it is awesome.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome at making your hair healthy.</li>
            <li> I liked it!</li>
            <li> The hair gets kind of unbreakable!</li>
            <li> Good luck to you!! :)</li>
            <li> If you choose to use this product any way, the smell is somewhat pleasant  </li>
            <li> I used it to review it first an loved it! :D</li>
            <li> The product smells wonderful, but I have fine hair and it often made my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> Over all it is a good product</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it felt this good</li>
            <li> It is important t use both the Shampoo and Conditioner together for best results.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this product years ago</li>
            <li> good hair makes you feel good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about couple of days that i have been using this shampoo and conditioner and already seeing really good results.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a good sign.</li>
            <li> Suds good.</li>
            <li> A good example of the dangers of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Cocamide DEA is your children&#x27;s bubble bath.</li>
            <li> I choose this product because I have watched a lot of YouTube videos and the people that have tried it themselves loved the product.</li>
            <li> I would of gave it a good go</li>
            <li> no complains about the shipping, i got it on time and all good.</li>
            <li> The shampoo dries out my hair, the conditioner weighs it down--not a good combination for my scalp/hair type.</li>
            <li> good product but never worked for me.</li>
            <li> Good luck people.</li>
            <li> I also take a multi vitamin and drink lots of H2O. Good luck ladies/gents.</li>
            <li> loved it will buy again</li>
            <li> I have baby hairs growing at a fairly rapid rate.  </li>
            <li> but surprisingly my boyfriend loves the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> shine, thickness, gorgeous all around.</li>
            <li> This will insure that you are applying the product on your scalp really good.</li>
            <li> Massage it in really good and then rinse it all out.</li>
            <li> but it smell good in my opinion, but</li>
            <li> and I have to say I have grown a good length just by looking at the roots.</li>
            <li> Some were good</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the good news.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Those were good 6 inches.</li>
            <li> good product.</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean and conditioned after use, and it smells awesome throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I just started the biotin &amp; MSM which are thought to both work together for hair growth in an exceptional way.</li>
            <li> About 7 people have asked if I got hair extentions which is really great :).....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner since February, and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> I am NOT an employee of Nisim, just a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it works great</li>
            <li> We were very pleased.</li>
            <li> but it smelled good and made my hair nice.</li>
            <li> But it smells nice (just a very clean smell) and it works great.</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Time to order some more !</li>

            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re okay with losing your hair, DON&#x27;T buy this product!</li>
            <li> :) Thank you!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s more than it grows in a year!</li>

            <li> I am so pleased!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Works awesome, I lost all my hair due to chemo and once I finished my treatments I started using this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> It really does work! :D</li>
            <li> i would recommend this product for sure!</li>
            <li> :) hopefully it keeps working, wish me luck!</li>
            <li> I already am in love with this product!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I just hope I can afford to buy more soon!</li>
            <li> Love it, and I can&#x27;t wait for my hair to start growing!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair so healthy looking!</li>
            <li> Will write more on the growth in about six weeks!</li>
            <li> there are many variables involved in having a really beautiful healthy head of hair</li>
            <li> ( I had an itchy, oily scalp before ), more manageable, and pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li> My hair grew about an inch or so each month which was amazing</li>
            <li> I have heard amazing things about this product</li>
            <li> and you can buy at the hairdressers that worked great with fabulous results.</li>
            <li> smells amazing</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if I was looking for an amazing smelling hair product</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own...</li>
            <li> I really liked this product</li>
            <li> I tried many conditioners but they were never as good as this one. .</li>
            <li> The hair growth is nice, but not for the price of my hair falling out.</li>
            <li> Love this system you get good results</li>
            <li> Have been using Fast shampoo and conditioner for about one month now and have noticed hair growth and thickening that I am very happy with!</li>
            <li> It was at this point that I began using FAST shampoo and conditioner and am very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> plus it smells so good :)</li>
            <li> it looked nice after 1st use.</li>
            <li> She is thrilled</li>
            <li> , I tried every kind of oil, shampoo, and cream.</li>
            <li> The shampoo smelled nice.</li>
            <li> Overpriced, to be honest.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is really nice and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I did not rate this product, because I did not purchase it, but I just thought I would say a lot of the comments are saying there hair grew 1-2 inches in a month, but my hair grows about 1-2 inches a month on its own, so Idk how this is helping, it seems all</li>
            <li> Please use at your own cautions.&lt;br /&gt;Ok</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice shampoo</li>
            <li> I liked what I saw and decided to give it a&lt;br /&gt;Try.</li>
            <li> This stuff gives you that kind of dryness.</li>
            <li> I first bought it because all of the wonderful reviews, i went through two bottles thinking that it needed more time and to be honest</li>
            <li> Great product and worth the price!</li>
            <li> It sounded really good but maybe too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff, ordering more!</li>
            <li> The smell was nothing impressive but still fresh and clean</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> My hair felt soft and it was shiny, an the best part my hair grew 1 1/2 inch in a month.</li>
            <li> extracts\\&quot; in an attractive, earth-tonish, environmentally friendly bottle, is a safe and healthy choice for washing hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel thicker ( I have very fine hair).</li>
            <li> so my hair is very fine.</li>
            <li> Sulfate is the subject of great controversy and the cause of the greatest concern to many scientists.</li>
            <li> glad i got it because my hair feels amazing:)</li>
            <li> HAPPY NEW YEARS!!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with FAST!!!</li>
            <li> I am very perplexed about this product.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly it conditions really well!!</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner smell pleasant, very clean, and fresh.</li>
            <li> I was super excited for this product, thinking it was going to be great for my hair and give it a boost in its hair growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I waited two months before writing this review because I wanted it to be accurate!  </li>
            <li> so glad.</li>
            <li> and my hair grows slower then most, but I was looking forward to this product</li>
            <li> and I am hoping to get the same beautiful results as I did then!</li>
            <li> Every time I take a shower, I noticed my hair falling out way more than it used to be..  </li>
            <li> I felt like my hair was growing faster, but was sure I was making it up until my boyfriends daughter (age 4) said it had.</li>
            <li> I love dying my hair, and decided to start bleaching it for colors.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> /&gt;But, in the end i&#x27;m still satisfied and will continue to use this</li>
            <li> it made it grow faster and longer, but my hair isnt fuller or healthy..</li>
            <li> it really helped my hair to look healthy and grow about a 1\\&quot; but it looks great</li>
            <li> it was that my hair started falling out more.</li>
            <li> I doubt I&#x27;ll be ordering more of this product after it&#x27;s finished.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this because so many reviews were giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I am hoping to see more growth as an added bonus :)</li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I found this product, bought it, and fell in love.</li>
            <li> I have noticed hair growth and it looks really healthy.</li>
            <li> and i noticed that it&#x27;s more shinier and more manageable</li>
            <li> My senior year I got extensions, but those seemed to damage my hair more than it was worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> F.A.S.T is just fabulous!</li>
            <li> Only the very best hair stylists in Chicago can even do my hair and most of them have like 30 yrs of experience and owns salons themselves.</li>
            <li> it will break off for most of us.</li>
            <li> I think the company (Nisim) must have worked on the scent, because it is quite lovely.</li>
            <li> recommended. :)</li>
            <li> I am completely IN LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li> It feels so light and soft which is wonderful considering</li>
            <li> :) but overall, great shampoo and conditioner, TRY IT!</li>
            <li> SO FIVE STARS FROM ME :)</li>
            <li> I received F.A.S.T. in a very timely manner and the product is great.  </li>
            <li> My hair was just touching the tops of my shoulders.</li>
            <li> The healthier your body is, the more efficiently it will operate - and grow that</li>
            <li> feel I should let future buyers know that this product, while wonderful, can fade hair color.  </li>
            <li> Healthy hair will grow faster than using this product which dries out your hair</li>
            <li> but I decided that my hair would be able to handle it.</li>
            <li> I should have known better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li> But it sure didn&#x27;t do anything for hair loss or growing your hair longer or thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have some lighter carmel highlights in my hair, so I will be able to see my growth.</li>
            <li> I noticed that many people mentioned that a lot of their hair fell out</li>
            <li> and I do feel that it has been growing more since I have been using it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> And then to top t off i havnt seen a change in my hair grown at all, but i will still give it a try for another 30 days to see.</li>
            <li> the more I use it the more</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> thanks for the great product.</li>
            <li> Awesome I look like a blonde Jesus.</li>
            <li> After the first use, I noticed a remarkable difference in the appearance of my hair.</li>
            <li> I sooooooooo love this shampoo</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I switched or thought something else would bring better results, however I learned my lesson and it won&#x27;t happen again.</li>
            <li> and it was ok,</li>
            <li> It gives me more appointment oriented haircuts, also.  </li>
            <li> Using the shampoo for my first time was amazing!</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo and conditioner set, I think it did wonders for my hair</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the relaxing medicinal spa scent and gel like consistency of the cream.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> My hair feels more stronger</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo &amp; Conditioner for growing hair fast.</li>
            <li> I had better luck with mane n tail.</li>
            <li> but overall it was great !</li>
            <li> Okay so i just bought f.a.s.t.</li>
            <li> I tried to put more shampoo thinking</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> This time, however, I will learn from my mistakes! :)</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;then again I didn&#x27;t buy it for the smell&amp;#34; It smells like most shampoo that doesn&#x27;t have perfume in it.</li>
            <li> will stop my hair from breaking off therefore making it longer :)</li>
            <li> I ordered one more shampoo but skipped the conditioner-it doesn&#x27;t do much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair has become a bit more healthier and has grown about .75 of an inch.</li>
            <li> &quot; that is \\&quot;average\\&quot; to most people.  </li>
            <li> Looks to me more like 1/4\\&quot; based on the line I see.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner are ok and I will continue to use it up</li>
            <li> It says what it does :)</li>
            <li> Just as described and will purchase from again! :)</li>
            <li> I just ordered some more</li>
            <li> Not too sure.</li>
            <li> I still have to wait and see if more hair grows out and if existing hair grows as promised.</li>
            <li> VO5 SHAMPOO WORKS BETTER AND IS 95% CHEAPER</li>
            <li> The smell is okay.</li>
            <li> Then use a more moisturized conditioner that works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair texture is more of a &#x27;Z&#x27; pattern than it is an &#x27;S&#x27; pattern.</li>
            <li> love it a lot..</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells while I&#x27;m using it; the way my hair smells afterwards.</li>
            <li> My hair looks healthy, hydrated and with volume.  </li>
            <li> It was okay.</li>
            <li> I am glad I read the review that stated it strips the color out of color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner because i had to cut my hair because of chemical damage more than 5 months ago.</li>
            <li> I&lt;br /&gt;Proceeded to darken it allow my hair to become healthy again.</li>
            <li> This product is magic</li>
            <li> When I did use aussie 3 minute repair conditioner however the results were even better.</li>
            <li> and I just ordered more to keep it growing.</li>
            <li> Alright so I read many reviews before purchasing.</li>
            <li> She loves it, so I love it as well.</li>
            <li> and I think it gave me more split ends than I had before</li>
            <li> better--</li>
            <li> my co-workers were able to tell a difference when they had not seen me for a week.</li>
            <li> Maybe if the bottles had lasted longer I would have noticed more of  a difference over more time.</li>
            <li> I see people mostly mentioning how it dries your hair out.</li>
            <li> product works for me, and I love it.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft, so shiny and healthy looking, and extremely beautiful.</li>
            <li> She read that it had a foul smell, but honestly it just has a really clean fragrance...</li>
            <li> So far so good, and I am also very pleased with product and am going to stick to it to observe results.</li>
            <li> I tried to ignore it because, after the first wash, my hair felt SO GOOD.</li>
            <li> it lathered pretty well and worked good</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li> This product is good, I just got it, my first time using it, when i rinsed out the shampoo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited about this shampoo and conditioner that I&#x27;ve told everyone I know about it!</li>
            <li> i was so excited!</li>
            <li> Nisim FAST just didn&#x27;t do it for me, it was a good shampoo and does help hair growth but just has too many chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> But it is great for growing out your hair naturally!</li>
            <li> so I guess there really is no miricle here because what good does it do if it&#x27;s growing in at the roots but breaking off at the ends!?!?</li>
            <li> light, refreshing flowery smell.   </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;great, makes my hair feel healthy, shiny, tangle free, but</li>
            <li> the smell is great and naturally is straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> it really feels good on your scalp though</li>
            <li> its soft and smooth and shiny and looks very healthy!</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t even been a full month yet!</li>
            <li> but overall it is a good product!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product, after many years of looking for things to help with my hair growth.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown out very quickly.</li>
            <li> After using this product my hair was easy to comb.</li>
            <li> Makes it feel really healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> and I actually liked FAST a lot more.</li>
            <li> Being that I dye my hair, it is easy to see the growth line at the root.  </li>
            <li> Leaving soft &amp; tangle free, with a great scent.</li>
            <li> it also has a really strong scent</li>
            <li> :) I will update review in about couple of weeks but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t care for the smell (like strong laundry detergent).</li>
            <li> when i first started using this stuff i liked it</li>
            <li> It is full of vitamins to help your scalp become healthy with massaging it and</li>
            <li> The conditioner makes my hair very smooth and soft :) I even received compliments about how healthy and smooth my hair looked :)</li>
            <li> My hair type is fine (but I have a lot of hair).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been fine.</li>
            <li> , I thought the smell was fine.</li>
            <li> and Caucasians were fine.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> But you guys should know that this is not some super magical product.</li>
            <li> anyone wants to ask me more about this product before considering buying it; please do!</li>
            <li> Almost any new shampoo/conditioner you buy is going to make your hair feel good, (unless it&#x27;s really cheap stuff )because it always happens when you switch products.</li>
            <li> All of that stopped after the very first use!</li>
            <li> I could see a huge difference in my hair after one use.  </li>
            <li> I have seen a huge improvement from this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for two weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any huge change to my hair growth yet.  </li>
            <li> Title says it all, but to explain it breifly; its cheap shampoo that was put in a bottle that claims to help you grow or keep hair that you have.</li>
            <li> Taking biotin supplements with this will help, and you can get them cheap over-the-counter.  </li>
            <li> But this product is Great overall.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is amazing because my hair is so much manageable after i use it.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> it was worth the harmless side effects i love this product.</li>
            <li> No matter my skin is amazing thanks to these products</li>
            <li> In fact, my hair felt so silky smooth after I used it.</li>
            <li> It is used so freely by manufacturers as it is a cheap detergent that produces a lot of foam and bubbles which we all equate with cleansing.</li>
            <li> I thought hey, why not see if they sell hair growth products on here for cheap?</li>
            <li> also wanted to mention Nisim has come out with a sulfate, paraben free verison</li>
            <li> code I used for the free samples:&lt;br /&gt;FAST</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> The natural oils are really good for your hair.</li>
            <li> For some background information, you should know that I used to have long, beautiful hair that reached all the way to my waist.</li>
            <li> Soon after, I began to straighten my naturally curly hair (in an effort to fit in and look good).</li>
            <li> anything natural gets points from me and it smells so good will stick on your hair .</li>
            <li> I have been  using this shampoo for a month-so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far I have had good observed results using the conditioner and shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am very happy that brought FAST because with in a week my hair actually grew</li>
            <li> It really works!!!  </li>
            <li> hairs\\&quot; have grown back and the best part is the hair is growing back strong and not breaking off!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, noticed a huge difference!</li>
            <li> (my hair was like 1/8 of an inch long lol)</li>
            <li> But i&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> My hair grew significantly faster and looked heathly while using it.</li>
            <li> Although she said it was well worth it!</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the product.</li>
            <li> For me, the conditioner worked great for ALL of my hair, so long as I used a leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I imagine that cocktail in the bottle that promotes hair growth may not be friendly to color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for about 15 years now, and most of those have been home dye jobs, so my hair was pretty frizzy.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to order this.</li>
            <li> and I was really excited.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and believe it does help my hair grow faster plus it looks healthier than it had in the past 5 months.</li>
            <li> I noticed the first wash that my scalp looked healthy</li>
            <li> Worth a try!</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> , it smells clean after.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product not really expecting much, but I was greatly surprized!</li>
            <li> &quot; felt clean.</li>
            <li> The smell is clean and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> , THIS PRODUCT MAKES MY HAIR FEEL SO SILKY AND STAYS CLEAN WAY LONGER THEN</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced dry hair like everyone else, but then again, I like to apply moisturizer to my hair the minute I get out the shower.</li>
            <li> but I like it because the shampoo feels like it strips your hair clean and the conditioner renutritions it</li>
            <li> It smells nice and makes my hair feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great value, although it will dry your hair out.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair feels more manageable and it is very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> if its not greasy it&#x27;s still clean.</li>
            <li> Getting long, healthy hair takes time and patience for people like me who&#x27;s hair just wont grow at all!!</li>
            <li> I have gone a more clean and pure way and am now using Renpure 14 day keratin treatment shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Shipping was excellent came the next day without paying for next day arrival and the product itself is fantastic will deffinetly be ordering more very soon!</li>
            <li> amazing results so far.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t say my hair felt softer but it stayed normal, smelled good and grew fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks :)</li>
            <li> People were giving it 5 stars based on the fact their hair was so much silkier, and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have never come across a product that I love this much.</li>
            <li> full length hairs with the follicle attached (STILL...2 MONTHS after I stopped using it.)</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the shampoo &amp; conditioner smelled.</li>
            <li> I loved this combo so much, I came back to order more.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any shampoos or conditioners that have really made my hair feel and look...so healthy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s grown a full inch.</li>
            <li> I caucasian and bought this product for both my own hair and my 5 year old daughter who gave herself a haircut.  </li>
            <li> but it is true</li>
            <li> I give Nisim Fast three stars, though, because many have said it does work for them and though it did not work for me, I do not want to say that it does not work for everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update after a full month of using.</li>
            <li> the FAST sulfate-free shampoo - Like that better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;BUT, I am not quite sure if it really helps my hair growth like they advertise.</li>
            <li> I googled FAST shampoo and many results came up.</li>
            <li> did I know how much I would come to love those two bottles.</li>
            <li> After 4 weeks of using both the shampoo and conditioner my hair grew a full inch.</li>
            <li> so I continued to do that and used this shampoo and conditioner every time I washed my hair for a full month.  </li>
            <li> Leave the FAST conditioner on for about 2 or more minutes and then rinse.</li>
            <li> and she got a full inch at the end of 28 days.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving this product, my mother has started using it too</li>
            <li> The FAST is much more affordable--</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had time to measure my hair to see if it really extend my hair lenghth , but one thing for sure about this shampoo is that it improves</li>
            <li> Stick with vitamins, deep conditioning treatments, a good shampoo and conditioner, use oils (I use jajobaoil) and drink lots of water.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s only fair</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of a beauty salon but its not bad.</li>
            <li> I thought that a good way to keep track of how much hair was growing in a month using the shampoo and cond combo would be to measure the new gray hair growth.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and can really tell a difference with the way my hair feels silkier, smoother, and it really has grown!!</li>
            <li> My main issue with this product is that it made me LOSE more hair than grow hair.</li>
            <li> However, you will most likely lose more strands of hair in the shower for a week or two until your hair adjusts to the formula.  </li>
            <li> so I was pretty amazed that it lasted exactly a month (could have even done a day or two more).</li>
            <li> I have very thick,coarse,kind of poofy hair that already grows kind of fast.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Just make sure that you brush your hair more often on these days, than regular, so the oils and get to your ends.     </li>
            <li> I love this product and I&#x27;m definitely going to be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Over a year ago i got a perm, this damaged my hair tremendously.</li>
            <li> Since I am pregnant, I will be waiting until I deliver my baby to start my hair growth vitamins with this product to help keep my hair healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars because my hair has grown quickly, but I might have to&lt;br /&gt;Cut</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably continue to use this product for a couple more months and then switch back to sulfate free shampoo!</li>
            <li> My hair felt nice and smelled good at least.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for healthy look.</li>
            <li> I thought long hair was the only beautiful kind, and that I couldn&#x27;t be completely pretty without it.</li>
            <li> Love it so far!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten such great results fun any so-called hair growth system as I did with Nissim Fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whenever I first tried this, it made my hair so silky and smooth</li>
            <li> I noticed the FIRST DAY I used it that it made my hair feel amazingly soft and light!!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased that my hair had finally reached my belly button.</li>
            <li> I used the FAST conditioner on top of another conditioner of my own, and the oils I put into my hair on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> It left my roots feeling very clean and oil-free; which is really great, especially during Summer.</li>
            <li> I took prenatal vitamins when I heard that they encouraged the growth of new cells, more specifically, hair cells.</li>
            <li> After 4 more weeks, not even a 1/4 inch of new growth.</li>
            <li> my hair has also got thicker and softer so use it great for black people.</li>
            <li> I would probably buy the FAST shampoo and conditioner again as I like how easy my hair is to handle after using it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time user and will continue to use both the shampoo and conditioner!  </li>
            <li> arnt they saposed to text this stuff on animals first!</li>
            <li> I first used this product about four years ago and it worked so well!</li>
            <li> The only thing I see as a downfall is my first lather isn&#x27;t very lathery (lol)</li>
            <li> , i have already used a whole bottle of both the shampoo and conditioner, no results!!</li>
            <li> BUT, overall, it has grown more than 2 inches!</li>
            <li> It really does work!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll update after I&#x27;ve used it for a month, but so far I&#x27;m super pleased.</li>
            <li> my hair is already extremely fine and straight</li>
            <li> worth it.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it makes my hair look so healthy and soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> all this is really worth the money.</li>
            <li> I believe the shampoo is worth it just for how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Nice to find a product that actually does what it claims.</li>
            <li> My hair loves it      - I rarely use heat on my hair and when I do, I use a heat defence product.      </li>
            <li> My hair grew a full inch in the first month, and its health has improved as well.</li>
            <li> This is the result of the effect of Propylene Glycol which is to repel important components necessary for healthy skin and scalp, including moisturizing water, and to act as a synthetic replacement for the moisture which the body cannot assimilate.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the price but don&#x27;t expect to have rapunzel hair overnight.</li>
            <li> Some people it may work for, but I have such damaged hair roots that it&#x27;s kind of a lost cause at this point.</li>
            <li> I actually had many, many people tell me how much faster my hair was growing after I started using this shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In terms of lengthening my hair, well I have to continue using both bottles, but so far I do see a difference :)</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the 25 bucks</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t say too much about how much my hair grew since i just started today, but i will continue using this just because of how healthy my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li> But I honestly I cannot wait to go back to no sulfate and organic shampoo</li>
            <li> It suds up pretty good and doesn&#x27;t make my hair dry.</li>
            <li> thanks to this AMAZING product, my hair is no down to my chest.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> atleast just to say, it worked, but no, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, the very first thing I noticed the first time I used</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wishes to get long, healthy hair faster!</li>
            <li> Short hair was cute, long hair was gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a lot of hair falling out while I am in the shower but not any other time which is good.</li>
            <li> one or the other is good.</li>
            <li> Dont give up on it right away.</li>
            <li> , I noticed that my hair fell out right before a growth spurt.  </li>
            <li> This stuff does work if you use it right.</li>
            <li> He was right</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> it does it right away..</li>
            <li> It dries mine out enough that it actually looks nice and healthy, and it&#x27;s still nice looking the next day.</li>
            <li> I look like Mr. Clean hahaha.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES CLEAN YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li> Amazon definitely has the best pricing for this product but for me it is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> However this is a problem VERY EASY to solve applying  conditioners and deep treatments for you type of hair(DON&#x27;T use oil treatment on your scalp.</li>
            <li> and I really noticed a change even though I used it only twice a week :) extra hair growth with good scalp sensation?</li>
            <li> Happy to report my hair is able to be pulled back into a little stump.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very shiny, full and bouncy even if my hair wasn&#x27;t growing I would use this product.</li>
            <li> It has grown about what I expected to do and I am very pleased with that.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they truley worked or not, but is still a great shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Even my mom&#x27;s been using it and her hair is gorgeous and dark.</li>
            <li> hair appears strong and I don&#x27;t have to get my hair trimmed as often but that could be because I chopped most of my hair off due to damaged before I started using this product.</li>
            <li> the only positive thing is that it has a pretty nice smell...</li>
            <li> but it certainly works for me!</li>
            <li> But soon after I washed it I would blow dry it &amp; it was amazingly tame-able.</li>
            <li> So far it has given me results that I would say surpass my own natural process of hair growth, with diligent care (including supplements, hair trims, reducing heat to my hair).</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged, very neat &amp; simple.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves it and swears it is making her hair grow super fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping it would grow my hair out super fast like some people clamed it would.</li>
            <li> Every night, I would shower and shampoo like normal, but making sure to massage the product more carefully into my scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try Nioxin instead because I heard that stuff works very very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As far as a shampoo and conditioner it was fine.</li>
            <li> and if you go to their facebook page and click the \\&quot;click here for special offers\\&quot; in red top mid of page you can get this set for $20 with free</li>
            <li> The shipping came relatively fast!</li>
            <li> I had only been using it for a month and someone that I hadn&#x27;t seen in about a month asked me if I had gotten hair extentions :)</li>
            <li> --NEVER in the shower--and from the first use, I was picking out tons of hair from the drain every time I showered.</li>
            <li> haha!</li>
            <li> How many times have you bought something only to find out</li>
            <li> and it really did!</li>
            <li> However, I only gave four stars because I think I am loosing my hair more.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly; shampooing twice, hot water, etc.</li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> this might by the first time I&#x27;ve done it.</li>
            <li> This is my first Amazon purchased.</li>
            <li> I first was thinking about getting hair extensions but didn&#x27;t want to spend all that mula</li>
            <li> I used it for almost exactly two months.</li>
            <li> it takes my not-so-managable mane, and makes it soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li> Pretty Hair is Parched.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had read numerous reviews saying that it made people&#x27;s hair shed more and it was drying</li>
            <li> but now I have constant itching and flaking and on top of that</li>
            <li> Most people tend to think that a shampoo bottle whether sold in a health food store or not, which costs four times as much as a regular shampoo, with pictures of flowers and the labels \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; and \\&quot;herbal</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s put my hair in better shape.</li>
            <li> I overly used it the first time.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product to keep my hair growing just as advertised- FAST!</li>
            <li> However, after using this shampoo for a month now I actually like the way it makes my hair feel better then</li>
            <li> First off,</li>
            <li> but I am just glad that it actually works.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was hooked.</li>
            <li> so I know my exact growth rate to be 1/2 inch per month.</li>
            <li> I used it exactly as directed.</li>
            <li> We also take a daily biotin supplement to help our hair along just a bit more.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a dream and</li>
            <li> its seem to have many mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> An I would also use a leave in conditioner for extra moisture : )</li>
            <li> and i got it in the mail so fast!</li>
            <li> I bought this and after the first use I decided not to use it.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using FAST my family and friends have told me that my hair looks longer, after one week!</li>
            <li> First I have to say that all beauty items are subjective.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really to rave about this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in that goofy state between short and medium length</li>
            <li> Overall I love the shampoo and the conditioner</li>
            <li> I contacted the company directly to see if they could offer any free samples that way</li>
            <li> I purchased this about 2 months ago and my hair has really grown!</li>
            <li> i really think that whats in the bottle is not whats on the label!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much better product than you can buy at your local hair salon!</li>
            <li> I got this last week I have washed my hair three times sometimes more with</li>
            <li> AS THIS PRODUCT REALLY DOES NOT MAKE YOUR HAIR GROW!</li>
            <li> So when I first heard about this product I did not believe that it would work at all.</li>
            <li> After the first couple of times I thought it was alright.</li>
            <li> me tell you, my hair did grow and it happened within the first two weeks of using this product.</li>
            <li> so I could not continue as I did the first two week.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has just restored softness and health to my hair all around on top of actually helping it grow faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like my hair was growing any faster when I was using this consistently.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing so much faster!</li>
            <li> I had a big night coming up and didn&#x27;t want to lose latest wash-in color, so I waited to use it.</li>
            <li> I rated this 4 because I just used it for the first time</li>
            <li> pretty</li>
            <li> It really has been heaven sent for shedding hair!</li>
            <li> I think it works really well!</li>
            <li> I can now get most of my hair in some form of a ponytail (although it is a rather short one) and was even confident that I had enough length to get the layers</li>
            <li> I bought this and started using the first week of January</li>
            <li> I love this product it definitely works.</li>
            <li> The product did exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> When I first started, it was at 3 1/2..</li>
            <li> I do suggest investing in a quality leave-in conditioner for the extra moisture for your ends if you do like to use heat (and of course a heat protectant) to keep your hair as healthy as possible. :)</li>
            <li> product and I will be back for more when I run out..</li>
            <li> It smells funny</li>
            <li> will say my hair grew about and inch within the first month.</li>
            <li> This most likely is contributing to the growth.</li>
            <li> I liked how it made my hair feel really silky and thicker, didnt dry my hair out or anything.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited that my own hair has grown quite a bit in the past month as well.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this product once so far, but it was amazing.</li>
            <li> even when my hair is back to my desired length, I will continue to order nisim fast because of how healthy my hair is.</li>
            <li> , afro/carribbean, dry, super thick hair and my hair really looks awesome now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s overall a good product I would definitely try it again</li>
            <li> This shampoo will only provide the fast growth, you need to complement it with conditioners to keep your hair healthy.</li>
            <li> There is a thick substance that covers your hair (is the best way I can think to describe it) when you shampoo and condition with this which actually increases the diameter of the hair follicle!</li>
            <li> However, it leaves my hair silky and healthy looking after each use and the conditioner is light enough to not weigh down my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Even my hubby uses it and his hair won&#x27;t stop growing and its super soft too!</li>
            <li> I did not notice any positive difference after two bottles of use.</li>
            <li> I started using fast shampoo and conditioner in July and for the first time \\&quot;what lil hair</li>
            <li> I receive compliments all the time about how healthy, shiny and long it is.</li>
            <li> I was using shampoos that was for long hair like Garnier Length &amp; Strength, the Mane&#x27;n Tail shampoo that I have used before many times, and even Alberto VO5 that has 5 vitamins -2 being Biotin &amp; Niacin that thickens and promotes hair growth.</li>
            <li> My hair grew pretty well fast.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to everyone that wants to grow there hair FAST!</li>
            <li> and I do believe I&#x27;ve seen some improvement with length and softer texture in my daughters hair as well as my own after only a few washes :)</li>
            <li> I actually purposely colored my hair so I can better document growth and my color stayed as vibrant as day one.</li>
            <li> My hair got cut REALLY short in 7th grade for locks of love, and now a sophomore in high school, it was shoulder length, but</li>
            <li> during this most recent summer, my hair was probably right at shoulder length, if not a little shorter.</li>
            <li> though I agree with most reviewers it does dry out your scalp.</li>
            <li> After just one use of this stuff, my hair was super silky &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> when you wash w/ this shampoo&amp;conditioner it gets SUPER soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> -  Yes, it did dry my hair out a bit, but not horribly so.  </li>
            <li> This product made my hair even more dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> It most defiantly didn&#x27;t dry my hair out</li>
            <li> I noticed no extra growth more than normal.</li>
            <li> hair is coming back to normal and more....</li>
            <li> This product does dry out your hair so make sure you use a leave in conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li> Every one is different so is the texture and length of hair but this shampoo change it to bouncy, long, good smelling hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if you have to use a product like this for a certain amount of time before noticing a result</li>
            <li> I can say that my hair is certainly healthier and appears to be stronger than before.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that my hair was coming out in large amounts in the shower.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to be growing faster in certain areas</li>
            <li> I purcahsed this package back in August the first time i used to it really enjoyed how soft and silky my hair was.</li>
            <li> It seems like it&#x27;s working, but it hasn&#x27;t quite been a month yet, so I do want to continue this shampoo for a few more months!</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed with the product, the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the product did not live up to it&#x27;s name, as I said before it did not make my hair grow faster, but it did leave it shiny and smooth, which is never a bad thing in my book.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s abundant thanks to my black side.</li>
            <li> Overall, good for your hair and smells nice, but not sure it actually promotes growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle and my hair has grown significantly since I first started using it.</li>
            <li> When I measured my hair from roots to the end of my new growth, I had 3 full inches of new hair growth.</li>
            <li> This provides a large margin of freedom for manufacturers to formulate their products without too much government interference.  </li>
            <li> I have a mix of coarse curly hair and fine stick straight hair.</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who wants their hair to grow fast!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really write an accurate review because I only tried it twice.</li>
            <li> and I have already noticed a few amazing changes in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its in my head or what, but this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I really hope this product works.</li>
            <li> After using these products, my hair felt waxy, and the stuff smelled like Nair (how ironic).  </li>
            <li> Update K so now its been 2 and 1/2 months since i have been using nisim&#x27;s FAST about 3-4 times per week, and yes it does make your hair grow</li>
            <li> I also really think that my hormones had somthing to do with the way it grew because the weeks that I was PMSing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really shed all that much</li>
            <li> I was really fooled...</li>
            <li> My hair has always been really oily..</li>
            <li> Will have to wait and see whether or not the product really works.</li>
            <li> My hair really did grow a lot faster and healthier.</li>
            <li> Takes time but after 4 weeks, you can tell the hair has grown fast.</li>
            <li> I used Pantene Pro V before this product and my hair wouldn&#x27;t fall out as much.</li>
            <li> It was so brittle and lifeless that I couldn&#x27;t even really run my fingers through it.</li>
            <li> Eventually, I decided to give FAST a shot</li>
            <li> How ironic...</li>
            <li> My hair is so much easier to style</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so much softer now.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li> But this is coming from someone who pays very close attention to her hair.</li>
            <li> In conclusion, the product didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown so much faster</li>
            <li> WHEN I CAME HOME LOOKED UP SOME FAST HAIR GROWTH PRODUCTS AND SEEN ALOT OF REVIEWS ON THIS ONE</li>
            <li> I did notice that my hair grew, but so much of my hair fell out while washing it that it made me regret using the shampoo.</li>
            <li> but once I repeat with the shampoo it lathers very easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like Renpure&#x27;s \\&quot;My</li>
            <li> I really like Garnier Sleek and Shine Smoothing Milk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> I didnt see much of a difference in length</li>
            <li> FAST shampoo is a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt my hair but it didn&#x27;t really help it either.</li>
            <li> So, I ordered the FAST shampoo and the conditioner.</li>
            <li> The rest of my hair needs as much oil and moisture that it can get.</li>
            <li> and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product!</li>
            <li> I have used PAUL MITCHELL AWAPUHI which are very pricey shampoos/conditioners</li>
            <li> and I dyed it a day before I received FAST in the mail,</li>
            <li> I believe massaging the scalp while washing your hair with any shampoo will promote fast hair growth, plus having patience and persistence.</li>
            <li> It drys out your hair to much.</li>
            <li> I order this once a month because it really does work.</li>
            <li> Very disapointed.</li>
            <li> but when i would use it i noticed way to much of my hair coming out too.</li>
            <li> so this stuff will probably help hair growth but get ready to shed and lose your edges and some of your hair.</li>
            <li> i had split ends, breaking, shedding and my ends were thinning out and very stringy.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it really works on</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s made my hair so much healthier as well.</li>
            <li> I noticed that I didn&#x27;t lose as much hair...</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my hair felt engorged as opposed to stringy during the scrub (I could really use a product like this for another parts of my body).</li>
            <li> Thats when I came across a miracle- FAST Shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown TWO INCHES since I have used FAST.</li>
            <li> I had a precise starting point</li>
            <li> so I know how much it grew.</li>
            <li> I was determined and very hopeful.</li>
            <li> leaves my hair soft, fresh and manageable.</li>
            <li> so I can really see how fast the roots are growing-</li>
            <li> i never had sooo much split ends in my life...</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t grow much at all</li>
            <li> It absolutely works.</li>
            <li> I said yes, my hair grows fast.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely would recommend this for anyone who is looking to have their hair grow fast.</li>
            <li> I really works</li>
            <li> My daughter had a bit too much taken off the bottom at the hair dresser and was devastated.</li>
            <li> She used it faithfully every day and her hair has grown so much already.  </li>
            <li> Had a very severe haircut done because of damage.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in hair growth..</li>
            <li> my hair takes a while to start growing but when it does, it grows fast</li>
            <li> and I relax it because I just prefer straight hair all the time.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nisim FAST shampoo for about a week now.</li>
            <li> it will really grow my hair</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Very affordable as well.</li>
            <li> , once I got it I went straight to the shower to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Who knows, I may end up giving FAST another try.</li>
            <li> I was really nervous about purchasing FAST</li>
            <li> what I did see was that my hair was really shiny and silky, but not oily, ,my sister even notices and even my friends.  </li>
            <li> But as soon as the month ended I stoped buying it because it was to much money I would have to be spending</li>
            <li> The downside is that it is VERY drying.</li>
            <li> Seeing the online reviews for FAST, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I did not want to have to use twice as much conditioner.</li>
            <li> Also, no matter what I do I seem to get a layer of build-up on my scalp which really annoys me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> use the FAST shampoo as instructed, lathering, rinsing and then repeating.</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the speed of hair growth.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this stuff</li>
            <li> I really do believe it did really help hair growth at the beginning--</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing fast</li>
            <li> I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Doing this routine really helped my hair grow fast with this product.</li>
            <li> and i really got scared.</li>
            <li> After using this shampoo/condtioner for one month it made me break out along my hairline and caused my ahir to become very brittle and poofy</li>
            <li> Will always use this shampoo and would HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> We tried this for my elderly mother and didn&#x27;t really notice a difference on her.</li>
            <li> but then I used this and it grew so fast</li>
            <li> This shampoo really cleanses hair really well.</li>
            <li> Fast works well where it supposed to it</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really know why I did but didn&#x27;t happen..</li>
            <li> I just used it today, but I will update when I have used the whole bottle, &amp; in that review I will leave the result, whether or whether not this product produces hair growth.</li>
            <li> literally, my hair grew so fast.</li>
            <li> I also really like the scent.</li>
            <li> No results but didn&#x27;t use the whole bottle</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t have to use it for too much longer.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt recommend this product to anyone who wants to grow their hair longer.</li>
            <li> That will get you much farther than this money sucking product.</li>
            <li> So I found another reputable stylist who fixed the cut although my hair was left even shorter.</li>
            <li> It was not only soft but seemed to have alot more body.</li>
            <li> In about a week, i got my products, earlier than expected, that&#x27;s always good.</li>
            <li> Loving this product I got the big bottles and use it every day and now my hair has grown a total of 4 inches!</li>
            <li> The more reviews i have read i do wish i had not wasted my money as i think the key to growing hair is all in your diet and stay away from using styling tools every day.</li>
            <li> I love my results so far, hopefully it keeps up in the future!</li>
            <li> lol I didnt even get through half the bottle!!!!</li>
            <li> I have very curly, frizzy, unruly hair but styled right with good product (by professionals that never give me the secret products they use..</li>
            <li> Feels so soft!!!</li>
            <li> I am hoping that this complete package formula will do the trick!!!</li>
            <li> , it felt so soft and made my hair feel like it came right out of the salon every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i was so excited to use this because i used to have pretty long hair, but it was split from all the dying</li>
            <li> Im hoping to get my hair long enough to cut next year and send to locks of love :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes to a huge foam with very little shampoo and it doesn&#x27;t take much conditioner to smooth your hair, but as a hair grower, it&#x27;s a no-go.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, I will continue to buy this product because even though it hasn&#x27;t made my hair grow faster, I do love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;ll never buy another shampoo other than this.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered the smaller shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time today and my hair is SOOO soft !</li>
            <li> I love the f.a.s.t. shampoo for helping with hair growth, and use it every other shampoo to supplement my biotin regimen.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know for sure if it grew any faster than it would have with any other product.</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s almost back to it&#x27;s original length.</li>
            <li> Bodycare product manufacturers, on their own responsibility, use any raw material as a cosmetic ingredient and market the product.  </li>
            <li> As a young girl I had always had long hair, my mom made sure of it.</li>
            <li> Also, for the first go round, I was also using this in combinationof my favorite conditioners (Suave and VO5)</li>
            <li> There is nothing special about this product it is just regular shampoo</li>
            <li> come fast and is less money than with most dealers.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to read the good reviews on this product before purchasing NISIM F.A.S.T, so since my very horrible hair cut LAST July I have been looking for good products to promote hair growth.</li>
            <li> When I first used this product I could not believe how soft my hair was.</li>
            <li> I kid you not, I get compliments EVERY day now on how pretty my hair is and how soft it is.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really seem to make your hair grow any faster than normal.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair about every 3 days, and it&#x27;s very healthy and thick.</li>
            <li> Also my drain after every shower would be full of hair.. enough to clog it!</li>
            <li> One tip though, some people said it feels like it dries out their hair, and I want to tell you if you use it correctly, and only apply the shampoo to your scalp DIRECTLY, and do NOT bring it through your ends, you will be just fine.</li>
            <li> This shampoo kind of makes my hair coarse and dry, but I use Moroccan oil to help that!</li>
            <li> so my 12 oz bottles are about more than half way done.</li>
            <li> From the roots, I have noticed that there is considerably less build-up on my scalp, and there is definitely much more volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> This is why many people believe that black women hair do not grow.</li>
            <li> In less then another 20 days my hair grew more than before.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a deep conditioning treatment that I left on for an hour once or twice a week to cope with the static.</li>
            <li> Like I said, this is only my second use of the products, but I love them.</li>
            <li> These \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products are primarily composed of synthetic chemicals mixed with some natural ingredients .         </li>
            <li> My short layers left me feeling like Mr. Bigglesworth (in Austin Powers) when I am striving to feel more like a Fembot.</li>
            <li> I did also do deep conditioning once a week as I was not only trying to grow my hair but keep it healthy to speed up results.</li>
            <li> I have to get my hair cut super short!</li>
            <li> I am going to buy a big bottle next time :)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anybody who is trying to grow their hair.</li>
            <li> I am Black mixed with American, lol.</li>
            <li> A little challenging when one has color on their hair.  </li>
            <li> However, after leaving it in for a few minutes, and rinsing it out, i dried and styled my hair and it was so smooth and healthy already!</li>
            <li> With the tremendous growth of the natural products industry in recent years, it is no wonder that a whole new generation of \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; products is springing up in neighborhood drug and health food stores alike.</li>
            <li> However, I bought this product for a friend who had colored hair (natural brunette, gone purple) who said that this really stripped the purple out of her hair.</li>
            <li> I hope it helps because it really did clear up my scalp.</li>
            <li> Normally I have oily hair</li>
            <li> Now I find myself writing my own negative review.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped straightening it since this product is recommended to use everyday, and I am actually comfortable wearing my hair curly now!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love the smell, but it wasn&#x27;t noticable once hair was dried.</li>
            <li> It dried out my hair and gave me more spilt ends.</li>
            <li> I decided to stop using the product and have returned to my normal shampoo and my hair is improving</li>
            <li> Further comments by Dr. Epstein criticized regulatory agencies and the cosmetic industry in the US for knowing that DEA \\&quot;reacts with nitrites in cosmetics to form another potent carcinogen, nitrosos/DEA\\&quot; and not taking any action to phase out its use although European governments and industries had done so already since the 1980&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> And I have noticed quicker growth than I normally would if I hadn&#x27;t used the product.</li>
            <li> However, if you use the conditioner after, then it renews your hair and makes it feel normal again.</li>
            <li> AS ANY NORMAL SHAMPOO WOULD AND</li>
            <li> First of all, you only want to really wash your scalp when using this product.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews and most of them said that it dried out their hair, not mines.</li>
            <li> As soon as I started using this, my hair felt healthier and within a few days, I saw progress. :)</li>
            <li> I actually bought both the shampoo and conditioner for 20$ which is not bad at all, since I usually spend more on my hair products.</li>
            <li> I had far less breakage and my hair looks stronger and has a lovely sheen....</li>
            <li> right now my hair is above my bra strap</li>
            <li> If you want long hair quick grab it now.</li>
            <li> and I have to straighten it all the time to tame it, which leds to more damage of course...</li>
            <li> The smell was okay, not offensive and not really strong either.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more in the future just to make sure I use for at least 6 months, since I have heard you should definitely see results by then.</li>
            <li> It does double your hair growth which is great, but hair grows so slowly in the first place that it will take a long time to tell the difference.</li>
            <li> i will use this product even when i get all my long hair back because its a decent price and everything is true about it!</li>
            <li> A Material Safety Data Sheet which \\&quot;contains written or printed material concerning a hazardous material as prescribed by law\\&quot;, including information \\&quot;needed to insure the safety and health of the user at all stages of manufacture, storage, use, and disposal\\&quot;, for SLS reports that it is harmful if inhaled, ingested, left on skin too long,  and it poses dangers to the eyes as it can accumulate in the tissues of the eye causing possible cataracts.          </li>
            <li> Did not like original FAST shampoo - extremely drying to my 4C natural hair</li>
            <li> (but my hair still looks a little longer because the back of my head is catching up.)</li>
            <li> so nothing new.</li>
            <li> (WTH is in this product??).I would be cautious if I was a new client.</li>
            <li> After I started using this stuff my hair has grown 2 inches since the week before new years.</li>
            <li> People may say, \\&quot;Oh you&#x27;re loosing hair because you are getting new growth\\&quot; --</li>
            <li> Not only does my hair grow about twice as fast, it has made my hair thicker, healthier, and much fuller.</li>
            <li> The price is much cheaper than on the actual product website, and the shipping is fast.</li>
            <li> If you wash your whole head with this product, your hair will feel very brittle (and I actually think this goes for non-blacks as well).</li>
            <li> i used two of this packs and - tadaaaa - my hair grew really fast, got thick and healthy</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft and seems healthier and for this reason I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I am highly recommending this product so far...</li>
            <li> I mean, it REALLY dries it out and on top of it all it strips your hair color</li>
            <li> But overall it was a really good product and hope to purchase it againg for the same price or a little  bit cheaper.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s completely transformed my hair!  </li>
            <li> I will be updating this post exactly one month from now to give my input and possibly change the rating.</li>
            <li> and I ignored the hair, figuring it was just because it hadn&#x27;t been brushed or something, but it has happened consistently.</li>
            <li> The first month I noticed about an inch of growth, the second month was also close to an inch.</li>
            <li> When you first use the shampoo, it will make your hair feel knotted and gross in the shower.</li>
            <li> My hair was permed for the first time, they left the chemicals on for 2 hours!!!</li>
            <li> I was completely devastated!</li>
            <li> The funny thing is, i have only used it four times!</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian with normal, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Be aware that this productts might work differently for everyone !</li>
            <li> but it did do what the product is ment to do my hair grew about an inch being that it was bearly touching my coller bone to now being past it.</li>
            <li> the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that I had to wash my hair with hot water that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it a 4 stars</li>
            <li> and my hair feels incredibly soft!</li>
            <li> I find the exact opposite.</li>
            <li> It was pretty gross.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner, not really sure if my hair is growing faster</li>
            <li> Literally 4-5 times more than usual.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is not hard on your hair and the conditioner makes your hair feel soo soft.</li>
            <li> For the price - I expected a pretty decent combo!</li>
            <li> I have tryed other products that have simaler claims that retail for more, its worth the extra expence because this stuff will dry your scalp, give you dangruff , make you pull your hair out!</li>
            <li> I went to have my hair cut by a new stylist and she completely wrecked my hair -</li>
            <li> so far it&#x27;s the first bottle and it wont be the last one....</li>
            <li> I first assume it was because I hadnt brushed my hair so it had built up, but after several times of large amounts of hair loss</li>
            <li> A little history, I was born a blonde, but as I got older my natural color became more of a chestnut brown.</li>
            <li> Now, If your hair is like mine, Fast shampoo will dry out your hair( using FAST conditioner don&#x27;t help).</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin straight hair, &amp; this makes my hair feel so soft &amp; silky.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t fall out or dry, but it does rip chemical hair color right out.</li>
            <li> However, the FDA classifies cosmetic ingredients according to their degree of toxicity and prohibits the use of certain ingredients proven to be unsafe for use on humans such as certain colorants and some prohibited or restricted ingredients (such as hexachlorophene, mercury compounds, and chloroform).</li>
            <li> I also think the over all health of my hair improved a little, but there wasn&#x27;t a huge difference.</li>
            <li> It smells like a normal shampoo and doesn&#x27;t really do anything other than make your hair grow fast.</li>
            <li> You should be very proactive about the other products that you use in your hair (read the ingredients, actually know what they are), find out what works in your hair, experiment with different type of hair oils, find out what your roots are craving as well as your ends, find a really good thirst quenching leave-in conditioner if you&#x27;re prone to dry hair, let your hair air-dry as much as possible...</li>
            <li> I decided to give this nisim fast a try, not only does it make my hair soft</li>
            <li> My hair is back to the natural color looks much healthier</li>
            <li> Ever used a clarifying shampoo or a clear (no pearliness/creaminess)bodifying shampoo?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d use the Fast conditioner on and near my scalp, and deep condition the middle-to-ends with whatever goo moves you.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner for my 18 year old daughter as she swore it was supposed to make hair grow.</li>
            <li> , my hair didn&#x27;t fall out ( i have color processed hair), my hair felt bouncy and soft, it showed results and this product works.</li>
            <li> and it makes your hair incredibly soft because it&#x27;s an AMINO TREATMENT.</li>
            <li> so i dont want to say it is completely from the shampoo</li>
            <li> faster accomplishes this buy wiping out all the natural oils and nutrients when you use it.</li>
            <li> So I decided to shave my head and just let it grow out natural.</li>
            <li> and she could not belive how much my hair had grown since she saw me last!</li>
            <li> I had one of the old bottles stored away and just rediscovered it, It was expired</li>
            <li> It was shiney and soft, but made it have a wierd texture.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The smell is kinda funky, like old women perfume BUT doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> Because of a very stressful event in my life and in turn not eating properly, my hair began to fall out and break off.</li>
            <li> My husband keeps complimenting me on how soft it is.</li>
            <li> I also deep condition after I use a heat styling tool which isn&#x27;t very often.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;wow your hair is getting long\\</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using it for nearly a month now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about three months, the 1st month i didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference but the last 2 months</li>
            <li> The rest of my hair has seen about 3/4 of an inch of growth so far.</li>
            <li> I purchased FAST Shampoo and Conditioner to not only lengthen my hair but also improve its texture.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this shampoo/conditioner set actually makes your hair grow fast because I will not continue to use it to find out.</li>
            <li> Overall it really does work.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I was a natural hair color I would&#x27;ve seen some growth thru the month</li>
            <li> I tried pills, I tried natural supplements.</li>
            <li> I have just started to record the growth as far as length and hope to post the pictures on line.</li>
            <li> though I am writing this review a bit too early, I figured I&#x27;d add my 2 cents anyway.  </li>
            <li> Hair naturally grow 1/2 an inch once monthly and 6 inches within a year.</li>
            <li> wo is willing to change their shampoo and grow their hair long faster.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s something that would have to be fixed before purchasing again.</li>
            <li> not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if it does not help grow my hair,  then I&#x27;d much rather use a different shampoo set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It completely strips your hair of dye.. and it seemed like it even altered the natural hair color as well.</li>
            <li> So I buy the FAST system because it falls in the middle of the price gamut damit.</li>
            <li> It was a reasonable price so if it didn&#x27;t work, I would only be out $25.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo was very stripping, and the conditioner wasn&#x27;t enough to counteract it.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair</li>
            <li> It is shiny, soft and even feels thicker.</li>
            <li> I would recommend doing intense deep conditioning if you try this product.</li>
            <li> It really works, i can only speak for the mix girls</li>
            <li> I let it grow for some time naturally</li>
            <li> so I can see the darker hair thats grown in so far.</li>
            <li> And being a woman of color I wanted to find products to maximize my natural hair growth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product directly off of the Nisim Canada website, and once my order was placed it took two days for delivery.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice so far</li>
            <li> I also wasn&#x27;t too comfortable with the amount of chemicals and sulfates in the shampoo, i have heavily processed hair and were looking for something to treat and make healthier.</li>
            <li> Nisim leaves my hair soft, i just leave the conditioner on for about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Mostly she just complained that the conditioner made her hair feel a bit greasy afterwards.</li>
            <li> but i like it so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this weekly or something, and I just came out of the shower after using it once so far</li>
            <li> It makes my hair really soft and I can start to see changes in the length</li>
            <li> I have a whole foot left to grow!!</li>
            <li> it left my hair very tangled.</li>
            <li> Hair was however soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It also kinda smells like old-school setting lotion (like an old lady</li>
            <li> If you have evr met anybody who partakes in these sort of sports then you know we usually have kind of long hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick, healthy hair</li>
            <li> If you want to compare your hair to mine: I have thick, golden-brown, wavy hair that dries out if I don&#x27;t take care of it (i.e. heat styling), but mostly is soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> People with thicker hair can tolerate it better, but anyone with hair that isn&#x27;t really thick, DO NOT buy it.</li>
            <li> but right now my goal is to get me my big hair back</li>
            <li> Nisim worked for me, though the results weren&#x27;t as strong as i&#x27;d hoped for I did notice about an extra 2-3 cm a month when I was using it (my hair grows really slowly, on average hair grows 1/2 inch a month</li>
            <li> First of all, there is a misconception that black women hair do not grow as fast as non-blacks.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a little over a month and haven&#x27;t noticed a significant increase in length that I would give F.A.S.T. any credit for.</li>
            <li> At first, I noticed that my hair was getting dry from using it</li>
            <li> The first one I ever tried made my hair extremely dry which is why I was reluctant to try this one.</li>
            <li> so my hair was pretty dry to start with.</li>
            <li> I was at 3 inches of new growth on April 9, 2013 and two weeks later (April 23, 2013), I was at 4 inches of new growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have light brown hair but dye it blonde, I dyed it three days before I started using Fast, and usually it takes two to three weeks for my roots to start showing noticeably</li>
            <li> It smells good, not a strong smell but a faint clean smell.</li>
            <li> I have more black ppl hair than I have mixed girl or white people hair.</li>
            <li> First of all I am African American.</li>
            <li> Bodycare and cosmetic products are not considered medicines and are therefore not subject to FDA approval, nor does the FDA try to regulate the body care industry.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a diference in lenght in the first few weeks but</li>
            <li> just used this shampoo and conditioner combo for the first time today and my hair is very soft and there wasn&#x27;t as much breakage as there usually is.</li>
            <li> ends were very dry the first two times I washed so</li>
            <li> It really does grow fast, I just recommend every other day and you will a difference within a week!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you have similar hair as me, and I&#x27;m considering buying this set again!</li>
            <li> Nobody keeps the same hair forever, your hair naturally falls out over time as NEW hair grows in.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel hard at all, it actually feels soft after using the conditioner.</li>
            <li> i wear extentions, because i really wish i had long hair.</li>
            <li> &quot; it really did look long that day. .</li>
            <li> My hair has always been long and I had to cut much of it off</li>
            <li> But if the dryness gets excessive I&#x27;m going to have to lay off of it and return if I deem it to be fit to returning too.</li>
            <li> I did notice that it made my hair manageable because my hair was pretty rough.</li>
            <li> It is very likely that the ingredients list of the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoo will contain one of the following three chemical additives, as do all other regular shampoos, as one of its top three ingredients: DEA or Diethanolamine, Propylene Glycol, SLS or Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, and SLES or Sodium Laureth Sulfate.          </li>
            <li> The American Academy of Dermatologists, Inc. published a clinical review in January 1991 which implicated Propylene Glycol as a cause of a significant number of reactions and as a primary irritant to the skin even in low levels of concentrations.</li>
            <li> No significant quick hair growth  in-</li>
            <li> so I bought it for her to calm her down.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo system won&#x27;t grow your hair like the boy in The Peanut Butter Solution, but it may help give your hair a little boost in growing a little more than what your hair type normally does.  </li>
            <li> When I got my new bottle of conditioner, I began the routine again but this only lasted me about 8 or 9 days.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again only because I did not see any new growth within 2 months of using it.</li>
            <li> Comparing the new with the old, the only difference is the old products had emulsifying wax as an ingredient, I wonder why they excluded this from the current product?It also wasn&#x27;t labeled by \\&quot;Nisim\\</li>
            <li> and really course and dry.</li>
            <li> I used it for a month straight and all the negatives that people claimed like dry scalp, color stripping and foul smell did not come to pass for me.</li>
            <li> As a African- American Women who had the hardest time growing out my hair this product really helped.</li>
            <li> I used FAST shampoo &amp; conditioner according to the directions on the package, every single day give or take maybe two or three days.</li>
            <li> I am not claiming that this product did not work or does not work for some, but after two months of consistent use (I did not use any other hair shampoos or conditioners)</li>
            <li> This is a cause of concern, as SLS enters and maintains residual levels in the lungs, liver, and brain from skin contact,causing major problems in these areas.            </li>
            <li> As stated in other reviews the product lasted me exactly a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to the hairdresser in a few days to get my hair cut evenly then leaving it alone for good to let nature do its&#x27; thing and in a few years I&#x27;ll have long, lucious hair</li>
            <li> At first she used the shampoo AND conditioner every single day for the first month and then during the second month used it every other day.</li>
            <li> So IF FAST does dry out your hair, try adding that balm!</li>
            <li> it was because the CLEAN smell, no more than that,</li>
            <li> I used to have waist length, super thick, straight blonde hair.</li>
            <li> And also, it does dry out your hair a bit, but an extra conditioner, a hair mask at least once a week, and some leave in conditioner should keep your hair healthy, and definitely stay away from heat products as much as you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think they hay have helped the growing process, but in general they are not &amp;#34;miracle shampoo and conditioner&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I had my hair cut a week ago by the same stylist who fixed my hair</li>
            <li> apparently the hair dresser thought an 1.5 meant 4.5 inches</li>
            <li> First of all my hair was long the next 3 months it is up to my mid neck.</li>
            <li> Yet, do the companies using this marketing tool really have the integrity to carefully select their ingredients so that their claims are factual?</li>
            <li> However, I have been highlighting my hair to be blonde for nearly 20 years now.</li>
            <li> I had curly soft hair before a relaxer treatment that was intended for coarse hair and lost some hair at the nape of my neck and my temples.</li>
            <li> and it left it really soft.</li>
            <li> This is my second order so far.</li>
            <li> so I barely used this.</li>
            <li> it left my hair soft and also seemed to work--</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t get 1 inch in the next 4 weeks it cannot possibly be possible to grow hair faster than normal.</li>
            <li> I just did not want ANY more unnecessary hair loss.</li>
            <li> Phyto is kind of expensive</li>
            <li> It gives it a weird texture and feels kind of like hay.</li>
            <li> what I&#x27;ve started doing is apply thick cheap conditioner to my ends BEFORE I shampoo</li>
            <li> It worked at first and then about a few weeks into it my hair became dry and was breaking more then usual.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 things of this shampoon/conditioner and have used it for over a month and have noticied not a single difference in length in my hair!</li>
            <li> Second, the shampoo didn&#x27;t dry my hair out all that much</li>
            <li> I recieved my shampoo &amp; conditioner a few days ago, and used them right away.</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair or normal you will have issues with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I switched to WEN which has completely saved my hair, it grows at a normal pace but its how my hair feels and looks that make me never want to use any other brand of shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried for so long to get my hair back to its healthy state and just by using this product it seemed like all my hard work was stripped away from my hair.</li>
            <li> BUT AS FAR AS PAYING AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE TO FOR IT ,ITS NOT WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a frizzy hot mess.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any difference from using this compared to using any other shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I got a perm two years ago and it left my hair VERY damaged and dry and nothing I did, from deep conditioners and repairing shampoos and conditioners, nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li> The only change I did see was how soft it left my hair.</li>
            <li> and my oily scalp did not dry out even with me washing every day...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had thick, full hair and now my hairline is receding along the corners on each side of my forehead and temples and my hair in general is THINNING.</li>
            <li> The diameter of my strands of hair are unbelievably thick, people say I have asian-like coarse hair (which is all about the diameter), but my hair isn&#x27;t strong like asian hair</li>
            <li> At first my hair seemed a little straw</li>
            <li> :) I don&#x27;t use it daily, as it says in the directions, but it still works extremely well and my hair has grown 75% faster as usual.</li>
            <li> It was feeling really dry and brittle and NOW it&#x27;s as soft as a feather!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve kind of experimented over the last few months, and came to the conclusion that you have to use it at LEAST every other wash to get real results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But since Ive used the shampoo and conditioner I have not had to put anything else in it to calm it down on straighten it!!</li>
            <li> I cut my hair super short this past Feb., and not it is Sept.</li>
            <li> She complained at first that the first month she noticed that her scalp would be dry and itchy but the second month it wasn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
            <li> The conditioner really doesn&#x27;t seem like it is a deep enough moisturizer for dry hair, so I have been using a deep conditioning treatment (Infusium for damaged hair)twice a week.</li>
            <li> Two other ingredients that commonly find themselves at the top of the list of ingredients of your \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoo are Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) and its sister chemical Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES).</li>
            <li> Secondly, I have only used it for 5-6 weeks and can not really say how much longer it has grown..</li>
            <li> but it does - i barely used other conditioners with it and had no negative side effects.</li>
            <li> I am pretty heavy handed</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo the first day, and I scrubbed it in my scalp with a boar hair brush, and after my hair was dried, (notice she had no idea I had received this shampoo yet)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a medication that seemed to have really slowed down my hair growth.</li>
            <li> Thus, there are many commonly used ingredients in cosmetics today with potential carcinogenic effects which have been so-far overlooked by the FDA and continue to be used in alarming proportions in daily cosmetic applications, even in \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products.         </li>
            <li> The middle of my hair was very short due to breakage and now the whole thing has evened out.</li>
            <li> it made my dry brittle hair, soft again</li>
            <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve been using this, I&#x27;ve had significantly less breakage, my hair&#x27;s been so much softer, and shinier</li>
            <li> I really like this product my hair falls out less</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to see maybe a quarter of an inch or half an inch of growth,</li>
            <li> I started taking pre-natal vitamins and biotin and got a whole inch and a half in about two months...</li>
            <li> , it made my hair knotty, thin, and breaks easily.</li>
            <li> I generally wear my hair in flat twists.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo before but not long enough to see a difference.</li>
            <li> I died my hair in the beginning of summer(june) black (naturally brown) and when early August came, My roots still hadn&#x27;t grown in, by the time the beginning of september came</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian and was not \\&quot;blessed\\&quot; with the typical straight and silky hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown considerably and I have any used half the product so far.  </li>
            <li> I have semi thick, super wavey coarse hair.</li>
            <li> If you are a black woman, do not be afraid to wash your hair everyday to get the best results from this product.</li>
            <li> my normal L&#x27;Oreal shampoo and conditioner that I use.&lt;br /&gt;Using this shampoo and conditioner, trying to only washing my hair every other day, and taking &amp;#34;hair skin and nails&amp;#34; supplement, has made my hair grow 1.5 inches</li>
            <li> anyways I came to Amazon two months ago determined to find a solution to losing so much hair, and also it stops growing when it gets to a little below my shoulders.</li>
            <li> So, although I seem to be right back where I started, I know that in a few months I&#x27;ll be on my way to long hair again!</li>
            <li> That might not seem like a whole lot, but my hair normally grows less than half an inch per month.</li>
            <li> Then on top of that, the shampoo dried my hair out and made it feel hard and brittle.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes but was let down....  </li>
            <li> my hair felt a little dry, but very very.</li>
            <li> I would be bald completely because of the dryness and breakage but also overheating with flat irons and blow-dryers which I have to do every single time I wash</li>
            <li> So I guess if you have a bad home dye job this is a good set.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry for the long review, but I&#x27;ve notice that a lot of black women wanted to know if this product really work for them.</li>
            <li> I have also used WEN and L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free shampoos but it has made my hair appear greasy and dirty, and they cost the same amount as the FAST product if not more, and I would use FAST over those products any day.</li>
            <li> I like it and it works however it can dry out your hair if your not careful.</li>
            <li> Sodium Laurel Sulfate is an irritant, and a shampoo containing 15% SLS is mainly tolerable because it comes in contact with the scalp for only a few minutes</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference after a week then had some breakage but hair felt soft&#x27; other than breakage</li>
            <li> I went in to donate my usual 12 inches to Locks of Love and left having lost at least 16 inches of hair and sporting layers that looked like they had been cut with garden shears.</li>
            <li> I do take hair, skin and nail vitamins from GNC and use professional grade leave-in conditioners and wash my hair with this product every OTHER day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In about a month I had roots roughly about 1.5 inches long instead of  (normally for me) 1 inch long.</li>
            <li> Because it does dry out my hair so much it takes me a while to untangle the mess after a shower.</li>
            <li> dry hair, easy to break, very hard to grow long.</li>
            <li> (I would recommend you bring a big bristle comb in the shower and comb out your hair really well, before putting on the conditioner), I poured a small amount and rubbed onto my ends and worked it to my roots.</li>
            <li> And it needs to be dried and/or straighten to look decent...</li>
            <li> Just about every Black woman in America is mixed (because of slavery) unless, they just got off the plane from Africa with natural 4C hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair grow much quicker than usual.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really growing fastER than usual.</li>
            <li> Not usually it&#x27;s greasy mess when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> I also flat ironed it every once in a while.</li>
            <li> My hair won&#x27;t be short for long.</li>
            <li> Between the bleaching, flat irons, and blow drying, my hair now feels like straw.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want all my long hair clumping out for a few new short strands.</li>
            <li> so sometimes it even feels a little to soft!</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;ll never make sense to me, but I definitely think it also helps to either wash your hair every other day or alternate your shampoo and conditioner with this product so that you are not doing this treatment daily like the bottle says.</li>
            <li> I blow dry or iron my hair ONLY once every one or two weeks.  </li>
            <li> &amp; Out of those time it left my hair so UNBELIEVABLY DRY .</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel brittle and dry and noticed nothing different.</li>
            <li> My only complaint with this shampoo is it really dries the hair out,</li>
            <li> The people who aren&#x27;t experiencing any growth are probably the ones who continue to straighten, don&#x27;t leave the conditioner on long enough, or thought they would get long hair overnight, who knows.</li>
            <li> Overall, no new growth but softer hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been growing but in the past few months ive been wanting my hair to grow extra FAST!!</li>
            <li> Anyone who has coily, curly hair, I would not recommend purchasing this product, because my hair is naturally coily, and it was a mess to detangle.</li>
            <li> I seriously could not belive how fast my hair grew!</li>
            <li> While on one hand, it is considered non-carcinogenic by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the National Toxicology Program (NTP), and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), there is still unveiling evidence that SLS produces a potential carcinogenic effect in your shampoo when it interacts with other nitrogen bearing ingredients to form nitrosamines ornitrates.</li>
            <li> Is it possible they do not consistently use the same ingredients?</li>
            <li> I know some people were complaining about it drying out their hair, but before I blow dry my hair, while it&#x27;s still wet, I use Beyond the Zone Smooth Criminal Blow Out Balm ($7.50 at Sally&#x27;s)</li>
            <li> This product left my scalp very dry.</li>
            <li> the only thing i have seen is that my hair is very dry when i use it.</li>
            <li> However, I must say the phytophanere has completely eradicated my dry scalp which has previously been categorized as seborrhic dermatitis which is a problem I&#x27;ve had for years</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to tell how fast my hair has grown.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t read most of the reviews and little was actually said about hair growth.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that grows very very slow, but since I started using this product it has growth at least 3 inches.  </li>
            <li> After getting my chest-length hair chopped off all the way to my chin, I pretty much immediately regretted it and was desperately looking for ways to speed up my hair growth.</li>
            <li> Sodium Laureth Sulfate is a milder version of SLS and is commonly used in industrial engine degreasers and in concrete cleansers among others with similar effects as SLS.         </li>
            <li> The descriptive, \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot;, has become a buzzword used by big and small companies trying to exploit the niche market of natural products.</li>
            <li> but once I started leaving the conditioner in for 5 minutes my hair came out soft and fluffy once I blow dryed it.</li>
            <li> it was a complete waste of money?  </li>
            <li> In two months my roots were 2 1/2 inches long .</li>
            <li> Both Shampoo and Conditioner did the unthinkable to my hair</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times on my daughter and her hair is finally growing back.  </li>
            <li> BUT KEEP THE LONG LENGTH</li>
            <li> (long before I even cared about growing my hair out)</li>
            <li> (I wanted an inch off my medium long hair...</li>
            <li> This means in simple terms that there are no legal guidelines and boundaries for manufacturers, controlling the substance of their \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; claims.</li>
            <li> Hairs is so freaking long.</li>
            <li> I bought this product not to long ago.</li>
            <li> after shampooing hair is a bit rough but the conditioner solves that problem instantly...</li>
            <li> as long as I have my Aussie leave in conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> I do not believe that you will wake up with a headfull of long flowing hair overnight or in a week.</li>
            <li> You will need another bottle of conditioner depending on how long your hair is.</li>
            <li> : I just got it, and it arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Plus I had an area of thinning hair that is completely unaffected..</li>
            <li> You do not want to wash your hair everyday for it strips your hair of its natural oils.</li>
            <li> I mention it because I am doing everything I can to get it long before vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever used Pink brand hair lotion for ethnic hair, that has a very similar scent.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but it was hard to deny that this actually worked, since I could see it right before my eyes.</li>
            <li> have fine hair and was afraid that it would be left flat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixed (black and white).</li>
            <li> Plus, even though it&#x27;s only been two weeks, my hair has actually grown about a half an inch already.</li>
            <li> So I am a Black American woman and I wanted to try this basically because I have heard mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> I will say that unlike some of the other reviews where people said the product dried out their hair it did the complete opposite for me.</li>
            <li> But the strange thing is, my nails and other bodily hair grows at a supersonic speed.</li>
            <li> -my hair barely grew half an inch.</li>
            <li> It is not fine, its super thick, and while it&#x27;s not nappy</li>
            <li> Major companies anxious to tap into the natural products market with its 20% yearly average growth rate are scrambling to produce \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; shampoos, hair dyes, and skincare products.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the shampoo leaves your hair a little bit dry feeling at first, so</li>
            <li> It takes about 6 months for my hair to grow only 3/4 of an inch normally, but while using this shampoo and conditioner, my hair grew one inch in 2 months, which is CRAZY fast for</li>
            <li> I am very blonde and I felt like there was a lot of build up of other conditioners on my hair.</li>
            <li> and if you can believe it or not my hair is 3 inches long already!</li>
            <li> - I only wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> did not see much of a difference, very small change</li>
            <li> My hair was little above my chin is now at my shoulder after I used my 2nd bottle!!!</li>
            <li> I would every day and not really deep condition it like other people would.  </li>
            <li> and I only use it every other day.</li>
            <li> About every 3rd wash, I use my &#x27;other&#x27; shampoo.  </li>
            <li> 4 stars only due to the dryness.  </li>
            <li> The only reason it gets two stars is because of the smell; other than that I would not recommend this to a friend and will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> My hair does not feel dry at all.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> but it may leave your hair a bit dry at times.</li>
            <li> However, by the end of the month my hair was dry and brittle with not anything to speak of in the way of accelerated growth</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t use this producth my hair today again just because it&#x27;s so dry.</li>
            <li> I have never suffered from having a dry or irritated scalp and this shampoo/conditioner set did that to me insantly.</li>
            <li> and it did in fact dry my hair and scalp out a ton.</li>
            <li> So-called \\&quot;natural\\&quot; cosmetics can still contain potentially harmful or irritant chemical preservatives, cheap, chemically derived aesthetic and texture enhancing additives, chemically derived sudsing agents, artificial colorants and fragrances.</li>
            <li> Some of its adverse effects include dermatitis, kidney and liver abnormalities and it has been shown to inhibit skin cell growth and damage cell membranes causing rashes, dry skin and surface damage to the skin.</li>
            <li> I cannot explain how dry my hair was after wards.</li>
            <li> if it does dry your hair out, the conditioner will help by leaving it on for 1-2 minutes as the instructions recommend.</li>
            <li> My scalp is itching off and my hair is sooo dry with no moisture.</li>
            <li> Dry your hair but use coconut oil resolve the problem</li>
            <li> it does it dry your hair out</li>
            <li> I use it every day as directed and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> and it made my scalp dry my hair</li>
            <li> Neither the shampoo or conditioner made my hair dry.</li>
            <li> but it made my hair feel really dry and brittle</li>
            <li> It does make my hair dry after</li>
            <li> The shampoo does dry out your hair, but the purpose of the conditioner is to complement the effects of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> it three times and my hair was still matted, and dry...</li>
            <li> so I had to let it dry like that...and start taking the tangles out...</li>
            <li> my hair again because it&#x27;s so dry.</li>
            <li> hair does feel dry after applying the shampoo</li>
            <li> Propylene Glycol, also known as the main TOXIC ingredient in industrial antifreeze, is also a commonly used humectant ingredient that may be used in your shampoo to give it its \\&quot;glide\\&quot; and in order to prevent the drying of the product.</li>
            <li> but I think that using this product over a long period of time really has dried my hair out and it is starting to feel like straw a little bit, and I have noticed little pieces keep breaking off my ends,</li>
            <li> Well, one need only read the ingredients of the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoo and to compare it to any conventional brand sold in every drugstore.          </li>
            <li> In addition, it would interest you to know that every single time before using this, I would run my fingers through my hair</li>
            <li> So at the end of the 30 days (May 9, 2013), I was a little less than 4 1/2 of new growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 3 weeks, and use it every other day because it tends to make my hair flat, but I do see a difference in the growth.</li>
            <li> For me, an extra boost in my growing journey is NOT worth the dryness and damage your hair goes through for this product to work.</li>
            <li> (DOWN TO MY LOWER BACK)</li>
            <li> and with this shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ll be back down to my longer length in no time.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t measure it down to the last inch before using it.</li>
            <li> I even made a shirt with one inch markings going down the back</li>
            <li> But all I got was shampoo and conditioner that really made no difference other than the need to use more product afterwards to tame the frizz. :(</li>
            <li> made hair grow, but made it thinner,break easily, and fall out like crazy.  </li>
            <li> The package began to dry my hair out and make it frizzy, though it DID make my hair grow!</li>
            <li> and I have seen about a half of centimeter of growth in the last 5 days</li>
            <li> The dangers of DEA were reported last year on CBS This Morning, in which Dr. Samuel Epstein, M.D. of the University of Illinois and one of the world&#x27;s foremost toxicologists, testified about the results of his study in which he found that DEA is \\&quot; a potential carcinogen\\&quot; and that in even small doses, repeated use of DEA increases the risk of cancer.</li>
            <li> Until this shampoo I had minimal growth at my temples and the hair that did grow was kinky and dry and soon broke.</li>
            <li> Third, I discovered that the massaging of the scalp as you wash and condition is part of the reason why my hair has sped up on growing about 1 and a half inches to 2 inches.</li>
            <li> Not only did my hair grow there was also less hair loss in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month an a half after a cut my hair short.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine hair that lays down and dies if I use any moisturizing product on it, so I&#x27;m used to a \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; feel.</li>
            <li> and I do personally like the smell, but its nothing out of the ordinary, and honestly the ingredients do seem bad,</li>
            <li> let it naturally air dry and be fine (I hated how poufy and short it looked)</li>
            <li> it felt soft and conditioned and ready to go air dry (and that&#x27;s just crazy talk for me).</li>
            <li> It does make hair shiny and softer, it has not dried it out like a lot of the other shampoos that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I got my hair cut about two months ago and have only used this product for a little over a month.</li>
            <li> You only need a little of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I know it has only been a little over 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a little over a month</li>
            <li> The only thing I did notice was it made my head breakout in little pimple things on my head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair gets a little bit greasy the next day</li>
            <li> Like some other reviews have mentioned, it does dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> I used it every other day, and within 3 washes my hair was SO extremely dry</li>
            <li> It is hard to say how much it has grown in the few weeks I have used it</li>
            <li> I am used to using very thick conditioners that really coat my hair (even though I am sure that&#x27;s unhealthy) and this conditioner is rather thin</li>
            <li> my hair is so heavy and thick and just very abused from everything I have put it through.</li>
            <li> My hair is short, I had to cut my almost  armpit length hair to my earlobe short when I damaged it beyond repair when I bleached it in late Oct. 2013.  </li>
            <li> It is only when you apply the conditioner and let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing that it&#x27;ll feel luscious.</li>
            <li> so that was a bummer, but I followed through and washed my hair everyday (not skipping a day) and massaged it into my scalp daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately a month in conjunction with a vitamin for hair growth and it really works.</li>
            <li> I suggest purchasing the larger bottles, as this product requires everyday usage.</li>
            <li> Plus I&#x27;ve never really had stubborn hair to begin with.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely not straight or a manageable curly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on and off for the last few months.  </li>
            <li> but I feel upset that I wasted money on something that left me at square one.</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> me, I think it is such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I never really notice a difference in hair growth</li>
            <li> and I found absolutely no accelerated growth whatsoever.</li>
            <li> he told me that all those products are total bs and waste of money.</li>
            <li> I think it is a mental thing, seeing the name of the product gave me a boost of enthusiasm to keep my hair growing out.</li>
            <li> I do notice it is a bit drying, so I tend to use a deep conditioner a few times a week with it.  </li>
            <li> never really noticed a difference with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I could barely keep up with my hair growth with this product so :/...</li>
            <li> THis makes your hair so rough and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> Alarming hair loss.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 2 MONTHS since I&#x27;ve used this product and during that time my hair has become extremely dry (like straw) and is THINNING and FALLING OUT!!</li>
            <li> My hair is also soft and shiny and no more tangles!</li>
            <li> The ends were so dry and crispy and my whole head of hair was so dry it felt fake.</li>
            <li> Every single time!!</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no positive difference from using the product.</li>
            <li> what it did is that every time I would shower I will loose alot of hair so down</li>
            <li> My only complaint it that it does dry your hair out...</li>
            <li> it grew faster than the other two weeks of the month.</li>
            <li> I was my hair every other day</li>
            <li> Usually I don&#x27;t care enough to do so.</li>
            <li> ANY OTHER SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER OUT THERE...</li>
            <li> I decided to buy both the shampoo and condish and have been using them for almost a month now every other day.</li>
            <li> my product came faster than expected and has worked fantastically!</li>
            <li> By proteins and other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It is deliberately used in clinical studies to irritate the skin so that the effects of other substances can be tested.</li>
            <li> I wash it every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other types of hair growth shampoo&#x27;s before.</li>
            <li> Other than that this is a miracle product</li>
            <li> it is growing at the same speed as usual.</li>
            <li> the other day</li>
            <li> Due to my sleeping habits, I know it&#x27;s me to blame.</li>
            <li> I used this every other day and sometimes don&#x27;t even get to the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try other alternatives.</li>
            <li> I will continue until the bottles are gone because I know these sort of things don&#x27;t happen overnight like some of the other reviews I read stating that there hair grew an inch in a month and all that...</li>
            <li> Other then not waking up with Rapunzel like hair</li>
            <li> For some dumb reason I decided to cut it into this very short hair style where the back was buzzed and the front was about chin-length.</li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;d prefer to use other brands.  </li>
            <li> but I am looking at other alternatives.</li>
            <li> I brought it because of a upcoming wedding, but I will have to use other alternatives.  </li>
            <li> This is because it is stripping the moisture from your hair and other things like product build up.</li>
            <li> All products will works depends on the health conditions, food and other stuff.  </li>
            <li> , maybe, other people will said IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> and i decided to wash it every other day.</li>
            <li> no thanks!</li>
            <li> The directions say to use it everyday, which is unthinkable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately due to peer pressure I am growing it out again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plenty conditioning for my picky hair, but I can see where other people would need to supplement it.</li>
            <li> Yes it does dry my hair out a little, but its nothing conditioner can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> it felt a little dry while i was in the shower, which worried me.</li>
            <li> In reading all the reviews good and bad I was totally confused about whether or not I wanted to try this product.</li>
            <li> Bubble bath is defined by the FDA as \\&quot;any product intended to be added to the bath for the purpose of producing foam and containing a surface active agent serving as a detergent or foaming agent\\&quot; and produces \\&quot;risks\\&quot; which \\&quot;have been known for some time\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that I recently cut very short</li>
            <li> According with them is deactivate the  active compound in the shampoo).</li>
            <li> but I got a horrendous haircut and was desperate for my hair to grow as fast as possible.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 months now, and my hair is finally down past my shoulders when 3 months ago it was above my shoulders.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First let me indicate that my hair is moderately frizzy, flat and considerably thin due to bleaching.</li>
            <li> I had really long hair, like I mean down to your butt long hair</li>
            <li> I  blow dry my hair sometimes but lately I have given it time to air dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen another black woman do it every other day as well</li>
            <li> My hair was a little above my ear now its past my ear it also stops breakage i like it.</li>
            <li> It is hard to tell after only a month&#x27;s use of this product</li>
            <li> I moved a few months ago and in turn lost the stylist who was the only person to I trusted to cut my hair for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as to whether this product would really work.  </li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t so much so that I was uncomfortable with it.</li>
            <li> Of course I was skeptical and questioned myself as to if I really should buy the product</li>
            <li> After looking at multiple websites, testimonials, and negative reviews, I decided to go for it.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d have a very short pixie by late spring.</li>
            <li> It is not worth it buying it at all</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, its not worth the negatives.</li>
            <li> After a bleaching mishap, I lost quite a bit of hair that broke off about 1\\&quot; from my roots so needless to say I was in dire need of fast growth.  </li>
            <li> I cut my hair off a couple years ago and it still has not since then gotten long or grown past my shoulders...</li>
            <li> this stuff honestly is not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have somewhat coarse, wavy, and thick hair.</li>
            <li> I am a latin female with thick, wavy, &amp; colored hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this set to help grow out my hair and hoped to make it thicker for a wedding 6 months down the road.</li>
            <li> This may have been in part me not wearing my hair down, though.</li>
            <li> It did not weight my hair down, nor make it feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I had to cut my hair up to my collarbone when it used to be down to ribcage.</li>
            <li> so while I lather my scalp, my ends are protected from the shampoo that slides down my hair.</li>
            <li> When I recieved the products I took my hair down for shampooing and conditioning.  </li>
            <li> my bangs r now down to my eyebrows...</li>
            <li> and when I started I wouldn&#x27;t even wear my hair down</li>
            <li> Rub the product into your scalp and let it flow down the length.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> Obviously it isn&#x27;t for everyone and just because it worked on me doesn&#x27;t mean it will work on you.</li>
            <li> I usually have to wash my hair because it gets dry.</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s the typical average hair growth for women 1/2 or 0.5 each month giving me 3 inches for 6 months)</li>
            <li> So therefore, I am the typical Black American woman with thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair growth is slow to begin with but this definitely adds a little bit of speed to the process for those looking for longer hair quicker.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it everyday due to my laziness</li>
            <li> The conditioner made it a little softer, but it basically matted my hair and made it very tangled and difficult to manage.</li>
            <li> Other reviews claimed the product dried their hair out...</li>
            <li> Hair loss was too much, price was little expensive...</li>
            <li> the scent of this shampoo &amp; conditioner does Not smell bad to me, it smells like a clean laundry detergent and fabric softener scent.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, in the midst of DYING to find a way to get my hair to grow longer faster, I found this product and ignored all of the bad reviews and stuck to the good ones.</li>
            <li> so far nothing dramatic at all.</li>
            <li> Well i can tell you that after two weeks of grow out my gray hair was measuring a half an inch.</li>
            <li> At the end of April, my hair had grown an inch and a half.</li>
            <li> It typically grows about a 1/2 inch in a month.</li>
            <li> My hair grew half an inch in one month</li>
            <li> but I can not say this product gave me that growth because my hair always grow half an inch on</li>
            <li> seen slight results.&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li> Arrived in less than a week.</li>
            <li> but I also notice slight dryness.</li>
            <li> and I seriously cannot say enough about it.</li>
            <li> I gave a bottle to my friend, who dyes her hair black, and she said that she wished she could&#x27;ve kept using it, but it faded her hair color.  </li>
            <li> After using it for just 2 weeks my hair grew half an inch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say a half inch.</li>
            <li> Also, it was less frizzy when blow drying...</li>
            <li> My hair typically grows 1/4 inch a month.</li>
            <li> The hair does not even grow half an inch per month.</li>
            <li> I also like to believe that I lose less hair in the showers.</li>
            <li> I also noticed less breakage while combing the conditioner through my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other Products Also Used Durring this use of this product: Jamaican Black Castor Oil and Chi Infra Shampoo</li>
            <li> I have noticed less hair coming out when I brush it.</li>
            <li> I def got about half a milimeter if that.</li>
            <li> i noticed about a half to three quarters of an inch of hair growth ( for myself that was a miracle).</li>
            <li> think put my hair in a protective style (a ponytail) using my Shea Moisture and Ampro Gel (aka black gel).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black</li>
            <li> the only disappointment in that short time period was that it seemed to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> The bottles lasted about a month and a half.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s less gunk keeping hair stuck, whereas moisturizing products build up and hold hair in longer.</li>
            <li> It could be a coincidence that my hair decided to start growing around the same time that I started using FAST, but as you can see from my past history that is highly unlikely!   </li>
            <li> She had grown her hair down to her waist, and when she asked for a trim I think the hairdresser went a little nutso and lopped off about 4 inches.  </li>
            <li> I do have long thick hair</li>
            <li> I combatted this by diluting the product slightly (I added a little bit of water to the shampoo, like a teaspoon).</li>
            <li> Ive used F.A.S.T for about a little less than a month.</li>
            <li> But lets just say I ended up having to cut off half of my hair after using it just a few times.</li>
            <li> For me, using this duo everyday for a month and a half, did help aid in hair growth.</li>
            <li> you are a black woman, there is a few tricks that you need to know when using this product.</li>
            <li> Also your hair starts having a fuller look but every single hair will be coated with something thick or just repaired whatever the process it does..</li>
            <li> My hair was in such a bad condition when I used these, I couldn&#x27;t use them long enough to see a result.</li>
            <li> I have averaged about 7/8 an inch per month ( a little over 3/4 inch)</li>
            <li> Your color will fade a little.  </li>
            <li> and I was a little hesitant because of the price, but I have to say I will continue to buy it until I reach my length goal.</li>
            <li> Came out a little darker than I wanted, but still it&#x27;s fading to be the color that I wanted.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little cheaper</li>
            <li> and i think it probably was helping my hair grow a little</li>
            <li> I even got a little sample packet of shampoo/conditioner with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how it works, but my hair has been growing faster, and it&#x27;s a little thicker.  </li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s been a little over a month</li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> It made my hair grow three inches in a little over a month.</li>
            <li> itlooks like a little</li>
            <li> A little about my hair: I have medium textured, wavy, normal-thick hair.</li>
            <li> It does have a little funky smell but it&#x27;s duable.</li>
            <li> half black and black people don&#x27;t usually wash their hair everyday because our hair just can&#x27;t take it..</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, but wow was I proven wrong!</li>
            <li> my hair is almost down to my chest (my goal is the waist!)</li>
            <li> I had lost all of my hair about 2 years ago and it was beginning to grow back but very slowly.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about buying this product once I read all the negative reviews, but i really like it.</li>
            <li> I also have been having to clip my finger nails like crazy because they grow so fast.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, I&#x27;m embarrassed that I fell for this.</li>
            <li> and I have a few gray stragglers, so</li>
            <li> I began this product March 25th using almost everyday, it is April 5th</li>
            <li> SO, i chopped off all dead hairs every couple weeks (because i dye my hair SO</li>
            <li> its all my dead hairs from bleaching.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I think that when it comes to accelerated hair growth, it just has to happen to old fashion way-</li>
            <li> She was wanting to grow her hair out to cut all the dead ends off.</li>
            <li> She was very skeptical at first</li>
            <li> but sometimes I try to go without the heat for a few days just to give it a break.</li>
            <li> So, let me just begin by saying that if you want to use this for hair growth, don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> I have not found it to be drying, but, I do not use everyday.  </li>
            <li> I cut off all my dead ends</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a heavy user of heat styling, this probably isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and can feel a difference already.</li>
            <li> I have grown a few inches</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Also, I straighten and blowdry my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> and I almost don&#x27;t have to straighten my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I wore clip-in extensions from the beginning of 10th grade, until a few months before the end of my senior year in highschool.</li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> However, the shampoo and conditioner dried out my hair and it gave me ALOT of split ends..</li>
            <li> and my hair has already grown 3 inches by washing my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product three times - everyday for three days - and my roots have started showing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it as instructed: every day, shampoo, massage, rinse, repeat shampoo, massage, rinse, condition, leave in for a few minutes, rinse.</li>
            <li> It is dried out a bit</li>
            <li> It has dried my hair even with me adding on a spritz leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I washed and conditioned my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday up until the end of October.</li>
            <li> (please note that my hair is uneven all the way around</li>
            <li> I was washing my hair everyday doing this routine.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I noticed it was healthier and growing faster.</li>
            <li> However, the conditioner is so heavy that even a dab will make your hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> I found this product on here on amazon and within a few days of using it my daughter</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t recommend washing your hair everyday, not with this either (can be drying if you dont also condition it),</li>
            <li> I decided to chop off all the dead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend taking some vitamins or talking to your doctor if you have trouble with hair growth.</li>
            <li> I DID NOT use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Then I cut the dead ends off</li>
            <li> I even bleached twice in one month, so it was dead.</li>
            <li> would like to mention that I am also taking 10mg of biotin everyday.</li>
            <li> and my hair grew an inch and a half !</li>
            <li> the less you use heated products!</li>
            <li> It usually constitutes 10-20% of a typical cosmetic formulation.</li>
            <li> My hair grew about 2 inches in the month and a half of using it!</li>
            <li> My hair usually grows an inch and a half each time I use this.</li>
            <li> I did keep track of measuring my hair growth, and it did seem to grow slightly faster than usual.</li>
            <li> It used to grow less then .25 a month!</li>
            <li> Not good, it doesn&#x27;t made my hair grow faster and leave it really dry</li>
            <li> Not real sure about this shampoo and conditioner!??</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually a little weak, and it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> This is the cause of the skin irritations and drynessand other negative reactions associated with PG.          </li>
            <li> I understand that hair growth is slow but mine has been stunted for over two years due to lack of care.</li>
            <li> As soon as I wash the shampoo out of my hair, my hair was ridiculously stiff.</li>
            <li> DEA and any combinations of DEA, including the widely used Cocamide DEA has been found to pose a serious health risk to consumers.</li>
            <li> In the past month my hair has grown A LITTLE, but who&#x27;s to say it&#x27;s from the shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s working or not, but my hair seems to be growing a little faster.  </li>
            <li> First, the smell isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> this product makes my hair feel very soft and doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as other people say it does.</li>
            <li> My ends were dry and thin.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair so dry, thin, and lots of breakage.</li>
            <li> In about 3 months, my hair grew a little over 3 inches!</li>
            <li> I asked for a trim and in turn had three inches cut off and it was cut uneven!</li>
            <li> Hm well I shall update in a few months!    </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t so heavy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
            <li> I was initially skeptical about this product actually working as well as I have read it does.</li>
            <li> It usually remained shoulder length.</li>
            <li> My hair usually doesn&#x27;t have problems growing</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t noticed any hair growth that was faster than usual.</li>
            <li> If you want your hair to grow and am impatient like me, this product is a STEAL!</li>
            <li> As of yesterday, my hair had grown (in these past 6 months) about 5 inches.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is that this product works, but its not magic.  </li>
            <li> Excessive use or prolonged ex-posure may cause irritation to skin and urinary tract.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be expecting wait length hair in a few months!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> have heard this works for some people, I&#x27;m not sure why or why</li>
            <li> No more drug store shampoo for this</li>
            <li> I usually swift off the shower floor.</li>
            <li> Obviously the hot plates ruined my hair and introduced me to the horrible world of split ends.</li>
            <li> My hair grew at its usual 1/2&amp;#34; per month.</li>
            <li> its just an ordinary shampoo and coditioner and doesnt help the hair grow</li>
            <li> Not sure what to think now.</li>
            <li> i was soo sad and determined to grow it back.</li>
            <li> I can usually go about maximum 3 days without shampooing my hair before it gets greasy but it has no problem with shampooing every day with this product.</li>
            <li> I did notice that my hair was growing faster  after about a month, than usual</li>
            <li> It usually would grow about 3/4 of an inch a month</li>
            <li> but my friend and i have been using this product for the past two weeks</li>
            <li> plan on purchasing this product again because it does appear to be helping my hair grow faster than usual...</li>
            <li> think it´s too expensive to use it now, but if i ever need my hair to grow faster again, i will definitely purchase this shampoo &amp; conditioner again!</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t get it past that length.</li>
            <li> This product definitely works I have ordered it several times and never have I been disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> I bought this product not sure of how well it would work</li>
            <li> it is past my shoulder and continues to grow.  </li>
            <li> I am noticing it growing faster than usual.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed excessive loss, but if you use wussy shampoo/conditioner (just kidding), I could see being freaked at the amount of hair</li>
            <li> I use to have dirty blonde hair down to my belly button until the seventh grade.</li>
            <li> my hair did not grow any longer than usual, it smells bad, and left my hair feeling very dry and lifeless.</li>
            <li> it made it a lot healthier witch in the long wrong</li>
            <li> Maybe this product works but it&#x27;s hard to tell.</li>
            <li> This meant all of that hard work was cut away.</li>
            <li> I recommend this flr those who have a hard time with growing out their hair.</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s under 20 and stress is giving him a hard time with he&#x27;s hair....</li>
            <li> My hair tends to grow faster in the summer months, so it is hard to say if it&#x27;s the shampoo or the weather that is making my hair grow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to describe my hair texture as I am not a pro in figuring it out.</li>
            <li> It looked dull, peices of hair stuck up everywhere, and it looked so damaged.</li>
            <li> but I avoid hair dryers and give my hair a day to \\&quot;rest\\&quot; and regain natural oils so it isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> I measured my hair multiple times because I thought I was crazy</li>
            <li> today is Jaunary 23, and my hair has grown at least 3/4 of an inch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using both the shampoo and conditioner for about 2 1/2 months and my hair has grown at least 3 inches during that time.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was crazy, but I had my husband double measure it for me</li>
            <li> Drys out hair and doesnt help in the least to make it grow.</li>
            <li> -  Some reviewers have complained about their hair falling out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this stuff for 2-3 weeks and call me crazy</li>
            <li> Diethanolamine or DEA is a common ingredient in shampoos and in bath products.</li>
            <li> and my hair has grown at least 3 inches.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have read the negative reviews before trying this product.</li>
            <li> I swear it grew at least two inches in three weeks at least.</li>
            <li> and my hair has grown at least two inches.</li>
            <li> Like I could go almost a year without having to get a hair cut slow</li>
            <li> So yeah, my hair is slow.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers up really thick.</li>
            <li> Vietnamese with wavy thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair was always slow to grow and it has grown an inch in the 4 weeks I have been using the product.</li>
            <li> I had a very bad (short) haircut and now I can actually wear my hair up in a clip.</li>
            <li> I got the small bottle and used it tell it was gone and saw about an inch difference!</li>
            <li> and I mean &amp;#34;A LOT&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars but really not sure if it worked!</li>
            <li> I kid you not... try it and you will see what I mean...</li>
            <li> So I was desperate for long hair</li>
            <li> I only hate that you have to use it everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair out for over a year with no results; like seriously - almost NO growth no matter what I did.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about ordering this product.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product, I was a little wary of what it may do to my hair.</li>
            <li> I got a bad hair cut and ordered this to grow my hair back asap.</li>
            <li> I wanted to break away from all this bad hair habit, so I went and had my hair dyed back to a chestnut brown.</li>
            <li> I was planning to grow my hair out to get rid of a bad hair cut at the salon and to get a different style.</li>
            <li> Not too bad, but I&#x27;m wanting to go from really short hair to just about shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> SLS is not good for any hair type.</li>
            <li> but the itchy scalp is not a good sign in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I hated in so much I was will to do anything.</li>
            <li> it made my hair worse not better like i thought it would!</li>
            <li> After about three months of continuous use, my hair finally got out of that awkward should length stage!</li>
            <li> And it also grows really really slow!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to manage.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but base on the reviews I wanted to try it for myself, and plus it wasn&#x27;t that expensive at all.</li>
            <li> I have very slow growing hair as it is.</li>
            <li> Absolutely unbelievable!!</li>
            <li> Stupid me decided to comb my hair, BIG mistake!</li>
            <li> The lady was an idiot at short.</li>
            <li> My hair is looking thin and straggly and I find hairs on my desk at work...</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product but not completely.</li>
            <li> I started using the shampoo and conditioner approximately 3 years ago.  </li>
            <li> It is a caustic cleaner and corrodes hair follicles and impairs ability to grow hair.</li>
            <li> I Hate having short hair.  </li>
            <li> Thats when I became addicted to shopping online on Amazon.com and Ebay.com.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced the hair loss as others commented.</li>
            <li> I was so tired, and I still had to finish styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair was broken and damaged from bleaching it.</li>
            <li> False advertisement</li>
            <li> But I put ALOT of effort washing my hair every day and a ton of false hope into this product.</li>
            <li> It seemed like the people who were of other origin got bad result</li>
            <li> this woke it up and told it to start growing, seriously!  </li>
            <li> I have noticed I am cutting my bangs a lot now because they keep going past my eyebrows</li>
            <li> from previous reviews, I was expecting it to be bad.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic results like some of the reviews talked about.</li>
            <li> started shedding insane amounts of hair at a very young age</li>
            <li> After using this for about a week it dried my hair out so bad every time I used it.  </li>
            <li> After getting a short hairstyle and really hated it, I decided to give this product a try.  </li>
            <li> In 2003, I donated my hair and hated it short.</li>
            <li> I wanted all the benefits that were mentioned but then there were just some nasty reviews that nearly scared me away.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it 4 stars was because, it made my hair texture feel weird.</li>
            <li> NOT condition your hair, it makes your hair feel brittle and weird.</li>
            <li> When I started using it on August 1st, I had about 3/4 inch of hair if I put it behind my ear, and now it is mid-September and my hair has grown out to about an inch below my chin!</li>
            <li> Beyond angry - Yes, I&#x27;ll contuine using the rest of the shampoon/conditioner that I already bought, but will I contuine buying from this company?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just trying to give you guys an idea of how difficult my hair is.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately yesterday I saw a scissor-happy stylist who chopped off three inches.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wordy review, I know, but I have been obsessed with growing my hair out.  </li>
            <li> It works really well and has saved me an awful lot of stress from bad haircuts.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again nor do I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Even then,&lt;br /&gt;its questionable.  </li>
            <li> ) ill be updating in a month or 2 to see the progress.</li>
            <li> I hate that I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> just wish it hadn&#x27;t been so expensive.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was in tears and immediately began my search for a miracle cure.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will use again probably in between the expensive Surface awaken reorders.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terribly unruly and I have to flat iron it to control it....</li>
            <li> This product mad my hair knotty and thin.</li>
            <li> i saw reviews that it makes the hair nasty feeling and dry?</li>
            <li> I was desperate and eager to get extensions, but those can be uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad and mad about it all.</li>
            <li> : Make it shed like crazy.</li>
            <li> so when she was done cutting my hair</li>
            <li> So whenever I saw a bunch of hair in the drain, I knew my hair was about to grow crazy</li>
            <li> Now that I have researched and read, the ingrediants in this product are dangerous.  </li>
            <li> So desperate</li>
            <li> Being desperate for rapid growth and a eternal optimist</li>
            <li> think it smells like a science lab or something crazy</li>
            <li> So I was afraid that by the time I made it to forty</li>
            <li> If you are skeptical, just take a chance and go for it!</li>
            <li> i think this is a fake hair product!</li>
            <li> I ordered the shampoo skeptical but hopeful and very desperate.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to accelerate my hair growth after a disastrous trip to the hair salon</li>

            <li> it looked so bad.</li>

            <li> I ordered this product to give it a try, even there&#x27;s a lot of bad reviews on the website.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care because I know some people will exaggerate on the bad reviews.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product left my scalp very dry. I did not notice any positive difference after two bottles of use.</li>
            <li> I just got this product. I&#x27;ve only wash my hair once. So I see no results yet but I&#x27;m hoping to see some eventually</li>
            <li> I just received this product today and have already washed my hair. The shampoo and conditioner smell pleasant, very clean, and fresh. My hair does not feel dry at all. I will definitely be back on here reviewing! I bought the liter sizes.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner for my 18 year old daughter as she swore it was supposed to make hair grow. I didn&#x27;t want to argue with her, so I bought it. She seemed to like it, though I don&#x27;t believe that external products will make hair grow. LOL.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about buying this product once I read all the negative reviews, but i really like it. I&#x27;ve been using it for four months. At first my hair seemed a little straw like but once I started leaving the conditioner in for 5 minutes my hair came out soft and fluffy once I blow dryed it. Occasionally my scalp was itchy but I just assume it&#x27;s the hair follicles growing. It doesn&#x27;t have the best smell but I don&#x27;t mind it. My hair feels clean after I use it. My hair grew about an inch or so each month which was amazing considering my hair grows an inch every four to six months. The shipping came relatively fast! Over all it is a good product, my hair didn&#x27;t fall out ( i have color processed hair), my hair felt bouncy and soft, it showed results and this product works. I recommend this product be bought.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the super fast shipping! I&#x27;m a first time user and will continue to use both the shampoo and conditioner!  So far so good.  I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference! Normally I have oily hair and it&#x27;s completely transformed my hair!  I&#x27;ve already seen hair growth in 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> Nisim worked for me, though the results weren&#x27;t as strong as i&#x27;d hoped for I did notice about an extra 2-3 cm a month when I was using it (my hair grows really slowly, on average hair grows 1/2 inch a month but mine will  grow 1/8) though I agree with most reviewers it does dry out your scalp. I combatted this by diluting the product slightly (I added a little bit of water to the shampoo, like a teaspoon). it also has a really strong scent but If you want your hair to grow who cares??? it really feels good on your scalp though and I really noticed a change even though I used it only twice a week :) extra hair growth with good scalp sensation? worth it.</li>
            <li> I started using this almost two weeks ago. I don&#x27;t know if its in my head or what, but this stuff really works. My roots are growing like crazy!!! I actual like the smell, it smells clean after. Yes it does dry my hair out a little, but its nothing conditioner can&#x27;t fix. It leaves my hair very shiny, full and bouncy even if my hair wasn&#x27;t growing I would use this product.</li>
            <li> I had cut my hair very, very short and I hated it. I ordered this product not really expecting much, but I was greatly surprized! My hair has grown out very quickly. So happy!</li>
            <li> I am a surfer, skater, snow boarder, etc. If you have evr met anybody who partakes in these sort of sports then you know we usually have kind of long hair. Well I keep mine at around three or four inches and recently got a hair cut. The lady was an idiot at short. She \\&quot;accidentally\\&quot; cut a chunk of hair out of my head resulting in me having to shave it last night. I have heard amazing things about this product and I also ordered a pill supplement to help with the growth. I think its call Niaxin. I don&#x27;t advise women to use this product as I have read tons of reviews and they all spoke of unwanted body hair. I really hope this product works. I look like Mr. Clean hahaha. I will be updating this post exactly one month from now to give my input and possibly change the rating. December 16th 2010. Oh and I won&#x27;t start using the product until December 18th 2010. I&#x27;ll update January 18th, 2011. HAPPY NEW YEARS!!!</li>
            <li> Not only did this combo not do anything to increase my rate of hair growth, but even as just a regular shampoo and conditioner, I didn&#x27;t like how they made my hair feel or smell.  After using these products, my hair felt waxy, and the stuff smelled like Nair (how ironic).  Don&#x27;t waste your money, I&#x27;m embarrassed that I fell for this.</li>
            <li> used the shampoo and conditioner for about a month.  made hair grow, but made it thinner,break easily, and fall out like crazy.  i dye my hair blonde and after using it one day i ran my hand through my hair and squeezed out water and the water was yellow.</li>
            <li> When I got this i needed to color my roots cuz I&#x27;m 36 and I have a few gray stragglers, so I thought that a good way to keep track of how much hair was growing in a month using the shampoo and cond combo would be to measure the new gray hair growth. Well i can tell you that after two weeks of grow out my gray hair was measuring a half an inch. I had only been using it for a month and someone that I hadn&#x27;t seen in about a month asked me if I had gotten hair extentions :) that made my day!.........Update K so now its been 2 and 1/2 months since i have been using nisim&#x27;s FAST about 3-4 times per week, and yes it does make your hair grow I have averaged about 7/8 an inch per month ( a little over 3/4 inch) I also really think that my hormones had somthing to do with the way it grew because the weeks that I was PMSing it grew faster than the other two weeks of the month. About 7 people have asked if I got hair extentions which is really great :).....but I think that using this product over a long period of time really has dried my hair out and it is starting to feel like straw a little bit, and I have noticed little pieces keep breaking off my ends, so I guess there really is no miricle here because what good does it do if it&#x27;s growing in at the roots but breaking off at the ends!?!?</li>
            <li> Title says it all, but to explain it breifly; its cheap shampoo that was put in a bottle that claims to help you grow or keep hair that you have. I have tryed other products that have simaler claims that retail for more, its worth the extra expence because this stuff will dry your scalp, give you dangruff , make you pull your hair out! arnt they saposed to text this stuff on animals first!</li>
            <li> This stuff definitely works.  You definitely will NOT LOSE ANY HAIR TO IT  and it makes your hair incredibly soft because it&#x27;s an AMINO TREATMENT.</li>
            <li> ive been using the shampoo for over a month now and it made such a difference with my hair. however i began taking biotin pills at the same time so i dont want to say it is completely from the shampoo but i think it definitely has helped! my hair is already extremely fine and straight so sometimes it even feels a little to soft! but i am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I recently went to my salon to get a trim, I told my hair dresser to cut off 2 inches.... I guess for some reason she felt the need to cut off 5. I was desperate and eager to get extensions, but those can be uncomfortable. I decided to give this nisim fast a try, not only does it make my hair soft but my hair grew 1/2 inch in only 2.5 weeks. I measured my hair multiple times because I thought I was crazy but it worked. I also take fish oil pills, so I imagine that this has helped. I also have been having to clip my finger nails like crazy because they grow so fast. even when my hair is back to my desired length, I will continue to order nisim fast because of how healthy my hair is.</li>
            <li> Sigh. Unfortunately, in the midst of DYING to find a way to get my hair to grow longer faster, I found this product and ignored all of the bad reviews and stuck to the good ones. Now I find myself writing my own negative review.  My main issue with this product is that it made me LOSE more hair than grow hair. I don&#x27;t really shed all that much--NEVER in the shower--and from the first use, I was picking out tons of hair from the drain every time I showered. I tried to ignore it because, after the first wash, my hair felt SO GOOD. I wanted to touch it constantly! I couldn&#x27;t believe it felt this good and I ignored the hair, figuring it was just because it hadn&#x27;t been brushed or something, but it has happened consistently. I washed it tonight and got so freaked out by the amount of hair I lost in the shower that I immediately submitted a return request to the person I purchased it from. I just did not want ANY more unnecessary hair loss. I have naturally thick, healthy hair and I do not want that compromised. Not only this, but my hair felt drier and duller than ever after the 2nd wash. I was really fooled...but now I&#x27;m just going to stick to taking my vitamins.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I recieved this product on January 7th, started using it the same day. today is Jaunary 23, and my hair has grown at least 3/4 of an inch. im gunna say about an inch a month, thats my goal by january 28-30 th ! ((:  definately work though, im probably going to be buying another bottle soon. and i keep updating!  i saw reviews that it makes the hair nasty feeling and dry? heck no, not at all. its soft and smooth and shiny and looks very healthy! im so glad. (:</li>
            <li> I had shoulder-length non-color-treated hair at the end of March. At the end of April, my hair had grown an inch and a half. I used the shampoo and conditioner every day and the bottles lasted me about two months. I was skeptical at first, but it was hard to deny that this actually worked, since I could see it right before my eyes. Every night, I would shower and shampoo like normal, but making sure to massage the product more carefully into my scalp. Same with the conditioner. I massaged it into my scalp, left it on for about 3 minutes, used a wide-tooth comb to evenly distribute the product, and then rinsed it out. However, I bought this product for a friend who had colored hair (natural brunette, gone purple) who said that this really stripped the purple out of her hair. So I would NOT recommend this for people with color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> I waited two months before writing this review because I wanted it to be accurate!  The first month I noticed about an inch of growth, the second month was also close to an inch. Taking biotin supplements with this will help, and you can get them cheap over-the-counter.  When you first use the shampoo, it will make your hair feel knotted and gross in the shower. It is only when you apply the conditioner and let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing that it&#x27;ll feel luscious. However, you will most likely lose more strands of hair in the shower for a week or two until your hair adjusts to the formula.  This formula dries out your hair/scalp and may cause itching. I ended up buying a deep conditioning treatment that I left on for an hour once or twice a week to cope with the static. What I don&#x27;t understand is how a shampoo that is supposed to make your hair come in healthier, stronger, and faster accomplishes this buy wiping out all the natural oils and nutrients when you use it. I guess it&#x27;ll never make sense to me, but I definitely think it also helps to either wash your hair every other day or alternate your shampoo and conditioner with this product so that you are not doing this treatment daily like the bottle says. Switching up your stuff anyways helps refresh and restore your hair!  Overall, I do think I would recommend this product. It seems to have worked since it grew about two inches in two months, but then again I haven&#x27;t trimmed my hair since I started using it!</li>
            <li> I am very blonde and I felt like there was a lot of build up of other conditioners on my hair. I could see a huge difference in my hair after one use.  My hair is back to the natural color looks much healthier and I havent measured but looks 1 inch longer after about one month of use.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> Transaction went great. Had no problems.</li>
            <li> So let me start off by saying, I am a female and I shaved my head back in July this year! I did this becuz I had a hair cut and color I didn&#x27;t like at all. Plus my mom is losing her hair with her battle with cancer. So I decided to shave my head and just let it grow out natural. I started using fast shampoo and conditioner in July and for the first time \\&quot;what lil hair I had left\\&quot; felt clean. (my hair was like 1/8 of an inch long lol) But I measured my hair every week.. and if you can believe it or not my hair is 3 inches long already! yay!!! I&#x27;m so excited about this shampoo and conditioner that I&#x27;ve told everyone I know about it! I would have rated it 5 stars but in this last month I seem to have alil dandruff (which I never had before) My hair has always been really oily.. like have to wash my hair twice a day oily. And it also grows really really slow! Like I could go almost a year without having to get a hair cut slow haha! Anyways if you&#x27;re looking for a shampoo to help with hair growth this is a good one, but keep in mind what works for one person may not work for another! Thanks :)</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and in good condition. Will have to wait and see whether or not the product really works.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Product works.  A little challenging when one has color on their hair.  Your color will fade a little.  But this product is Great overall.  I would recommend it! Hair growth excellent.  It is important t use both the Shampoo and Conditioner together for best results.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about ordering this product. I moved a few months ago and in turn lost the stylist who was the only person to I trusted to cut my hair for the past 5 years. I went to have my hair cut by a new stylist and she completely wrecked my hair - I asked for a trim and in turn had three inches cut off and it was cut uneven! So I found another reputable stylist who fixed the cut although my hair was left even shorter. I began using the shampoo and conditioner and my hair grew back an inch in a month. It typically grows about a 1/2 inch in a month. I had my hair cut a week ago by the same stylist who fixed my hair and she could not belive how much my hair had grown since she saw me last! I just ordered the shampoo and conditioner for the second time and am looking forward to seeing my hair continue to grow back!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! My hair really did grow a lot faster and healthier. The only thing i have to say is the smell of it isn&#x27;t great, but i am buying this product again!!</li>
            <li> After just one use of this stuff, my hair was super silky &amp; soft. It has grown about 3 inches in 2 months! I LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as to whether this product would really work.  How many times have you bought something only to find out it was a complete waste of money?  Well not with this product!  I&#x27;ve been using both the shampoo and conditioner for about 2 1/2 months and my hair has grown at least 3 inches during that time.  No joke.  I&#x27;m buying another set to keep it growing!  I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who wants their hair to grow fast!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking, thinking there was a product that would make your hair grow faster.  I don&#x27;t know if you have to use a product like this for a certain amount of time before noticing a result but I used for 2 months and noticed nothing.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me and my hair grows slower then most, but I was looking forward to this product but i didn&#x27;t get the results.  ) :</li>
            <li> I like this product, it makes my hair look so healthy and soft and shiny. The only downfall is that i&#x27;m losing alot of hair and i havent seen any growth and ive beeing using it for about a month.</li>
            <li> I first used this product about four years ago and it worked so well! After about three months of continuous use, my hair finally got out of that awkward should length stage! I had one of the old bottles stored away and just rediscovered it, It was expired so I ordered another supply last week. I absolutely loved this product years ago and I am hoping to get the same beautiful results as I did then! Comparing the new with the old, the only difference is the old products had emulsifying wax as an ingredient, I wonder why they excluded this from the current product?It also wasn&#x27;t labeled by \\&quot;Nisim\\&quot; Hm well I shall update in a few months!    Update:   I began this product March 25th using almost everyday, it is April 5th and my hair has grown 3/4\\&quot;! I thought I was crazy, but I had my husband double measure it for me and it really did! I should add that i began taking Biotin that same week as well. But not only have I noticed definite growing, but my hair is dramatically smoother. I&#x27;ve stopped straightening it since this product is recommended to use everyday, and I am actually comfortable wearing my hair curly now!</li>
            <li> I think my hair is growing so it is doing what it suppose to do- grow my hair.  However, I only gave four stars because I think I am loosing my hair more.  Every time I take a shower, I noticed my hair falling out way more than it used to be..  So I am gussing this shampoo might have done this...</li>
            <li> After getting a short hairstyle and really hated it, I decided to give this product a try.  I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner since February, and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results.  I have very fine hair that grows very very slow, but since I started using this product it has growth at least 3 inches.  I definitely recommend this product if you need a growth boost, but don&#x27;t expect results within a week and please don&#x27;t give up after a week, as it may take 2 months to actually see the results.  This shampoo is definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> So I received the F.A.S.T shampoo/conditioner set on March 28th and it lasted me a month. I am pretty heavy handed so I was pretty amazed that it lasted exactly a month (could have even done a day or two more). My hair grew half an inch in one month but I can not say this product gave me that growth because my hair always grow half an inch on it&#x27;s own...so nothing new. I did notice that it made my hair manageable because my hair was pretty rough. After using this product my hair was easy to comb. I gave it 3 stars because even though it didn&#x27;t make my hair grow, it did make it softer. I did not realize that I had to wash my hair with this product every day (recommended) so that was a bummer, but I followed through and washed my hair everyday (not skipping a day) and massaged it into my scalp daily. Overall, no new growth but softer hair. I&#x27;m happy either way but will not purchase again. I would recommend this to those who want softer hair. What works for one doesn&#x27;t work for all.</li>
            <li> Ive used F.A.S.T for about a little less than a month. I followed the directions exactly; shampooing twice, hot water, etc. I felt like my hair was growing faster, but was sure I was making it up until my boyfriends daughter (age 4) said it had. And my boyfriend agreed you could tell.   The reason I gave it 4 stars was because, it made my hair texture feel weird. It was shiney and soft, but made it have a wierd texture.  Overall I would suggest it, but I took hair and nail vitamens with it.  Also I would suggest that you use a treatment with it.</li>
            <li> It really works!  Takes time but after 4 weeks, you can tell the hair has grown fast.</li>
            <li> I love dying my hair, and decided to start bleaching it for colors.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was badly damaged! SO, i chopped off all dead hairs every couple weeks (because i dye my hair SO often)&lt;br /&gt;And i wear extentions, because i really wish i had long hair. I came across this product, and have been using it for about..2 or 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Have seen slight results.&lt;br /&gt;Makes you excited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The smell is kinda funky, like old women perfume BUT doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;Does NOT condition your hair, it makes your hair feel brittle and weird. (so i suggest using a spray leave in conditioner, like miricle 7!&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;-)&lt;br /&gt;It sorta, makes alot of my hair fall out? But i&#x27;m pretty sure its all my dead hairs from bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, in the end i&#x27;m still satisfied and will continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I was my hair every other day&lt;br /&gt;- I blow dry my hair&lt;br /&gt;- I use leave in conditioners&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;Have they changed whats in the shampoo and conditioner?!&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t so heavy! and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel gross anymore?!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEW UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I have decided to stop using this product.. my hair thinned ALOT using this. it made it grow faster and longer, but my hair isnt fuller or healthy.. so i will be trying mane n tail!</li>
            <li> I really liked this product it really helped my hair to look healthy and grow about a 1\\&quot; but it looks great and I dye my hair and I had no problem with that the color did not fade. Try it and I think you will be happy you did !!</li>
            <li> Drys out hair and doesnt help in the least to make it grow. Smells bad too. Dont waste your money on this product. Try One n&#x27; only cleansing conditioner instead. Its like Wen, but cheaper. As in like, $12.</li>
            <li> So I started using this when I bleached my hair blonde and fried it all to hell &amp; had to get it chopped all off . In two months my roots were 2 1/2 inches long . I went and got my roots touched up, and haven&#x27;t been using it ...my roots are just now starting to show and I got them touched up in the beginning of november. I&#x27;m convinced ! Time to order some more !</li>
            <li> I been using this stuff for about a week and it&#x27;s great. My hair was a little above my ear now its past my ear it also stops breakage i like it. my hair has also got thicker and softer so use it great for black people.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is amazing because my hair is so much manageable after i use it. The shampoo is not hard on your hair and the conditioner makes your hair feel soo soft. I tried many conditioners but they were never as good as this one. . as for growth: i&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks and my boyfriend asked me one day \\&quot;is your hair getting longer???\\&quot; it really did look long that day. . i dont know if its from the shampoo or if its from how i styled it that day. however, my hair does seem longer so i will continue to use this product. im also taking vitamin pills. all this is really worth the money. good hair makes you feel good.</li>
            <li> After getting my chest-length hair chopped off all the way to my chin, I pretty much immediately regretted it and was desperately looking for ways to speed up my hair growth. I don&#x27;t even know how I stumbled upon this shampoo &amp; conditioner, but I&#x27;m so glad I did! I used FAST shampoo &amp; conditioner according to the directions on the package, every single day give or take maybe two or three days. It lasted me about a month and I noticed results after about two weeks. When I started using it on August 1st, I had about 3/4 inch of hair if I put it behind my ear, and now it is mid-September and my hair has grown out to about an inch below my chin! I took multi-vitamins and a biotin supplement while using this shampoo &amp; conditioner. I also flat ironed it every once in a while. I think the effectiveness of this product depends on the texture of your hair. I have very thick,coarse,kind of poofy hair that already grows kind of fast. I highly recommend this product if you have similar hair as me, and I&#x27;m considering buying this set again! I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive:\</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a month that I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner and I think I&#x27;ve seen some growth in my hair. However, the very first thing I noticed the first time I used it was that my hair started falling out more. I&#x27;m not sure why. I used Pantene Pro V before this product and my hair wouldn&#x27;t fall out as much. Now, I&#x27;m constantly gathering fallen strands of hair in the shower. I doubt I&#x27;ll be ordering more of this product after it&#x27;s finished. The hair growth is nice, but not for the price of my hair falling out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately a month in conjunction with a vitamin for hair growth and it really works. I had a very bad (short) haircut and now I can actually wear my hair up in a clip.</li>
            <li> I am not claiming that this product did not work or does not work for some, but after two months of consistent use (I did not use any other hair shampoos or conditioners) I did not see any change in my hair growth that I would attribute to this product. Unfortunately I think that when it comes to accelerated hair growth, it just has to happen to old fashion way- a lot of time and maybe some vitamins.  If you choose to use this product any way, the smell is somewhat pleasant  but it may leave your hair a bit dry at times.</li>
            <li> I never review products- in fact this might by the first time I&#x27;ve done it. Usually I don&#x27;t care enough to do so. I have to write a review for this one because it actually does work and I love it! My hair grew significantly faster and looked heathly while using it. I didn&#x27;t love the smell, but it wasn&#x27;t noticable once hair was dried. I seriously could not belive how fast my hair grew! This is like a miracle elixer.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this because so many reviews were giving it 5 stars. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t read most of the reviews and little was actually said about hair growth. People were giving it 5 stars based on the fact their hair was so much silkier, and healthy. This product markets the fact that it makes your hair grow, and so I am basing my review on that claim with 1 star, because it does not.     Almost any new shampoo/conditioner you buy is going to make your hair feel good, (unless it&#x27;s really cheap stuff )because it always happens when you switch products. Also a clarifying shampoo will do this as well, removing residue from the last product.</li>
            <li> Because of a very stressful event in my life and in turn not eating properly, my hair began to fall out and break off. My hair has always been long and I had to cut much of it off it looked so bad. It was so brittle and lifeless that I couldn&#x27;t even really run my fingers through it. When I first used this product I could not believe how soft my hair was. It was not only soft but seemed to have alot more body. It is hard to say how much it has grown in the few weeks I have used it but judging from my bangs it does seems to be growing and thicker. My husband keeps complimenting me on how soft it is. I believe the shampoo is worth it just for how it makes my hair feel. I am hoping to see more growth as an added bonus :)</li>
            <li> I was initially skeptical about this product actually working as well as I have read it does. I got a perm two years ago and it left my hair VERY damaged and dry and nothing I did, from deep conditioners and repairing shampoos and conditioners, nothing seemed to work. Eventually, I decided to give FAST a shot and I LOVE IT. It makes my hair so soft, so shiny and healthy looking, and extremely beautiful. I have never come across a product that I love this much. I am NOT an employee of Nisim, just a very satisfied customer. The only complaint I have is that the shampoo leaves your hair a little bit dry feeling at first, so the conditioner is a must-have. But it smells nice (just a very clean smell) and it works great. I kid you not, I get compliments EVERY day now on how pretty my hair is and how soft it is. BUT IT!</li>
            <li> In 2003, I donated my hair and hated it short. I found this product, bought it, and fell in love. In about 3 months, my hair grew a little over 3 inches! Incredible!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about to donate my hair again and am about to purchase it again. My hair won&#x27;t be short for long. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. Not only does my hair grow about twice as fast, it has made my hair thicker, healthier, and much fuller. Nice to find a product that actually does what it claims. It works!!!</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re okay with losing your hair, DON&#x27;T buy this product! How ironic...this shampoo is marketed to speed up hair GROWTH but I&#x27;ve only noticed hair LOSS since using it. I used the shampoo and conditioner almost daily for about a month. At first, I noticed that my hair was getting dry from using it but it wasn&#x27;t so much so that I was uncomfortable with it. However, by the end of the month my hair was dry and brittle with not anything to speak of in the way of accelerated growth so I stopped using it. It&#x27;s been 2 MONTHS since I&#x27;ve used this product and during that time my hair has become extremely dry (like straw) and is THINNING and FALLING OUT!! I&#x27;ve always had thick, full hair and now my hairline is receding along the corners on each side of my forehead and temples and my hair in general is THINNING. My hair is looking thin and straggly and I find hairs on my desk at work...full length hairs with the follicle attached (STILL...2 MONTHS after I stopped using it.) WTH is this stuff?? Battery acid?? I gave it 1 star only because its necessary to give a star rating to post a review.</li>
            <li> What a ripoff! I bought 4 things of this shampoon/conditioner and have used it for over a month and have noticied not a single difference in length in my hair! I&#x27;m going to the hairdresser in a few days to get my hair cut evenly then leaving it alone for good to let nature do its&#x27; thing and in a few years I&#x27;ll have long, lucious hair like I used to have. Everyone, dont be fooled by this product. It does absoultly N.O.T.H.I.N.G to help your hair growth! Beyond angry - Yes, I&#x27;ll contuine using the rest of the shampoon/conditioner that I already bought, but will I contuine buying from this company? No. Never again!</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes to obtain rapid growth, after learning about it through various beauty products sites. So far it has given me results that I would say surpass my own natural process of hair growth, with diligent care (including supplements, hair trims, reducing heat to my hair). The smell is clean and not overpowering. Overall, \\&quot;Not Bad\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly. Arrived in less than a week. Nicely packaged, very neat &amp; simple. I suggest purchasing the larger bottles, as this product requires everyday usage. 4.99999/5.0 stars.</li>
            <li> Both Shampoo and Conditioner did the unthinkable to my hair: Make it shed like crazy. When I had my hair under the shower I felt something big sliding through my back (I thought it was a ghost trying to touch my back) and realized that it was hair. Stupid me decided to comb my hair, BIG mistake! It felt crunchy and my hair was breaking and a ball of hair (the size of a baseball) was left in my bath tub.My scalp felt like it went through a big process, like hair dye (it felt like burning)and it&#x27;s supposed to be a regular shampoo and conditioner! I had to use lots of oils and deep conditioner but still feels crunchy (WTH is in this product??).I would be cautious if I was a new client.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a local salon and the stylists insisted it would work. In the past month my hair has grown A LITTLE, but who&#x27;s to say it&#x27;s from the shampoo or conditioner. Plus I&#x27;ve never really had stubborn hair to begin with. I think it smells great, and although the shampoo knots my hair up, the conditioner is AWESOME!!! My hair didn&#x27;t fall out or dry, but it does rip chemical hair color right out. So I guess if you have a bad home dye job this is a good set.</li>
            <li> Love this system you get good results</li>
            <li> Excellent product I have noticed a difference in my hair since I started using it. I have noticed hair growth and it looks really healthy.</li>
            <li> This is my first Amazon purchased. I first was thinking about getting hair extensions but didn&#x27;t want to spend all that mula and it will not be permanent so I thought about browsing online and was recommended amazon and this product. I was skeptical at first but base on the reviews I wanted to try it for myself, and plus it wasn&#x27;t that expensive at all. In about a week, i got my products, earlier than expected, that&#x27;s always good. It&#x27;s been about couple of days that i have been using this shampoo and conditioner and already seeing really good results. My hair is so much easier to style and i noticed that it&#x27;s more shinier and more manageable and it&#x27;s so much softer now. amazing results so far. Im very impressed! :) I will update review in about couple of weeks but so far so good. :) Thank you!</li>
            <li> Have been using Fast shampoo and conditioner for about one month now and have noticed hair growth and thickening that I am very happy with! I had lost all of my hair about 2 years ago and it was beginning to grow back but very slowly. It was at this point that I began using FAST shampoo and conditioner and am very happy with the results! Would recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li> my whir is really short and air made it grow a lot it was worth the harmless side effects i love this product.</li>
            <li> As a young girl I had always had long hair, my mom made sure of it. I use to have dirty blonde hair down to my belly button until the seventh grade. I was bullied and told how &#x27;ugly&#x27; my hair was so I cut it short and died it dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently 18 almost 19 and my hair struggled growing back. It usually remained shoulder length. My senior year I got extensions, but those seemed to damage my hair more than it was worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved my product May 5, 2012. It is now May 16th, 2012 my hair seems healthier and has grown 1/2 an inch almost an inch. I am very satisfied with this product. I also deep condition after I use a heat styling tool which isn&#x27;t very often.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s working or not, but my hair seems to be growing a little faster.  Time will tell!</li>
            <li> Save your self and YOUR MONEY!! Any shampoo that list SLS in its ingredients is BAD. Any shampoo that includes SLS will KILL your hair!! Please, do not USE this product!! This product will break and damage your hair with continued use. SLS is not good for any hair type. Say NO to SLS!</li>
            <li> I saw no results except for my hair being straw like and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> My hair was permed for the first time, they left the chemicals on for 2 hours!!! i never had a perm before so i didnt know this was bad!! and about 1 to 1 1/2 inches feel off when i washed it and the rest kept breaking off. i had to get all my hair cut off until i have about 5 inches of hair left. i started with about 20 so i was hurt! i needed hair again! i used this product and with in a month it grew 1 inch, ive bought it 4 times now and i will never go with out it!! it made my dry brittle hair, soft again plus it smells so good :) i will use this product even when i get all my long hair back because its a decent price and everything is true about it!</li>
            <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve been using this, I&#x27;ve had significantly less breakage, my hair&#x27;s been so much softer, and shinier and I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of compliments about the length and healthiness of my hair.    I have relaxed, afro/carribbean, dry, super thick hair and my hair really looks awesome now. Even my mom&#x27;s been using it and her hair is gorgeous and dark. She&#x27;s really happy with it because she had been expressing some concerns about the fineness of her hair and that it was thinning.. but not anymore    But you guys should know that this is not some super magical product. You should be very proactive about the other products that you use in your hair (read the ingredients, actually know what they are), find out what works in your hair, experiment with different type of hair oils, find out what your roots are craving as well as your ends, find a really good thirst quenching leave-in conditioner if you&#x27;re prone to dry hair, let your hair air-dry as much as possible... there are many variables involved in having a really beautiful healthy head of hair</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner for my girlfriend. She was wanting to grow her hair out to cut all the dead ends off. She was very skeptical at first but she decided to take the risk. We measure on day one of using the shampoo and conditioner(which was 15inch) a month later we measured again(15.5) and two months later(16.5-17inches). At first she used the shampoo AND conditioner every single day for the first month and then during the second month used it every other day. She complained at first that the first month she noticed that her scalp would be dry and itchy but the second month it wasn&#x27;t a problem. Although she said it was well worth it! If you want to help your hair grow this is the shampoo to get!</li>
            <li> F.A.S.T is just fabulous! :) I don&#x27;t use it daily, as it says in the directions, but it still works extremely well and my hair has grown 75% faster as usual.</li>
            <li> Dries hair out. Don&#x27;t use. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the product. But lets just say I ended up having to cut off half of my hair after using it just a few times. Please don&#x27;t use this producth my hair today again just because it&#x27;s so dry. But this isn&#x27;t uncommon I usually have to wash my hair because it gets dry. Also, take note I&#x27;m mixed (black and white). My hair is one of the most difficult hair types imaginable. The diameter of my strands of hair are unbelievably thick, people say I have asian-like coarse hair (which is all about the diameter), but my hair isn&#x27;t strong like asian hair it&#x27;s actually a little weak, and it&#x27;s dry and it&#x27;s abundant thanks to my black side. Only the very best hair stylists in Chicago can even do my hair and most of them have like 30 yrs of experience and owns salons themselves. I&#x27;m just trying to give you guys an idea of how difficult my hair is. I will say this I notice a difference i the manageability of my hair but I also notice slight dryness. I also notice a difference in the way the roots of my hair are laying on my scalp. Something is definitely changing I can&#x27;t put my finger on it. But this is coming from someone who pays very close attention to her hair. I&#x27;m going to continue. But if the dryness gets excessive I&#x27;m going to have to lay off of it and return if I deem it to be fit to returning too. This may be a shampoo I can only use once or twice a week. We shall see. There&#x27;s an added complexity to this decision because I&#x27;m half black and black people don&#x27;t usually wash their hair everyday because our hair just can&#x27;t take it..it will break off for most of us. I have more black ppl hair than I have mixed girl or white people hair. It is not fine, its super thick, and while it&#x27;s not nappy it&#x27;s definitely not straight or a manageable curly. It&#x27;s a frizzy hot mess. I get my hair done every week but sometimes I try to go without the heat for a few days just to give it a break. We&#x27;ll see how this goes. I&#x27;ll keep you guys posted in terms of hair growth. My hair usually doesn&#x27;t have problems growing it grows about a 1/2 inch per month. I&#x27;m expecting an inch. I must also say I&#x27;m taking various vitamins. 2000 mg of MSM/day,6000mg biotin/day, &amp; phytophanere. These things are known to assist in hair growth. If I don&#x27;t get 1 inch in the next 4 weeks it cannot possibly be possible to grow hair faster than normal. However, I must say the phytophanere has completely eradicated my dry scalp which has previously been categorized as seborrhic dermatitis which is a problem I&#x27;ve had for years, I think that&#x27;s because of the oils in it. Phyto is kind of expensive but I like what it&#x27;s done. I just started the biotin &amp; MSM which are thought to both work together for hair growth in an exceptional way. We shall see. No matter my skin is amazing thanks to these products and I have seen about a half of centimeter of growth in the last 5 days</li>
            <li> I have used the shampoo and conditioner for about 1 week and find it to be incredibly conditioning.  My hair has a lot of body and shine. . .I have fine hair and was afraid that it would be left flat but that is not the case at all.  I will update you on whether My hair has grown faster on not after I give it enough time.</li>
            <li> So, let me just begin by saying that if you want to use this for hair growth, don&#x27;t waste your time. I have been using this product for about 4 months now and I haven&#x27;t noticed any hair growth that was faster than usual. I was disappointed with this product but not completely. I will say that unlike some of the other reviews where people said the product dried out their hair it did the complete opposite for me. In fact, my hair felt so silky smooth after I used it. I also think the over all health of my hair improved a little, but there wasn&#x27;t a huge difference. So it is great for washing your hair but I could spend 5 dollars on a cheaper product and see the same result.  In conclusion, the product didn&#x27;t really work for me. So I guess I will keep doing cardio and taking biotin for somewhat faster hair growth.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell but I did notice the damage was les breaking.  Don&#x27;t think it grew any faster but the smell is a different smell.  Remind me of Grandma lotion</li>
            <li> My hair does NOT grow. I died my hair in the beginning of summer(june) black (naturally brown) and when early August came, My roots still hadn&#x27;t grown in, by the time the beginning of september came, it still hadn&#x27;t grown in! My hair also only grew 3 inches in 4 years. So yeah, my hair is slow. But I ordered this stuff on September 3rd, and I got it in September 6th. I started using and it&#x27;s been about a month and my hair grew an inch and a half ! That&#x27;s more than it grows in a year! My hair got cut REALLY short in 7th grade for locks of love, and now a sophomore in high school, it was shoulder length, but thanks to this AMAZING product, my hair is no down to my chest. I LOVE THIS! If you want your hair to grow and am impatient like me, this product is a STEAL!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the shampoo &amp; conditioner smelled. from previous reviews, I was expecting it to be bad. I think the company (Nisim) must have worked on the scent, because it is quite lovely. light, refreshing flowery smell.   I have very fine, thin straight hair, &amp; this makes my hair feel so soft &amp; silky. it looked nice after 1st use. I have not found it to be drying, but, I do not use everyday.  I loved this combo so much, I came back to order more. recommended. :)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Ok so I just had to write a review on this product because this product works! My hair was extremely long and I went to get it trimmed and apparently the hair dresser thought an 1.5 meant 4.5 inches so when she was done cutting my hair I was completely devastated! I did a lot of research and tried to find products that would help increase the growth of my hair and found this product. Of course I was skeptical and questioned myself as to if I really should buy the product but I just thought, \\&quot;hey, why not?\\&quot; So I purchased it here on amazon and I seriously cannot say enough about it. I am completely IN LOVE with this product. My hair has grown so much faster and I even have guys saying, \\&quot;wow your hair is getting long\\&quot; and you know how guys are...they don&#x27;t ever notice changes in women&#x27;s hair!  I got my hair cut about two months ago and have only used this product for a little over a month. My hair has grown almost 2 inches!! Maybe this product doesn&#x27;t work for everybody but it certainly works for me! It&#x27;s absolutely amazing!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This might work for some people, but it did not work for me. It dried out my hair and gave me more spilt ends. It worked at first and then about a few weeks into it my hair became dry and was breaking more then usual.</li>
            <li> I got this product hoping that it would indeed make my hair grow faster.  I have been using it for a little over a month and haven&#x27;t noticed a significant increase in length that I would give F.A.S.T. any credit for. On the other hand, I will continue to buy this product because even though it hasn&#x27;t made my hair grow faster, I do love the way it makes my hair feel. It feels so light and soft which is wonderful considering my hair is so heavy and thick and just very abused from everything I have put it through. I haven&#x27;t found any shampoos or conditioners that have really made my hair feel and look...so healthy. Defiantly is one of my favorites now.</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago i got my hair cut really short because i had messed it up before and i HATED it! during this most recent summer, my hair was probably right at shoulder length, if not a little shorter. it&#x27;s been growing but in the past few months ive been wanting my hair to grow extra FAST!! so for christmas i got the shampoo and conditioner. i&#x27;ve been using it for nearly a month now and it&#x27;s grown a full inch. i was so excited! and the smell is great, when you wash w/ this shampoo&amp;conditioner it gets SUPER soft and bouncy. my hair is almost down to my chest (my goal is the waist!) i recommend this product and i also recommend not using a hair dryer and to try not to use a straightener,(unless it&#x27;s an emergency) because your hair gets a lot healthier the less you use heated products! :) but overall, great shampoo and conditioner, TRY IT!</li>
            <li> I caucasian and bought this product for both my own hair and my 5 year old daughter who gave herself a haircut.  I&#x27;ve only used this a few times on my daughter and her hair is finally growing back.  It was almost like her growth was stunted and this woke it up and told it to start growing, seriously!  She is thrilled and I&#x27;m excited that my own hair has grown quite a bit in the past month as well.  I just placed my third order for this product.  I have color treated hair and it doesn&#x27;t do a great job at conditioning my hair so I reccomend a deep conditioning treatment in addition to this product like once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about three months, the 1st month i didn&#x27;t notice too much of a difference but the last 2 months my hair has gotten about 3 inches. I&#x27;m planning to stick with it for a while    TIPS- I cut off all my dead ends (find a stylist you can trust not to hack off all your hair)      - I drink tons of water! My hair loves it      - I rarely use heat on my hair and when I do, I use a heat defence product.      - I deep condition my hair once a week (aussie 3 min miricle left on for about an hour)      - I only wash my hair every other day. The natural oils are really good for your hair. Just make sure that you brush your hair more often on these days, than regular, so the oils and get to your ends.     Getting long, healthy hair takes time and patience for people like me who&#x27;s hair just wont grow at all!! But stick with the product. Dont give up on it right away. And good luck!!!</li>
            <li> SO I WENT TO THE MALL AND ASKED THE STYLIST TO LAYER MY HAIR BUT KEEP THE LONG LENGTH (DOWN TO MY LOWER BACK) I TOLD THE STYLIST \\&quot;4\\&quot; TIMES EVEN SHOWED HER A \\&quot;PICTURE\\&quot;.... DID SHE LISTEN??? HELL NO!! THE B**** BUTCHERED ME!!! I WAS SO PISSED OFF WHEN I CAME HOME LOOKED UP SOME FAST HAIR GROWTH PRODUCTS AND SEEN ALOT OF REVIEWS ON THIS ONE SO FIGURED WHAT DID I HAVE TO LOSE (SINCE ALL MY HAIR WAS CHOPPED OFF ALREADY!!) IT HAS BEEN A MONTH AND MY HAIR HAS GROWN 2 INCHES* AND NOT ONLY THAT, THIS PRODUCT MAKES MY HAIR FEEL SO SILKY AND STAYS CLEAN WAY LONGER THEN ANY OTHER SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER OUT THERE... BUT I DO SHAMPOO AND RINSE TWICE LIKE IT SAYS ON THE BOTTLE... SO FIVE STARS FROM ME :)</li>
            <li> I got a bad hair cut and ordered this to grow my hair back asap. I used it for almost exactly two months. I did notice that my hair grew, but so much of my hair fell out while washing it that it made me regret using the shampoo. Oh well, I guess I&#x27;ll try Biotin now to get my hair to grow back.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy both the shampoo and condish and have been using them for almost a month now every other day. I have noticed I am cutting my bangs a lot now because they keep going past my eyebrows so that&#x27;s a good sign. The rest of my hair has seen about 3/4 of an inch of growth so far. However, I am also taking silica supplements and liquid msm so it could be a combination of the three. I haven&#x27;t experienced dry hair like everyone else, but then again, I like to apply moisturizer to my hair the minute I get out the shower. The people who aren&#x27;t experiencing any growth are probably the ones who continue to straighten, don&#x27;t leave the conditioner on long enough, or thought they would get long hair overnight, who knows.</li>
            <li> I received F.A.S.T. in a very timely manner and the product is great.  I use it all the time.  It does what it says.  I started using the shampoo and conditioner approximately 3 years ago.  At that time my hair was @ my shoulders.  Now my it is at my waist.  I receive compliments all the time about how healthy, shiny and long it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten such great results fun any so-called hair growth system as I did with Nissim Fast. I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle and my hair has grown significantly since I first started using it. My search for a product that actually makes my hair grow is finally over!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to read the good reviews on this product before purchasing NISIM F.A.S.T, so since my very horrible hair cut LAST July I have been looking for good products to promote hair growth. I saw this and just had to order it! I recieved my shampoo &amp; conditioner a few days ago, and used them right away. Like I said, this is only my second use of the products, but I love them. The only thing I see as a downfall is my first lather isn&#x27;t very lathery (lol) but once I repeat with the shampoo it lathers very easily.&lt;br /&gt;I give this shampoo &amp; conditioner two thumbs up....it takes my not-so-managable mane, and makes it soft and frizz free. I will continue to use NISIM F.A.S.T, and I hope to acheive maximum results!</li>
            <li> I bought this product in March after a too-short haircut. My hair was just touching the tops of my shoulders. As of yesterday, my hair had grown (in these past 6 months) about 5 inches. That might not seem like a whole lot, but my hair normally grows less than half an inch per month. This product definitely helps speed up the process. Unfortunately yesterday I saw a scissor-happy stylist who chopped off three inches. So, although I seem to be right back where I started, I know that in a few months I&#x27;ll be on my way to long hair again! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy!</li>
            <li> my product came faster than expected and has worked fantastically! the box was a bit damaged but the product inside was in perfect shape and has worked great. I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on and off for the last few months.  If you want to compare your hair to mine: I have thick, golden-brown, wavy hair that dries out if I don&#x27;t take care of it (i.e. heat styling), but mostly is soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, here&#x27;s my take on it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 -  Yes, it did dry my hair out a bit, but not horribly so.  If you&#x27;re a heavy user of heat styling, this probably isn&#x27;t for you.  I blow dry or iron my hair ONLY once every one or two weeks.  To combat the drying, simply alternate with a heavily-conditioning shampoo and conditioner.  I really like Renpure&#x27;s \\&quot;My Pretty Hair is Parched.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 -  Yes, it makes my hair grow faster.  I&#x27;ve kind of experimented over the last few months, and came to the conclusion that you have to use it at LEAST every other wash to get real results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 -  Some reviewers have complained about their hair falling out.  Let&#x27;s think about this.  Nobody keeps the same hair forever, your hair naturally falls out over time as NEW hair grows in.  See where this is going?  Your hair&#x27;s growth rate fluctuates depending on a number of factors: health, stress, smoking, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was kid (long before I even cared about growing my hair out), I noticed that my hair fell out right before a growth spurt.  So whenever I saw a bunch of hair in the drain, I knew my hair was about to grow crazy fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 -  Hair growth happens at your scalp, NOT THE ENDS.  So save some money and massage the shampoo into your scalp only - and let it sit for about 5 minutes to let the science cocktail sink in.  For me, the conditioner worked great for ALL of my hair, so long as I used a leave-in conditioner.  I really like Garnier Sleek and Shine Smoothing Milk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 -  Some tips on growing your hair out (beyond this product):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a -  Exercise, exercise, exercise.  How does your hair grow?  By proteins and other ingredients.  How does your scalp get these ingredients to the build site?  BLOOD.  Exercise increases your heart rate... and consequently the health and growth of your locks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b -  When in the shower, massage your hair in a circular pattern with your finger tips.  This stimulates (again) blood circulation, and therefore your hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;c -  Vitamins.  Not just biotin and iron (which you need), but a multivitamin.  The healthier your body is, the more efficiently it will operate - and grow that hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;d -  Don&#x27;t smoke.  This will improve your skin and teeth too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wordy review, I know, but I have been obsessed with growing my hair out.  I&#x27;ve tried it ALL.  Bottom line is that this product works, but its not magic.  It alone will not makes your hair grow over night.  Just think of it as a helpful boost.  And happy growing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12-23-14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel I should let future buyers know that this product, while wonderful, can fade hair color.  I gave a bottle to my friend, who dyes her hair black, and she said that she wished she could&#x27;ve kept using it, but it faded her hair color.  I imagine that cocktail in the bottle that promotes hair growth may not be friendly to color pigments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck again!  I hope some of you have gotten longer, beautiful hair since I made the review.</li>
            <li> Shipping was excellent came the next day without paying for next day arrival and the product itself is fantastic will deffinetly be ordering more very soon! My hair has probably grown a couple of inches in a couple of weeks. Love the product!</li>
            <li> This product really works. After using it for just 2 weeks my hair grew half an inch. Ive been using it for two months now and can definitely tell a difference in the length.</li>
            <li> I purchased FAST Shampoo and Conditioner to not only lengthen my hair but also improve its texture. I am very satisfied with the results. My hair grew a full inch in the first month, and its health has improved as well.</li>
            <li> I didnt see much of a difference in length but I like it because the shampoo feels like it strips your hair clean and the conditioner renutritions it lol</li>
            <li> First of all my hair was long the next 3 months it is up to my mid neck. So I was desperate for long hair there was something called Mira hair oil. But I did not trust it. So I went to Amazon. FAST shampoo is a miracle worker. I already used it for two weeks and MY HAIR GREW 1 INCH. First of all I am African American. I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY ONE also my nails are growing a lot and if my nails are growing so is my hair. The smell is heavenly. Suds good. Lifetime shampoo.Every one is different so is the texture and length of hair but this shampoo change it to bouncy, long, good smelling hair. This is WONDERFUL.  TIPS:Try Doo Gro products for thicker hair. Biotin pills also grow hair. People ignore this but it is true YOU MUST DRINK 8 CUPS OF WATER FOR GLOWING SKIN AND HEALTHIER HAIR (made a big impact!).  :) &lt;3</li>
            <li> Thank you. This is AWESOME STUFF!!!!</li>
            <li> I have never suffered from having a dry or irritated scalp and this shampoo/conditioner set did that to me insantly. I&#x27;ve used drugstore brands and salon brands and never had that problem. I don&#x27;t know if this shampoo/conditioner set actually makes your hair grow fast because I will not continue to use it to find out. Healthy hair will grow faster than using this product which dries out your hair A LOT and your scalp as well.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend. FYI: I have curly bra length hair.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for about three weeks and i already noticed, it made my hair grow. I have hair thats about collar bone length and it feels alot cleaner and softer now. I only give it four stars because it took quiet a bit of time to recieve the product. I liked how it made my hair feel really silky and thicker, didnt dry my hair out or anything. Overall it really does work. Try it, i didnt think it would but you know.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to accelerate my hair growth after a disastrous trip to the hair salon (I wanted an inch off my medium long hair...she cut it to my chin) and after doing some research I decided to purchase this product. I had read numerous reviews saying that it made people&#x27;s hair shed more and it was drying but I decided that my hair would be able to handle it. I used Nisim for about 3 months and did not see any results and it did in fact dry my hair and scalp out a ton. Dandruff was never a problem for me before but now I have constant itching and flaking and on top of that I was finding shed hairs all over the place. Every time I touched my head hairs would come out. I decided to stop using the product and have returned to my normal shampoo and my hair is improving but I feel upset that I wasted money on something that left me at square one. I give Nisim Fast three stars, though, because many have said it does work for them and though it did not work for me, I do not want to say that it does not work for everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this stuff for 2-3 weeks and call me crazy but my hair has definitely grown!!! I&#x27;d say a half inch. Which is insane. Try this product! I had a \\&quot;trim\\&quot; by my hairdresser about a month ago who ended up cutting about 4-5 inches off (!!!) and with this shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ll be back down to my longer length in no time.</li>
            <li> I WORK IN A CANCER CLINIC.  I bought this set to help grow out my hair and hoped to make it thicker for a wedding 6 months down the road. I should have known better. Now that I have researched and read, the ingrediants in this product are dangerous.  Read for yourself!\\&quot;  Warning: What Your Shampoo&#x27;s Label Won&#x27;t Tell You...         With the tremendous growth of the natural products industry in recent years, it is no wonder that a whole new generation of \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; products is springing up in neighborhood drug and health food stores alike. The descriptive, \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot;, has become a buzzword used by big and small companies trying to exploit the niche market of natural products. It implies the wholesomeness of a product and its environmental friendliness. Yet, do the companies using this marketing tool really have the integrity to carefully select their ingredients so that their claims are factual? Major companies anxious to tap into the natural products market with its 20% yearly average growth rate are scrambling to produce \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; shampoos, hair dyes, and skincare products. These \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products are primarily composed of synthetic chemicals mixed with some natural ingredients .         Bodycare and cosmetic products are not considered medicines and are therefore not subject to FDA approval, nor does the FDA try to regulate the body care industry. This provides a large margin of freedom for manufacturers to formulate their products without too much government interference.  However, the FDA classifies cosmetic ingredients according to their degree of toxicity and prohibits the use of certain ingredients proven to be unsafe for use on humans such as certain colorants and some prohibited or restricted ingredients (such as hexachlorophene, mercury compounds, and chloroform). Bodycare product manufacturers, on their own responsibility, use any raw material as a cosmetic ingredient and market the product.  The FDA will only investigate a product and possiblypull it off the shelf if extensive mass consumer complaints and lengthy accumulations of evidence point to its harmfulness.   Thus, there are many commonly used ingredients in cosmetics today with potential carcinogenic effects which have been so-far overlooked by the FDA and continue to be used in alarming proportions in daily cosmetic applications, even in \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products.         The fact is that there is, according to Aubrey Hampton a Chemist and the Founder of Aubrey Organics, \\&quot;no legal definition for &#x27;natural&#x27;, and a chemist&#x27;s definition of organic simply requires that the molecule contain carbon\\&quot;. This means in simple terms that there are no legal guidelines and boundaries for manufacturers, controlling the substance of their \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; claims. Thus, \\&quot;it is all in the wordplay\\&quot;. So-called \\&quot;natural\\&quot; cosmetics can still contain potentially harmful or irritant chemical preservatives, cheap, chemically derived aesthetic and texture enhancing additives, chemically derived sudsing agents, artificial colorants and fragrances. The proof is in the labeling. Most people tend to think that a shampoo bottle whether sold in a health food store or not, which costs four times as much as a regular shampoo, with pictures of flowers and the labels \\&quot;all-natural\\&quot; and \\&quot;herbal extracts\\&quot; in an attractive, earth-tonish, environmentally friendly bottle, is a safe and healthy choice for washing hair. Well, one need only read the ingredients of the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoo and to compare it to any conventional brand sold in every drugstore.          It is very likely that the ingredients list of the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoo will contain one of the following three chemical additives, as do all other regular shampoos, as one of its top three ingredients: DEA or Diethanolamine, Propylene Glycol, SLS or Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, and SLES or Sodium Laureth Sulfate.          Diethanolamine or DEA is a common ingredient in shampoos and in bath products. DEA and any combinations of DEA, including the widely used Cocamide DEA has been found to pose a serious health risk to consumers. The dangers of DEA were reported last year on CBS This Morning, in which Dr. Samuel Epstein, M.D. of the University of Illinois and one of the world&#x27;s foremost toxicologists, testified about the results of his study in which he found that DEA is \\&quot; a potential carcinogen\\&quot; and that in even small doses, repeated use of DEA increases the risk of cancer. Further comments by Dr. Epstein criticized regulatory agencies and the cosmetic industry in the US for knowing that DEA \\&quot;reacts with nitrites in cosmetics to form another potent carcinogen, nitrosos/DEA\\&quot; and not taking any action to phase out its use although European governments and industries had done so already since the 1980&#x27;s. This, in addition to the fact that the National Toxicology Program (NTP) has issued a study proving (coamide and lauramide) DEA cause cancer in laboratory tests.          Propylene Glycol, also known as the main TOXIC ingredient in industrial antifreeze, is also a commonly used humectant ingredient that may be used in your shampoo to give it its \\&quot;glide\\&quot; and in order to prevent the drying of the product. It usually constitutes 10-20% of a typical cosmetic formulation. The American Academy of Dermatologists, Inc. published a clinical review in January 1991 which implicated Propylene Glycol as a cause of a significant number of reactions and as a primary irritant to the skin even in low levels of concentrations. Some of its adverse effects include dermatitis, kidney and liver abnormalities and it has been shown to inhibit skin cell growth and damage cell membranes causing rashes, dry skin and surface damage to the skin. This is the result of the effect of Propylene Glycol which is to repel important components necessary for healthy skin and scalp, including moisturizing water, and to act as a synthetic replacement for the moisture which the body cannot assimilate. This is the cause of the skin irritations and drynessand other negative reactions associated with PG.          Two other ingredients that commonly find themselves at the top of the list of ingredients of your \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoo are Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) and its sister chemical Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES). SLS is found in 90% of all shampoos and toothpastes. It is used so freely by manufacturers as it is a cheap detergent that produces a lot of foam and bubbles which we all equate with cleansing. Sodium Laurel Sulfate is an irritant, and a shampoo containing 15% SLS is mainly tolerable because it comes in contact with the scalp for only a few minutes and it is diluted with water while in use.  It is deliberately used in clinical studies to irritate the skin so that the effects of other substances can be tested. It is a caustic cleaner and corrodes hair follicles and impairs ability to grow hair. It is similar to detergent in dishwashing liquids as it cleans hair so thoroughly, it strips the protective lipids from the surface of the scalp, impeding its ability to regulate moisture, so that in order to manage it you have to pour on a chemical conditioner. A Material Safety Data Sheet which \\&quot;contains written or printed material concerning a hazardous material as prescribed by law\\&quot;, including information \\&quot;needed to insure the safety and health of the user at all stages of manufacture, storage, use, and disposal\\&quot;, for SLS reports that it is harmful if inhaled, ingested, left on skin too long,  and it poses dangers to the eyes as it can accumulate in the tissues of the eye causing possible cataracts.          Sodium Lauryl  Sulfate is the subject of great controversy and the cause of the greatest concern to many scientists. While on one hand, it is considered non-carcinogenic by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the National Toxicology Program (NTP), and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), there is still unveiling evidence that SLS produces a potential carcinogenic effect in your shampoo when it interacts with other nitrogen bearing ingredients to form nitrosamines ornitrates. This is a cause of concern, as SLS enters and maintains residual levels in the lungs, liver, and brain from skin contact,causing major problems in these areas.            Sodium Laureth Sulfate is a milder version of SLS and is commonly used in industrial engine degreasers and in concrete cleansers among others with similar effects as SLS.         A good example of the dangers of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Cocamide DEA is your children&#x27;s bubble bath. Unlike shampoo, which contains the same foaming chemicals and is essentially the same thing (it produces foam), bubble bath is regulated by the FDA. Bubble bath is defined by the FDA as \\&quot;any product intended to be added to the bath for the purpose of producing foam and containing a surface active agent serving as a detergent or foaming agent\\&quot; and produces \\&quot;risks\\&quot; which \\&quot;have been known for some time\\&quot;. Thus, it is required by law to bear the following warning on its label:    Caution - Use only as directed. Excessive use or prolonged ex-posure may cause irritation to skin and urinary tract. Discont-inue use if rash, redness, or itching occur. Consult your physician if irritation persists. Keep out of reach of children.      \\&quot;</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really write an accurate review because I only tried it twice. &amp; Out of those time it left my hair so UNBELIEVABLY DRY . I cannot explain how dry my hair was after wards. It felt like I just bleached my hair I COULD not run my fingers thru my hair at all. It was like that for days not even a hydrating hair masks would help AT ALL. Maybe if I was a natural hair color I would&#x27;ve seen some growth thru the month but I just couldn&#x27;t put my hair thru it anymore. I had read mamy reviews saying the same thing but decided to take the risk.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair grow much quicker than usual. It smells nice and makes my hair feel so soft and smooth. The price is much cheaper than on the actual product website, and the shipping is fast. I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to grow a pixie out and am grabbing at straws to make it easier on me. I bought this shampoo and I was a little hesitant because of the price, but I have to say I will continue to buy it until I reach my length goal. It smells good, not a strong smell but a faint clean smell. Makes my hair feel thicker ( I have very fine hair). And I have noticed quicker growth than I normally would if I hadn&#x27;t used the product. Overall it&#x27;s put my hair in better shape. Makes it feel really healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for 4 weeks and can definitely see results in my hair growth. The thickness and health is also improved. I will definitely continue using this product. It&#x27;s amazing &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible. It didn&#x27;t hurt my hair but it didn&#x27;t really help it either. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and I haven&#x27;t seen any results besides the fact that it stripped my hair of its dye.</li>
            <li> Does not grow your hair any faster like it claims. It also smells terrible like chemicals. No thanks. False advertisement</li>
            <li> I would probably buy the FAST shampoo and conditioner again as I like how easy my hair is to handle after using it.  But it sure didn&#x27;t do anything for hair loss or growing your hair longer or thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes to a huge foam with very little shampoo and it doesn&#x27;t take much conditioner to smooth your hair, but as a hair grower, it&#x27;s a no-go.  So decide for yourself.</li>
            <li> i have been purchasing this shampoo and conditioner for 2 months and love it! come fast and is less money than with most dealers.</li>
            <li> A little history, I was born a blonde, but as I got older my natural color became more of a chestnut brown. However, I have been highlighting my hair to be blonde for nearly 20 years now. Between the bleaching, flat irons, and blow drying, my hair now feels like straw. It&#x27;s terribly unruly and I have to flat iron it to control it....hence...more damage. I wanted to break away from all this bad hair habit, so I went and had my hair dyed back to a chestnut brown. Came out a little darker than I wanted, but still it&#x27;s fading to be the color that I wanted. Anyway....I want my hair to grow out so I can cut off all this damage from years of hair abuse. So, I ordered the FAST shampoo and the conditioner. I recieved the conditioner before the shampoo. But I started with the conditioner anyway. First, the smell isn&#x27;t bad at all. The conditioner really doesn&#x27;t seem like it is a deep enough moisturizer for dry hair, so I have been using a deep conditioning treatment (Infusium for damaged hair)twice a week. I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday. I wash it every other day. I have started with the shampoo now as well. You only need a little of the shampoo. I overly used it the first time. The shampoo lathers up really thick. I can&#x27;t tell yet, if it has made my hair any drier, because my hair was so damaged. One thing that I have started doing is using the shampoo only on my scalp and roots. The rest of my hair needs as much oil and moisture that it can get. I have only been using the S/C for a week now. I have some lighter carmel highlights in my hair, so I will be able to see my growth. I&#x27;ll update after a full month of using. Keeping my fingers crossed that I&#x27;ll have a 5 star review!</li>
            <li> I have tried everything. I had curly soft hair before a relaxer treatment that was intended for coarse hair and lost some hair at the nape of my neck and my temples. I tried pills, I tried natural supplements., I tried every kind of oil, shampoo, and cream. Nothing worked. Until this shampoo I had minimal growth at my temples and the hair that did grow was kinky and dry and soon broke. I am only 20 and did not want to already be balding and thinning. After using the shampoo and conditioner my temple hair what grown to my ears and nape hair to my collarbone after going through one bottle of the shampoo and conditioner. Even my \\&quot;baby hairs\\&quot; have grown back and the best part is the hair is growing back strong and not breaking off! I will continue to buy this product to keep my hair growing just as advertised- FAST!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and can feel a difference already. I have just started to record the growth as far as length and hope to post the pictures on line.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this stuff every day, which definitely may have had an effect on it&#x27;s usefulness. I did get compliments on my hair and comments on the length after using for a while. This may have been in part me not wearing my hair down, though. Overall, good for your hair and smells nice, but not sure it actually promotes growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other types of hair growth shampoo&#x27;s before. The first one I ever tried made my hair extremely dry which is why I was reluctant to try this one. However, after using this shampoo for a month now I actually like the way it makes my hair feel better then my normal L&#x27;Oreal shampoo and conditioner that I use.&lt;br /&gt;Using this shampoo and conditioner, trying to only washing my hair every other day, and taking &amp;#34;hair skin and nails&amp;#34; supplement, has made my hair grow 1.5 inches and it hasn&#x27;t even been a full month yet! I am so pleased! and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now. I have not noticed a difference with my hair length. The product has a musky smell to it, which I don&#x27;t mind, it reminds me of men products. I noticed that many people mentioned that a lot of their hair fell out, mine has NOT it has been the same since I&#x27;ve been using it. It does make hair shiny and softer, it has not dried it out like a lot of the other shampoos that I have used in the past. It did not weight my hair down, nor make it feel greasy. I have used PAUL MITCHELL AWAPUHI which are very pricey shampoos/conditioners and I actually liked FAST a lot more. I have also used WEN and L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free shampoos but it has made my hair appear greasy and dirty, and they cost the same amount as the FAST product if not more, and I would use FAST over those products any day. I actually bought both the shampoo and conditioner for 20$ which is not bad at all, since I usually spend more on my hair products. I am not disappointed with the product, the only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the product did not live up to it&#x27;s name, as I said before it did not make my hair grow faster, but it did leave it shiny and smooth, which is never a bad thing in my book.</li>
            <li> I really like this product my hair falls out less and I do feel that it has been growing more since I have been using it.</li>
            <li> Like some reviewers who wrote that they were &amp;#34;Skeptical&amp;#34; about shampoo &amp; conditioner that says that it helps hair grow longer, such as this one. F.A.S.T. (Fortifying Amino Scalp Therapy) is working for me. I got this in the mail 3 days ago and though I am writing this review a bit too early, I figured I&#x27;d add my 2 cents anyway.  First off, the scent of this shampoo &amp; conditioner does Not smell bad to me, it smells like a clean laundry detergent and fabric softener scent. Second, the shampoo didn&#x27;t dry my hair out all that much and I dyed it a day before I received FAST in the mail, if it does dry your hair out, the conditioner will help by leaving it on for 1-2 minutes as the instructions recommend. Third, I discovered that the massaging of the scalp as you wash and condition is part of the reason why my hair has sped up on growing about 1 and a half inches to 2 inches. My hair is short, I had to cut my almost  armpit length hair to my earlobe short when I damaged it beyond repair when I bleached it in late Oct. 2013.  I Hate having short hair.  I was using shampoos that was for long hair like Garnier Length &amp; Strength, the Mane&#x27;n Tail shampoo that I have used before many times, and even Alberto VO5 that has 5 vitamins -2 being Biotin &amp; Niacin that thickens and promotes hair growth. I believe massaging the scalp while washing your hair with any shampoo will promote fast hair growth, plus having patience and persistence. Hair naturally grow 1/2 an inch once monthly and 6 inches within a year. This shampoo system won&#x27;t grow your hair like the boy in The Peanut Butter Solution, but it may help give your hair a little boost in growing a little more than what your hair type normally does.  I&#x27;m white/caucasian, btw.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It works really well and has saved me an awful lot of stress from bad haircuts.</li>
            <li> I feel like this shampoo and conditioner gave my hair a boost in growth. My hair grew about 2 inches in the month and a half of using it!</li>
            <li> PEOPLE GET PAID TO RAVE ABOUT THIS PRODUCT. SAVE YOUR HAIR AND YOUR SELF ESTEEM AND DONT BUY IT UNLESS YOU DONT MIND LOSING A CHUNK OF YOUR HAIR!!!.</li>
            <li> My hair is processed so maybe that&#x27;s the problem.  This product made my hair even more dry and brittle.  I don&#x27;t know if it grew any faster the risk of loosing it outweighed the possibility of it growing faster.</li>
            <li> this did not work for me. it was kinda pricey to try and not have it work as it claimed it would</li>
            <li> Love it! My hair usually grows an inch and a half each time I use this. No issues with dryness as I use Moroccan oil every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I choose this product because I have watched a lot of YouTube videos and the people that have tried it themselves loved the product. I wanted to try it myself. I was planning to grow my hair out to get rid of a bad hair cut at the salon and to get a different style. I would recommend it to anyone wo is willing to change their shampoo and grow their hair long faster.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month now,a nd the only thing i have seen is that my hair is very dry when i use it. It drys out your hair to much. And then to top t off i havnt seen a change in my hair grown at all, but i will still give it a try for another 30 days to see.</li>
            <li> After having my hair damage by a different product and having the need to cut off some of my hair, a friend of mines recommended this product. After trying it, I was really happy with the results the more I use it the more I see the growth of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo before but not long enough to see a difference. So desperate about 3 months ago I decided to give it a shot. I got the small bottle and used it tell it was gone and saw about an inch difference! Loving this product I got the big bottles and use it every day and now my hair has grown a total of 4 inches! This stuff is miracle working. I have damaged hair from bleach but it is growing like crazy now! My only complaint it that it does dry your hair out... I have grown a few inches yes but the ends of my hair keep breaking off and and really course and dry. I&#x27;m buying a split end repair that should do the trick but you definitely need some sort of extra conditioning for your ends with this product! Other than that this is a miracle product and I&#x27;ll be expecting wait length hair in a few months! (I started with chin length) I recommend!</li>
            <li> I Used both bottles.  I Did not notice any hair growth at all. Would not purchase again. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I saw two months of hair growth in 5 weeks. However, it dries the hair out terribly. That&#x27;s something that would have to be fixed before purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Works awesome, I lost all my hair due to chemo and once I finished my treatments I started using this wonderful product. It really does grow fast, I just recommend every other day and you will a difference within a week!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it works great and my hair grows jus like it says I definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> The shampoo smelled nice. But it did not make my hair grow at all and I was disappointed with that aspect. My hair felt nice and smelled good at least.</li>
            <li> For me, using this duo everyday for a month and a half, did help aid in hair growth. It didn&#x27;t actually make my hair grow it helped speed up the process. In about a month I had roots roughly about 1.5 inches long instead of  (normally for me) 1 inch long. I would say if you&#x27;re wanting to speed up the process it&#x27;s worth the price but don&#x27;t expect to have rapunzel hair overnight.</li>
            <li> I know it has only been a little over 2 weeks so I am not complaining just yet. I do have long thick hair so my 12 oz bottles are about more than half way done. I will be purchasing more in the future just to make sure I use for at least 6 months, since I have heard you should definitely see results by then. The shampoo does smell great!</li>
            <li> I order this once a month because it really does work. My hair grows a lot quicker and its stronger too. I love this shampoo and conditioner. I only hate that you have to use it everyday but I am just glad that it actually works. I have been using this for about 3 months now, and my hair is finally down past my shoulders when 3 months ago it was above my shoulders. This stuff does work if you use it right. thanks for the great product. I just wish it was a little cheaper but I will keep getting it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this purchase. I ordered this product after a hair stylist told me that all of her colleagues use it for hair growth and they swear by it. I&#x27;m not sure if I can claim that this stuff is the reason why my hair is growing longer, because I&#x27;ve also stopped dying my hair and heat styling it, but it definitely isn&#x27;t hurting any. My hair feels clean and conditioned after use, and it smells awesome throughout the day. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an alright shampoo and conditioner set. But I&#x27;ve been using it for months, and have seen no faster hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything, my hair has actually been growing slower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have heard this works for some people, I&#x27;m not sure why or why not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if it does not help grow my hair,  then I&#x27;d much rather use a different shampoo set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck!</li>
            <li> Only used once and wont be using again. My scalp is itching off and my hair is sooo dry with no moisture. I would of gave it a good go but the itchy scalp is not a good sign in my eyes. The more reviews i have read i do wish i had not wasted my money as i think the key to growing hair is all in your diet and stay away from using styling tools every day. Very disapointed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Don&#x27;t give into this crap.</li>
            <li> when i first started using this stuff i liked it and i think it probably was helping my hair grow a little but when i would use it i noticed way to much of my hair coming out too. i ignored this because i just wanted to see growth but i washed my hair today and looked around my edges and noticed they were thinning. so this stuff will probably help hair growth but get ready to shed and lose your edges and some of your hair. this product also has some bad ingrediets, i suggest you look them up.i also heard some of these ingrediets can cause cancer.</li>
            <li> Awesome I look like a blonde Jesus. Hairs is so freaking long. So rad. I can&#x27;t believe it worked. If you are reading this go ahead and buy it. This is not a joke. If you want long hair quick grab it now.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY WIFE&#x27;S REVIEW ON THE PRODUCT:&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this shampoo / conditioner for my visibly damaged hair. i had split ends, breaking, shedding and my ends were thinning out and very stringy. After the first use, I noticed a remarkable difference in the appearance of my hair. I had far less breakage and my hair looks stronger and has a lovely sheen....I can even pull without breaking the strands. I am using this along with spring valley biotin capsules and it complements the pills well. The middle of my hair was very short due to breakage and now the whole thing has evened out. I sooooooooo love this shampoo and I will definitely be buying it again. I&#x27;m still amazed that a shampoo and conditioner can restore my hair to its former glory. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> not only did this NOT make my hair grow faster and/or thicker, it almost made it seem like it was getting thinner. It completely strips your hair of dye.. and it seemed like it even altered the natural hair color as well. I remember my hair being stringy and oily after using this. The smell is horrid. I would not recommend to someone.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair product in hopes to strengthen my hair and encourage growth like I had in another product.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product I started to notice a lot of hair in the sink and I mean &amp;#34;A LOT&amp;#34;. Needless to say I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again nor do I recommend it to anyone. There is another product that is sold on AMAZON and you can buy at the hairdressers that worked great with fabulous results. I don&#x27;t know why I switched or thought something else would bring better results, however I learned my lesson and it won&#x27;t happen again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much. Overpriced, to be honest. Others complain about it stripping their hair of oils, etc. This is the case with the shampoo, yes. It gives it a weird texture and feels kind of like hay. However, if you use the conditioner after, then it renews your hair and makes it feel normal again. Some people it may work for, but I have such damaged hair roots that it&#x27;s kind of a lost cause at this point.</li>
            <li> Did not like original FAST shampoo - extremely drying to my 4C natural hair - Repurchased the FAST sulfate-free shampoo - Like that better.  The conditioner is really nice and moisturizing.  No significant quick hair growth  in-so the &amp;#34;jury is still out&amp;#34; on this one.</li>
            <li> I wanted my hair to grow faster and it was ok, did not see much of a difference, very small change but it smelled good and made my hair nice. no complains about the shipping, i got it on time and all good.</li>
            <li> People with thicker hair can tolerate it better, but anyone with hair that isn&#x27;t really thick, DO NOT buy it. This product mad my hair knotty and thin. It never even worked either. I had to cut my hair up to my collarbone when it used to be down to ribcage. I had to cut it because, like I said, it made my hair knotty, thin, and breaks easily. I would never suggest this to anyone and want a refund.</li>
            <li> I actually had many, many people tell me how much faster my hair was growing after I started using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I cut my hair, and stopped trying to grow it out, I think that F.A.S.T. has a cleaner feel to it with the shampoo and conditioner.  I even got a little sample packet of shampoo/conditioner with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how it works, but my hair has been growing faster, and it&#x27;s a little thicker.  So I like it.  It gives me more appointment oriented haircuts, also.  I like it, may not be for everyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this product not to long ago. I was a bit skeptical at first, but wow was I proven wrong! When I received the package in the mail I was jumping for JOY! I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out! I had really long hair, like I mean down to your butt long hair (I miss it terribly) and after a couple years it&#x27;s gotten shorter and shorter. So now I want to grow it out and never cut it again! Using the shampoo for my first time was amazing! My hair felt like it was getting cleansed from root to tip! It suds up pretty good and doesn&#x27;t make my hair dry. Then I used the conditioner (I would recommend you bring a big bristle comb in the shower and comb out your hair really well, before putting on the conditioner), I poured a small amount and rubbed onto my ends and worked it to my roots. The conditioner makes my hair very smooth and soft :) I even received compliments about how healthy and smooth my hair looked :) In terms of lengthening my hair, well I have to continue using both bottles, but so far I do see a difference :) I would recommend this product to anyone who wishes to get long, healthy hair faster! It really does work! :D</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo and conditioner set, I think it did wonders for my hair, it felt so soft and made my hair feel like it came right out of the salon every time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, I am not quite sure if it really helps my hair growth like they advertise. But because of how this product makes my hair feel, I&#x27;ll buy again and again!</li>
            <li> The products smell good, and leave my hair feeling wonderful. I did keep track of measuring my hair growth, and it did seem to grow slightly faster than usual. However, not enough to make up for the price.</li>
            <li> The shampoo dries out my hair, the conditioner weighs it down--not a good combination for my scalp/hair type. I also didn&#x27;t care for the smell (like strong laundry detergent). My hair type is fine (but I have a lot of hair).</li>
            <li> I bought this item and then use it for a month.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it really works on me.&lt;br /&gt;For me, I think it is such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product, I was a little wary of what it may do to my hair. I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for about 15 years now, and most of those have been home dye jobs, so my hair was pretty frizzy. Also, I straighten and blowdry my hair everyday. Even though I use a heat protection product, my hair still came out like a puffball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I first tried this, it made my hair so silky and smooth I almost thought I left conditioner in my hair or something, but I didn&#x27;t. And it&#x27;s made my hair so much healthier as well. My hair isn&#x27;t as frizzy anymore and I almost don&#x27;t have to straighten my hair everyday. Plus, even though it&#x27;s only been two weeks, my hair has actually grown about a half an inch already. I love this product and I&#x27;m definitely going to be buying more when I run out. No more drug store shampoo for this girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: It&#x27;s been a little over a month and my hair has grown at least 3 inches. It&#x27;s insane. :) I&#x27;ll never buy another shampoo other than this.</li>
            <li> This is for all you girls that miss your big hair. I recently suffered a trimming tragedy from my hairdresser&#x27;s overestimating clippers. My short layers left me feeling like Mr. Bigglesworth (in Austin Powers) when I am striving to feel more like a Fembot. So I buy the FAST system because it falls in the middle of the price gamut damit. The first time I used it, I was hooked. I noticed that I didn&#x27;t lose as much hair...it was only a fraction of the ping pong ball wad I usually swift off the shower floor. I also noticed that my hair felt engorged as opposed to stringy during the scrub (I could really use a product like this for another parts of my body). I really enjoyed the relaxing medicinal spa scent and gel like consistency of the cream. Also, it was less frizzy when blow drying...it felt soft and conditioned and ready to go air dry (and that&#x27;s just crazy talk for me). I love this. I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s helping my color any but right now my goal is to get me my big hair back and I believe I am well on my way back to Fembotland.</li>
            <li> For some background information, you should know that I used to have long, beautiful hair that reached all the way to my waist.* Then, in middle school my mom convinced me to get a hair cut. Soon after, I began to straighten my naturally curly hair (in an effort to fit in and look good). Obviously the hot plates ruined my hair and introduced me to the horrible world of split ends. Ever since then, I have been in a constant battle against my upper-chest length hair. I thought long hair was the only beautiful kind, and that I couldn&#x27;t be completely pretty without it. Short hair was cute, long hair was gorgeous. I wore clip-in extensions from the beginning of 10th grade, until a few months before the end of my senior year in highschool. I took prenatal vitamins when I heard that they encouraged the growth of new cells, more specifically, hair cells. I even tried Ovation Cell Therapy, which worked but didn&#x27;t give me the results I was looking for. Eventually I gave up trying to make my hair something it wasn&#x27;t and didn&#x27;t try anything after my senior year 2010 to summer 2010, all the way up until March 2011. Thats when I became addicted to shopping online on Amazon.com and Ebay.com. As I was browsing and spending away I thought hey, why not see if they sell hair growth products on here for cheap? Thats when I came across a miracle- FAST Shampoo. I was VERY skeptical at first. I googled FAST shampoo and many results came up. After looking at multiple websites, testimonials, and negative reviews, I decided to go for it. It was a reasonable price so if it didn&#x27;t work, I would only be out $25.  Little did I know how much I would come to love those two bottles. My hair has grown TWO INCHES since I have used FAST. The funny thing is, i have only used it four times! I don&#x27;t know if it is my hair or whatnot, but I promise, ever since I have started using it, my hair looks healthier and feels softer &amp; stronger. It leaves your hair smelling great, too! It could be a coincidence that my hair decided to start growing around the same time that I started using FAST, but as you can see from my past history that is highly unlikely!   If you are skeptical, just take a chance and go for it! You won&#x27;t regret it(:    *I am Caucasian with normal, naturally curly hair. I think results might differ depending on hair texture(:</li>
            <li> smells amazing I never really notice a difference in hair growth then again I wasn&#x27;t focused on that . anything natural gets points from me and it smells so good will stick on your hair .</li>
            <li> It washes out your hair color and dries out your hair a bit. Use lots of conditioner. But it is great for growing out your hair naturally!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my take. I ordered this shampoo after damaging my hair so badly I had to literally shave my head. It was winter and I figured I could wear a hat. I figured I&#x27;d have a very short pixie by late spring. I ordered the shampoo skeptical but hopeful and very desperate. It came within 2 days so I started it 2 days after shaving my head. I mention this just to let you know I had a precise starting point so I know how much it grew. I have grown my hair out before so I know my exact growth rate to be 1/2 inch per month. I used this shampoo diligently for 3 months straight once per day without missing a day. I used it exactly as directed. I was determined and very hopeful. I measured my growth once a month and I found absolutely no accelerated growth whatsoever. My hair grew at its usual 1/2&amp;#34; per month. I am embarrassed that I fell for this scam. I heard that Nism will refund your money back if it does not speed growth. I called and asked for a refund. They were very nice about it and promptly refunded my money and I did not have to send the near empty bottles back. But I put ALOT of effort washing my hair every day and a ton of false hope into this product. I can&#x27;t believe this product is allowed to advertise as a growth shampoo. It is a total scam.</li>
            <li> doesnt work&lt;br /&gt;waste dmy money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;horrible product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;beware&lt;br /&gt;your hair wont grow from this please please be warned not to wste your time</li>
            <li> this is a very nice product. leaves my hair soft, fresh and manageable.</li>
            <li> Dry your hair but use coconut oil resolve the problem</li>
            <li> My hair was in such a bad condition when I used these, I couldn&#x27;t use them long enough to see a result. The shampoo was very stripping, and the conditioner wasn&#x27;t enough to counteract it.&lt;br /&gt;But idk, I might try again soon depending on the price.</li>
            <li> its just an ordinary shampoo and coditioner and doesnt help the hair grow any faster.you can go buy any shapoo and get same results-nothing.</li>
            <li> My hair feels more stronger</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me, I bought shampoo and conditioner and zero result, I color my hair so I can really see how fast the roots are growing- it is growing at the same speed as usual. Well I should ve listened to my hairdresser- he told me that all those products are total bs and waste of money. He was right</li>
            <li> Maybe this product works but it&#x27;s hard to tell. It does double your hair growth which is great, but hair grows so slowly in the first place that it will take a long time to tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I am almost done using this product. My hair grew pretty well fast. However, the shampoo and conditioner dried out my hair and it gave me ALOT of split ends.. i never had sooo much split ends in my life...UGHHH</li>
            <li> Soooo I only gave this product a 4 because I&#x27;ve only been useing it for 3 days now BUT I imagine I will be very satisfied after about a month of use!! I noticed the FIRST DAY I used it that it made my hair feel amazingly soft and light!! My hair has lots of damage from my getting blonde highlights and at home dye jobs. So as a result my hair frizz&#x27;s out and I have to straighten it all the time to tame it, which leds to more damage of course...But since Ive used the shampoo and conditioner I have not had to put anything else in it to calm it down on straighten it!! Which saves my money and hair lol. I will review later about the length part Im hoping to get my hair long enough to cut next year and send to locks of love :) Well I hope this review was helpful!!</li>
            <li> I cut my hair super short this past Feb., and not it is Sept. and I have been using these products on and off.  I think they hay have helped the growing process, but in general they are not &amp;#34;miracle shampoo and conditioner&amp;#34;.  I think it is a mental thing, seeing the name of the product gave me a boost of enthusiasm to keep my hair growing out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now and I have had tons of growth! My hair is also soft and shiny and no more tangles! I have a mix of coarse curly hair and fine stick straight hair. It&#x27;s very hard to manage. But since I&#x27;ve started using this my hair is like silk! I deff will continue using this product for ever! Even my hubby uses it and his hair won&#x27;t stop growing and its super soft too! We also take a daily biotin supplement to help our hair along just a bit more. &#x3D;D I would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have only used this shampoo and conditioner about 5 times, so it is too soon to see results. However, it leaves my hair silky and healthy looking after each use and the conditioner is light enough to not weigh down my fine hair. The smell is...different...but overall it is a good product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my hair into a pixi style and I liked it for a day! I hated in so much I was will to do anything. Fish oil, vitamins, oil treatment, conditioning treatments, and even this. At first I thought it was a dream and its seem to have many mixed reviews. I have used this product for 3 months now. And this&#x27;d is my 3rd bottle bought and I stopped using this product for a months and what was averaging 2 inches a month went to 1\2 inch. I took picture of the day before I used the product and then every week for the last 3months. You can see the difference!!!! My hair was little above my chin is now at my shoulder after I used my 2nd bottle!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any difference from using this compared to using any other shampoo/conditioner.  My hair didn&#x27;t grow much at all and I used it every day.  I guess everyone is different.  But, to me this didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo &amp; Conditioner for growing hair fast. It absolutely works. 2 weeks after I got my hair cut, my stylist said your hair is growing.  I said yes, my hair grows fast.  I absolutely would recommend this for anyone who is looking to have their hair grow fast. When I run out, I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about three months ago and I didn&#x27;t notice anything different about my hair. I was really hoping to see maybe a quarter of an inch or half an inch of growth, atleast just to say, it worked, but no, very disappointed. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am very perplexed about this product. I originally ordered the smaller shampoo and conditioner. My hair typically grows 1/4 inch a month. After 4 weeks of using both the shampoo and conditioner my hair grew a full inch. I was stunned and quite happy. So, I then ordered the larger size shampoo and conditioner. It smelled different and it is not working at all. After 4 more weeks, not even a 1/4 inch of new growth. Is it possible they do not consistently use the same ingredients? Not sure what to think now.</li>
            <li> Love this product it is awesome. I really works I recommend it to everyone that wants to grow there hair FAST! Definitely worth the 25 bucks</li>
            <li> My daughter had a bit too much taken off the bottom at the hair dresser and was devastated. She had grown her hair down to her waist, and when she asked for a trim I think the hairdresser went a little nutso and lopped off about 4 inches.  We found this shampoo and conditioner online so I bought it for her to calm her down.  It really works!!!  She used it faithfully every day and her hair has grown so much already.  She read that it had a foul smell, but honestly it just has a really clean fragrance...my daughter loves it and swears it is making her hair grow super fast.</li>
            <li> Had a very severe haircut done because of damage.  Being desperate for rapid growth and a eternal optimist&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this.  Save your money.  The only thing that might work would be Biotin for hair growth taken by pill.  Even then,&lt;br /&gt;its questionable.  Would not recommend.  In fact, I returned it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in hair growth..I had better luck with mane n tail. It smells good though!</li>
            <li> Be aware that this productts might work differently for everyone ! Well to start off I used this product for a month and it was the 12oz bottles me and my sister used it so that&#x27;s why it finished faster but it did do what the product is ment to do my hair grew about an inch being that it was bearly touching my coller bone to now being past it. It&#x27;s overall a good product I would definitely try it again I used it to review it first an loved it! :D alot of people said they had dryness in there hair even after using the conditioner I personally would leave it in for 3 minutes instead of 1 minute and it left it really soft. An I would also use a leave in conditioner for extra moisture : ) it lathered pretty well and worked good the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that I had to wash my hair with hot water that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it a 4 stars but overall it was great ! The only way you&#x27;ll see if it works is by trying it out !</li>
            <li> Okay so i just bought f.a.s.t. the other day and i got it in the mail so fast! i was so excited to use this because i used to have pretty long hair, but it was split from all the dying so i went to get it cut. i told the girl at the salon 1 inch and she cut off 3 INCHES! :( i was soo sad and determined to grow it back. my hair takes a while to start growing but when it does, it grows fast so i was hoping this would make it even faster. I just used it for the first time today and my hair is SOOO soft ! even if my hair doesnt grow faster im glad i got it because my hair feels amazing:)) ill be updating in a month or 2 to see the progress. i would recommend this product for sure! :) hopefully it keeps working, wish me luck!</li>
            <li> I bought this and after the first use I decided not to use it. I have natural curly hair and I relax it because I just prefer straight hair all the time. As soon as I wash the shampoo out of my hair, my hair was ridiculously stiff. I tried to put more shampoo thinking it would help loosen it up and still didn&#x27;t work. I ended up just using my herbal essence conditioner to loosen it up. Terrible. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I did not rate this product, because I did not purchase it, but I just thought I would say a lot of the comments are saying there hair grew 1-2 inches in a month, but my hair grows about 1-2 inches a month on its own, so Idk how this is helping, it seems all it does it dry your hair out, I haven&#x27;t tried it thought, so don&#x27;t hold this against me, lol!</li>
            <li> i recieved this product over a month ago, and my hair has not grown any faster then before, i have already used a whole bottle of both the shampoo and conditioner, no results!!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for about one month now.  However, have also started taking hair, skin and nail type vitamins.  At this time, I cannot determine which is contributing to hair growth.  I can say that my hair is certainly healthier and appears to be stronger than before.  Started my kids on the product so I can see if it actually helps.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nisim FAST shampoo for about a week now. I already am in love with this product! I use it every day as directed and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out. I have thin hair that I recently cut very short and it takes forever to grow. I can usually go about maximum 3 days without shampooing my hair before it gets greasy but it has no problem with shampooing every day with this product. It is shiny, soft and even feels thicker. I have noticed a lot of hair falling out while I am in the shower but not any other time which is good. Since I&#x27;ve been using FAST my family and friends have told me that my hair looks longer, after one week! I definitely notice a difference in the way my hair is. I will continue to use this product over the next couple of months and see where it takes me. I highly recommend this product to anybody who is trying to grow their hair. Obviously it isn&#x27;t for everyone and just because it worked on me doesn&#x27;t mean it will work on you. Everybody is different!</li>
            <li> It is not worth it buying it at all I bought this shampoo and I thought using it it will really grow my hair no it&#x27;s just a regular simple shampoo and what it did is that every time I would shower I will loose alot of hair so down but it I recommend the coconut shampoo is like 7 bucks at Walmart or the horse shampoo that one does help</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and I do believe I&#x27;ve seen some improvement with length and softer texture in my daughters hair as well as my own after only a few washes :)</li>
            <li> good product but never worked for me.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have read the negative reviews before trying this product. Yes it has made my hair grow faster, I can tell by my roots. HOWEVER, its not worth the negatives. I noticed that my hair was coming out in large amounts in the shower. I first assume it was because I hadnt brushed my hair so it had built up, but after several times of large amounts of hair loss I&#x27;m worried that this will not grow back. I wish I never tried this product because I&#x27;m scared to lose my hair!!!</li>
            <li> There is nothing special about this product it is just regular shampoo and it made my scalp dry my hair didn&#x27;t even grow</li>
            <li> First I have to say that all beauty items are subjective. Please use at your own cautions.&lt;br /&gt;Ok got that disclaimer out of the way and I&#x27;m really to rave about this! I&#x27;m Asian and was not \\&quot;blessed\\&quot; with the typical straight and silky hair. I have somewhat coarse, wavy, and thick hair. The hair does not even grow half an inch per month. Due to my sleeping habits, I know it&#x27;s me to blame. But the strange thing is, my nails and other bodily hair grows at a supersonic speed. Anyways, after using this for a month... My hair grew an inch!! I used this every other day and sometimes don&#x27;t even get to the conditioner. Neither the shampoo or conditioner made my hair dry. I also like to believe that I lose less hair in the showers. Onward towards my hair goal~</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. I noticed a difference right away. Will definitely use again when needed. Very affordable as well.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product, after many years of looking for things to help with my hair growth. I first bought it because all of the wonderful reviews, i went through two bottles thinking that it needed more time and to be honest i feel like my hair hasnt grown at all, if anything I feel like I&#x27;m losing some hair now that im on my second bottle. This product doesnt work for everyone I guess. Good luck people.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to order this., once I got it I went straight to the shower to wash my hair. I did notice that my hair was growing faster  after about a month, than usual but it made my hair feel really dry and brittle, that&#x27;s why I stopped using it. I switched to WEN which has completely saved my hair, it grows at a normal pace but its how my hair feels and looks that make me never want to use any other brand of shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li> It seems to be living up to its name increasing my hair growth rate.  I&#x27;m in that goofy state between short and medium length and it seems to be helping me grow it faster.  I use it daily without any dryness or anything. Hair growth is slow to begin with but this definitely adds a little bit of speed to the process for those looking for longer hair quicker.  It won&#x27;t happen overnight but and extra bit each month adds up.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it everyday due to my laziness so I can&#x27;t determine whether it grows hair or not, but it did make my hair softer, shinier, and healthier. I also noticed less breakage while combing the conditioner through my hair. Overall I love the shampoo and the conditioner and I think they&#x27;re great so I give them 4 stars.</li>
            <li> In reading all the reviews good and bad I was totally confused about whether or not I wanted to try this product. I wanted all the benefits that were mentioned but then there were just some nasty reviews that nearly scared me away. I contacted the company directly to see if they could offer any free samples that way I wouldn&#x27;t be out $25 if I didn&#x27;t like it. They emailed me a code and all I had to pay was shipping (around $6) I received the samples like in 2 days and I love it. I love the smell and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel hard at all, it actually feels soft after using the conditioner. I&#x27;m african american and I have type 4 hair. I just started using it so I haven&#x27;t checked my length but will update my review in a month.&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to mention Nisim has come out with a sulfate, paraben free verison and if you go to their facebook page and click the \\&quot;click here for special offers\\&quot; in red top mid of page you can get this set for $20 with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The code I used for the free samples:&lt;br /&gt;FAST Products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FAST 2oz (2 Pak) Shampoo and Conditioner:&lt;br /&gt;Coupon code: SUFSA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retail Value of $12.80 for the set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...if the code I was given doesn&#x27;t work for you just email them, they are very nice and helpful (o&#x3D;</li>
            <li> I used this product on and off for 6 months. My hair grew a total of 3-4 inches. I was very pleased that my hair had finally reached my belly button. I thought everything was great until I thoroughly studied the ends of my hair. My ends were dry and thin. I went to my hair stylist and she cut 4 inches off. This meant all of that hard work was cut away. My hair grew, BUT it didn&#x27;t matter. I had to trim it off and start again.&lt;br /&gt;  I would recommend doing intense deep conditioning if you try this product. That might have helped me a lot. I&#x27;m going to try other alternatives. Who knows, I may end up giving FAST another try. This time, however, I will learn from my mistakes! :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this about 2 months ago and my hair has really grown! I&#x27;ve been on a medication that seemed to have really slowed down my hair growth. It usually would grow about 3/4 of an inch a month but since I started taking the medication it slowed to about 1/4 of an inch. I was really nervous about purchasing FAST but I&#x27;m so glad I did! My hair seems to be growing faster in certain areas BUT, overall, it has grown more than 2 inches! I know some people were complaining about it drying out their hair, but before I blow dry my hair, while it&#x27;s still wet, I use Beyond the Zone Smooth Criminal Blow Out Balm ($7.50 at Sally&#x27;s) and my hair feels incredibly soft! I&#x27;ve dyed my hair for 15 years, bleached, stripped, highlighted... It was feeling really dry and brittle and NOW it&#x27;s as soft as a feather! So IF FAST does dry out your hair, try adding that balm! I&#x27;ve been telling everyone about this shampoo and conditioner I just hope I can afford to buy more soon!</li>
            <li> I love this product. This is my second order so far. It really works, i can only speak for the mix girls but my friend and i have been using this product for the past two weeks and my hair has already grown 3 inches by washing my hair everyday. It hasnt change the texture of my hair nor has any breakage has occured. this product is a must have for me knowing that when i use it my hair is getting longer and longer.</li>
            <li> I have seen a huge improvement from this product. I recommend this flr those who have a hard time with growing out their hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping it would grow my hair out super fast like some people clamed it would. I have been using this for two weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any huge change to my hair growth yet.  I will continue until the bottles are gone because I know these sort of things don&#x27;t happen overnight like some of the other reviews I read stating that there hair grew an inch in a month and all that... Other then not waking up with Rapunzel like hair this product makes my hair feel very soft and doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as other people say it does. &amp;#34;then again I didn&#x27;t buy it for the smell&amp;#34; It smells like most shampoo that doesn&#x27;t have perfume in it. It most defiantly didn&#x27;t dry my hair out *I use the conditioner also*  my hair is color treated and I do put permanent straighteners on it so my hair was pretty dry to start with. Surprisingly it conditions really well!! All in all I would recommend this product because even if it doesn&#x27;t make my hair grow faster it made it a lot healthier witch in the long wrong will stop my hair from breaking off therefore making it longer :)</li>
            <li> I have very slow growing hair as it is. The product smells wonderful, but I have fine hair and it often made my hair frizzy. I noticed no extra growth more than normal. I bought this after a disastrous decision of going from shoulder length to a pixie cut and wanted it grown out asap! But all I got was shampoo and conditioner that really made no difference other than the need to use more product afterwards to tame the frizz. :( I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> As soon as I got  it the next day I started using it.  I didn&#x27;t see much of a diference in lenght in the first few weeks but what I did see was that my hair was really shiny and silky, but not oily, ,my sister even notices and even my friends.  So I stoped cheking my hair lenght until it was the end of the month.  Reviews said it would grow 1inch in 1 month and it worked.  I would every day and not really deep condition it like other people would.  When I ordered it on monday It came like at the end of the week and I was really excited.  But as soon as the month ended I stoped buying it because it was to much money I would have to be spending and I believed it was like $30 at that time.  But overall it was a really good product and hope to purchase it againg for the same price or a little  bit cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have been  using this shampoo for a month-so far so good. My hair is an inch longer. I ordered one more shampoo but skipped the conditioner-it doesn&#x27;t do much.&lt;br /&gt;I am using stronger conditioner.</li>
            <li> We bought this for months and it did speed up my daughters hair growth. We were very pleased.</li>
            <li> Its almost 4 years later and im still using these same bottles. Great value, although it will dry your hair out. It helps stimulate growth. Recommend that you use extra conditioners though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product three times - everyday for three days - and my roots have started showing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have light brown hair but dye it blonde, I dyed it three days before I started using Fast, and usually it takes two to three weeks for my roots to start showing noticeably but I&#x27;m amazed! In just three days you can see my hair has grown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ends were very dry the first two times I washed so what I&#x27;ve started doing is apply thick cheap conditioner to my ends BEFORE I shampoo so while I lather my scalp, my ends are protected from the shampoo that slides down my hair. Worked 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update after I&#x27;ve used it for a month, but so far I&#x27;m super pleased. I use it as instructed: every day, shampoo, massage, rinse, repeat shampoo, massage, rinse, condition, leave in for a few minutes, rinse. Follow the instructions, guys!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 weeks and I only use it every other day. I can definitely tell my hair is growing so that&#x27;s great! It is dried out a bit but I avoid hair dryers and give my hair a day to \\&quot;rest\\&quot; and regain natural oils so it isn&#x27;t too bad. The smell reminds me of a beauty salon but its not bad. I would recommend it for \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair types. I also take a multi vitamin and drink lots of H2O. Good luck ladies/gents.</li>
            <li> I have now used this product for one month. As stated in other reviews the product lasted me exactly a month. My hair has become a bit more healthier and has grown about .75 of an inch. It used to grow less then .25 a month! So that&#x27;s an improvement! Over a year ago i got a perm, this damaged my hair tremendously. So I&#x27;m trying to grow out my hair to cut off the ends of my damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again. I&#x27;m trying out different products. I&#x27;ve now started using this Lee Stafford Hair growth shampoo, treatment, and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Products Also Used Durring this use of this product: Jamaican Black Castor Oil and Chi Infra Shampoo</li>
            <li> Stupid...why did I buy it?</li>
            <li> Okay, I was a bit skeptical when I saw this. Hair growth 40% only using shampoo? No way. So I started looking up reviews and things, and it intrigued my curiosity, so I decided to try. I used the shampoo the first day, and I scrubbed it in my scalp with a boar hair brush, and after my hair was dried, (notice she had no idea I had received this shampoo yet) my mom commented on my hair saying it was growing. And after my third use, my hair has grown maybe an inch! This is amazing stuff! You HAVE to try it! Thank you Nisim!</li>
            <li> I used to have waist length, super thick, straight blonde hair. For some dumb reason I decided to cut it into this very short hair style where the back was buzzed and the front was about chin-length. I let it grow for some time naturally and it just wasn&#x27;t growing at the same rate it used to. After I started using this stuff my hair has grown 2 inches since the week before new years. I measured it by my \\&quot;dye line\\&quot;. I dyed it a lighter color a few days before I started using FAST so I can see the darker hair thats grown in so far. The downside is that it is VERY drying. I use a L&#x27;oreal hair mask every time I wash it to keep my scalp from aching. I love my results so far, hopefully it keeps up in the future!</li>
            <li> After a bleaching mishap, I lost quite a bit of hair that broke off about 1\\&quot; from my roots so needless to say I was in dire need of fast growth.  I had already been taking biotin before this so I continued to do that and used this shampoo and conditioner every time I washed my hair for a full month.  Being that I dye my hair, it is easy to see the growth line at the root.  I don&#x27;t even think my hair grew the 1/2\\&quot; that is \\&quot;average\\&quot; to most people.  Looks to me more like 1/4\\&quot; based on the line I see.  Very disappointed.  The shampoo and conditioner are ok and I will continue to use it up but I can&#x27;t say it helped with hair growth in any way.  For the price, I&#x27;d prefer to use other brands.  I see it works for some.  I guess I will keep taking my biotin and hoping for the best.</li>
            <li> My hair felt soft and it was shiny, an the best part my hair grew 1 1/2 inch in a month. It says what it does :) and it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> It was alright. Noticed a difference after a week then had some breakage but hair felt soft&#x27; other than breakage it was great. loved it will buy again</li>
            <li> I recently transitioned from permed to &amp;#34;natural hair. And being a woman of color I wanted to find products to maximize my natural hair growth. Seeing the online reviews for FAST, I decided to give it a try. I hate that I wasted my money. The product did ship on time, however, You must wash your hair with this product every day :( Then on top of that, the shampoo dried my hair out and made it feel hard and brittle. The conditioner made it a little softer, but it basically matted my hair and made it very tangled and difficult to manage. I had high hopes but was let down....  the only positive thing is that it has a pretty nice smell...lol I didnt even get through half the bottle!!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work but it smells kinda good?&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know maybe its just my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Vietnamese with wavy thick hair so yeah.</li>
            <li> this hair product has a bad smell to it and it also does not work! it dryed out my hair! i will never use it again! i really think that whats in the bottle is not whats on the label! it made my hair worse not better like i thought it would! i think this is a fake hair product!</li>
            <li> Just as described and will purchase from again! :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product 3 weeks, give or take.  It works.  I have baby hairs growing at a fairly rapid rate.  Overall length probably about an inch.  It has dried my hair even with me adding on a spritz leave in conditioner.  About every 3rd wash, I use my &#x27;other&#x27; shampoo.  I do plan to buy again though.  4 stars only due to the dryness.  I have not experienced the hair loss as others commented.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my niece and she loved it! I highly recommend this to anyone! It&#x27;s a much better product than you can buy at your local hair salon!</li>
            <li> I big chopped on Dec. 20th 2013 and started using this shampoo &amp; conditioner on Dec. 23th 2013. My hair was 3inches, 3 weeks later I measured my hair and it was 5inches!!!! It does make my hair dry after so I use my Mixed Chicks leave in. I washed and conditioned my hair everyday. I ran out after one month, it&#x27;s been about two weeks since I haven&#x27;t been washing my hair with this shampoo, and my hair hasn&#x27;t grown at all since then. I just ordered some more and I can&#x27;t wait to get back to my hair growth journey!</li>
            <li> Not good, it doesn&#x27;t made my hair grow faster and leave it really dry</li>
            <li> My hair has grown considerably and I have any used half the product so far.  I will be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my son.... he&#x27;s under 20 and stress is giving him a hard time with he&#x27;s hair.... so far it&#x27;s the first bottle and it wont be the last one.... you can tell ... hair is coming back to normal and more.... thank you</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice shampoo but it doesn&#x27;t really seem to make your hair grow any faster than normal. By the way my parents are Jamaican and Indian (from India Indian not native american) so my hair is very fine.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a little over a month so it&#x27;s hard to tell how fast my hair has grown. Other reviews claimed the product dried their hair out... I find the exact opposite. My hair is very soft and seems healthier and for this reason I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I got this last week I have washed my hair three times sometimes more with it.&lt;br /&gt;I have switched up to this only so it works, so far nothing dramatic at all. It does smell&lt;br /&gt;great, makes my hair feel healthy, shiny, tangle free, but length? Not too sure. I won&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;suggest it just yet...I will send another review in maybe a month or when there&#x27;s a change!</li>
            <li> Saw slight-to-No improvement to hair loss and No hair growth</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once so far, but it was amazing. it felt a little dry while i was in the shower, which worried me. I did not want to have to use twice as much conditioner. However, after leaving it in for a few minutes, and rinsing it out, i dried and styled my hair and it was so smooth and healthy already!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product directly off of the Nisim Canada website, and once my order was placed it took two days for delivery. I have used it twice so far and I have already noticed a few amazing changes in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let me indicate that my hair is moderately frizzy, flat and considerably thin due to bleaching. Also, no matter what I do I seem to get a layer of build-up on my scalp which really annoys me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the FAST shampoo as instructed, lathering, rinsing and then repeating. It foams up very nicely and I think it smells very nice. The shampoo does dry out your hair, but the purpose of the conditioner is to complement the effects of the shampoo. I keep the conditioner in for around three minutes and then rinse it out. I  blow dry my hair sometimes but lately I have given it time to air dry. From the roots, I have noticed that there is considerably less build-up on my scalp, and there is definitely much more volume to my hair. I have noticed less hair coming out when I brush it. Also, my hair feels more manageable and it is very silky and smooth. Love it, and I can&#x27;t wait for my hair to start growing!</li>
            <li> Using it now going on a week. Makes your hair so healthy looking! Feels so soft!!! Will write more on the growth in about six weeks! Love it so far!!</li>
            <li> So far I have had good observed results using the conditioner and shampoo. I have had almost no additional hair fall out and my scalp has stopped itching. The shampoo leaves my hair and scalp oil-free( I had an itchy, oily scalp before ), more manageable, and pleasant smelling. I still have to wait and see if more hair grows out and if existing hair grows as promised. So far so good, and I am also very pleased with product and am going to stick to it to observe results. I also bought Nissim hair loss shampoo that fights DHT, I have ordered it and am waiting for its delivery. I am hoping that this complete package formula will do the trick!!! I am highly recommending this product so far...</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle and I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the speed of hair growth. The only thing I did notice was it made my head breakout in little pimple things on my head. It was pretty gross. I never had that happen before. As soon as I stopped using it they stopped appearing. I think I&#x27;ll just stick with Biotin for hair growth.</li>
            <li> I RATED THIS PRODUCT A 2 BECAUSE IT DOES NOT WORK AND I WOULD NOT  WANT YOU TO SPEND YOUR MONEY ON IT!!.I DID NOT GIVE IT A 1 STAR BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES CLEAN YOUR HAIR AS ANY NORMAL SHAMPOO WOULD AND THE CONDITIONER WORKS OUT YOUR TANGLES. BUT AS FAR AS PAYING AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE TO FOR IT ,ITS NOT WORTH IT! VO5 SHAMPOO WORKS BETTER AND IS 95% CHEAPER AS THIS PRODUCT REALLY DOES NOT MAKE YOUR HAIR GROW!</li>
            <li> So when I first heard about this product I did not believe that it would work at all. I went on youtube and found a lot of reviews that said that this product would work. I am very happy that brought FAST because with in a week my hair actually grew and I was shocked. Not only did my hair grow there was also less hair loss in the shower. As a African- American Women who had the hardest time growing out my hair this product really helped.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this. After the first couple of times I thought it was alright. I even ordered it again because I wanted my hair to grow.  I wish I waited. After using this for about a week it dried my hair out so bad every time I used it.  I really wanted to like this stuff</li>
            <li> Not real sure about this shampoo and conditioner!?? I gave it three stars but really not sure if it worked! I really do believe it did really help hair growth at the beginning-- started using it! Maybe it worked because it makes the hair healthier!?!?!?</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It smells pretty good.  I do notice it is a bit drying, so I tend to use a deep conditioner a few times a week with it.  My hair feels like it has grown faster since I have been using it (about 2 months) but I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic results like some of the reviews talked about. My hair tends to grow faster in the summer months, so it is hard to say if it&#x27;s the shampoo or the weather that is making my hair grow.</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well. I will continue to buy the product line.&lt;br /&gt;I can see a change in my hair growth</li>
            <li> So I read reveiws on this product til I went cross-eyed...after all the raves I decided to take the plunge. Amazon definitely has the best pricing for this product but for me it is not worth the money. I used it for a month straight and all the negatives that people claimed like dry scalp, color stripping and foul smell did not come to pass for me. I actually purposely colored my hair so I can better document growth and my color stayed as vibrant as day one. The smell was nothing impressive but still fresh and clean (guess everyones pheramones are diff and thats the smell you&#x27;ll get)...and my oily scalp did not dry out even with me washing every day...after shampooing hair is a bit rough but the conditioner solves that problem instantly...I did also do deep conditioning once a week as I was not only trying to grow my hair but keep it healthy to speed up results. I def got about half a milimeter if that. I understand that hair growth is slow but mine has been stunted for over two years due to lack of care. I have semi thick, super wavey coarse hair. I started taking pre-natal vitamins and biotin and got a whole inch and a half in about two months...so I say save your money and go over to GNC.</li>
            <li> I just started using the shampoo and conditioner about 3 weeks ago and I THINK I can see a difference in length. It has grown about what I expected to do and I am very pleased with that. Like some other reviews have mentioned, it does dry out my hair. I am used to using very thick conditioners that really coat my hair (even though I am sure that&#x27;s unhealthy) and this conditioner is rather thin so I am finding myself running out of it a lot faster than the shampoo. Because it does dry out my hair so much it takes me a while to untangle the mess after a shower. I&#x27;ve been spraying it with Aussie leave in conditioner to put some moisture back in and it&#x27;s been fine. The smell is okay. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if I was looking for an amazing smelling hair product but surprisingly my boyfriend loves the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on purchasing this product again because it does appear to be helping my hair grow faster than usual...as long as I have my Aussie leave in conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for just a couple weeks now and my hair has already grown about a quarter inch. Not too bad, but I&#x27;m wanting to go from really short hair to just about shoulder length.  This is gonna take some time.  The product seems to be doing what it says it will do though.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome at making your hair healthy. I do believe that it works but you must follow the directions and keep your hair trimmed... I do not believe that you will wake up with a headfull of long flowing hair overnight or in a week. It is full of vitamins to help your scalp become healthy with massaging it and the this helps your hair grow. Try not to use another type of S n C while using this. I liked it!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hair is complemented by everyone ..&lt;br /&gt;excellent shine, thickness, gorgeous all around. Highly recommended for healthy look. Bammm</li>
            <li> My hair is growing fast but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really growing fastER than usual. This product does dry out your hair so make sure you use a leave in conditioner afterwards. I am African American and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend washing your hair every day. I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair appears strong and I don&#x27;t have to get my hair trimmed as often but that could be because I chopped most of my hair off due to damaged before I started using this product. I might buy again but I am looking at other alternatives.</li>
            <li> It is hard to tell after only a month&#x27;s use of this product but I do think that it has improved my hair growth some. I am going to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on this product and heard how it was drying to some people&#x27;s hair, but everyone is different.  For me, it was a disaster.  I generally wear my hair in flat twists.  When I recieved the products I took my hair down for shampooing and conditioning.  I only shampooed my hair twice, but I had to condition it twice, and deep condition it three times and my hair was still matted, and dry...so I had to let it dry like that...and start taking the tangles out...it took me SIX hours...I was so tired, and I still had to finish styling my hair.  I will never, never use this product again.  I brought it because of a upcoming wedding, but I will have to use other alternatives.  Anyone who has coily, curly hair, I would not recommend purchasing this product, because my hair is naturally coily, and it was a mess to detangle.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to speed the growth of my hair. I wish now that I would have left nature alone. This product made my hair so dry, thin, and lots of breakage. I have to get my hair cut super short! I&#x27;m so sad and mad about it all. I so wish I would have known this would happen.</li>
            <li> I purcahsed this package back in August the first time i used to it really enjoyed how soft and silky my hair was. I used it everyday up until the end of October. The package began to dry my hair out and make it frizzy, though it DID make my hair grow! i noticed about a half to three quarters of an inch of hair growth ( for myself that was a miracle). I cut my hair off a couple years ago and it still has not since then gotten long or grown past my shoulders... I also wasn&#x27;t too comfortable with the amount of chemicals and sulfates in the shampoo, i have heavily processed hair and were looking for something to treat and make healthier. Nisim FAST just didn&#x27;t do it for me, it was a good shampoo and does help hair growth but just has too many chemicals in it. I have gone a more clean and pure way and am now using Renpure 14 day keratin treatment shampoo and conditioner. the smell is great and naturally is straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> this stuff honestly is not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I used it til it was gone and my hair grew maybe an inch.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it did make my hair stronger and i felt a difference HOWEVER if you are buying this product for hair growth, don&#x27;t bother.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try Nioxin instead because I heard that stuff works very very well.&lt;br /&gt;I would also recommend vitamins!! I&#x27;m taking ultra mega hair and skin vitamins from GNC and I&#x27;ve already noticed my nails and hair are both longer!!</li>
            <li> So I am a Black American woman and I wanted to try this basically because I have heard mixed reviews. First of all, there is a misconception that black women hair do not grow as fast as non-blacks. That&#x27;s false.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I measured my hair before I started using this product and I bought this some time in April 2013. Before I started using this product, I did not have a relaxer for 6 months. When I measured my hair from roots to the end of my new growth, I had 3 full inches of new hair growth. (that&#x27;s the typical average hair growth for women 1/2 or 0.5 each month giving me 3 inches for 6 months) Then I measured the relaxed part of my hair and it was at about 9 inches. So all together, I was at 12 inches. (please note that my hair is uneven all the way around and I was measuring the middle of my head which is the longest part of my hair. I once had a bob hair cut, and then my hair kept breaking off)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a black woman, there is a few tricks that you need to know when using this product. First of all, you only want to really wash your scalp when using this product. If you wash your whole head with this product, your hair will feel very brittle (and I actually think this goes for non-blacks as well). This is because it is stripping the moisture from your hair and other things like product build up. So what I do is only wash my scalp with this shampoo and then rinse. I only do it once even though the bottle says to wash twice. I don&#x27;t feel the need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When washing, section your hair as if you are doing a relaxer doing this into four sections. This will insure that you are applying the product on your scalp really good. Massage it in really good and then rinse it all out. Then saturate your hair with the conditioner from scalp to ends. You will need another bottle of conditioner depending on how long your hair is. I had to buy a second bottle while doing this 30 day trail. Also, for the first go round, I was also using this in combinationof my favorite conditioners (Suave and VO5) one or the other is good. Leave the FAST conditioner on for about 2 or more minutes and then rinse. Then use a more moisturized conditioner that works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think put my hair in a protective style (a ponytail) using my Shea Moisture and Ampro Gel (aka black gel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, my hair did grow and it happened within the first two weeks of using this product. I was washing my hair everyday doing this routine. I was at 3 inches of new growth on April 9, 2013 and two weeks later (April 23, 2013), I was at 4 inches of new growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the two weeks, I messed up my routine because I ran out of conditioner so I could not continue as I did the first two week. When I got my new bottle of conditioner, I began the routine again but this only lasted me about 8 or 9 days. So at the end of the 30 days (May 9, 2013), I was a little less than 4 1/2 of new growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing this routine really helped my hair grow fast with this product. My hair texture is more of a &#x27;Z&#x27; pattern than it is an &#x27;S&#x27; pattern. I would say that my hair is a 4Bish. The thickness of my strands of hair is medium (2 on a 1-3 scale). It&#x27;s really hard to describe my hair texture as I am not a pro in figuring it out. But hopefully you get the idea. I am Black mixed with American, lol. Just about every Black woman in America is mixed (because of slavery) unless, they just got off the plane from Africa with natural 4C hair. So therefore, I am the typical Black American woman with thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, since I did not continue the routine that I was so dedicated to while on the 30 day trial, my hair did break off about 1 inch. So now I am back to 12 inches in the middle of my head. (but my hair still looks a little longer because the back of my head is catching up.) This is why many people believe that black women hair do not grow. Our hair break off a lot once you start to neglect it. So I am back to the routine and trying to stick with it. Since I am pregnant, I will be waiting until I deliver my baby to start my hair growth vitamins with this product to help keep my hair healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the long review, but I&#x27;ve notice that a lot of black women wanted to know if this product really work for them. My hair is not fully relaxed, it is in the transitioning stage because of my pregnancy which will be ending July 4th 2013. I will not relax my hair until July 2014 (maybe, because of breastfeeding).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck ladies with this product. If you are a black woman, do not be afraid to wash your hair everyday to get the best results from this product. I&#x27;ve seen another black woman do it every other day as well and she got a full inch at the end of 28 days. She washed her hair while having twists in her hair. I forgot her name, but she is on youtube.</li>
            <li> This product totally changed my hair. My hair was broken and damaged from bleaching it. After a few weeks I noticed it was healthier and growing faster. I&#x27;d totally recommend this product. I&#x27;m thrill with the results.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner, not really sure if my hair is growing faster but it smell good in my opinion, but I think the bottle sizes should be bigger because I use a lot at one time.</li>
            <li> I love the f.a.s.t. shampoo for helping with hair growth, and use it every other shampoo to supplement my biotin regimen.  However, the conditioner is so heavy that even a dab will make your hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> I kept loosing hair and i really got scared. Also i wanted to grow out a bad haircut.&lt;br /&gt;So i used two of this packs and - tadaaaa - my hair grew really fast, got thick and healthy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it´s too expensive to use it now, but if i ever need my hair to grow faster again, i will definitely purchase this shampoo &amp; conditioner again!</li>
            <li> I found this product on here on amazon and within a few days of using it my daughter thats&lt;br /&gt;22 couldn&#x27;t believe the way my hair looked and felt, now we both don&#x27;t want to be with out it..love it a lot..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Amazon.com i shop here for everything...</li>
            <li> I adore this product. I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair out for over a year with no results; like seriously - almost NO growth no matter what I did. I&#x27;ve tried tons of advertised hair growth shampoos n the like from brands like Garnier and Pantene. Honestly, this is the best shampoo ever. I love the way it smells while I&#x27;m using it; the way my hair smells afterwards. This shampoo has just restored softness and health to my hair all around on top of actually helping it grow faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone wants to ask me more about this product before considering buying it; please do! I am by no means just fluffing up this page for sales. I truly adore F.A.S.T. shampoo and conditioner and recommend it whole-heartedly!</li>
            <li> just used this shampoo and conditioner combo for the first time today and my hair is very soft and there wasn&#x27;t as much breakage as there usually is. i can&#x27;t say too much about how much my hair grew since i just started today, but i will continue using this just because of how healthy my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair type 3b-c, so you know what  this means; dry hair, easy to break, very hard to grow long. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 months and I got ~3 inches. My hair looks healthy, hydrated and with volume.  Now, If your hair is like mine, Fast shampoo will dry out your hair( using FAST conditioner don&#x27;t help). However this is a problem VERY EASY to solve applying  conditioners and deep treatments for you type of hair(DON&#x27;T use oil treatment on your scalp. According with them is deactivate the  active compound in the shampoo). This shampoo will only provide the fast growth, you need to complement it with conditioners to keep your hair healthy. Yes, I&#x27;m washing my hair every day, and I&#x27;m not having any problem, hair lost or breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It was okay. I don&#x27;t feel like my hair was growing any faster when I was using this consistently. As far as a shampoo and conditioner it was fine. I read some people didn&#x27;t like the smell, I thought the smell was fine.</li>
            <li> i noticed a difference, but the smell was awful</li>
            <li> did nothing for me. my hair did not grow any longer than usual, it smells bad, and left my hair feeling very dry and lifeless.</li>
            <li> To start off with I am white with coarse wavy hair BSL length. After using this shampoo/condtioner for one month it made me break out along my hairline and caused my ahir to become very brittle and poofy-my hair barely grew half an inch. The only reason it gets two stars is because of the smell; other than that I would not recommend this to a friend and will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> It made my hair grow three inches in a little over a month. It smells like a normal shampoo and doesn&#x27;t really do anything other than make your hair grow fast.</li>
            <li> My daughter begged for this after a requested &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34;, resulted in about 7 inches being cut off her hair. She was 15 and her world crumbled! Anyway, she was please with the product and seemed to think it did make her hair grow back faster. I know her hair looks great. I don&#x27;t know for sure if it grew any faster than it would have with any other product. But getting it for her assuaged her despair!&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it hadn&#x27;t been so expensive.</li>
            <li> bought these for myslef and my daughter after reading about them online. Not sure if they truley worked or not, but is still a great shampoo and conditioner. My daughter though it did, i am sitll unsure.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing so much faster! Will always use this shampoo and would HIGHLY recommend it! Great product and worth the price! I am going to buy a big bottle next time :)</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel brittle and dry and noticed nothing different. Over priced and under whelming and I&#x27;ve tried everything/</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to give it a try, even there&#x27;s a lot of bad reviews on the website.  I didn&#x27;t care because I know some people will exaggerate on the bad reviews. All products will works depends on the health conditions, food and other stuff.  All I can say I tried for 1 months and I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore. Hair loss was too much, price was little expensive... The only reason Im giving 2 stars it was because the CLEAN smell, no more than that, but like I said it didn&#x27;t work for me, maybe, other people will said IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from my best friend. I hadn&#x27;t heard anything about this shampoo before receiving it. When I started using this, my hair was around the middle of my back. My hair growth was at a stand still, I couldn&#x27;t get it past that length. I started using this (as well as 3 minute miracle by Aussie) every time I washed my hair. It&#x27;s grown about a inch.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend washing your hair everyday, not with this either (can be drying if you dont also condition it), if its not greasy it&#x27;s still clean. I wash my hair about every 3 days, and it&#x27;s very healthy and thick. Hair growth is at the scalp so focus your efforts up top!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Works! 1 inch of growth in a month!&lt;br /&gt;Gets my hair squeaky clean!&lt;br /&gt;Luxurious lather!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I think it smells like a science lab or something crazy&lt;br /&gt;Not miracle grow for you hair :( 2 inches a month? 3? I wish!</li>
            <li> I am glad I read the review that stated it strips the color out of color-treated hair. I had a big night coming up and didn&#x27;t want to lose latest wash-in color, so I waited to use it. It definitely takes out the color. I have been using it for about 3 weeks, and use it every other day because it tends to make my hair flat, but I do see a difference in the growth. Happy!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner because i had to cut my hair because of chemical damage more than 5 months ago. Since then, my hair had only grown about 2 1/2 inches. Since I started using NISIM my hair feels healthier and i have noticed some growth in just one month. I read some reviews and most of them said that it dried out their hair, not mines. Nisim leaves my hair soft, i just leave the conditioner on for about 3 minutes. So far I&#x27;m loving this product, my mother has started using it too and she absolutely loves it. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and believe it does help my hair grow faster plus it looks healthier than it had in the past 5 months.</li>
            <li> After bleaching my hair for a few months my hair became really damages. It looked terrible. I decided to chop off all the dead. My hair was shoulder length and after I cut it-it was almost pixie short. I&lt;br /&gt;Proceeded to darken it allow my hair to become healthy again. I saw this shampoo and read the reviews. I liked what I saw and decided to give it a&lt;br /&gt;Try. I noticed the first wash that my scalp looked healthy so I kept using it. Well, it&#x27;s been a week and I have to say I have grown a good length just by looking at the roots. My only complaint with this shampoo is it really dries the hair out, I mean, it REALLY dries it out and on top of it all it strips your hair color (if you dye your hair). I give it 3 stars because my hair has grown quickly, but I might have to&lt;br /&gt;Cut my hair again because it&#x27;s so dry. I stopped using the conditioner and i decided to wash it every other day. I hope it helps because it really did clear up my scalp.</li>
            <li> never really noticed a difference with this stuff. I&#x27;d recommend taking some vitamins or talking to your doctor if you have trouble with hair growth. We tried this for my elderly mother and didn&#x27;t really notice a difference on her. The smell was okay, not offensive and not really strong either. Mostly she just complained that the conditioner made her hair feel a bit greasy afterwards.</li>
            <li> I got a Nightmare bang cut... my bangs r now down to my eyebrows...</li>
            <li> This product definitely works I have ordered it several times and never have I been disappointed with the results. I will be ordering this product again right now my hair is above my bra strap so I cant wait to see my progress. I also found that this product works well with maxi hair plus hair vitamins.</li>
            <li> For the price - I expected a pretty decent combo! Totally disappointed. The shampoo made my hair incredibly tangled. It felt nasty after rinsing. Also, I noticed A TON of hair loss with this product. Literally 4-5 times more than usual. People may say, \\&quot;Oh you&#x27;re loosing hair because you are getting new growth\\&quot; -- yeah, no thanks! I don&#x27;t want all my long hair clumping out for a few new short strands. Overall - never again. I didn&#x27;t even finish the bottles. Waste!&lt;br /&gt;Namaste</li>
            <li> I bought this product not sure of how well it would work but I got a horrendous haircut and was desperate for my hair to grow as fast as possible. I used this for about three weeks and when I started I wouldn&#x27;t even wear my hair down let alone let it naturally air dry and be fine (I hated how poufy and short it looked) but then I used this and it grew so fast and now it&#x27;s almost back to it&#x27;s original length. I swear it grew at least two inches in three weeks at least. This product is magic i dont know how it works but it does - i barely used other conditioners with it and had no negative side effects. Wouldn&#x27;t say my hair felt softer but it stayed normal, smelled good and grew fast. When I did use aussie 3 minute repair conditioner however the results were even better. This product is a godsend and I just ordered more to keep it growing. DEFINITELY recommend!!</li>
            <li> Alright so I read many reviews before purchasing. Some were good some weren&#x27;t. It seemed like the people who were of other origin got bad result and Caucasians were fine. I rated this 4 because I just used it for the first time so haven&#x27;t seen change in length but it does make my stronger and healthier and shiny. I would definitely recommend this plus has flowery smell I recommend it to my inlaw she is also trying to grow out her hair</li>
            <li> I have used the product for 1 months i havent seen a big difference but i like it so far</li>
            <li> March 23rd: I just got it, and it arrived earlier than expected. I&#x27;ll update this weekly or something, and I just came out of the shower after using it once so far and I do personally like the smell, but its nothing out of the ordinary, and honestly the ingredients do seem bad, but I just am going to take a chance and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and can really tell a difference with the way my hair feels silkier, smoother, and it really has grown!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff, ordering more! It makes my hair really soft and I can start to see changes in the length</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black so I barely used this. This shampoo really cleanses hair really well. I could barely keep up with my hair growth with this product so :/...use ManeChoice</li>
            <li> I like it and it works however it can dry out your hair if your not careful. When I was using this product I would always use a leave in conditioner after. I also do not like the smell of this product. Fast works well where it supposed to it does make hair grow faster but there is no over night  miracle cream. So give it time so see  your hair growth improve .</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, noticed a huge difference! There is a thick substance that covers your hair (is the best way I can think to describe it) when you shampoo and condition with this which actually increases the diameter of the hair follicle! pretty crazy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started shedding insane amounts of hair at a very young age cause I have very curly, frizzy, unruly hair but styled right with good product (by professionals that never give me the secret products they use..sigh!)it always been glamorous and shiny but then as soon as I would wash it... bam! problems again. So I was afraid that by the time I made it to forty I would be bald completely because of the dryness and breakage but also overheating with flat irons and blow-dryers which I have to do every single time I wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyways I came to Amazon two months ago determined to find a solution to losing so much hair, and also it stops growing when it gets to a little below my shoulders. In addition, it would interest you to know that every single time before using this, I would run my fingers through my hair atleast 8-10 follicles would come off.. Every single time!! Also my drain after every shower would be full of hair.. enough to clog it! Yup that&#x27;s how bad! All of that stopped after the very first use! The hair gets kind of unbreakable! It has just stopped coming out of my head.. Now when I run a brush or comb or my fingers through it, one might come out. Thats it. Also your hair starts having a fuller look but every single hair will be coated with something thick or just repaired whatever the process it does.. it does it right away.. that&#x27;s the good news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will let you know two things though. One, it does not make your hair any softer so don&#x27;t expect silkiness as a result of using this which I did.. don&#x27;t really know why I did but didn&#x27;t happen.. but that&#x27;s perfectly fine. Secondly, I have only used it for 5-6 weeks and can not really say how much longer it has grown.. itlooks like a little but I didn&#x27;t measure it down to the last inch before using it. Plus I had an area of thinning hair that is completely unaffected.. so it doesn&#x27;t necessarily simulate hair growth but just makes existing hair stronger. Hope it helps! It really has been heaven sent for shedding hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted longer hair in faster time. I think it works really well! My hair has been getting longer. I will definitely be purchasing it again!</li>
            <li> This product is good, I just got it, my first time using it, when i rinsed out the shampoo my hair felt a little dry, but very very. Thje conditoner adds the moisture back into you hair. Leaving soft &amp; tangle free, with a great scent. I just used it today, but I will update when I have used the whole bottle, &amp; in that review I will leave the result, whether or whether not this product produces hair growth.</li>
            <li> Who ever buy&#x27;s this product, it works. My hair has grown about 5 inches in about 3 months. I kid you not... try it and you will see what I mean... Very pleased with FAST!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after a horrible cut. The only change I did see was how soft it left my hair. I am a latin female with thick, wavy, &amp; colored hair. And it needs to be dried and/or straighten to look decent... I DID NOT use it everyday. But soon after I washed it I would blow dry it &amp; it was amazingly tame-able. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again only because I did not see any new growth within 2 months of using it. But hey, we are all different....</li>
            <li> I went in to donate my usual 12 inches to Locks of Love and left having lost at least 16 inches of hair and sporting layers that looked like they had been cut with garden shears. What I had left didn&#x27;t even cover the back of my neck. Needless to say I was in tears and immediately began my search for a miracle cure.&lt;br /&gt;I began using this product about a month ago, and although I have not done any measurements I am happy with the results. I can now get most of my hair in some form of a ponytail (although it is a rather short one) and was even confident that I had enough length to get the layers repaired.&lt;br /&gt;My hair does feel dry after applying the shampoo so I would definitely recommend the conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it! Is it mind over matter? Who cares?! She loves it, so I love it as well.</li>
            <li> literally, my hair grew so fast. I think I grew my hair from my armpit length to my chest in 20 days. Those were good 6 inches. Then I cut the dead ends off that I had before about 3 inches. In less then another 20 days my hair grew more than before. I also really like the scent.</li>
            <li> No results but didn&#x27;t use the whole bottle</li>
            <li> I wanted to grow my hair out and I seem this on YouTube and thought I&#x27;d research it a bit. It sounded really good but maybe too good to be true. I bought this and started using the first week of January it&#x27;s now the end of February and my hair has grown at least two inches. I love this product it definitely works. It smells great so it doesn&#x27;t bother me as I have a sensitivity to smells. I will continue to buy this until my hair grows to the length I want but at the rate it&#x27;s growing I won&#x27;t have to use it for too much longer.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness. My hair was fried beyond belief. I even bleached twice in one month, so it was dead. As soon as I started using this, my hair felt healthier and within a few days, I saw progress. :)</li>
            <li> The product did exactly what it said it would do. My hair was always slow to grow and it has grown an inch in the 4 weeks I have been using the product. I&#x27;ll probably continue to use this product for a couple more months and then switch back to sulfate free shampoo! This shampoo kind of makes my hair coarse and dry, but I use Moroccan oil to help that! But I honestly I cannot wait to go back to no sulfate and organic shampoo but this stuff does the job! It worked for me!</li>
            <li> It seems like it&#x27;s working, but it hasn&#x27;t quite been a month yet, so I do want to continue this shampoo for a few more months!</li>
            <li> This product is great.  In just 1 month my hair has grown.  it is past my shoulder and continues to grow.  I recommend this product and back it up.</li>
            <li> Product made me lose hair and smelled bad. There was absolutely no positive difference from using the product. Very sad.</li>
            <li> good product. works great.</li>
            <li> A little about my hair: I have medium textured, wavy, normal-thick hair. I do not use ANY heat whatsoever in my efforts to help it grow as fast/healthy as possible. I do take hair, skin and nail vitamins from GNC and use professional grade leave-in conditioners and wash my hair with this product every OTHER day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review: I am a licensed hair stylist and I must say that this is an absolutely AMAZING shampoo!! It really does work!! I had a horrible undercut done in March and found this product last month and decided to give it a try.. BEST $25 dollars I could ever spend. I even made a shirt with one inch markings going down the back so I could keep track of the growth. When I first started, it was at 3 1/2.. 2 weeks later, it was at 4!! In just 7 washes, it grew 1/2\\&quot;. Absolutely unbelievable!! I was very skeptical just like anyone, but I&#x27;m telling you, it works!!  You will not regret getting this!! One tip though, some people said it feels like it dries out their hair, and I want to tell you if you use it correctly, and only apply the shampoo to your scalp DIRECTLY, and do NOT bring it through your ends, you will be just fine. It left my roots feeling very clean and oil-free; which is really great, especially during Summer. I do suggest investing in a quality leave-in conditioner for the extra moisture for your ends if you do like to use heat (and of course a heat protectant) to keep your hair as healthy as possible. :)&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product and I will be back for more when I run out.. I have a whole foot left to grow!! Good luck to you!! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this and used it every. single.day. It smells funny and I think it gave me more split ends than I had before, so I doubt it made my hair grow. Keep shopping, ladies.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown since I started using the product. It does have a little funky smell but it&#x27;s duable. It smells like a hair salon. I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair gets a little bit greasy the next day so I find myself washing my hair daily.</li>
            <li> Great price and product!</li>
            <li> This product lasted me two months. However, I didn&#x27;t notice any changes in my hair. My hair length was still the same. I guess it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
            <li> I only used for a week while I was waiting for Surface Awaken system- I did notice growth the only disappointment in that short time period was that it seemed to dry my hair. I will use again probably in between the expensive Surface awaken reorders. The FAST is much more affordable-- but I like the Surface better-- it left my hair soft and also seemed to work-- my co-workers were able to tell a difference when they had not seen me for a week.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had time to measure my hair to see if it really extend my hair lenghth , but one thing for sure about this shampoo is that it improves my hair quality A LOT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair feel like silk. and decrease my hair loss.  Worth a try!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to help hair grow noticeably faster and even using alot of conditioner it left my hair very tangled. Hair was however soft and shiny. Maybe if the bottles had lasted longer I would have noticed more of  a difference over more time. The bottles lasted about a month and a half.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt recommend this product to anyone who wants to grow their hair longer. THis makes your hair so rough and unmanageable. My hair lost its shine and vitality in one wash.</li>
            <li> I was super excited for this product, thinking it was going to be great for my hair and give it a boost in its hair growth. The directions say to use it everyday, which is unthinkable. You do not want to wash your hair everyday for it strips your hair of its natural oils. So from the start this product seemed sketchy. I used it every other day, and within 3 washes my hair was SO extremely dry it was disgusting. I&#x27;ve tried for so long to get my hair back to its healthy state and just by using this product it seemed like all my hard work was stripped away from my hair. The ends were so dry and crispy and my whole head of hair was so dry it felt fake. It looked dull, peices of hair stuck up everywhere, and it looked so damaged. Mind you I used the FAST conditioner on top of another conditioner of my own, and the oils I put into my hair on a regular basis. Even after conditioning my hair it felt so terrible. For me, an extra boost in my growing journey is NOT worth the dryness and damage your hair goes through for this product to work. Stick with vitamins, deep conditioning treatments, a good shampoo and conditioner, use oils (I use jajobaoil) and drink lots of water. That will get you much farther than this money sucking product.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month an a half after a cut my hair short. Unfortunately due to peer pressure I am growing it out again. Anyway, I used this product because I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily hair naturally, so bad I have to wash it every day. I see people mostly mentioning how it dries your hair out. It dries mine out enough that it actually looks nice and healthy, and it&#x27;s still nice looking the next day. Not usually it&#x27;s greasy mess when I wake up in the morning. So for me, this was actually beneficial. If you have dry hair or normal you will have issues with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say my hair grew about and inch within the first month. I am noticing it growing faster than usual. After reading reviews before I purchased the product I decided to measure too. Happy to report my hair is able to be pulled back into a little stump. When I chopped my hair off I couldn&#x27;t even grab a fist full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to mention that I am also taking 10mg of biotin everyday. This most likely is contributing to the growth. But it&#x27;s only fair I mention it because I am doing everything I can to get it long before vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works for me, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have stressed out for years about my hair not growing. It takes about 6 months for my hair to grow only 3/4 of an inch normally, but while using this shampoo and conditioner, my hair grew one inch in 2 months, which is CRAZY fast for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it recently because I died my hair, and it does tend to take out color. And also, it does dry out your hair a bit, but an extra conditioner, a hair mask at least once a week, and some leave in conditioner should keep your hair healthy, and definitely stay away from heat products as much as you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, YES, it does make your hair grow faster!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple weeks, so I&#x27;ll update with growth info later. But after reading a lot of reviews, I thought I&#x27;d describe some things:&lt;br /&gt;1) The smell. If you&#x27;ve ever used Pink brand hair lotion for ethnic hair, that has a very similar scent. It also kinda smells like old-school setting lotion (like an old lady beauty parlor).&lt;br /&gt;2)The dryness from the shampoo. Ever used a clarifying shampoo or a clear (no pearliness/creaminess)bodifying shampoo? This stuff gives you that kind of dryness. I have very thin, fine hair that lays down and dies if I use any moisturizing product on it, so I&#x27;m used to a \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; feel. If that&#x27;s not your bag, prolly you should thoroughly brush your hair before you wash it, and not rumple up your hair during the shampoo. Rub the product into your scalp and let it flow down the length.&lt;br /&gt;3) The inadequacy of the conditioner. It&#x27;s plenty conditioning for my picky hair, but I can see where other people would need to supplement it. I&#x27;d use the Fast conditioner on and near my scalp, and deep condition the middle-to-ends with whatever goo moves you.&lt;br /&gt;4) Alarming hair loss. In my opinon, this goes back to clarifying/clear volumizing shampoos. They keep your scalp cleaner. That&#x27;s less gunk keeping hair stuck, whereas moisturizing products build up and hold hair in longer. I haven&#x27;t noticed excessive loss, but if you use wussy shampoo/conditioner (just kidding), I could see being freaked at the amount of hair this product will \\&quot;liberate.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update with growth info when the results come in!</li>
