            <li>Was very pleased to find that I could use this eye cream and have no resulting redness or itching.  </li>

            <li>This eye cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>this cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and excellent product.  </li>
            <li>Reviva has many good products.</li>
            <li>Never irritating and best part is that you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li>Nice cream, blends in without oily feeling.</li>
            <li>This is a genuinely nice eye cream</li>
            <li>but it moisturizes nicely</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll purchase again, just to give it a fair shot, since I&#x27;ve heard great things about this product from family members, but this first purchase has been a bummer...</li>
            <li>Suitable for day or night as it&#x27;s not sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li>best I have used so far.....</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li>So far I am quite happy with it and will hope for good results as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this cream and it has already proven to be great.  </li>
            <li>This product is inexpensive, easy to apply and effective.  </li>
            <li>IT WORKS BETTER THAN ANYTHING I HAVE TRIED...</li>
            <li>I love this cream and you get a lot for your money.</li>
            <li>Most products like this tend to cause irritation, so that&#x27;s a plus</li>
            <li>Love this cream.</li>
            <li>Now I can say that works:-)</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>This is a good product that has left a great impression on me.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS Produet its not sticky when you put on my skin around my eyes</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have tried, especially for the money.  </li>
            <li>cool and effective for my eyebag..</li>
            <li>Lovely silkie texture is firming and reduces those fine lines.  </li>
            <li>It doesn’t really have a scent, which is good for users who suffer with sinusitis like myself and it moisturizes the skin as well.</li>
            <li>Happy to an eye cream that&#x27;s in a large size,, it is economical in use.</li>
            <li>This cream spreads smoothly and easily, it&#x27;s just a bit thinner than what I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth with no greasy feel.</li>
            <li>feels so soft and more toned !</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue using as this is an extremely good bargain at this price level.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad buy.</li>
            <li>Turned out to be a great product for my dark circles and also really the best moisturizer for my severely sun dried skin from work.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product due to the good reviews and the cheap price, but it is not working for me.</li>
            <li>I used to splurge on a MUCH more costly product, but this one performs as good as, if not better.</li>
            <li>The more watery eye creams are always less effective in my experience.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it contains no animal ingredients since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I really liked it and can definitely see results!</li>
            <li>I seem to be allergic to many eye creams, even those for sensitive skin; so this was a gamble that paid off.  </li>
            <li>Price was right but since it was ineffective, it was a wash for me.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, non-greasy cream that goes on easily and doesn’t feel too heavy after applied.</li>
            <li>Best for night time use, and definitely when you want to take preventative measures to keep skin firm as you age.</li>
            <li>But better than no eye cream at all :)  I just use Organic Raw Coconut Oil all over face now.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li>I am 54 and over the years I tried many different eye creams.</li>
            <li>Not oily and the under eye area feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t a great product, I just have to adjust a bit.</li>
            <li>compared to others, this leaves me with  a clean and Natural feeling.</li>
            <li>Very good!Keep moisturing a whole day !</li>
            <li>Looking less stressed and younger is always welcome.</li>
            <li>My eyes look more bright no more dark shadows.</li>
            <li>This eye cream really helps.  </li>
            <li>This is a very soothing cream that helps keep the skin around your eyes hydrated.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t attest to the usefulness of that, but it is very moisturizing and not irritating.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much for results.</li>
            <li>but this eye cream is incredibly gentle.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>use every day.. not a miracle cream but real close....</li>
            <li>The old one is more protective and you can feel that it moisturises your skin and make it more supple, but the current one burns a bit and doesn&#x27;t have the effects of the previous.</li>
            <li>no unknown ingredients, natural oils leaves your skin SILKY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>Dark circles mostly gone thanks to the product.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered this product, so I don&#x27;t have any basis for comparison, but I think I may have been shipped old, dried-out product...</li>
            <li>What I received was definitely not a &amp;#34;cream.&amp;#34; I opened the jar to find it about 1/4 full of an elastic ball of viscous goo.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin around my eyes very soft, and doesn&#x27;t take much of the cream.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive &amp; this is one cream that seems to keep it soft &amp; clear.</li>
            <li>It is very light and helps my sensitive eyes look less puffy or wrinkled in the morning.</li>
            <li>no problem with the cream agitating my skin - my eye makeup goes on easily and stays on fine - and a little bit of the cream goes a long way!</li>
            <li>It has natural ingredients and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The scent is very pleasing and natural.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that it gave my face a much smoother feel and no irritation at all.</li>
            <li>havent start using it,hope it would do the firm job ,what is interesting ,the expiration date was printed .....</li>
            <li>Updates: it seems they changed the formula, the one with Red Vine was much better than the current one, the color was translucent for the old one</li>
            <li>it goes on smoothly and leaves no residue like some other products.  </li>
            <li>I buy a new jar every 3 months or so.</li>
            <li>and this one by far is the least effective.</li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t really last too long, but it does appear to restore elasticity and smooth out some lines.</li>
            <li>This product does not cause any irritation and I actually use it as moisturizer for my whole face.</li>
            <li>works well so far</li>
            <li>It is a soft, non-greasy eye cream, and I hope it provides the moisture I need around my aging eye area.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, no remarkable notice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this one so far, but I could feel that it tightened my skin</li>
            <li>I used it for a few weeks but hot no results.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I am not sensitive to any of the ingredients...</li>
            <li> I bought this as an eye cream, but after my other brand face products keep giving me those little fat bumps(i guess my face is just sensitive to the chemicals), I tried this on.</li>
            <li> You can live with your imperfections, spend thousands of dollars for plastic surgery or use Reviva Eye Complex Firming Cream.  </li>

            <li> It does not irritate my skin like other creams and lasts for about 6 weeks if I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I took a small pinch of it and tried to apply it to the skin around my eyes, only to have it roll into a congealed little ball of the stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dark bags</li>
            <li> but I always notice the consistency is much less watery than the reviva brand.</li>

            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t really last too long, but it does appear to restore elasticity and smooth out some lines. You shouldn&#x27;t waste any product since it comes in a jar. It absorbs fairly well too. It&#x27;s not a bad buy.</li>
            <li> Just started using this, but I am always happy with Reviva products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have trouble with facial moisturizers bothering my eyes. This product does not cause any irritation and I actually use it as moisturizer for my whole face. I just add a little water to the small dab of cream, mix in my hands and then moisturize my face and neck.</li>
            <li> This has been one of the best products I have used to moisturize the eye area.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and excellent product.  Extra small for the price.</li>
            <li> use it at night to diminish crow&#x27;s feet...great product for the price</li>
            <li> Watery  and ineffective.  Will not buy again.  Gave it away.</li>
            <li> As good as or better than some $50 to $60 dollar eye creams I&#x27;ve used!  Reviva has many good products.</li>
            <li> no problem with the cream agitating my skin - my eye makeup goes on easily and stays on fine - and a little bit of the cream goes a long way!</li>
            <li> IT WORKS BETTER THAN ANYTHING I HAVE TRIED...IT REALLY REALLY WORKS! I USE IT ON MY ENTIRE FACE NOT JUST MY EYES</li>
            <li> havent start using it,hope it would do the firm job ,what is interesting ,the expiration date was printed .....on asmall note which makes it doesnt seem like aprofessional company produced it ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 60 and this is the best eye cream I have ever used! I put it above Clinique and Estee Lauder!  Lovely silkie texture is firming and reduces those fine lines.  I&#x27;ll never stop using this one!</li>
            <li> This eye cream really helps.  It does not take a way lines but helps some and does reduce puffiness.</li>
            <li> cool and effective for my eyebag..absorb quickly.will buy again next time</li>
            <li> This is a very soothing cream that helps keep the skin around your eyes hydrated.  It has natural ingredients and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Yes! This is some Great Stuff! I use it around my eyes, above my eyebrows, &amp; around my mouth. Massage it in well &amp; let it work its little miracle!</li>
            <li> I love this cream and you get a lot for your money.</li>
            <li> Suitable for day or night as it&#x27;s not sticky or greasy. I don&#x27;t have dark bags so I can&#x27;t attest to the usefulness of that, but it is very moisturizing and not irritating. Recommend!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I used it for a few weeks but hot no results. I would not recommend this</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;m used for my eyes. The scent is very pleasing and natural. You don&#x27;t need much for results. Great price!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the way this product made my eyes look red after use. I don&#x27;t know what it was but I guess my body just doesn&#x27;t agree with it.</li>
            <li> Love it ! Goes on smooth with no greasy feel. This is my 2nd purchase of this product and Yes ! I would buy again .</li>
            <li> The more watery eye creams are always less effective in my experience. This one is no exception. I have tried several under eye creams (paula&#x27;s choice, khiel&#x27;s, derma e, etc.) and this one by far is the least effective. I will just use it as a basic moisturizer until it is gone and will not reorder. I bought it from one of the vitamin sites. Price was right but since it was ineffective, it was a wash for me. I have only tried a couple of derma e products but I always notice the consistency is much less watery than the reviva brand.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is amazing. Always perks my eyes up and makes me less tired. Never irritating and best part is that you don&#x27;t need a lot. Use on upper eye and lower eye. Slightly greasy so dust some powder over eye before applying eye liner.</li>
            <li> Turned out to be a great product for my dark circles and also really the best moisturizer for my severely sun dried skin from work. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great firming cream. Best for night time use, and definitely when you want to take preventative measures to keep skin firm as you age. I love the fact that it contains no animal ingredients since I have sensitive skin. Most products like this tend to cause irritation, so that&#x27;s a plus. It&#x27;s also a great moisturizer. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Works GREAT! compared to others, this leaves me with  a clean and Natural feeling. no unknown ingredients, natural oils leaves your skin SILKY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> this cream is amazing. I am allergic to just about every product out there but this eye cream is incredibly gentle. I don&#x27;t get any reactions from it. It is not greasy but yet it is very effective in moisturizing. I strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> does not irritate my eyes.  not greasy.</li>
            <li> great...doesn&#x27;t sting if it gets in one&#x27;s eyes</li>
            <li> I am 54 and over the years I tried many different eye creams. This inexpensive cream is very good, it does the work.</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price.  Fast shipping.  Will by again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to the good reviews and the cheap price, but it is not working for me. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, but it left my skin around the eyes so dry and flaky.I have used it for a few weeks and hasn&#x27;t seen any improvement.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the texture of this product and the results.</li>
            <li> Dark circles mostly gone thanks to the product.  It does not do anything for the wrinkles though.  Almost no product reverses the crow&#x27;s feet or the wrikly part under the eyes.  This product moisturizes, but does not reverse.</li>
            <li> I can see the difference</li>
            <li> Nice cream, blends in without oily feeling.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product, but this seller is the slowest of all sellers!  I noticed when I went to write this review that the product now has an add-on item classification so maybe this will solve the problem?  It has been weeks and I still haven&#x27;t received the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this one so far, but I could feel that it tightened my skin and it made me look refreshed. Almost no smell. Didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes like some products can.</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin around my eyes very soft, and doesn&#x27;t take much of the cream. This product should last a while.</li>
            <li> No noticeable results.</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome!! This is my first time using this cream and it has already proven to be great.  People keep asking me what product am I using! Ill never stop using.  Great job!</li>
            <li> works well so far but it will months before I can judge the final result.</li>
            <li> Happy to an eye cream that&#x27;s in a large size,, it is economical in use.It&#x27;s good for use in winter.I like it!</li>
            <li> Love this cream. Not oily and the under eye area feels smooth and soft. I guess I have to use for a longer time to reap the benefits.</li>
            <li> I not sure if  this works ,because the lines did not go any where I just went and got a pell and Botox f it! Now I can say that works:-)</li>
            <li> This is a genuinely nice eye cream and I kept returning to it. Great quality at a great price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because of the good reviews. After using it for a week I broke out in itchy bumps and can no longer use it.</li>
            <li> I dont think this eye cream is working for my eyes at all . So went back to use my loreal recitalist</li>
            <li> Excellent Product!!  Would buy again!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered this product, so I don&#x27;t have any basis for comparison, but I think I may have been shipped old, dried-out product... What I received was definitely not a &amp;#34;cream.&amp;#34; I opened the jar to find it about 1/4 full of an elastic ball of viscous goo. I took a small pinch of it and tried to apply it to the skin around my eyes, only to have it roll into a congealed little ball of the stuff. Yuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll purchase again, just to give it a fair shot, since I&#x27;ve heard great things about this product from family members, but this first purchase has been a bummer... I&#x27;ll be trying to rehydrate and thin out the stuff with some other oil. With any luck, that&#x27;ll help...</li>
            <li> Great cream that feels great on my skin! Best for both morning and night time use. This product causes no irritation, so that&#x27;s a plus. It&#x27;s also a great moisturizer. I recommend.</li>
            <li> This cream spreads smoothly and easily, it&#x27;s just a bit thinner than what I&#x27;m used to.  This doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t a great product, I just have to adjust a bit.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an eye cream, but after my other brand face products keep giving me those little fat bumps(i guess my face is just sensitive to the chemicals), I tried this on. I was pleasantly surprised that it gave my face a much smoother feel and no irritation at all. The &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; label does work! Now it has become my night cream,day primer, and of course eye cream!   Updates: it seems they changed the formula, the one with Red Vine was much better than the current one, the color was translucent for the old one but the current one is like a white cream. The old one is more protective and you can feel that it moisturises your skin and make it more supple, but the current one burns a bit and doesn&#x27;t have the effects of the previous. I think they cheaped out in ingredients.</li>
            <li> Very good!Keep moisturing a whole day !</li>
            <li> I really liked it and can definitely see results! I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> Have only used this for a few days... Hoping to have good results.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t use anything else now. Best eye cream ever. I buy a new jar every 3 months or so. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It is very light and helps my sensitive eyes look less puffy or wrinkled in the morning. It does not irritate my skin like other creams and lasts for about 6 weeks if I use it twice a day. The price is good and delivery is always on time.</li>
            <li> I will recomended to my friends and buy another one soon. Looking forward to get it and use it again.</li>
            <li> Was very pleased to find that I could use this eye cream and have no resulting redness or itching.  I seem to be allergic to many eye creams, even those for sensitive skin; so this was a gamble that paid off.  It is a soft, non-greasy eye cream, and I hope it provides the moisture I need around my aging eye area.  So far I am quite happy with it and will hope for good results as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is a good product that has left a great impression on me. I am now at the age and in the profession where those stress lines begin to show. This is a nice, non-greasy cream that goes on easily and doesn’t feel too heavy after applied. It doesn’t really have a scent, which is good for users who suffer with sinusitis like myself and it moisturizes the skin as well. It has just been a few days and I have begun to see a noticeable difference in the lines. Looking less stressed and younger is always welcome. I will definitely continue using as this is an extremely good bargain at this price level.</li>
            <li> If you want to improve your appearance, what are your choices?  You can live with your imperfections, spend thousands of dollars for plastic surgery or use Reviva Eye Complex Firming Cream.  This product is inexpensive, easy to apply and effective.  I noticed results in just a couple of days.  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS Produet its not sticky when you put on my skin around my eyes feels so soft and more toned ! My eyes look more bright no more dark shadows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, no remarkable notice.  But better than no eye cream at all :)  I just use Organic Raw Coconut Oil all over face now.</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive &amp; this is one cream that seems to keep it soft &amp; clear.</li>
            <li> Have been using several weeks do not see any improvement of puffiness under eyes but it moisturizes nicely and I am not sensitive to any of the ingredients...it goes on smoothly and leaves no residue like some other products.  I do wish that it was in a pump rather than open jar of cream.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have tried, especially for the money.  Great quality, great value.  I used to splurge on a MUCH more costly product, but this one performs as good as, if not better.</li>
            <li> Excellent...really works.....best I have used so far.....use every day.. not a miracle cream but real close....</li>
            <li> Great product for good price</li>
