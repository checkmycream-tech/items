            <li>I absolutely love this mascara.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>I love Maybelline products</li>
            <li>this one gets better with time.</li>
            <li>I like it better than Avon for the price.</li>
            <li>The colossal gives me incredible fake-lashes like volume; it&#x27;s the best mascara for such that I have found so far.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even wear eyeliner because it give such great definition to my eyes.</li>
            <li>Gives great thickness and long lashes.</li>
            <li>Waterproof and keeps my very straight lashes curled!</li>
            <li>The color is fine, and the product got good reviews overall, so maybe it&#x27;s just my particular bottle of it, but I will not be buying it again.</li>
            <li>It really thickens my lashes and make them look longer!</li>
            <li>I use this mascara for many years and will keep doing so, doesn&#x27;t take my eyelashes away like some others that I have tried in the past, so this is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>they clump and still don&#x27;t add much volume to your eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;Their</li>
            <li>Affordable and really makes your lashes look thicker and longer.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel it did much for my lashes.</li>
            <li>I really liked the brush and the color was dark enough</li>
            <li>I do live in a humid area</li>
            <li>It was very clumpy and hard to make look more natural.</li>
            <li>super dry and un usable when I received it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super black and better than the Glam Black in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I can wash my face, using facial wash on my mascara, then eye makeup remover on a cotton ball, then try the remover again in the morning before my shower, wash my makeup in the shower with a facial wash, and the product is still remaining under my eyes in true racoon fashion.  </li>
            <li>I have a natural curl to my lashes and this mascara accentuates them.  </li>
            <li>I have really stubby and short lashes.</li>
            <li>I keep going back to this one because the wand is thick and strong, and I like the control I have, as I need to coat my lashes very particularly.</li>
            <li>Its ok product doesnt make my lashes thick and long.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear contacts but i am kind of sensitive to eye cosmetics, that being said upfront this mascara irritated my eyes, they were red itchy and uncomfortable.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if mine was just old or what, but it is the clumpiest mascara I have ever worn, and I will not be finishing my bottle.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the formula dried out and got really thick within a month or two, which is normal I guess.</li>
            <li> Spent the day at the pool at a resort</li>
            <li> but i could not wear due to the irritation.</li>
            <li> I have given up after about 2 weeks of wearing the stuff that all this washing is just not worth finishing the bottle.  </li>
            <li> and i looked like i had two black eyes.</li>
            <li> the less it goes on...</li>
            <li> At least on me.  </li>
            <li> - It clumps too but at least you get volume and length.</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my puny lashes look thick and stand out.</li>
            <li> Very few clumps and leaves your lashes fully volumized!</li>
            <li> This mascara is really bad to smudge.  </li>

            <li> My favorite mascara! Gives great thickness and long lashes. I don&#x27;t even wear eyeliner because it give such great definition to my eyes.</li>
            <li> I loooove this mascara! I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like it when I saw the plastic bristle brush but it acts as the regular bristles. Waterproof and keeps my very straight lashes curled! Love love love!</li>
            <li> My fave....for over 10 years</li>
            <li> super dry and un usable when I received it!</li>
            <li> It really thickens my lashes and make them look longer!</li>
            <li> This mascara is really bad to smudge.  At least on me.  I do live in a humid area but I don&#x27;t remember my mascara doing this before.</li>
            <li> they clump and still don&#x27;t add much volume to your eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;Their own &amp;#34;Falsies&#x27; product is better - It clumps too but at least you get volume and length.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara. It does thicken your lashes. It also doesn&#x27;t create a smudge under you eye as the day wears on.</li>
            <li> Maybelline Colossal Volum Waterproof is perfect for me.  I have a natural curl to my lashes and this mascara accentuates them.  It also stays on all day.  No retouching&lt;br /&gt;necessary even well into the night.</li>
            <li> Mis pestañas parecen postizas&lt;br /&gt;Me encanta.. Lo recomiendo&lt;br /&gt;Llego en buen estado y sellado&lt;br /&gt;lo amo excelente producto.&lt;br /&gt;gracias ..</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara. Affordable and really makes your lashes look thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> Very few clumps and leaves your lashes fully volumized! I&#x27;m very very happy with the product. I definitely would recommend this product especially because it is waterproof.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear contacts but i am kind of sensitive to eye cosmetics, that being said upfront this mascara irritated my eyes, they were red itchy and uncomfortable. I really liked the brush and the color was dark enough but i could not wear due to the irritation.</li>
            <li> I use this mascara for many years and will keep doing so, doesn&#x27;t take my eyelashes away like some others that I have tried in the past, so this is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> My go to mascara for volume + curl! The colossal gives me incredible fake-lashes like volume; it&#x27;s the best mascara for such that I have found so far. Does smear by the end of the day and occasionally flake however.</li>
            <li> I love Maybelline products this is one I plan to keep buying it gets the job done a 5 star product</li>
            <li> The mascara itself is great and looks great on.  It thickens the lashes as it says.  The problem comes when you want to remove it.  It&#x27;s like this stuff is made out of industrial glue.  I can wash my face, using facial wash on my mascara, then eye makeup remover on a cotton ball, then try the remover again in the morning before my shower, wash my makeup in the shower with a facial wash, and the product is still remaining under my eyes in true racoon fashion.  I have given up after about 2 weeks of wearing the stuff that all this washing is just not worth finishing the bottle.  Getting washable next time!</li>
            <li> I like this one...the newer the mascara the less it goes on...this one gets better with time. It&#x27;s super black and better than the Glam Black in my opinion. I keep going back to this one because the wand is thick and strong, and I like the control I have, as I need to coat my lashes very particularly.</li>
            <li> I have really stubby and short lashes. With just one coat my lashes look instantly 3 or 4 times longer. It lasts all and and is waterproof. The only downside is that the formula dried out and got really thick within a month or two, which is normal I guess.</li>
            <li> I always buy Mabelline or have for the last 5 years. I like it better than Avon for the price.</li>
            <li> Good waterproof mascara. I didn&#x27;t feel it did much for my lashes. Did not make a big difference in terms of how they looked. I would not re-purchase, will be trying others.</li>
