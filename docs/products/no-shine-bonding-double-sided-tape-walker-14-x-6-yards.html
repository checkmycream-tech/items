            <li>Works better than most</li>
            <li>I love tape I. Hair extensions</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many others.</li>
            <li>Also the most comfortable to sleep in!</li>
            <li>This is more of a once a day type strength.</li>
            <li>A great buy for my new Oticon hearing aids.</li>
            <li>I made my tape in extentions all by myself, and this tape made it so clean and so easy!</li>
            <li>Easily removed with heat and oil.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>My hair is super fine and my extensions haven&#x27;t budged an inch!</li>

            <li>And it sticks just as good as the solid 1/4 strip</li>
            <li>good stuff but only for hand tied wefts</li>
            <li>Extensions weren&#x27;t bonded well and fell out quickly.</li>
            <li>Walker Tape is by far the most efficient and dependable tape on the market.</li>
            <li>This one is the right size and does the job, but it does leave a shine.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone whose looking to apply tape-in hair extensions or needing to secure a wig or toupee.</li>
            <li>I try to do my own and this is by far the easiest and cleanest way I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>Very sticky!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather hot glue or just clip in my extensions.</li>
            <li>im not sure if its a good product to buy</li>
            <li>This is my first time getting this particular one.</li>
            <li>very fast&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>lasted me one whole month！，</li>
            <li>This tape is very sticky, and works very well.</li>
            <li>I decided to try it myself and it was much easier than I was worried it would be.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>When used correctly, stays better than any other tape I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I was so excited due to reviews to order this tape</li>
            <li>and I was surprised at the amount of tape in the roll.</li>
            <li>The whole roll was cut through middle</li>
            <li>The long lasting tape isnt worth the hassle of taking them out.</li>
            <li>I’m fairly certain that I have used every other type of tape on the market</li>
            <li>and obviously no one wants to loose their hair.  </li>
            <li>but they always need retaped and this tape is easy to use and thin.</li>

            <li> but they always need retaped and this tape is easy to use and thin.</li>
            <li> well it&#x27;s been a disappointment it doesn&#x27;t hold extensions in they&#x27;ve lasted the most 2 days, tried it again &amp; same thing happened.</li>
            <li> how long this wil hold in your extensions&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li> I will be a faithful customer for as long as I wear extensions.</li>
            <li> The only thing I &amp;#34;dislike&amp;#34; (even though it won&#x27;t cause me to discontinue use) is that this tape seems thicker than other tapes...</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t loose it&#x27;s strength.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different extension tapes</li>
            <li> One of the weft would slip off and the other would still be attached in the shower.</li>
            <li> Also the neutral color doesn&#x27;t work well with dark hair...</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t bond well to hair and when it slides down the hair shaft it leaves a trail of residue.</li>
            <li> It seems like I&#x27;m using less.</li>
            <li> would have like to seen this paper little wider</li>
            <li> The glue is a little sticky in there</li>
            <li> I will never buy again and don&#x27;t recommend anybody to waste money.</li>
            <li> Ive wasted them a few times as well.</li>
            <li> not easy to manage</li>
            <li> I have very few choices in tapes .</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s really hard to remove the residue.</li>
            <li> is too hard to take the plastic off.  </li>
            <li> Not to say it&#x27;s no good ,it is.</li>
            <li> Very hard to apply and peel off paper.</li>
            <li> I bought the tape to fix a couple loose extensions between appointments and my hair dresser was shocked by the extremely poor quality of this tape.</li>
            <li> useless, have no idea how to use it, not for those unfamiliar with, it&#x27;s thin and hard to work with, won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Tape is too thin.  </li>
            <li> You won’t be sorry.</li>
            <li> This tape is really, really bad, it will not stick and poor quality.</li>
            <li> but nothing crazy where I&#x27;m uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the removal process won&#x27;t be too crazy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very painful</li>

            <li> Walker Tape is by far the most efficient and dependable tape on the market. I use it for tape-in hair extensions and if used properly, it can and will last 6-8+ weeks. I’m fairly certain that I have used every other type of tape on the market and there is nothing that can compare to Walker Tape. I highly recommend this product for anyone whose looking to apply tape-in hair extensions or needing to secure a wig or toupee. You won’t be sorry. It’s worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> This tape destroyed my hair! It&#x27;s way too sticky so when it&#x27;s time to remove the extensions, it doesn&#x27;t let go and rips your hair out. It&#x27;s very painful and obviously no one wants to loose their hair.  I bought the tape to fix a couple loose extensions between appointments and my hair dresser was shocked by the extremely poor quality of this tape. You get what you pay for! I would definitely NOT recommend this tape.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Does what it says.</li>
            <li> Great for making tape in extensions. Easily removed with heat and oil.</li>
            <li> Makes my extensions last forever without the damage of glue or braids. I would indefinitely recommend this tape to anyone.</li>
            <li> This tape works well, and itll make the extensions stay in for 2-3 months. The only reason i gave it such a low rating is because it wont come out of your hair. Its been a week since i took out my extensions and still my hair is sticking in clumps. Ive done the citric spray, conditioner, and oils, and it still hasnt came out. The long lasting tape isnt worth the hassle of taking them out.</li>
            <li> I did not hold up in the shower. And it&#x27;s really hard to remove the residue. One of the weft would slip off and the other would still be attached in the shower.</li>
            <li> would have like to seen this paper little wider is too hard to take the plastic off.  not easy to manage</li>
            <li> This is my first time getting this particular one. It has two 1/8in strips stuck side by side. It seems like I&#x27;m using less. And it sticks just as good as the solid 1/4 strip</li>
            <li> great product&lt;br /&gt;arrived very fast&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;easy to work with&lt;br /&gt;very sticky but at the same not too sticky</li>
            <li> Great product! Will continue to shop with this seller!</li>
            <li> Used this for tape in extensions.. Lasted about 3-4 weeks. I&#x27;ve also used the 1/2 in tape. They both work great. Very sticky!</li>
            <li> never got this iteam so im not sure if its a good product to buy</li>
            <li> This tape bonds great and doesn&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li> Tried to use once didn&#x27;t. Stick on my hair, no direction might be a better product for someone else. Not to say it&#x27;s no good ,it is.</li>
            <li> I was so excited due to reviews to order this tape well it&#x27;s been a disappointment it doesn&#x27;t hold extensions in they&#x27;ve lasted the most 2 days, tried it again &amp; same thing happened.</li>
            <li> A great buy for my new Oticon hearing aids.</li>
            <li> Great hold! My hair is super fine and my extensions haven&#x27;t budged an inch! You can cut this to fit your extension length and I was surprised at the amount of tape in the roll.</li>
            <li> This stuff works miracles&lt;br /&gt;Of course it depends on your hair type how long this wil hold in your extensions&lt;br /&gt;These lasted me one whole month！，</li>
            <li> Great product! Perfect for tape in extentions.</li>
            <li> useless, have no idea how to use it, not for those unfamiliar with, it&#x27;s thin and hard to work with, won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Works better than most</li>
            <li> never used, very strong</li>
            <li> When used correctly, stays better than any other tape I&#x27;ve used. Doesn&#x27;t come out unwanted, even when conditioner is used on the tape itself.</li>
            <li> I have very few choices in tapes . This one is the right size and does the job, but it does leave a shine.</li>
            <li> Works great. Easy to use. I love tape I. Hair extensions but they always need retaped and this tape is easy to use and thin.</li>
            <li> Been using for 7 years. Best I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> This tape is very sticky, and works very well. When I put in my extensions I use two peices of tape and sandwich the hair in between. I have reordered this product to redo my extensions, the roll got me through two times.</li>
            <li> Bought this tape to make my own tape in hair extensions and I just love it. This rape by far it&#x27;s been the best tape I&#x27;ve ever bought. It stays in for 7 weeks even when I washed my hair once or twice a week and it doesn&#x27;t loose it&#x27;s strength. I will be a faithful customer for as long as I wear extensions. Best tape ever.</li>
            <li> Very hard to apply and peel off paper. Did not adhere to my scalp well.</li>
            <li> Good tape,it comes out easily with a flat iron and doesnt damage your hair</li>
            <li> Great deal it has a split inhalf making taping wefts for extensions a breeze.</li>
            <li> This has probably been the best hair tape I have picked up and I have tried many others. Seems to hold the longest and I like that it has dual pieces, lasts longer that way.</li>
            <li> Didnt hold wig in lace, maybe it was the application process, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> SO STICKY... doesn&#x27;t bond well to hair and when it slides down the hair shaft it leaves a trail of residue. I&#x27;d rather hot glue or just clip in my extensions. Also the neutral color doesn&#x27;t work well with dark hair... you end up seeing it some how- whether pulling your hair up or parting it close to the weft.</li>
            <li> This tape is really, really bad, it will not stick and poor quality. I will never buy again and don&#x27;t recommend anybody to waste money.</li>
            <li> good stuff but only for hand tied wefts</li>
            <li> Tape is too thin.  Extensions weren&#x27;t bonded well and fell out quickly.</li>
            <li> I was paying almost $400 every 8 weeks to have my extensions redone. I decided to try it myself and it was much easier than I was worried it would be. I used this tape and let me tell you it has been 4 weeks since I did and only one extension has come out. Since I know how to reapply and have the tape it was simple to reattach.</li>
            <li> I made my tape in extentions all by myself, and this tape made it so clean and so easy! Defiantly using these every time!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v tried everything when it comes to extensions. I try to do my own and this is by far the easiest and cleanest way I have tried so far. I haven&#x27;t removed the tape yet but they have been in for a couple weeks without any coming out. They are in place! Ive wasted them a few times as well. The glue is a little sticky in there but nothing crazy where I&#x27;m uncomfortable. And it feels like I don&#x27;t have any extensions when I put my hand along the back of my head. Also the most comfortable to sleep in! Hopefully the removal process won&#x27;t be too crazy so I can use this tape forever!!!</li>
            <li> It held up in the shower and brushing did the job will order this again in the future thank you</li>
            <li> The whole roll was cut through middle so I couldn&#x27;t use it at all !  Thanks I guess I now know what to,order and from who!</li>
            <li> This is more of a once a day type strength. Definitely not something to use for a week or two at a time.</li>
            <li> I use this for my tape in extensions... I&#x27;ve tried a few different extension tapes I prefer Walkers because it seems to be easier to remove. If you &#x27;install&#x27; the tape in extensions correctly using this tape they stay in your hair till you need to remove them (since they grow out). The only thing I &amp;#34;dislike&amp;#34; (even though it won&#x27;t cause me to discontinue use) is that this tape seems thicker than other tapes... Hence the 4 star rating.</li>
