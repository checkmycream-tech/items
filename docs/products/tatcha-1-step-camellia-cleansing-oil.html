            <li>best product period!</li>

            <li>The best offense is a defense I always say.</li>
            <li>Love it!!!</li>
            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the consummate cleanser</li>

            <li>so glad I found this!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Nice packaging, but containers themselves won&#x27;t do a thing for your or my skin.</li>
            <li>One of a kind.  </li>
            <li>I liked the value of getting both the Cleansing Oil and Rice Enzyme Cleanser for under $100.00.</li>
            <li>I use this cleansing oil even in place of my own cleanser because after I use this oil all the makeup is off, while leaving my skin hydrated and plumped.</li>
            <li>By far, the best cleansing wash you will ever use.  </li>
            <li>love the smell, amazing.</li>
            <li>I bought it based on a blogger&#x27;s recommendation and am totally in love with it.</li>
            <li>I did want to love it, but my face did not.</li>
            <li>This cleanser removes my make-up and leaves my skin silky smooth!  </li>
            <li>Love this for removing makeup.  </li>
            <li>Love this cleansing oil - when you add water to your face, it turns into a creamy milky face wash.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, and this is a good price.</li>
            <li>This cleanser takes absolutely every bit of makeup off without stripping my skin which I love!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different kinds of cleansing oil and this is by far one of the best one.  </li>
            <li>Your face is totally clean.</li>
            <li>My skin felt clean without being stripped of all its moisture.</li>
            <li>Face is clean and not drying.  </li>
            <li>Two pumps is all it takes for a completely clean face.  </li>
            <li>Takes off makeup quickly, and leaves my face feeling clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so gentle but also potent.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it , very mild for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The camellia oil quickly emulsifies into a milk that sweeps away everything, and my face never feels stripped or</li>
            <li>It just feel super luxurious.  </li>
            <li>The first day I used the cleansing oil I saw a significant difference in my skin in terms of clarity and glow.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This product is worth every cent.  </li>
            <li>My make-up came off easily, including my eye make-up and a particularly stubborn mascara.</li>
            <li>My face is super clean an soft afterward.  </li>
            <li>The camellia oil Tatcha uses is much better for skin though than mineral oil, coconut oil or other types since it&#x27;s OK for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>the rice enzyme powder is great, although still a little early to see results, my skin does seem smoother.</li>
            <li>stuff quickly melts away the day&#x27;s dirt and grime and leaves my face feel not only clean but refreshed.  </li>
            <li>When you put it on your face it feels like a pure oil.</li>
            <li>This is my HG cleanser - there really is nothing like</li>
            <li>- highly recommend giving this a try!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really imagine what it is like till you experience it.</li>
            <li>Overall, I can&#x27;t justify the price vs. DHC pore cleansing oil, which does a stellar job of removing everything, and makes my face feel so much more smooth, soft, and hydrated than this does- all while making my pores look almost non-existent, at half the cost.</li>
            <li>I purchased it previously on QVC, but better value on Amazon.</li>
            <li>If it weren&#x27;t so expensive I would love to be able to use it all over myself instead of soap.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for your skin.</li>
            <li>Took a while for me to find a cleanser that removes all make-up and is gentle on my sensitive skin,</li>
            <li>So I stopped, and my skin returned to normal.</li>
            <li>I always do the paper-towel test after testing a new cleanser.  </li>
            <li>In the mean time, the price is so totally worth it just for the clean face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any of my old make up remover anymore.</li>
            <li>My face feels so so soft after use</li>
            <li>I have very acne prone skin and wear makeup daily.</li>
            <li>I wanted a gentle way to wash my face with natural ingredients and that wouldn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li>Just put some on dry hands and gently massage my face all over and everything comes off.</li>
            <li>This is such a gentle cleanser that I can use almost daily</li>
            <li>I have tried the entire Tatcha ritual, and wanted badly to love it (because I&#x27;m fairly obsessed with Asian skin care in general), but was not wowed by anything in their whole line...</li>
            <li>First, know that cleansing oil is the only way to go for a face wash - hands down.  </li>
            <li>Generally some makeup is left making you cleanse again to get it off.  </li>

            <li> Unfortunately, this not only caused me to break out, but my skin to itch.  </li>
            <li> I hate when cleansers leave your skin feeling tight and dry.  </li>

            <li> Amazing product!!! Takes off makeup quickly, and leaves my face feeling clean and fresh! Not oily at all!!!</li>
            <li> Best makeup remover/face wash and no chemicals. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Just ok- a very thin cleansing oil that I found I had to use a lot of to remove all my makeup. I have tried the entire Tatcha ritual, and wanted badly to love it (because I&#x27;m fairly obsessed with Asian skin care in general), but was not wowed by anything in their whole line...(The best product IMO was dewy skin mist).

            <li> This product is worth every cent.  I bought it based on a blogger&#x27;s recommendation and am totally in love with it.</li>
            <li> my skin has changed thru the years and this leaves it so soft.workswonders as well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this not only caused me to break out, but my skin to itch.  I can say this has never happened in my long life!  I was warned, however, by reports on the company&#x27;s (previous?) lack of transparency with ingredient listing.  I did want to love it, but my face did not.</li>
            <li> This cleanser removes my make-up and leaves my skin silky smooth!  Took a while for me to find a cleanser that removes all make-up and is gentle on my sensitive skin, so glad I found this!</li>
            <li> I hate when cleansers leave your skin feeling tight and dry.  This cleanser takes absolutely every bit of makeup off without stripping my skin which I love!  I always do the paper-towel test after testing a new cleanser.  After cleansing and blotting dry i take a paper towel and run over my face.  Generally some makeup is left making you cleanse again to get it off.  Not with this cleanser!  Not one bit of makeup left - not even waterproof makeup!  Amazing!  Cannot be without this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I wanted a gentle way to wash my face with natural ingredients and that wouldn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  This has been the holy grail for me.  First, know that cleansing oil is the only way to go for a face wash - hands down.  The camellia oil Tatcha uses is much better for skin though than mineral oil, coconut oil or other types since it&#x27;s OK for sensitive skin.  Other brands like Shiseido, SK-II, DHC and drug store brands used to really dry me out, but not Tatcha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff quickly melts away the day&#x27;s dirt and grime and leaves my face feel not only clean but refreshed.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> This is my HG cleanser - there really is nothing like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so gentle but also potent. I can&#x27;t wrap my head around it! It literally melts away everything - my waterproof liner, foundation and all the other elements I&#x27;ve faced after a long day of working and commuting. The camellia oil quickly emulsifies into a milk that sweeps away everything, and my face never feels stripped or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the consummate cleanser and I&#x27;ve raved about it to all my friends - highly recommend giving this a try!</li>
            <li> I love this! I don&#x27;t use any of my old make up remover anymore. It works with even waterproof mascara, long lasting lipstick, and it doesn&#x27;t sting. I don&#x27;t need to use it with a cotton ball or pad either. Just put some on dry hands and gently massage my face all over and everything comes off.</li>
            <li> Love this for removing makeup.  My face feels so so soft after use</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how my friend convinced me - the human with the world&#x27;s oiliest skn - to use a cleansing oil, but she did. And I couldn&#x27;t thank her enough. This is such a gentle cleanser that I can use almost daily and it helps regulate my oil production while keeping my skin feeling hydrated and nourished. It&#x27;s truly the best!!</li>
            <li> Every evening I use this product to remove my makeup, dirt and sunscreen.  I highly recommend this product for your skin.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product! This takes off all my makeup.</li>
            <li> This stuff is totally amazing! You can&#x27;t really imagine what it is like till you experience it. Yes, it takes off even water proof mascara in seconds, with just your fingertips. Then as you wash the rest of your face you are not smearing black mascara all over your face as you do with soap. When you put it on your face it feels like a pure oil. When you rinse it off, there is no longer any oil! I&#x27;m not kidding. It rinses off easier than any soap, or cleansing cream. Your face is totally clean. No residue left on it. If it weren&#x27;t so expensive I would love to be able to use it all over myself instead of soap. Maybe in the future the price will drop. In the mean time, the price is so totally worth it just for the clean face. Fast shipping, and this is a good price.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about a cleansing oil. After trying Tatcha&#x27;s my inner skeptic was gone. My make-up came off easily, including my eye make-up and a particularly stubborn mascara. My skin felt clean without being stripped of all its moisture. I was afraid it would sting my eyes if I got even the tiniest bit in them. To this day that has not been the case and I&#x27;ve been using if for six months now.</li>
            <li> best product period! My skin has never looked so flawless!</li>
            <li> One of a kind.  I&#x27;ve used many different kinds of cleansing oil and this is by far one of the best one.  I just can&#x27;t stop massaging this oil on my face.  It just feel super luxurious.  My face is super clean an soft afterward.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Third purchase of this product.  By far, the best cleansing wash you will ever use.  No mineral oil, takes your eye makeup off like a dream.  Face is clean and not drying.  Two pumps is all it takes for a completely clean face.  I purchased it previously on QVC, but better value on Amazon.</li>
            <li> love the smell, amazing. not sure it cleans off all makeup but not a big deal. the rice enzyme powder is great, although still a little early to see results, my skin does seem smoother. I&#x27;m hopeful it will continue.</li>
            <li> Love this cleansing oil - when you add water to your face, it turns into a creamy milky face wash. Gave some to my Mom and she loves it at 89!!</li>
            <li> I would consider myself a beauty expert since I have worked in labs formulating products. I will try almost anything and everything  to find the best product. I was flipping through channels and watched the TATCHA presentation on QVC and for some reason I was tempted to try it. I liked the value of getting both the Cleansing Oil and Rice Enzyme Cleanser for under $100.00. The first day I used the cleansing oil I saw a significant difference in my skin in terms of clarity and glow. I have very acne prone skin and wear makeup daily. I use this cleansing oil even in place of my own cleanser because after I use this oil all the makeup is off, while leaving my skin hydrated and plumped. Being 25 I am trying to find products that would leave my skin moisturized preventing wrinkles and other aging signs from appearing. The best offense is a defense I always say.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it , very mild for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This product seems to irritate my skin and cause rash. My skin is usually clear but upon using this product, I got redness and little red bumps on my face, giving it uneven texture. Took me a couple weeks to realize the cause. So I stopped, and my skin returned to normal. Then I used it again, and my skin immediately got rash. So it must have been something in this product.</li>
