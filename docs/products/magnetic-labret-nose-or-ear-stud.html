            <li>So I put it on my nose and it works great as a nose piercing!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to use this as a nose stud I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, but works great as monroe or cartilage piercing!</li>
            <li>These look so real, love it!</li>
            <li>I Didn&#x27;t Use Mine For A Monroe Piercing, But They Are Great For A Nose Stud.</li>

            <li>Works good with big noses.</li>
            <li>The magnet is super strong and it looks completely real!</li>
            <li>The magnet was strong, but too large for a nose piercing.</li>
            <li>No it didn&#x27;t work right</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just so huge and the magnet is even bigger</li>

            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get it to stay, nearly swallowed the magnet, and, while trying to get it to stay put for the millionth time, dropped it in my car and lost it the first day.</li>
            <li>Its cute but the ring is too big and the magnet is way too big.</li>

            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> So not worth itm</li>
            <li> It felt down after hours, and I didn&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li> Until I lost the little stud</li>
            <li> You can tell that it&#x27;s fake from far</li>
            <li> You can kinda tell its fake, but not really.</li>
            <li> A lot of the reviews are negative, I personaly don&#x27;t go by a lot of reviews though</li>
            <li> It is impossible to wear it on lip, since it keeps falling and there is big chance that you can swallow the magnet.</li>
            <li> a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it as a Monroe piercing and it was just bad.</li>
            <li> This product was the worst.</li>

            <li> Way too big and the magnet keeps movie. You can tell that it&#x27;s fake from far it&#x27;s just so huge and the magnet is even bigger</li>
            <li> These look so real, love it! I bought two.</li>
            <li> Works well on your nose although I&#x27;m scared it will get stuck BAHAHAHA but do not buy if for your lip if you have braces because it will just get stuck to those instead of staying on your lip since its magnetic</li>
            <li> I bought this product to convince my parents to let me get a Monroe piercing, unfortunately my braces interfered with the magnet causing me to not be able to wear it on my lip. So I put it on my nose and it works great as a nose piercing! The magnet is super strong and it looks completely real!</li>
            <li> It is a really good magnet and very comfortable! If you&#x27;re looking to use this as a nose stud I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, but works great as monroe or cartilage piercing!</li>

            <li> No it didn&#x27;t work right</li>

            <li> a bad purchase. It is impossible to wear it on lip, since it keeps falling and there is big chance that you can swallow the magnet.</li>

            <li> This product was the worst. The magnetic pieces did not work at all. I wanted to use it as a Monroe piercing and it was just bad. My advice is to just get the real thing. Also it was super TINY i could barley even see it. Not worth it.</li>
