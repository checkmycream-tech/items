            <li>I take hot showers and shave with a razor.  </li>
            <li>It is better than lactic acid based lotions for extremely dry, cracked, or brittle skin.  </li>
            <li>I was prescribed urea lotion many years ago by a dermatologist for extremely dry skin (icthyosis vulgaris).  </li>
            <li>It used to be available through prescription only.</li>
            <li>I saw many different doctors who recommended various solutions, like \\&quot;don&#x27;t shave\\&quot;, \\&quot;don&#x27;t use hot water\\&quot; and creams that felt like lard.  </li>
            <li>I tried so many other products and there was only one other that I liked as well</li>
            <li>bottle and it is expensive compared to more available types of foot cream.  </li>
            <li>You only need to apply it after bathing and your legs will stay smooth until the next shower/bath.  </li>
            <li>I spent so much money on other products that didn&#x27;t work, so glad Amazon carries this.</li>
            <li>Especially in the winter when my skin really tightens up and cracks.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to find any other lotion that works even remotely as well as Ultra Mide 25 and hope it stays on the market.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works on my husband&#x27;s rough hands and fingertips.  Loves it.</li>
            <li> Husband has dry, cracked feet and this is the only lotion that keeps his heels from developing cracks.  Expensive, but it works and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis on my hands, which seems to come and go at random times.  A friend told me about Ultra Mide 25.  As a lotion, I can&#x27;t stand it - leaves a chalky residue.  But I have found that if I apply it liberally to my hands and wear vinyl gloves overnight, it reverses the damage and stops the psoriasis from spreading.  I do this for a few days until the outbreak is completely gone.  I have tried a lot of so called treatments, this one works for me where others fail!</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you have cracked or dry skin, or even some types of dermatitis. You only need a small amount as it is quite concentrated, so even though it&#x27;s a bit costly, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  It is the only lotion I have ever found that prevents my skin from chapping and looking scaly during the winter.  This lotion is best used right out of the shower and does not feel good if you try to use it like other lotions.  If you skin is already chapped, it will sting a little so beware if you are using it on small children.</li>
            <li> This lotion will cure your dry, cracked heels.  I have used it for about 3 years and have not had a problem since.  A dab each day rubbed in to any dry spot on your foot and then, use a pumice or something like it a couple of times a week and, no more dry heels!</li>
            <li> Ultra Mide 25 was recommended to me by a dermatologist many years ago. I&#x27;d used it faithfully since with pleasing results until it had been taken off of the market for a while. I would periodically check to see if it had become available again and am happy to find that I can again purchase this outstanding lotion. I have not been able to find any other lotion that works even remotely as well as Ultra Mide 25 and hope it stays on the market.</li>
            <li> best moisturizer I have ever used</li>
            <li> If you have ichthyosis vulgaris this product is pretty effective.  Dermal Therapy&#x27;s Alpha Hydroxy Lotion (purchase through their website - they have excellent customer service) is much better though!</li>
            <li> This is the only produce that closes up the cracks in my hands and feet.  It&#x27;s well worth the $$$!</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous lotion! It used to be available through prescription only. It is better than lactic acid based lotions for extremely dry, cracked, or brittle skin.  Just note that it is a flowery smelling lotion. I would not recommend for men unless they carry a fragrance free version.</li>
            <li> does the job needed when others won&#x27;t!  Great product!</li>
            <li> Works great for dry, cracked skin.  Only need a small amount.  I only use this on hands and feet.  A must for winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this foot product for years, and with regular application it deals with my hard heel skin very efficiently.  However, it is not available tn drugstores these days - I have to send to Florida (through Amazon) for an 8 oz. bottle and it is expensive compared to more available types of foot cream.

            <li> dry skin ,it does the job to correct.</li>
            <li> Ultra mide is a life saver for me. I&#x27;ve used it for many, many, years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found it very hard to get. Some stores have stopped selling it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m afraid it will be discontinued completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for my chance to say this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shirley M. Swan</li>
            <li> I used to have very dry skin on my legs that itched like crazy.  I would require a visit to the dermotologist at least once a year for infections from scratching.  I saw many different doctors who recommended various solutions, like \\&quot;don&#x27;t shave\\&quot;, \\&quot;don&#x27;t use hot water\\&quot; and creams that felt like lard.  Finally, one recommended Ultra Mide 25.  That was over 20 years ago and  I have not seen a doctor about my legs since.  I take hot showers and shave with a razor.  When I get out of the shower, I leave my legs damp and let the lotion mix with the water on my legs.  That way you only need to use a small amount and mixed with water, it doesn&#x27;t leave the white residue.  You only need to apply it after bathing and your legs will stay smooth until the next shower/bath.  It is amazing!</li>
            <li> I ordered this article at the request of my wife. It was back ordered but finally arrived.  She liked it, used it up and wants more. I ordered it again, months ago, had it back ordered again, and have not been able to locate it when it is available. Is the manufacturer still in existence? She nags me about it. She liked it once and might like it again but she may not remember when that was. It was that long ago.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent service.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion for cracked dry calloused heels. It absorbs in the skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or like some products that also contain urea chalky. There for a while you couldn&#x27;t find this because the manufacturer that made it quit making it. I tried so many other products and there was only one other that I liked as well and then they quit making that product. Thank God another company started making ultra mide 25. All is well with my feet again.</li>
            <li> Smells and weird consistency. Did not help with ichthyosis diagnosis.</li>
            <li> Ultra-mide 25 is a good moistruizing lotion that I have been using for 15 years and it is as good now as when I started using it.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me several years ago by a pharmacist.  He told me it was the best product for softening cuticles.  I have used it ever since (when I can get it. It was impossible to find for a few months last year).  I also use it on my heels.  Works every time!</li>
            <li> Didnt moisturize as advertised. Jurgens does much better job.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever for cracked heels--- this is the only stuff I have ever used that actually heals my feet!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work for me at all. it makes your skin feel even dryer. Still looking for a better product. Very expensive!</li>
            <li> I was prescribed urea lotion many years ago by a dermatologist for extremely dry skin (icthyosis vulgaris).  Fortunately, I have a milder case that those truly burdened by this skin issue, so this really works for me.  Especially in the winter when my skin really tightens up and cracks.  I also use lacticare lotion at night, and urea in the morning after a shower.  It is a good combination, and really helps exfoliate my skin without all the unsightly flakes!</li>
            <li> Sorry that they discontinued the product.  Have used for years and very satisfied.  Would definitely recommend to a friend.  My other half is diabetic and it works great on his nasty feet.</li>
            <li> good product, have used for twenty years</li>
            <li> This is the best product for very very dry chapped skin.  There was a time when the heals of my feet would crack and bleed (in the winter in California), after one application my feet began to soften.  I spent so much money on other products that didn&#x27;t work, so glad Amazon carries this.</li>
