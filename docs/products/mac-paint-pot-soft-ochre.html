    <ol>
            <li>I think this is the greatest product for protecting your iPhone screen!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Great eye foundation for the day!</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great for those of us with oilier lids across which kohl liner likes to smudge throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>and I can even wear it on its own without looking too overdone!</li>
            <li>If you have fair skin and need a matte primer, then this paint pot will do the job.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and provides a good primer for eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this gem.  </li>
            <li>Most days when I&#x27;m rushed I wear alone.</li>
            <li>so to me it takes a lot more than it should.  </li>
            <li>My advice is think twice before you spend $$$ on this lil pot of okay...</li>
            <li>I still am in LOVE with it.</li>
            <li>Love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While it does the job at making sure my shadow stays put, it just doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as I would like.</li>
            <li>Urban Decay primer potion is definitely better lol</li>
            <li>Easy to install</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy and goes on so easy, all while ensuring my eye shadow doesn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li>Love the color and it was shipped so quickly</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not like they are cheap drug store products.  </li>
            <li>It has a smooth, matte finish.  </li>
            <li>A light colour that goes on so well over the eye lids and does not crease at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically a primer for eyelids with a super-matte finish, so that liner goes on in a clean line and stays there all day (shadow, too).  </li>
            <li>But I read that if you pat this over your eye primer (or if you don&#x27;t need it it works as a concealor 1st) and it will help make your eyeshadow look just simply amazing and professional!</li>
            <li>Soft ochre is the perfect neutral shade for my eyelids, and helps intensify brown, tan, and other types of neutral eyeshadow colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>yes, i put it on right</li>
            <li>My first eyelid primer was Urban Decay&#x27;s Primer Potion, and while I liked how it made my eyeshadows more vibrant, I felt that the texture was a bit too moist for my liking (I naturally have oily lids).  </li>
            <li>I wanted a matte color for those days that I don&#x27;t want any shimmer on my eye, and this seems to match my skin tone pretty well.</li>
            <li>Be warned that you will need to warm up the product first, but once you do, it effortlessly sweeps over the lids with little tug.  </li>
            <li>My friend recommended I try a MAC Paint Pot instead; my first choice was Soft Ochre.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like that I have to tug at that sensitive eye area at all to get it on!!  </li>
            <li>My first paint pot ever was in the color bare study.</li>
            <li>Super dry, doesn&#x27;t spread evenly across eye, splotchy effect.</li>
            <li>So with this product the shadow stays on A LITTLE better, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s enough to really even notice unless you are looking for it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really like the concealer method for making my upper eyelids look brighter because it gets sticky, but this paint pot provides a soft, natural finish that makes my eyes look more awake.  </li>
            <li>So in my opinion, get a different shade, as it will go on MUCH easier.</li>
            <li>I use thisnpaint pot in soft ochre as a primer.</li>
            <li>I am never sure when buying a high end make up products if it will be truely worth my money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used bare mineral &amp; body shop eye shadow with it...</li>
            <li>Soft ochre, however, isn&#x27;t of the same consistency.</li>
            <li>&quot; that&#x27;s actually functional and does something no other cosmetic I&#x27;ve discovered does.</li>

            <li> but I just have to say I&#x27;m really not impressed...</li>
            <li> when i put it on it looked like make up you use to make up a dead person&#x27;s face before a viewing  scary!!!</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this gem.  Most days when I&#x27;m rushed I wear alone. Definitely improves and brightens my eyes. When used as a base eye shadow stays on without creasing for ever!</li>
            <li> Great product. Have been using for many years as a shadow base.</li>
            <li> Love the color and it was shipped so quickly</li>
            <li> I bought this at the MAC store so I know it&#x27;s a legit product...but I just have to say I&#x27;m really not impressed...I&#x27;m actually debating on returning it.  It&#x27;s hard to get on, barely creamy at all...so to me it takes a lot more than it should.  I do typically have oilier skin &amp; this is what the person in the store recommended..but it&#x27;s rough getting it smoothed over my lid...I don&#x27;t like that I have to tug at that sensitive eye area at all to get it on!!  I use Benefit&#x27;s Erase Paste under my eyes &amp; I looove how it goes on.  This product is NOTHING like that so you have an idea how to compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So with this product the shadow stays on A LITTLE better, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s enough to really even notice unless you are looking for it.  I haven&#x27;t worn MAC eye shadow with it...maybe that&#x27;s the problem?  It shouldn&#x27;t be..I&#x27;ve used bare mineral &amp; body shop eye shadow with it...so it&#x27;s not like they are cheap drug store products.  My advice is think twice before you spend $$$ on this lil pot of okay...</li>
            <li> so i was finagled to get this to \\&quot;make my eye shadow stay on\\&quot;. in the container it looked thick and pasty but i thought what the heck ill try it. when i put it on it looked like make up you use to make up a dead person&#x27;s face before a viewing  scary!!! - yes, i put it on right, i dont think living people should like that</li>
            <li> Great for those of us with oilier lids across which kohl liner likes to smudge throughout the day.  It&#x27;s basically a primer for eyelids with a super-matte finish, so that liner goes on in a clean line and stays there all day (shadow, too).  One of the few cosmetic \\&quot;accessories\\&quot; that&#x27;s actually functional and does something no other cosmetic I&#x27;ve discovered does.</li>
            <li> Got this for gf and she says: Super dry, doesn&#x27;t spread evenly across eye, splotchy effect. Urban Decay primer potion is definitely better lol</li>
            <li> I think this is the greatest product for protecting your iPhone screen! Easy to install and it does not interfere with the touch system at all!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SHADOW BASE!</li>
            <li> Want your eyeshadow to stay on your eyes? Use this stuff as a foundation. It goes on smoothly and provides a good primer for eyeshadow. Spend the extra money.</li>
            <li> My first paint pot ever was in the color bare study. I still am in LOVE with it. It&#x27;s creamy and goes on so easy, all while ensuring my eye shadow doesn&#x27;t budge. Soft ochre, however, isn&#x27;t of the same consistency. I wanted a matte color for those days that I don&#x27;t want any shimmer on my eye, and this seems to match my skin tone pretty well. While it does the job at making sure my shadow stays put, it just doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as I would like. I&#x27;m not sure if I just got a defective pot of this (I bought mine at a mac counter) or if its just this color, but I hardly ever reach for it. So in my opinion, get a different shade, as it will go on MUCH easier.</li>
            <li> My first eyelid primer was Urban Decay&#x27;s Primer Potion, and while I liked how it made my eyeshadows more vibrant, I felt that the texture was a bit too moist for my liking (I naturally have oily lids).  My friend recommended I try a MAC Paint Pot instead; my first choice was Soft Ochre.  It&#x27;s now my go to eyelid primer, here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It has a smooth, matte finish.  For people with oily lids, this paint pot works like a dream.  Be warned that you will need to warm up the product first, but once you do, it effortlessly sweeps over the lids with little tug.  I find that the matte finish also makes it easier to apply and blend eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s a good base for neutral eyeshadows.  Soft ochre is the perfect neutral shade for my eyelids, and helps intensify brown, tan, and other types of neutral eyeshadow colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. You can also wear it alone as a way to brighten up your eyes.  I&#x27;ve never really like the concealer method for making my upper eyelids look brighter because it gets sticky, but this paint pot provides a soft, natural finish that makes my eyes look more awake.  Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I literally have no complaints about this product.  If you have fair skin and need a matte primer, then this paint pot will do the job.</li>
            <li> I use thisnpaint pot in soft ochre as a primer. It removes all color on the eyelids and prevents my eyeshadows from creasing.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I am never sure when buying a high end make up products if it will be truely worth my money. But I read that if you pat this over your eye primer (or if you don&#x27;t need it it works as a concealor 1st) and it will help make your eyeshadow look just simply amazing and professional!</li>
            <li> Great eye foundation for the day!</li>
            <li> A light colour that goes on so well over the eye lids and does not crease at all.  Serves both as an eyeshadow primer and I can even wear it on its own without looking too overdone!</li>
