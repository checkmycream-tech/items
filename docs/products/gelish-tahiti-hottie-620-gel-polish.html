            <li>More purple than fuchsia</li>
            <li>, if you ask me...reminds me of the color of Barney the dinosaur from children&#x27;s TV :)&lt;</li>
            <li>I have gotten soo many complements on it.</li>
            <li>I really love this color.</li>

            <li>I thought I was purchasing a dark wine color, however it is a bright purple.  </li>
            <li>this is a beautiful color but needs to be applied in thin coats other wise it wrinkles.</li>

            <li>but I like the actual color better.</li>
            <li>Gelish Carnival Hangover is my second favorite which is more pink that Tahiti Hottie.</li>
            <li>More like a hot pink.</li>
            <li>Then you can be certain about a color.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The picture is very deceiving.  </li>
            <li>If have added Izzy Wizzy Let&#x27;s Get Busy on top if I want purple blue sparke.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a deep rich magenta.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on this color plain and with the sparkle.  </li>
            <li>I always look on Chickettes&lt;br /&gt;.com to get a more accurate idea of what any gel polishes look like and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet</li>

            <li> Nice purple. Not too dark, not too bright!</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful color!  If your uncertain about a color from sellers pics, go to the gelish home page. Then you can be certain about a color.  I took this to my salon and they too loved the color and will purchase it for other customers!!</li>
            <li> Great bright summer color!  This goes on nicely and does not wrinkle.  It takes 3 layers instead of 2 to get the nice bold color.  The picture is maybe a bit darker than it looks on my nails.  It is a very pretty color.  Also a great one for a bold look on the toes.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite the purple I&#x27;d hoped it was. More like a hot pink. Good quality polish.</li>
            <li> Very nice color, excellent quality. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Very nice color. It&#x27;s a deep rich magenta.</li>

            <li> lovely purple/fuchsia color, great for summer! More purple than fuchsia, if you ask me...reminds me of the color of Barney the dinosaur from children&#x27;s TV :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No sparkle/shimmer, just a shiny finish.  Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The colour was not what I was expecting.  From the picture it looked like a darker fuchsia, but it actually bright purple.</li>
            <li> Very good service and products as described!</li>

            <li> The picture is very deceiving.  I thought I was purchasing a dark wine color, however it is a bright purple.  Nothing even close to the picture.  Very disappointed.</li>
