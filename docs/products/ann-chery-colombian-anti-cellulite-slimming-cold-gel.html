            <li> The delivery was right on time..The product.. I&#x27;ve been using in sice i received it.  When I applyvthe gel there is a strong minty like smell yet no tingling of any sort.

            <li> I&#x27;m still new at this waist training belt, I bearly started combing the gel. I do love that you feel it working but I will have to see if I get any different results after using it longer.</li>
            <li> Makes me tingle and is cooler beneath the Faja but have not noticed tightening.</li>
