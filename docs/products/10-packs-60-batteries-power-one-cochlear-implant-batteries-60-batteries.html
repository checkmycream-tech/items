            <li>I was pleased with the delivery of the batteries and just started using them, so far I have had no problems.  </li>
            <li>We are senior citizens and on a fixed income, my husband has a cochlear inplant and requires many different batteries, every little savings helps us out and your delivery service was excellent.</li>
            <li>This purchase really has helped me get full benefit of my CI without worrying about running out of batteries.</li>
            <li>They were exactly what I needed and the price was somewhat lower.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipment; product as described!</li>
            <li>they were exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>These batteries were exactly the ones we were looking for, as this is what came with the cochlear implant processor.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I want from amazon.  </li>
            <li>very fast shipping,i am very happy,will buy again.ty A++++++++</li>
            <li>I was suprised by the packaging, as the batteries came as ten bubble wrapped packages in a plastic bag, but no harm no foul, and shipping was free.  </li>
            <li>And fast, I received the batteries within 2 days of placing my order.  </li>
            <li>and I worried that my boys were going to be really struggling during the holidays.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>The batteries arrived in a timely manner and they work very well in my cochlear implant device.  </li>
            <li>Thanks God that it had arrived just in time</li>
            <li>These last a long time and are more economical that the cochlear mfr.</li>
            <li>I need this for my high powered cochlear implant.</li>
            <li>They were a few dollars cheaper than the other sources and the service was great.</li>
            <li>and I changed to new batteries.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>These were brand new batteries I purchased from CVS the day before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The product was new...</li>
            <li>so know they are new batteries.  </li>

            <li>They arrived quickly and were priced to be competitive with the other sources.  </li>
            <li>My worst fear was to run out of batteries and not be able to buy more in a local store, this purchase alleviated that fear.</li>
            <li>They last a reasonable length of time.</li>
            <li>A young man did a study and if you leave the battery out to open air for 5 minutes before placing it in the Cochlear it doubles the life of the battery.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time I purchased them from Amazon but it will certainly not be the last.  </li>
            <li>Generally lasts 2-3 days with regular (8-12 hours per day) usage.  </li>

            <li> Generally lasts 2-3 days with regular (8-12 hours per day) usage.  </li>
            <li> long story short.....................</li>
            <li> These are the same exact batteries I can purchase through cochlear, only they are quite a bit less expensive and the seller gets them to me fast.  </li>
            <li> you had a problem with Power One batteries before, you may not have been using the Power One batteries for a CI - they are not the same as the other Power One p675 batteries.</li>
            <li> generally use rechargeable batteries, but I also travel a few times a year, and when I do, I always use these.</li>
            <li> I paid for the 3 day express and literally had them a day and a half later...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that these last me about two and a half days, sometimes up to 3.</li>
            <li> so I go through about 8 batteries every day and a half.</li>
            <li> Shoppers not familiar with this brand may like to know that the protective backing stays in the package when the battery is removed.</li>
            <li> There was little damage on the box from shipping but did not damage the batteries at all.</li>
            <li> I found this out the hard way.  </li>
            <li> These batteries keep my child&#x27;s processor powered for at least a week.</li>
            <li> Within one hour I heard that irritating beep that my battery was about to go dead</li>
            <li> WTF?  </li>
            <li> I looked at the batteries and couldn&#x27;t figure out what was wrong.  </li>
            <li> I hate taking all the gear along to keep the rechargeables, so I just pack a bunch of these, along with my disposable battery case, and I never have to worry about it going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with these batteries.</li>

            <li> We are senior citizens and on a fixed income, my husband has a cochlear inplant and requires many different batteries, every little savings helps us out and your delivery service was excellent.</li>
            <li> Good price and fast delivery</li>
            <li> This purchase really has helped me get full benefit of my CI without worrying about running out of batteries. Initially, the model CI I have did not offer rechargeable batteries and I wore it almost continually as I adjusted to hearing again. My worst fear was to run out of batteries and not be able to buy more in a local store, this purchase alleviated that fear.</li>
            <li> These last a long time and are more economical that the cochlear mfr. items.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered 20 Packs of Power One Cochlear Implant Batteries.  They work perfectly and were received \\&quot;just in time\\&quot; as I was on my last pack.  This was the first time I purchased them from Amazon but it will certainly not be the last.  They were exactly what I needed and the price was somewhat lower.  So, I&#x27;m SOLD!!  Thank you, Seth</li>
            <li> Good brand, I believe these are original batteries for my Nucleus Freedom as received from Cochlear.  Generally lasts 2-3 days with regular (8-12 hours per day) usage.  I was suprised by the packaging, as the batteries came as ten bubble wrapped packages in a plastic bag, but no harm no foul, and shipping was free.  And fast, I received the batteries within 2 days of placing my order.  Definitely my provider of choice from now on.</li>
            <li> Good batteries for implant</li>
            <li> I order these all the time. Wife uses them for her cochlear implant. Works great and price is comparable to others and I only have to wait two days instead of a week</li>
            <li> I found this out the hard way.  I decided not to take my rechargeable batteries with me on a trip.  So I grabbed some batteries out of the fridge and hopped on the plane.  Within one hour I heard that irritating beep that my battery was about to go dead and I changed to new batteries.&lt;br /&gt;Well within an hour I heard the beep again.  I was flabbergasted.  What?  WTF?  I looked at the batteries and couldn&#x27;t figure out what was wrong.  These were brand new batteries I purchased from CVS the day before.&lt;br /&gt;I landed in California..............long story short.....................HEARING AID BATTERIES DO NOT WORK FOR COCHLEAR IMPLANTS!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Hearing aid batteries will only last about one hour for cochlear implants.  You can use them in a pinch, but you need batteries that say they are made for IMPLANTS........................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&amp;#34;T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT THEM.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment; product as described!</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the delivery of the batteries and just started using them, so far I have had no problems.  CJ Dobbins</li>
            <li> Good quality and long-lasting batteries.... makes the difference between hearing well and hearing ok.</li>
            <li> they were exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> I loved the cost and the time of arrival, I will always look to Amazon going forward. many thanks I will always need these batteries because I have a cochlear implant.</li>
            <li> Great buy for these pricey batteries. I Always order from here. I have Never had a problem.  I give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The customer service at Premium Batteries is fantastic!  Batteries worked great - lasted about 2.7 days with my CI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Premium Batteries!  BTW  -if you had a problem with Power One batteries before, you may not have been using the Power One batteries for a CI - they are not the same as the other Power One p675 batteries.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a tidbit of information that I would like to pass on.  A young man did a study and if you leave the battery out to open air for 5 minutes before placing it in the Cochlear it doubles the life of the battery.  It works great.</li>
            <li> I will use this seller over and over and over again. I have two boys who are bilaterally implanted so I go through about 8 batteries every day and a half. It adds up!!  The cost of purchasing enough rechargeable batteries for them would be about $1000. Until I can talk our insurance into paying for that (ha!), this is my best alternative. These are the same exact batteries I can purchase through cochlear, only they are quite a bit less expensive and the seller gets them to me fast.  We ran out just a couple days before Christmas and I worried that my boys were going to be really struggling during the holidays. I paid for the 3 day express and literally had them a day and a half later...just as they used their last battery in my supply.  I am eternally grateful that this seller happens to be here. THANK YOU!!! Thanks to you, my boys were able to hear the bells on Christmas day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mother&#x27;s implants It is a great product and great price. Will buy again and again!!</li>
            <li> Best batteries I&#x27;ve found at a reasonable price for my cochlear implant.  Will order from here again.</li>
            <li> Effective,  fast,  easy to use.</li>
            <li> Batteries not as advertised, description stated 3 year shelf life, batteries had expiration date of 11-2015, 14 months left.</li>
            <li> 7 out of ten packs were good !  It was a good buy but didn&#x27;t want to discard any before even using them</li>
            <li> These batteries were exactly the ones we were looking for, as this is what came with the cochlear implant processor. We are very happy with them. Shoppers not familiar with this brand may like to know that the protective backing stays in the package when the battery is removed. The package itself is a convenient size to carry along in the case a battery change is required while away from home.</li>
            <li> I need this for my high powered cochlear implant. It is easier when I do not want to bring my rechargeable batteries anywhere on vacation. It lasts about 6 hours.</li>
            <li> qThey are what I asked  for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marcia</li>
            <li> I have a Nucleus 5 Cochlear Implant and I love these batteries!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally use rechargeable batteries, but I also travel a few times a year, and when I do, I always use these. I hate taking all the gear along to keep the rechargeables, so I just pack a bunch of these, along with my disposable battery case, and I never have to worry about it going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that these last me about two and a half days, sometimes up to 3.</li>
            <li> Great price and free shipping.</li>
            <li> There was little damage on the box from shipping but did not damage the batteries at all.</li>
            <li> It great price for them . I recommend them to the customers</li>
            <li> Work great but prices were steep.</li>
            <li> Nice not to have to pay full price through Cochlear!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfectly working. Thanks again.</li>
            <li> My favorite brand.  Out lasts the others.</li>
            <li> very fast shipping,i am very happy,will buy again.ty A++++++++</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have been happier with my batteries.  They came very quickly.  The product was new...the expiration date isn&#x27;t for several years so know they are new batteries.  This is the lowest price that I have been able to find these.</li>
            <li> Purchased for school district.  I have not heard any complaints (and I would if there were) so I&#x27;m assuming that we are happy ith the item.</li>
            <li> The batteries arrived in a timely manner and they work very well in my cochlear implant device.  The packaging is good and handy to keep in my purse.  They last a reasonable length of time.</li>
            <li> These batteries keep my child&#x27;s processor powered for at least a week. Receiving so many and one package is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with these batteries. Not only are they the most expensive brand, they had the shortest life of all of the batteries I tested in my Med-El cochlear implants. They only lasted 37 hours compared to the Hear Clears which lasted 42 hours.</li>
            <li> Great!  I got exactly what I want from amazon.  Thanks God that it had arrived just in time I need the batteries for my hearing aid. Thank you!  Hope the next time I need to buy another one would be cheaper too.</li>
            <li> I use them for my cochlear hearing aid. l alm hearing impaired since my birth. l got Coclhear Implain 7 years ago at Boise, Idaho.</li>
            <li> A good price for the amount of battery packs I received.  I will purchase again when we start running low.</li>
            <li> Very good batteries for my cochlear implant.</li>
            <li> The batteries are needed for my cochlear implants and are a very important element in my hearing.  They arrived quickly and were priced to be competitive with the other sources.  They were a few dollars cheaper than the other sources and the service was great.</li>
            <li> I am a new cochlear wearer....continued to experience problems with the rechargeable batteries....expected to pay much more for disposable....love the convenience</li>
