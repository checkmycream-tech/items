            <li>What really impressed me with the use of this patch was not the discoloration you see after use (I read somewhere that it was a scam)</li>
            <li>B000NBQMC6 60 Gold Upgraded with 60 % Tourmaline Detox Foot Pads/patches Best Quality Cheapest]]The pads</li>
            <li>The morning after the 1st use, I felt great (the aches &amp; stiffness in my legs was gone)</li>
            <li>Great service, too.</li>
            <li>These pads are great to get the toxins out of your body while you sleep.  </li>
            <li>they are so great.</li>
            <li>but I never felt as good after that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good start</li>
            <li>I still have lots of pads, and use them intermittently when I need a good night&#x27;s sleep.  </li>
            <li>I hope you have good results regardless of the mechanism by which they are achieved.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with product.</li>
            <li>I love these foot pads!  </li>
            <li>I do believe the muck that looks like its coming from your body is the inside of packet thickened from warm of your skin, nothing more.</li>
            <li>Also, I started my day refreshed and more energized.  </li>
            <li>So I have been drawn to trying almost aything and reading any book I can find to get better.  </li>
            <li>many years ago that are now approved.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m buying more to see if it continues to do so.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be sure if it was a placebo effect or not</li>
            <li>My husband said he had more energy and it was easier to get up in the morning.</li>
            <li>, I just wanted to see if they had any effect on me because so many reviewers rave about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad if they work for some people, but I doubt I&#x27;ll try them again.</li>
            <li>There are some quality patches out there; for the money, this one is at the top.  </li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t believe it, but i&#x27;ve slept a lot better with these pads and feel  better as well.</li>
            <li>It would be interesting to see how moist the kleenex was in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just ordered more and I will continue to use them.</li>
            <li>All I care about is if I feel any better after using them.      </li>
            <li>and He said it was very good, and feel different every morning.    </li>
            <li>When I used it the first time, I had a good sound sleep just as it claim it would.   </li>
            <li>For skeptics - I&#x27;m right with you but keep in mind there are many treatments and many drugs that were not approved by the FDA or the AMA</li>
            <li>and I think you&#x27;ll enjoy the experience.</li>
            <li>The deep, dreamless sleep that both my co-worker and I experienced</li>
            <li>The metarsals contain the neck and shoulder areas, and the presence of the pads here could explain why I could not find a comfortable position the night that I placed the pads  here.   </li>
            <li>I do not know if this can be attributed to   A - the patches absorbing toxins, or   B - whether my organs were stimulated through reflexology to better process the toxins in my body and help clear my skin and improve my mood, or   C - a good night&#x27;s sleep, whatever the reason, or  D - whether it was all my imagination.    </li>
            <li>The patches arrived quickly, and the customer service was excellent - I had made a typo on my mailing address and emailed them to correct it, and they responded even though it was President&#x27;s Day, AND fixed my mailing address, and I got the patches 2 days later via US Post.    </li>
            <li>the statements aren&#x27;t true - it means we don&#x27;t know for a fact yet and it hasn&#x27;t been \\&quot;endorsed\\&quot; yet.  </li>
            <li>But I decided to purchase twenty for a good starting point.</li>
            <li>Strangely enough, I was able to sleep much better as one of its claims.  </li>
            <li>Felt so much better: more energized definitely!!</li>
            <li>Great adhesive, minimal shifting of contents and works fast!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I first found out about detox foot pads.</li>
            <li>My feet feel sorta clean and tingly all day after removing the patches and I feel generally lighter and energetic.</li>
            <li>It was a very restless night, I tossed and turned all night and could not find a comfortable position.  </li>
            <li>I think they are well worth the money</li>
            <li>Its still fun to see how gross the pads are in the morning (they even kind of smell like bacon... ewe).</li>
            <li>but if it works for some and not others - it might work for me and that makes it worth a try.    </li>
            <li>- she didn&#x27;t live to see the day when my grandmother was given Tomoxifin by her doctor, covered by insurance for her cancer and is over five years cancer free.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it for me to try a longer duration and more patches to see if it continues to have a positive effect on a few of my many symptoms.    </li>
            <li>i dont even know why i bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li>have to order more immediately to get back to sleep!</li>
            <li>I have been intending to test this theory by putting something else on my feet - a folded kleenex with first aid tape, or just the first aid tape, or just the adhesive patch that comes with the patches.  </li>
            <li>I hope it is helpful, and am curious to see if anyone else performed tests or experienced anything similar.  </li>
            <li>The detox patch did such a good job, it also pulled out my helpful medications and left me with the pains and aches I had had under control.</li>
            <li>Also, even if you accept that the pads are absorbing toxins, how do we know they are not also absorbing nutrients and/or medications that our bodies could find useful?    </li>
            <li>I had pretty much stopped driving all together but started again after about 5 days of these..</li>
            <li>I really like the Gold upgraded tourmaline detox foot pads.  </li>
            <li>However, after both my fiance and I put them on our feet for 2 weeks straight, we noticed two things.</li>
            <li>The product seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>Either my body is contaminated with with so much toxic chemicals that 20 pads couldn&#x27;t absorb the toxicity</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather take my money and invest in something real like COQ10 or flax oil</li>
            <li>, that really does improve the way you feel and your health, an known fact.</li>
            <li>The 3rd night I placed the pads back under my arches and experienced another deep, dreamless sleep -</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading this, and</li>
            <li>So for you all out there, I really don&#x27;t know if they will work for you or not.  </li>
            <li>If I just attached the patches, the stain was much like a wet footprint, absent under the arch and present around the edges, where the adhesive enabled good contact.  </li>
            <li>The next morning, I compared his patches with my own, and also with a 3rd silver patch on which I had poured filtered water.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them to everyone who wants an alternative to medicine.</li>
            <li>did not see anything different about my body (cleared up acne or something) or feel any different (more energy, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never would have tried them but a friend of mine highly recommended this product to me</li>
            <li>lol this product is useless</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start with how suspicious I am of new products for healthcare.  </li>
            <li>All right, lets give it 2 weeks, same thing every morning with the thing looking like tar, except one of them fell off early in the night and didn&#x27;t look used at all, so just to experiment</li>
            <li>(untill they run out) &amp; they come out dark brown each time, but the feeling of refreshed &amp; light on my feet seems to be gone</li>
            <li>I could actually feel the pads pulling out the toxins the first night.  </li>
            <li>It was indeed an awakener to actually see this much guck comeing from my body!</li>
            <li>pads never got light (a few nights there were light spots, but it seems to me like the herbs were concentrated in the other spots/</li>
            <li>I think as everyone else thinks, it&#x27;s not exactly confirmed whether these pads actually detox your body or what they do, but I can confirm that I definitely started feeling better, my back pain was reduced a lot, and my sleeping schedule became much more regular.</li>
            <li>I have used several brands and these generic ones seem to be less effective, took forever to arrive &amp; have no customer service...</li>
            <li>20/20 news show states to steer clear of all detox foot pads</li>
            <li>In the 80&#x27;s, someone close to me could not get approval for Tomoxifin for her cancer because it was not scientifically proven to do anything and still experimental</li>
            <li>Stayed the same color the whole time, turned brown wherever my feet perspired.</li>
            <li>We ordered a pack of 100 as soon as we finished this directly from the company.  </li>
            <li>The presence of the patch and adhesive could conceivably stimulate these reflex points, although I don&#x27;t know how they would relate to my sleep pattern.  </li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t care if they detox me or if they really remove toxins out of my body.</li>
            <li>Most of what I have tried has been a waste of money with no results but these actually do something.    </li>
            <li>Lastly, I thought I felt a little less stressed over my normal trigger issues, a little more mellow and able to just go with the flow of the day.  </li>
            <li>I felt the same from the first patch to the last.</li>
            <li>I have used my first set of 20 of these patches and I definitely have noticed a difference in my overall energy.</li>
            <li>and she also reported deep, dreamless sleep and a little more energy the next day.    </li>
            <li>Then it changed and for the next few days had white fuzzy stuff on top of the brown gunk.  </li>
            <li>The first night I placed the pink pads under my arches.  </li>
            <li>I am a very young but sick person - for 5 years now and doctors don&#x27;t seem to be able to do anything but try to mask the pain and symptoms  - only a couple out of 40+ are actually trying to get me better and</li>
            <li>I think elimination of toxins (at least in my case)is by all avenues possible with this and so am using more fiber to help the process.</li>
            <li>There was no reduction in the stuff on the pad during the course of the week that I used the patches, although the shape of the stain was different; it seemed related to how much contact there was.  </li>
            <li>and I have no regrets.</li>
            <li>I slept deeply and did not remember any bizarre dreams in the morning, and I usually wake up several times and remember my dreams.  </li>
            <li>but it will always remind me that experimental or not proven doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t worth a try to improve your quality of life.     </li>
            <li>One important thing I learned, however, is that I should only use it for a few days at a time, due to the supplements and medications I am taking for Fibromyalgia.</li>
            <li>I think that if the patches were absorbing toxins from our bodies, they would have pulled different toxins from different bodies, and that the water test would have been different, so the silver patches all being the same seemed a little suspicious.  </li>

            <li> Lastly, I thought I felt a little less stressed over my normal trigger issues, a little more mellow and able to just go with the flow of the day.  </li>
            <li> I felt the same from the first patch to the last.</li>

            <li> Then it changed and for the next few days had white fuzzy stuff on top of the brown gunk.  </li>

            <li> I slept deeply and did not remember any bizarre dreams in the morning, and I usually wake up several times and remember my dreams.  </li>
            <li> but it will always remind me that experimental or not proven doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t worth a try to improve your quality of life.     </li>
            <li> One important thing I learned, however, is that I should only use it for a few days at a time, due to the supplements and medications I am taking for Fibromyalgia.</li>
            <li> I think that if the patches were absorbing toxins from our bodies, they would have pulled different toxins from different bodies, and that the water test would have been different, so the silver patches all being the same seemed a little suspicious.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very satisfied with product. Needed to return 30 pads, received refund promptly. Am using these pads while they are still wrapped (yes, wrapped)but in my pockets and socks, and they are slowly helping me. (I realize this won&#x27;t work for everyone perhaps, but it saves a lot of expense for those who are put off by paying $1 a patch.) I think elimination of toxins (at least in my case)is by all avenues possible with this and so am using more fiber to help the process.</li>
            <li> The morning after the 1st use, I felt great (the aches &amp; stiffness in my legs was gone) but I never felt as good after that. Even though I&#x27;ve continued to use them once a week (untill they run out) &amp; they come out dark brown each time, but the feeling of refreshed &amp; light on my feet seems to be gone... I still will continue to use them periodically, maybe every 2 to 3 weeks apart.</li>
            <li> I really like the Gold upgraded tourmaline detox foot pads.  I could actually feel the pads pulling out the toxins the first night.  The pads were dark brown when I removed them in the morning.  Each night of use they were lighter in color.  I now use the pads for 3 or 4 nights in a row every 2 weeks.  I have reordered the foot pads.  I think they are well worth the money and I can tell a big difference in my energy level.</li>
            <li> lol this product is useless i dont even know why i bought it in the first place. I hope someday someone realizes the usefullness of this and the medical science behind it..   With the stress and presure of our society and the polution i think this would be like a drop in the ocean...only as a placebo effect i find it usefull</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I first found out about detox foot pads. I had always wanted to try one of those detoxing ion baths but couldn&#x27;t afford one. That being said, I finally decided to get these pads for my fiance and I. I am someone who is extremely into eastern medicine, holistic healing, and alternative lifestyles so I wasn&#x27;t really very skeptical about these. I just thought they would work. However, after both my fiance and I put them on our feet for 2 weeks straight, we noticed two things. One, the pads weren&#x27;t getting any less brown and hard in the morning, and two, if that meant the pads were taking all of these toxins out of our body, we couldn&#x27;t tell. I have come to the conclusion that all these pads do is have some sort of chemical reaction with the sweat that comes out of your feet, turning the pads brown. If you want to try them out, go ahead. Its still fun to see how gross the pads are in the morning (they even kind of smell like bacon... ewe). But I wouldn&#x27;t get these to use as a miracle cure of any sort.</li>
            <li> 20/20 news show states to steer clear of all detox foot pads, water makes the pads turn dark- they dont stink till they get wet, then they smell up your whole bedroom with a awful smell--lab test verify they have no detox properties, just a $$$ makin HOAX---------save your mony for some liver vitamins if ya want a detox--look for metal remover for the liver.&lt;br /&gt;thats no hoax</li>
            <li> What really impressed me with the use of this patch was not the discoloration you see after use (I read somewhere that it was a scam) but the effect it had on me after use.  Strangely enough, I was able to sleep much better as one of its claims.  Also, I started my day refreshed and more energized.  I will continue using the patches and see if the effects that I feel will continue.</li>
            <li> I used all of these patches, and I did not notice any difference at all. I felt the same from the first patch to the last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start with how suspicious I am of new products for healthcare.  I am a very young but sick person - for 5 years now and doctors don&#x27;t seem to be able to do anything but try to mask the pain and symptoms  - only a couple out of 40+ are actually trying to get me better and only a couple of things have truly helped..  So I have been drawn to trying almost aything and reading any book I can find to get better.  Most of what I have tried has been a waste of money with no results but these actually do something.    The first few days they came out brown and gunky like everyone else with it oozing all over my socks - nasty.  Then it changed and for the next few days had white fuzzy stuff on top of the brown gunk.  Out of fear of any unknown ingredients, I only wore them for a few hours each time - not all night like 8+ hours.  Then after a few more days, the gunk was less and less but still alot.    I don&#x27;t care if the gunk is the herbs mixing with your sweat or wet herbs or toxins or whatever.  I had a reduction in swelling (visible, measurable) the day after and no aches in my arches and legs.   I would like to try them elsewhere on my body but haven&#x27;t yet.  It&#x27;s worth it for me to try a longer duration and more patches to see if it continues to have a positive effect on a few of my many symptoms.    For skeptics - I&#x27;m right with you but keep in mind there are many treatments and many drugs that were not approved by the FDA or the AMA etc. many years ago that are now approved.  Everything starts out with \\&quot;no scientific studies\\&quot; and \\&quot;not approved\\&quot;  until there are studies and they are approved.  That doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t work or the statements aren&#x27;t true - it means we don&#x27;t know for a fact yet and it hasn&#x27;t been \\&quot;endorsed\\&quot; yet.  In the 80&#x27;s, someone close to me could not get approval for Tomoxifin for her cancer because it was not scientifically proven to do anything and still experimental - she didn&#x27;t live to see the day when my grandmother was given Tomoxifin by her doctor, covered by insurance for her cancer and is over five years cancer free.  This is just herbs on your feet and I don&#x27;t have cancer but it will always remind me that experimental or not proven doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t worth a try to improve your quality of life.     Many approved and endorsed treatments have been worthless to me and a few actually harmful.  If lots of people write that it sucks - it probably does but if it works for some and not others - it might work for me and that makes it worth a try.    Off my soapbox now - it helped my swelling and I&#x27;m buying more to see if it continues to do so.</li>
            <li> when I got this patch, my roommate asked me what was that    and I explained about this product, and he wanted to try it.    so I gave him half of this,    and He said it was very good, and feel different every morning.    also said he was not sleepy during the day    but I don&#x27;t feel any different     figure of my roommate&#x27;s opinion and mine it is 3 starts</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be sure if it was a placebo effect or not but either way there was some sort of physiological response to these for both my husband and myself.. It helped some pretty bad allergies of mine. I had brain fog so bad before I used these I had pretty much stopped driving all together but started again after about 5 days of these.. My husband said he had more energy and it was easier to get up in the morning. They stink though.. And the brown stuff isn&#x27;t the toxins coming out of your body, it&#x27;s just the reaction the pad has to heat I believe. Anyway, I think it&#x27;s legit and would use them again. (:</li>
            <li> I bought these hoping to feel... something... I have no problems I was trying to cure, I just wanted to see if they had any effect on me because so many reviewers rave about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not see anything different about my body (cleared up acne or something) or feel any different (more energy, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My pads never got light (a few nights there were light spots, but it seems to me like the herbs were concentrated in the other spots/they had slid out of that area), which made sense to me because you&#x27;re just sweating into a bunch of herbs that saturate and show throw the thin layer of material once wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad if they work for some people, but I doubt I&#x27;ll try them again.</li>
            <li> Save your money. These pads did nothing for me. I placed one in a shallow dish of water and low and behold they turned brown, must be all the toxins being pulled out of the water!!! whatta joke. I can&#x27;t believe i fell for the advertising ploy. I wore them every day until the box was empty and i felt no difference. Stayed the same color the whole time, turned brown wherever my feet perspired. You may be tempted to try them but save your money, they do NOTHING.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me.  Turned a little brown with my sweat, but it also turned a little brown when I poured water on it too.</li>
            <li> It was indeed an awakener to actually see this much guck comeing from my body! I used it for one week and it just continued to pull it all out. One important thing I learned, however, is that I should only use it for a few days at a time, due to the supplements and medications I am taking for Fibromyalgia. The detox patch did such a good job, it also pulled out my helpful medications and left me with the pains and aches I had had under control. Now I know to use it only for a few days at a time so my meds aren&#x27;t totally wiped out of my system as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband. I reserved judgement &#x27;till I saw the results. Weird !!  It does what it says on the packet.</li>
            <li> The product seems to work very well.  Twenty patches is enough for ten days.  I recommend getting 2 or 3 enough to last a month.  I also used painters tape to help keep the pads on all night.</li>
            <li> I have used several brands and these generic ones seem to be less effective, took forever to arrive &amp; have no customer service...no one to talk to. I couldn&#x27;t even get my money back!</li>
            <li> There are some quality patches out there; for the money, this one is at the top.  Great adhesive, minimal shifting of contents and works fast!  Great service, too.</li>
            <li> I could not believe the gunk that came out of us.  We ordered a pack of 100 as soon as we finished this directly from the company.  Felt so much better: more energized definitely!!</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t believe it, but i&#x27;ve slept a lot better with these pads and feel  better as well. have to order more immediately to get back to sleep!</li>
            <li> I ordered a 1 week suppy and used as directed, they never got any lighter. All right, lets give it 2 weeks, same thing every morning with the thing looking like tar, except one of them fell off early in the night and didn&#x27;t look used at all, so just to experiment I put it on the sink and added 1 drop of water, after a couple of minutes it looked just like all the other ones that lasted throughout the night. Now I didn&#x27;t do any toxic level testing at start or end but if these things even half what they say they are why aren&#x27;t all the Doctors lining up to give them an endorsement?</li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical about the detox pads. But I decided to purchase twenty for a good starting point. The detox pads get dark and nasty every night, hopefully removing toxins from my body. I think as everyone else thinks, it&#x27;s not exactly confirmed whether these pads actually detox your body or what they do, but I can confirm that I definitely started feeling better, my back pain was reduced a lot, and my sleeping schedule became much more regular. I would definitely recommend purchasing these if you have any interest in detox. It&#x27;s a good start and I think you&#x27;ll enjoy the experience.</li>
            <li> These pads are great to get the toxins out of your body while you sleep.  highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even pretend to understand how or why this works. All I know is, in 3 days I went from having such awful pain in my hips that even rolling over in bed woke me up; to sleeping through the night and getting up in the morning pain free.  Science or snake oil?  I don&#x27;t know and don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000NBQMC6 60 Gold Upgraded with 60 % Tourmaline Detox Foot Pads/patches Best Quality Cheapest]]The pads worked just like it was advertised.  I could see and feel the difference and was amazed by the toxic  removed from me.</li>
            <li> This was like putting Teabags on the bottom of your feet! Either my body is contaminated with with so much toxic chemicals that 20 pads couldn&#x27;t absorb the toxicity or it&#x27;s just coloring from the leaves leaking through the bags to the pads and causing a wet starchy sticky secreation onto the athletic socks I wore on my feet to bed to keep from staining my bed sheets and mattress. I can&#x27;t say it didn&#x27;t work, but in my opinion they don&#x27;t work! I will never purchase these pads again!</li>
            <li> Did not help my husband or myself. yes it leaves that goo on the bottom of your foot but we didnt see any difference. Waste of money. i have to rate it in order to create my review but I give it 0 stars for this product.</li>
            <li> I do believe the muck that looks like its coming from your body is the inside of packet thickened from warm of your skin, nothing more. I could not, nor could hubby tell any difference in how we felt. We are in our 50&#x27;s.  I&#x27;d rather take my money and invest in something real like COQ10 or flax oil, that really does improve the way you feel and your health, an known fact.</li>
            <li> I have used these for 5 days now, they work instantly.  I have had severe back pain for over a year now and it is hard for me to get up in the morning.  THIS HAS CHANGED MY LIFE... I get up with no pain at all.  I have now made my entire family buy them they are so great.</li>
            <li> I love these foot pads!  I use them every night and find that I am less tired during the day, sleep better and longer, as well as feel happier.  I highly recommend them to everyone who wants an alternative to medicine.</li>
            <li> I bought one each of the silver, gold, and pink packages from Health Marvels.  The patches arrived quickly, and the customer service was excellent - I had made a typo on my mailing address and emailed them to correct it, and they responded even though it was President&#x27;s Day, AND fixed my mailing address, and I got the patches 2 days later via US Post.    The first night I placed the pink pads under my arches.  I slept deeply and did not remember any bizarre dreams in the morning, and I usually wake up several times and remember my dreams.  The second night I placed the pads under the metarsals.  It was a very restless night, I tossed and turned all night and could not find a comfortable position.  I felt restless, like I wanted to move or stretch or work out.  The 3rd night I placed the pads back under my arches and experienced another deep, dreamless sleep - but of course I was already tired from lack of sleep the night before so this could be meaningless.    I gave a co-worker 2 sets of the silver and gold and she also reported deep, dreamless sleep and a little more energy the next day.    There was no reduction in the stuff on the pad during the course of the week that I used the patches, although the shape of the stain was different; it seemed related to how much contact there was.  If I just attached the patches, the stain was much like a wet footprint, absent under the arch and present around the edges, where the adhesive enabled good contact.  If I used my feet to alternately press the patches under the arches while I was waiting to fall asleep, the stain was bigger and included the arch where I applied pressure.     I gave my husband the silver patches and used them myself the same night.  The next morning, I compared his patches with my own, and also with a 3rd silver patch on which I had poured filtered water.  All 3 silver sets were the same color and had the same herbal smell.  The pink patches that I saved from the previous night were a different color; I also poured water on a gold patch just to see what it would do.  The pink and gold were different colors than the silver.  I think that if the patches were absorbing toxins from our bodies, they would have pulled different toxins from different bodies, and that the water test would have been different, so the silver patches all being the same seemed a little suspicious.  Also, even if you accept that the pads are absorbing toxins, how do we know they are not also absorbing nutrients and/or medications that our bodies could find useful?    My theory is that the herbs in the patches change color with moisture.  The deep, dreamless sleep that both my co-worker and I experienced, I attribute to the actual presence of the pad on the foot.  (My husband did not acknowledge altered sleep patterns, but he was skeptical and reluctant to try the pads, and only agreed to use them after a week of my asking him to so I could make a comparison.)  According to my understanding of reflexology, which is very limited, the middle (arch) of the bottom of the foot is generally where organs are represented.  The presence of the patch and adhesive could conceivably stimulate these reflex points, although I don&#x27;t know how they would relate to my sleep pattern.  The metarsals contain the neck and shoulder areas, and the presence of the pads here could explain why I could not find a comfortable position the night that I placed the pads  here.   I have been intending to test this theory by putting something else on my feet - a folded kleenex with first aid tape, or just the first aid tape, or just the adhesive patch that comes with the patches.  It would be interesting to see how moist the kleenex was in the morning.  However, I have not gotten around to that yet.    I did notice that a (pimple, zit, ingrown hair?  weird bump that I had had for several months) shrank during the week that I used the patches, altho it did not disappear.  I also thought my skin seemed generally a little clearer.  Lastly, I thought I felt a little less stressed over my normal trigger issues, a little more mellow and able to just go with the flow of the day.  I do not know if this can be attributed to   A - the patches absorbing toxins, or   B - whether my organs were stimulated through reflexology to better process the toxins in my body and help clear my skin and improve my mood, or   C - a good night&#x27;s sleep, whatever the reason, or  D - whether it was all my imagination.    That is my 2 bucks (not cents due to inflation and the length of this post).  I hope it is helpful, and am curious to see if anyone else performed tests or experienced anything similar.  I still have lots of pads, and use them intermittently when I need a good night&#x27;s sleep.  Thanks for reading this, and I hope you have good results regardless of the mechanism by which they are achieved.</li>
            <li> Different strokes for different folks! I&#x27;ve read every review on these patches starting out as quite the skeptic. I have used my first set of 20 of these patches and I definitely have noticed a difference in my overall energy. My feet feel sorta clean and tingly all day after removing the patches and I feel generally lighter and energetic. I think they work. I&#x27;ve just ordered more and I will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> As to whether the detox patches are a scam or not, here is my personal opinion. I personally don&#x27;t care if they detox me or if they really remove toxins out of my body. I don&#x27;t care if the pads test positive for heavy metals after use or not! All I care about is if I feel any better after using them.      The answer to that is a resounding YES! I never would have tried them but a friend of mine highly recommended this product to me so I gave it a shot. When I used it the first time, I had a good sound sleep just as it claim it would.   I felt a little more energized than usual!  Placebo or not, it WORKS!!!    So for you all out there, I really don&#x27;t know if they will work for you or not.  They do for me and I have no regrets.</li>
