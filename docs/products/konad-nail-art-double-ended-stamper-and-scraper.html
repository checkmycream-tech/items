            <li>; I wish I had more image plates to use with it though!</li>

            <li>it is a great product, very practical to use, easy and looks very nice!!</li>
            <li>both parts came ahead of time, in their original packaging, and in perfect;y good shape, and make nice, clean nail polish stamps, and at a great price!</li>
            <li>100% recommended, this stamper is great for nail stamping is a very functional product and a very good brand, i love it</li>
            <li>I filed it lightly before I used it and it worked perfectly from the very first stamp!  </li>
            <li>AMAZING.</li>
            <li>This stamper is amazing.</li>
            <li>The applicator works great; it picks up the color well and deposits it evenly on the nail with a smooth rolling motion.  </li>
            <li>The stamper works amazing.</li>
            <li>and they make my manicures look amazing.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing stamper.</li>
            <li>it has worked amazingly.</li>
            <li>This Works great :)  I love stamping my nails.</li>
            <li>This is nice.</li>
            <li>but it does a good job most of the time.</li>
            <li>if you find a konad stamper w/o the scraper, good for you, but if not, having the scraper won&#x27;t kill you. :)</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and it works great!</li>
            <li>&amp; she wasn&#x27;t able to get any good results as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But over all i liked this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be honest, I did too at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if it is effective with its duty it seams like it would solve both my problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but all u need is practice it works nice</li>
            <li>and u can always do your own designs</li>
            <li>its nice nedw</li>
            <li>I can purchase this item without having to purchase a kit of some kind.</li>
            <li>DId not stay on well or appy on nicely.</li>
            <li>Stamper is really nice with the 2 sizes.</li>
            <li>i have started to do my own nail art</li>
            <li>I can do my own nails and save money.</li>
            <li>and I honestly can&#x27;t ask for anything else considering</li>
            <li>While the concept is a good one, I have to believe there is a better way.</li>
            <li>This is another great product from konad have many stampers glad to add this to my nail stamping collection .</li>
            <li>Scrapper was kind of bent</li>
            <li>but she really liked it</li>
            <li>Must have for every girl who loves to style her own nails.</li>
            <li>It is well made and picks up design nicely.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys stamping, also the scraper is perfect, It does not scratch the plates if held at a 45 degree angle towards yourself plastic cards are over rated and remove too much polish</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li>i can tell you it picks up the image nicely.</li>
            <li>I am buying more for some friends, so that should tell you that I thought this product was good.</li>
            <li>I really liked it.</li>
            <li>I could not find anyone to do nice designs after we moved at the nail places in my area.</li>
            <li>Rolls the image on nicely.</li>
            <li>and I am able to practice my stamper alittle more now that I am happy with the Mash plates and Konad stamper.</li>
            <li>I wish it came with more templates, but for the price a good product.</li>
            <li>Since my wife loves to do her own nails</li>
            <li>This is a really nice set.  </li>
            <li>The stamper works as intended and it is nice to have two stamps in one.  </li>
            <li>The rubber stamp is really nice and cleans up well.</li>
            <li>nice.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased :)</li>
            <li>This is a great stamper, and if you want to create your own starter kit the price can&#x27;t be beat when bought alongside one of the many stamp plate kits available.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to play with, and it makes beautiful nail arts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to nail stamping and was told this was the best stamper to use.  </li>

            <li>Amazing I love it .</li>

            <li>Nails look great and fun designs without having to purchase those stickers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so impressed with the scraper, so I just use an old gift card, instead.</li>

            <li>The ends are soft and pick up images perfectly.</li>
            <li>I followed the recommendation on chickettes.com and using an old credit card really is best.</li>
            <li>the product itself though is amazing, used many times</li>
            <li>Honestly I have not been able to use this item yet</li>
            <li>and I actually liked it MUCH better.</li>
            <li>so glad i bought it because it stamps my nail amazingly</li>

            <li>, I can&#x27;t imagine trying to perfectly place the single designs perfectly with the large side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not to impressed with this stamper I prefer a different kind of stamper .</li>
            <li>The stamper is great, picks up images well, is easy to clean, and I appreciate the two sizes.</li>
            <li>Great quality, the stamper itself is quite easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>Love this product nice to be able to switch ends and not have to pull out another stamper.</li>
            <li>this product is amazing, the stamper is great but the scraper not to much ...</li>
            <li>Also really easy to clean, great brand for nail art.</li>
            <li>This stamper works awesome and the double ended feature is nice as the size of the stamps and people&#x27;s nails vary.</li>
            <li>I used pure acetone to clean the stamper and plates and it cleaned off perfectly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the polish gets picked up pretty great</li>
            <li>so i heard this was great, and shipped fast, but mine still has not come!the polish and plates have already come though!</li>
            <li>Some nail polishes don&#x27;t work so just because it won&#x27;t stamp the first time it could be the nail polish over all great product.</li>
            <li>works great the first time, needs no buffing to get it to work.</li>
            <li>Product was great &amp; fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Worked great even as a first time stamper.</li>
            <li>When I first received this item, I thought they were both great.</li>
            <li>Great quality, works and came right away totally satisfied. : )</li>
            <li>But after trying this stamper set out, I thought the scraper worked just fine!</li>
            <li>Very important to have in order to transfer the design onto the nail.  </li>
            <li>This is extremely easy to work with, we started doing our own nail art</li>
            <li>The size is handy and it&#x27;s easy to grip, but I&#x27;d rather not scratch up my plates.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellent product i highly recommend very good.i loved it.</li>
            <li>It was easy for her to use even the first time, her nails turned out beautifully.  </li>
            <li>The designs picked up and transfered perfectly, looks like a professional did my nails, the plate and scraper were very easy to clean up.  </li>
            <li>This is so easy to use and clean (I use a Q-tip to clean the scrapper)!!!</li>
            <li>its very good and arrived early</li>
            <li>This stamper and scraper are durable, cute, and yield very good and clear results for nail stamping.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a huge hit!</li>
            <li>Got this for my daughter&#x27;s 8th birthday &amp; it was a huge hit with all the kids!  </li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I love this stamper</li>
            <li>it picks up most nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used it multiple times and it&#x27;s consistently excellent.  </li>
            <li>Polish sticks a bit more thsn it should.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Konad stamper...when it is working correctly.  </li>
            <li>I agree with the others who said to be sure to view the youtube tutorial.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to file your stamper and also rubbing the rubber end between your hands and warming it up helps as well.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to use the Konad nail polish as well.  </li>
            <li>This stamper also gives you more pressure when you&#x27;re stamping your design and has more of a handle to roll the stamper across your nail.</li>
            <li>I love the Konad Stamper with scraper.  </li>
            <li>But over all I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I ended up using a gift card instead and that worked much better.</li>
            <li>ive watched many tutorials</li>
            <li>some work better then</li>
            <li>Just remember to file it to get better pickup.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I do recommend it to those who love nail stamping art.</li>
            <li>and I love the stamper</li>
            <li>ENJOY!  </li>
            <li>I already know I will love this product.</li>
            <li>i love this stamper.  </li>
            <li>and she said she&#x27;s never gotten so many compliments before in her life.</li>
            <li>This is a nice cheap way to do your nails.</li>
            <li>but I hope to get some more practice with it when I get some time.</li>
            <li>I love the concept of being able to stamp on all kinds of designs on your nails.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s more to it than you.think.</li>
            <li>Its a cute idea</li>
            <li>..need more opaque polished out come.</li>
            <li>and I am glad that I have 2 sizes to choose from with the stamper.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and if the scrapper ever rusts or gets lost you can always use a credit card or something similar to scrape the polish.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
            <li>or id works alot better then</li>
            <li>but I am getting it! :)</li>
            <li>enjoy!</li>
            <li>The double ended stamper is great!</li>
            <li>go with this one, works well with all brands of plates! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>So I knew for sure it was me that was doing something wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is what make the magic happen on your nails &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>I love my stamper set, it works just like it is supposed to and looks just like the picture.</li>
            <li>This item wouldve made me even more happier if it came with the plastic scraper instead of the metal.</li>
            <li>Ditch the scraper that comes with it - a gift/credit card is so much better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li>I have tried different kinds of stampers and this is the very best.  </li>
            <li>so it would pick up the stamping polish better.  </li>
            <li>the top part&lt;br /&gt;of</li>
            <li>Overall, its great!</li>
            <li>Nothing more.</li>
            <li>the double ends are wonderful..   </li>
            <li>Wear the most.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget the image plates!! :)</li>
            <li>OK SO BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS</li>
            <li>SURE</li>
            <li>Glad I got it.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great idea of putting this together.</li>
            <li>Nothing I read suggested I had to buy more components to use this product.  </li>
            <li>Most people keep saying, \\&quot;I use a gift</li>
            <li>:).</li>
            <li>I know they will love them.</li>
            <li>I just have to practice more</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s overall the best stamping kit I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li>The stamper works most of the time, but it is not Konad.</li>
            <li>I use a flexible plastic ID card and it works much better.</li>
            <li>Since I have purchased this one, I have gotten many more</li>
            <li>but this is still my trusted stamper that I use most times.</li>
            <li>I love my konad stamper.</li>
            <li>The photo I&#x27;ve attached is one of many manicures I did using my konad stamper and image plates.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m wondering if a sponge might work better?</li>
            <li>Was perfect for me as a beginner stamper with short nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but otherwise I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love love love these products.</li>
            <li>Make sure to keep around some non-acetone polish remover when cleaning the stamper or scraper.  </li>
            <li>I have 200+ polishes, nail blog, and have used many products-</li>
            <li>/&gt;i thought it was better than that&lt;</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this set.  </li>
            <li>and I love this stamper</li>
            <li>WOrks much better, the way it should</li>
            <li>I love stamping my nails, and it works well.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend it for girls who love to do their nails.</li>
            <li>Love the quality of the stamp.</li>
            <li>The scraper is ok</li>
            <li>it was better than the one i had before i purchase this one.</li>
            <li>I get more compliments on my nails than ever before, and always bring it with me when I visit friends or family.</li>
            <li>i like this stamp better than any of the others that i have tried.</li>
            <li>the scraper thing is also better than most.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of it, but I know I will with more practice.</li>
            <li>The scraper is ok and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>and I love the product.  </li>
            <li>And you can&#x27;t do any better than the konad brand</li>
            <li>You can use a business card or a playing card and it will scrape off the excess polish just as well or (for me) better than the scraper that comes with this.</li>
            <li>Most of the designs do not come-out or transfer to nail.  </li>
            <li>The scraper takes off most of the polish.  </li>
            <li>but im glad i bout this</li>
            <li>Try use different nail polishes to find the one the works best for you.</li>
            <li>Love, love, LOVE this stamper.</li>
            <li>but I am confident it will work.</li>
            <li>I thought when I ordered this I would be satisfied.</li>
            <li>Simply the best</li>
            <li>Much better price than eBay.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this stamper with a set of 25 stamping plates and all my friends are wondering how I got such perfect designs on my nails!</li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>I love the texture of the rubber stamping ends and the fact that it is removable.</li>
            <li>My granddaughters and I are enjoying the nail stamper.  </li>
            <li>but I think a plastic scraper might work better.</li>
            <li>cute package</li>
            <li>Also bought many of the Konad plates and polish colors for her.  </li>
            <li>Stamper is ok</li>
            <li>It works better if you have the specials nail paints for this.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because it would have been better if it came with a plastic scrapper instead of a metal one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute still have to work it with the plates</li>
            <li>love it, and so do I</li>
            <li>but once you get the hang of it, you absolutely love this tool for nail art stamping :)</li>
            <li>They love it.  </li>
            <li>but i think i need some more practice with it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>you can pick the side that makes it easier to see. :-)</li>
            <li>The Konad Double Ended Stamper works great!</li>
            <li>Bought it to compliment the konad stamping image plate and its ok</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve also heard that some folks scratch up the stamping pads to get the image to transfer better, I did not do this and do not recommend this.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>i love stamping my nails with this product</li>

            <li>being said, I LOVE the double-ended stamper.</li>

            <li>I heard that people sand there stamper a bit to get a better results.</li>
            <li>it works and i am glad i got it..</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product.</li>
            <li>The scraper is better too, with a metal blade that doesn&#x27;t leave remains.</li>

            <li>I love this Konad stamper.</li>
            <li>Much better than the stamper that comes in the starter kit, I would recommend getting this stamper and buys a cheaper brand of plates to go with them.</li>
            <li>So be patient! :)</li>
            <li>Love them both</li>
            <li>An edge piece of a cereal box works better.</li>
            <li>Glad that others shared this tip.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with my stamper :)</li>
            <li>The scraper works better than the M.A.S.H. one.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stamper and scraper.</li>
            <li>I love that it has two sized ends to use.</li>
            <li>I think the stamper is ok,</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s 2 sided</li>
            <li>With that being said make sure you use a nail polish that doesn&#x27;t stain.</li>
            <li>I feel like I need to use it more and more to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>But i love the idea</li>
            <li>I really love the stamper i even bought one for my daughter.</li>
            <li>I love that I can do my fingers and toes with this stamper.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it is two-sided.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a cheaper stamper and scraper and this is definitely better.</li>
            <li>and now I use the scraper only with the plastic part and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>and i am so glad i did.  </li>
            <li>This one works so much better.</li>
            <li>its really cute</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It just works better.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that for my 1st stamper and for me being a beginner to nail stamping</li>
            <li>This scraper wasn&#x27;t working and this wasn&#x27;t the authentic Konad.</li>
            <li>so then more gets on the scraper</li>
            <li>Pleased with the stamp.  </li>
            <li>Love the stamper.</li>
            <li>The stamper is simply the best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m so glad this thing is two-sided....</li>
            <li>It is still usable, but people have mentioned alternative scrapers that may work better.</li>
            <li>This stamper works well and would be even better if the stamps I purchased worked better.</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully if used properly.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just getting into nail stamping after seeing so many cute manicures online.  </li>
            <li>ok you get what you pay for</li>
            <li>So much better than the Pueen one that I also ordered.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times i read the instructions and even look up tutorials on youtube, this does not work.</li>
            <li>I love this....</li>
            <li>what more can i say...</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Even with no practice and cheap polish, my nails look amazing and</li>
            <li>I have tried so many times to stamp on my nails with this product with no results whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>you like and the larger side works perfect for the whole finger nail stamp works great.</li>
            <li>Love this...doesn&#x27;t what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you wipe the end</li>
            <li>I love the metal scrapper I prefer it to the plastic one</li>
            <li>fast shipment and great product :)</li>
            <li>Stamper worked ok after buffing the surface.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to everyone! :)</li>
            <li>So my thoughts is if some of the reviewers have the same problem they should add it to the product description, besides that  this was a great buy!</li>
            <li>Deep matte polishes make especially great stamps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this makes using my stamping plates much better</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Good quality, fast shipping, nice packaging.</li>
            <li>I love the Konad stamper.</li>
            <li>I have created so many nail designs with this.</li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>The stampers that come with many of the stamping plates just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>This product meets my expectations for the most part.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I saw a lot of youtube videos and tutorials of people doing it, I guess I just need more practice.</li>
            <li>just okay.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t regret buying it. :)</li>
            <li>This nail stamper was very easy to use and very easy to clean in between stamps.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this allows you to be creative on your own ways and with your own materials, because no, Konad special nailpolish is not absolutely nesesary, i have tried it all, and it works perfectly with ANY nailpolish if you know how to use it</li>
            <li>this one is really good, works perfectly with most of my polishes, super easy to clean, cheap and just really good overall.</li>
            <li>but it is very worth it for that price!</li>
            <li>I just received this today, and was very excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>however, it looks like it&#x27;ll be very useful!</li>
            <li>I use a old credit card it seems to work just as good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and would reccomend it to anyone who wants to add more design to their nails in a fun and easy way.</li>
            <li>It truly does work great and makes my nails look detailed and pretty.</li>
            <li>picks up the paint pretty good, but sometimes needs sanded a bit for more grip.</li>
            <li>The stamper picks up pretty much any nail polish - saturated colors of course work best.</li>
            <li>I get nice clean stamps with this stamper.  </li>
            <li>I love nail art and trying new ways of getting great designs.</li>
            <li>You will have to buy your own designs and special nail polish.</li>
            <li>It stamps very clean and just wipes away excess polish.</li>
            <li>It works pretty good.</li>
            <li>i loved how fast my order came in!</li>
            <li>On my first try I was delighted to get it</li>
            <li>eh, it pretty good.</li>
            <li>it to, just need to figure out which polishes work best; love the different sizes available on double-ended stamper</li>
            <li>but I would say this one is pretty good for what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li>It cleans up very nicely and the price was decent.  </li>
            <li>The stamp itself is great, and super easy to use, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>, my, my am i happy i did, clean and crisp images as well as</li>
            <li>very good and the double stampers allow for more variability.  </li>
            <li>We were not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy the cheap drug store kind when you can get this for such a good deal and know that it works!</li>
            <li>is worth it!!</li>
            <li>I was NOT disappointed!  </li>
            <li>This product worked great with my new Konad stamp stencil.</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li>Two sides makes it able to switch easily.  </li>
            <li>Love how easy it is to use this product:D</li>
            <li>I heard how you have to get good ones or else they wont work very well and many times people give up!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Overall its a good set for a good price.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I got my own.</li>
            <li>so even if it picked up the image at all, which was rare, it just wasn&#x27;t a smooth process and didn&#x27;t have good results.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean also.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to clean, use, &amp; store.</li>
            <li>I ordered this the 20th of March, and got it the 26th, wasn&#x27;t happy with the shipping, but it was totally worth it!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great quality and the fact that it has a larger and smaller size makes it even more awesome.</li>
            <li>Good quality fun to try new techniques feels good in your hand well balanced I would recommend</li>
            <li>To tell you the truth it is fine and you will love it.</li>
            <li>I decided to get the original Konand along with a sheet of stamps and it is pretty amazing!</li>
            <li>Its easy to roll across your nails and also very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It works much better than any free stamper that may come with your plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and wow it works great</li>
            <li>product is good and the two sides are useful but the scraper is not always easy to clean</li>
            <li>I purchased that cheap stamping kit which you can find at most Sally&#x27;s and drugstores, and I had no luck with that kit.  </li>
            <li>However, with this stamper I am able to use those plates which were included in the cheap stamper kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It came sooner than expected and works perfectly!</li>
            <li>It cam early and works great</li>
            <li>and I find that it helps me &#x27;place&#x27; the image more precisely.  </li>
            <li>So far she says that it is working great.</li>
            <li>She loved the idea of being able to do her own nails without having to go outside of her room.</li>
            <li>Good quality and works really well with</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast on the Konad kit &amp; the price was fair, so I&#x27;d still recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is also easy to clean!  </li>
            <li>very useful stamps bundle, this was a gift to my cousin, and she love it when she use it on her nails.</li>
            <li>However, when it comes out right it comes out amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome, and it makes it easy to do stamps quickly since it&#x27;s double sided.</li>
            <li>It picks up the images perfectly, and it is a lot softer than the other stamper I was using.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get the nail art plate, and polish, and stamper, and scraper to do my nails really cute.  </li>
            <li>I have used other stampers and scraper and have the Konad to be the best.  </li>
            <li>This stamper works the best out of the other stampers I tried.</li>
            <li>Best 6 bucks I&#x27;ve ever spent!</li>
            <li>I use this to put cute and unique designs on my nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool!</li>
            <li>The scraper does its job well but scratches the plates easily.  </li>
            <li>Came quickly, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold</li>
            <li>, I opted against that since it will scrape your discs easily.</li>
            <li>So let me start with saying this is so easy</li>

            <li>Mine worked fine for picking up the design &amp; placing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold and comfortable to work with.</li>
            <li>What I was MOST pleased with was the seriously FAST delivery!</li>
            <li>and it worked fine,</li>
            <li>so I have to say that I like it just fine.</li>
            <li>This one works just fine with the plates.</li>
            <li>and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that works, but the scraper worked fine for me.</li>
            <li>It probably would&#x27;ve been fine if I had received the stencils</li>
            <li>scraper works just fine, but</li>
            <li>Works just fine</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean, easy to store or travel with.</li>
            <li>Better for acrylic nails, not natural nails but does pick up the images great.</li>
            <li>and they both work fine.  </li>
            <li>Once I got used to it, it works fine.</li>
            <li>Stamper works like magic without the need to file it like so many forums suggest when you first start stamping.</li>
            <li>It picks up and applies designs smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li>The stamper works fine though I guess...</li>
            <li>:) ugh, love it so much!</li>
            <li>The holder works fine but the scraper scratches the plates.  </li>
            <li>The holder and stamper work fine.</li>
            <li>The stamp in this kit works just fine, but I would have never found that out if it weren&#x27;t for me already owning a stamp and scraper that I got from a mall vendor.</li>
            <li>No need to buff the stamp, the scraper worked fine, if you are worried about scratching your plate try using a credit card instead.</li>
            <li>Both the stamper and the scraper worked fine.  </li>
            <li>We did not need to wipe it off w/ polish remover each time &amp; the images came out fine.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in a very timely manner and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Very fun and easy to use</li>
            <li>Easily transfers the design and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, easy to use.</li>
            <li>its so easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and easy to take with you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun &amp; really easy to have cute images without going to a nail salon.</li>
            <li>Such cute &amp; fun things I can do with my nails!!!!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use my first time</li>
            <li>Time after time her nails looked perfect with little effort.</li>
            <li>I love this stamper so much!!</li>
            <li>This little gem is awesome.</li>
            <li>BAM you got some cute nails for that hot date or work or for the heck of it!</li>
            <li>Very good everything I expected.</li>
            <li>I cut it in half for better grip and it worked!!!</li>
            <li>I was super excited when I got my konad stamping kit because I&#x27;ve seen so many youtube tutorials using this</li>
            <li>The seller should put an accurate pic of the product being sold and lower the price.</li>
            <li>This product was a huge let-down.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge hit.</li>
            <li>Since most people would use the pink side anyway I think this is still a great choice.</li>
            <li>The stamper is fabulous though</li>
            <li>It was worth the purchase price and even with the frustrations, I still do enjoy using it!</li>
            <li>Lightly sand the two tips with your nail filer.</li>
            <li>It sometimes takes a few times to get the image perfect.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and use.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy doing my nails now, and with so many different nail art stamp plates out there, it&#x27;s totally worth it and great price.</li>
            <li>If you want perfectly smooth nail designs saturated with color, you need this stamper.</li>
            <li>So happy, I might even order a second one!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>no one tells you online is that you have to press lightly onto the stamp for the color to transfer.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve ever tried the nail decals you know how bothersome and messy they can be, this is a great alternative to those!</li>
            <li>The stamper is easy to clean, and you can peel off the polish, easy, but the scraper is a PAIN to clean.</li>
            <li>Stamper is sooo easy to clean.</li>
            <li>So I did a bunch of research on these after i &amp;#34;got burned&amp;#34; buying a cheap one from another site.  </li>
            <li>the big end is great for an all-over design.</li>
            <li>This double end stamper works  great</li>
            <li>This stamper is GREAT quality, especially for its affordable price!!!!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s lots of free tutorials online that help get you started.</li>
            <li>You def need some practice but its fun to get creative with them.</li>
            <li>my opinion, it is quicker and easier to pain onto your nail free style...</li>
            <li>The ends of the stamper clean easy and and the scraper works well.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but will condition it as the videos tell you to, by lightly sanding with an emery board (nail file).</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>it just takes practice to get the whole stamp on nicely.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t give up, be patient with yourself and most of all have fun.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t give up, be patient with yourself and most of all have fun.</li>
            <li>It easy  to clean too</li>
            <li>Do not buy, it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>it picks up nicely and works very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to spend any more money on polishes (I have around $500 worth of polish already).</li>
            <li>What came in the mail was a genuine Konad stamper.</li>
            <li>It also probably requires the Konad nail polishes because not every color I had went on smoothly and visibly.</li>
            <li>Did not work with cheap polishes</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t regret buying at all .. totally worth this price and more</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to clean the scraper and stamp.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t as smooth as this one</li>
            <li>The larger end of the stamper is great, the smaller end didnt work that great for me.</li>
            <li>However the stamper is to smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The stamper is to smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the genuine konad stamper</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like the sound of metal on metal.</li>
            <li>It even works great with regular polishes.</li>
            <li>The double ended stamper works great.  </li>
            <li>This is such a great thing to buy some one into nails.  </li>
            <li>For this, I make a ring of tape and have it available before I stamping.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice (don&#x27;t know how) that it was a double stamper and that works out great for my pinky nails.</li>
            <li>Both the sides the rubber stamp part actually comes all the way off which is great for cleaning.</li>
            <li>The surface of the stamper is sufficiently sized and the scraper doesn&#x27;t scratch the stamp plate like the cheap one does.</li>
            <li>it is just really light colored when you stamp)</li>
            <li>I have had the most success with Orly Luxe, China Glaze Champagne Bubbles and Celeb City by Sally Hansen.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s easy to transfer designs and easier to clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>Cleanly applies the image and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>It smoothly picks up the polish and transfers it to your nail.</li>
            <li>Overall, for the price, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great for smaller images on the narrower of the two ends.</li>
            <li>cheating at being fabulous.</li>
            <li>It would save your plates from the damaging effects of the metal scraper &amp; it&#x27;s free.</li>
            <li>They work great and this is my second one.</li>
            <li>The product is great enough..</li>
            <li>I read the reviews thinking I was about to get a lovely, cheap, and fun nail art device.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap ones, this works perfect.  </li>
            <li>After stamping the image, I wait for a couple of minutes so to avoid smearing, then put top coat on gently without letting the brush touching the design.</li>
            <li>its the templates I am trying to use that do not make a good clear shape.</li>
            <li>With Konad stamper and some nail stamping plates, I can create whatever design in whatever color I desire, and if I find a design I love I can use it as much as I want :)</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and it worked with other nail polishes than konad nail art polish, which is great since I never bought any :)</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described, easy to use and easy to clean!</li>
            <li>I was able to start using it right away</li>
            <li>that´s where I am right now, I have to wait up to two weeks for the guarantee team at Amazon to investigate my case and see if they will be able to refund my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Had to see many YouTube videos to use it right way but still not</li>
            <li>at home results more fun, quick and easy now</li>
            <li>I think this was very worth the price, and I can see myself using it over and</li>
            <li>The stamps are perfect sizes the big one gets the whole design and the small side is perfect for pinky toes and nails</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast and even though the stamper comes in protective plastic, the seller also put it in a nice thick padded envelope, so it arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>The company very kindly issued a refund without me having to deal with shipping it back.  </li>
            <li>If you have the patience to stamp, and even more patience to clean up, then these tools are fun to use.</li>
            <li>i had seen reviews on youtube about other brands of stamper and scraper and the overall consensus is that to get a good clean stamp, it is best to use a scrape with a metal blade as opposed to one with a plastic end.</li>
            <li>So far I really love how it performs because the stamper is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Other than that, works great and is super easy to use!</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s my first time, I need a bit practice to be more accurate to get the designs on my nails.</li>
            <li>I just filed both the stamper heads lightly with a filer and then used a piece of scotch tape to clean the stamper.</li>
            <li>The larger end works great for a full nail design and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a noob to stamping but this stamper is super easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use, even for beginners.</li>
            <li>This is my first stamper and scrapper set, so far the stamper has worked great</li>
            <li>Easy payment options and quick shippment.</li>
            <li>The shipping came pretty fast which was good.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Her 9 year old friend tried it and she was able to do it on her own after a quick demo.</li>
            <li>Quick, easy, no prepping needed.</li>
            <li>It is also perfect for use on my neices little fingers!</li>
            <li>and I find this simple setup fascinating and easy.  </li>
            <li>It is super simple to use and gives great results.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s dubble sided, nice and soft, picks up design easily.</li>
            <li>I love doing nail art, but sometimes I just don&#x27;t feel like doing it, so an easy fast fun way to spice up my fingertips is to use the stamping art!</li>
            <li>It requires some skill, but it&#x27;s definitely worth trying if you&#x27;re a nail enthusiast!</li>
            <li>This product is well worth it!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use this.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for small fingers.</li>
            <li>Excited to use this with the group of design plates.</li>
            <li>THAT WHEN U DO YOUR FIRST STAMP MAKE SURE AFTERWARDS</li>
            <li>This Konad Nail Art Double Ended Scraper and Stamper is the best in its class by far!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not user friendly.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered and it works most of the time.</li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t want to splurge on the Konad plates, the stamper is worth it!  </li>
            <li>worth the 5 dollars no problem!</li>
            <li>Ok the first time i knew about konad was on YouTube</li>
            <li>I know that on Christmas morning she is going to be so excited to see this.   </li>
            <li>If i had known this stamper was so great i would have bought it a long time ago</li>
            <li>Some of the images don&#x27;t work so well, but it&#x27;s alot of fun to use with my step daughter!</li>
            <li>so the small one worked best for my pinky.</li>
            <li>my first purchase and many of the women said the metal scraper would scratch the stamp plates</li>
            <li>fun with this!  </li>
            <li>I like this stamp better than the one that came with my first kit.  </li>
            <li>so you are able to stamp exactly where you want.</li>
            <li>but when you do, it&#x27;s so much fun!</li>
            <li>We have so much fun with these!</li>
            <li>Pretty ok, but you cant get the exactdesigns as they show on TV</li>
            <li>Definitly buy alooooooot of plates, and make sure you have pure acetoneso it can be cleaned smoothly.</li>
            <li>The scraper is great - you need to make sure you clean it well ( the nail polish will get stuck in the little holes that hold the metal in place )</li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s to new and won&#x27;t work effectively.  </li>
            <li>Makes doing nail art fun and easy.  </li>
            <li>AND it doesn&#x27;t have the pesky rim that you have to clean every time you do a nail</li>
            <li>You can clean the rubber off w/your finger nail or rub it w/your finger.  </li>
            <li>a damp washcloth- a clean stamp helps designs transfer.&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li>Clean the plate and Stamper and card after each apply with acetone remover with a CLOTH not cotton balls.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use acetone to clean it just scotch tape..</li>
            <li>I have used several nail art products but Konad is by far the best!</li>
            <li>This made stamping so easy and fun to do.  </li>
            <li>As I mentioned, easy to use and a lot of fun.</li>
            <li>product, just wish it was easier to clean.</li>
            <li>It transfers so cleanly.</li>
            <li>THAT U CLEAN EACH STAMPING</li>
            <li>like others said, a gift card works just as well and is easier to clean.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it locally and was thrilled to get it here :-)</li>
            <li>One thing, in rode rto attach well the image, you have to clean it every time otherwise, doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Best way to clean the stamper: one of those lint rollers that&#x27;s an over-sized cylinder of sticky tape.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still doesn&#x27;t come clean.</li>
            <li>This works much better and my nail art looks more professional.</li>
            <li>IMO, an expired giftcard works just as well and is easier to clean off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fun and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>clean looking on the nail</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t clean the stamper with nail remover.</li>
            <li>I heard acetone gets absorbed into your skin very quickly</li>
            <li>And always clean the stamp, image plate, and scraper after each use with Acetone nail polish remover (I use a Q-tip dipped in acetone.</li>
            <li>I clean it with alcohol between uses</li>
            <li>and I clean the stamper with acetone between each application.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it will come more naturally to others. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to use for easy designs.  </li>
            <li>One tip is to clean the stampers, scraper and plate with rubbing alcohol instead of acetone nail polish remover, so you won&#x27;t damage the plate and melt away the rubber stamp tips.</li>
            <li>gotta clean each time after use....ummm</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, not bad, but really, the scraper doesn&#x27;t work any better than a credit card.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you practiced a lot more with it, you&#x27;d be good, but it never really cut it for me.</li>
            <li>But I still think this is a great stamper to have if it will be your first cause you certainly will get much use out of both sides.</li>
            <li>and it came with the single ended stamper which works great.</li>
            <li>I got these dupe suggestions from a famous nail-tutorial youtuber (elleandish) and they are pretty good replacements if you don&#x27;t wanna spend the extra money.</li>
            <li>this by FAR is my favorite!</li>
            <li>It  picks up the polish great, and as long as I work quickly</li>
            <li>(Special Introductory Price)]]</li>
            <li>The scraper is nothing special, it does scratch the plates though.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have to be the Konad \\&quot;special polish\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>but they sell special polish for it</li>
            <li>However, the large side of this stamper is fantastic for doing toe nails or an all over nail print!</li>
            <li>just right!</li>
            <li>They were so right!  </li>
            <li>A credit card is probably a cleaner way to go since nail polish will be harder to clean in the corners of the metal/plastic, but this still works great.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and works like it says; just be sure to clean it after every use with nail-polish remover.</li>
            <li>The scraper works really well; just make sure you clean it after each use.</li>
            <li>This little stamper worked awesome, exactly like it was supposed, to no complaints here.</li>
            <li>Came in quick works great haven&#x27;t had a single problem with it</li>
            <li>Great little stamper, really like that it is a simple yet a great tool for giving your nail a bit more.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to &#x27;file&#x27; the end of the stamper as some users mentioned to get the image to transfer; it worked just fine right out of the package.</li>
            <li>It works just fine right out of the box(well</li>
            <li>With the right polishes, you can quickly and easily give yourself a fancy professional-looking manicure.</li>
            <li>delivery was great and the seller got it to me way before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always use the scraper with some designs I use the straight edge of a scrap of tag board, like packaging inserts, it works better on wider designs (because you can cut it to size) and you can just toss it out instead of cleaning it.</li>
            <li>I was taking my dear sweet time and the polish dries and then won&#x27;t stick to the stamper or your nail  5)</li>
            <li>but I heard only good things about the konad stamper.</li>
            <li>I clean the product and try to do everything quickly</li>
            <li>I personally have not had a good experience with this product I bought one for myself and my daughter got one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li>I recommend using a different scrapper if you make this purchase, but the stamper itself is a good one.</li>
            <li>LOVE the whole stamping \\&quot;thing\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>n most of them seem to work very well.</li>
            <li>,It picks the images very nicely.but its better to use the plastic scraper to avoid scratches on plate..</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stamper.</li>
            <li>i liked this product but now i replaced the scraper with old credit card as it was scratching my plates.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because sometimes it doesn&#x27;t pick up the designs, but overall it does a good job.</li>
            <li>I read that one should file the stamper gently to help it grip the nail polish better</li>
            <li>Nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It picks up patterns well especially if you use a good polish.</li>
            <li>My teen loved them.</li>
            <li>She loves to do peoples nails and paints her own nearly every day.</li>
            <li>this item is way to cool</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably have to buy some stamping polish to get the full utility out of it.</li>
            <li>I had a Salon Express stamper before this one &amp; this enabled me to get a full transfer.  </li>
            <li>I had problems transferring full sized images and couldn&#x27;t get some images to pick up period.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It helps a lot to have one of the manicure clean-up pens for your cuticles (full of nail polish remover) because some of the pattern will stick to your skin.</li>
            <li>[...] My absolute favorite konading polishes are Sally Hansen Insta-Dri</li>
            <li>I tried this stamping product at a friends and it worked so well and looked so cool</li>
            <li>Always check the stamp before stamping it onto your nail to make sure the whole image has transferred.</li>
            <li>Overall it is was a good purchase</li>
            <li>i use regular polish and it work really good</li>
            <li>Go straight to Konad Brand, this one takes away all the hasle :)</li>
            <li>Sometimes you have to stamp a nail twice for full coverage which could ruin the look of the design.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend this to ANYONE who wants to start stamping :)</li>
            <li>I bought this for about $5 and it was the most reasonable price I found throughout the websites.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s smaller than I was expecting which is good because it&#x27;s easier to hold.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also read that gently filing the stamp heads with a nail file helps your polish grab onto the stamper better, if you&#x27;re having transferring problems.</li>
            <li>I think the animal prints plate is a good starting point for beginers because you don&#x27;t have to worry about placement looking off with those designs.</li>
            <li>I can use such a good scraper with but will hang on it.</li>
            <li>After much research, I decided not to use the scraper as so many people warned it would scratch the plates.</li>
            <li>This is a good brand though and not generic.</li>
            <li>This stamp is great for full nail and partial nail designs.  </li>
            <li>One thing I want to say about this product, which as far as I know wasn&#x27;t in any of the reviews, if this is your first time buying a stamper, make sure you look at the tutorial on YouTube and also make sure that you FILE YOUR STAMPER before the first use!!</li>
            <li>From the first try everything stamped so easily without using Konad special polish because they haven&#x27;t arrived as of today.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for full nail designs and for small detail designs!</li>
            <li>The excess polish left on the stamper peels right off, it&#x27;s freaking amazing!</li>
            <li>The stamper is super easy to use and feels good in your hand, I didn&#x27;t use the scraper only because I heard that using an old gift card or credit card would be better and it does work.</li>
            <li>It was be nice if the stamp was in a less popular color though.</li>
            <li>I just got my first stamper and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, even for a first time</li>
            <li>HAVE YET TO TRY IT, BUT LOOKS PRETTY EASY.</li>
            <li>The large red end is great for full nail designs.</li>
            <li>The small end is perfect for single images while the big side is perfect for full nail and tip designs.      </li>
            <li>Other than that it is a great buy.</li>
            <li>Other than that the stamper works great.</li>
            <li>This stamp system is so fun and unique.</li>
            <li>Like the other reviews, they are great products.</li>
            <li>This stamper works great, and I have not had problems with the scraper damaging my plates, as I have read other people mention.</li>
            <li>It definitely worked best to apply the stamper with some pressure in one smooth motion from left to right.</li>
            <li>Based on other reviews, I did use a nail file to \\&quot;buff\\&quot; the stamper, and I&#x27;ve gotten perfect stamping results, Overall, great product and an obvious must if you want to do nail art stamping!</li>
            <li>Results with this stamper can be awesome -- but mastering it takes serious practice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit time consuming having to clean after every stamp to remove the polish from the plate, scraper, and any from the stamper, but it&#x27;s certainly worth it.</li>
            <li>After MANY tries I was able to do it easily.</li>
            <li>Is so easy to decorate nail with and looks so professional with easy clean up....</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>many many times I finally got the image to stick onto it.</li>
            <li>Love the double end stamper but the scraper is just ok.</li>
            <li>, he nails look more professional than the free hand designs I sometimes get at the salon.</li>
            <li>arrived pretty quickly!</li>
            <li>Im hoping the seller will reply quickly or Im going to ask for my refund.</li>
            <li>Item shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>The image dries to quickly when trying to put it on your nails</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I think this stamper will save you a lot of money all need is some  different design nail plates  to go alone with it and some cute polish, and you are set :)</li>
            <li>it ships quick.</li>
            <li>I have only used it once and find that it makes a difference when you file the stamper bottom with a nail file to ensure you are able to get the most defined design patterns.</li>
            <li>Quickly sent.</li>
            <li>Quick ship.</li>
            <li>Did a quick try - can&#x27;t wait till the weekend - looks like a winner to me.</li>

            <li>I love the way that there are many different plates I can get.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m usually successful, but then I fail on my own nails!</li>
            <li>(Which is 10 times at least) all in all, it was the best purchase and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Quick response, as well.  </li>
            <li>Received item quickly.  </li>
            <li>Quickly shipped.</li>
            <li>It is so much better to just use an old credit card or old reward card it works 100 times better!</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this stamper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>File the ends of the Stamper lightly before first use.</li>
            <li>This is my very first experience with stamping.</li>
            <li>It felt somewhat cheap and it did not transfer the design onto the finger consistently.</li>
            <li>The scraper itself has not been used as I don&#x27;t want to damage my plates due to the metal edge, but an old gift card or credit card works perfectly.</li>
            <li>This was cheap, but has been holding up very well!</li>
            <li>Very First Stamper...</li>
            <li>I dont have a lot of experience with nail art but had no difficulty using it the very first time.</li>
            <li>I use a normal razor blade because it&#x27;s neater and seems to do the job better.</li>
            <li>I am also attaching a photo of my very first manicure with this stamper</li>
            <li>The scraper is nice too, easy to hold though harder to clean.</li>
            <li>I have used this a few times and love it, It is very easy to use and cleans fairly easy.</li>
            <li>It was here super fast and works like a charm!!</li>
            <li>This is great for those smaller designs that you want in a particular place.  </li>
            <li>Awesome for doing large or small designs.</li>
            <li>but its fun and is great for the big toe nail where the design doesnt need the top coat and the margin for error is bigger</li>
            <li>The only thing you have to make sure is that your card isn&#x27;t chipped, make sure its smooth and straight.    </li>
            <li>I refuse to buy special polishes at this point, as I have seen loads of tutorials on Youtube using polishes I already own, but I may decide to in the future if I can&#x27;t get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>I love new nail ideas, techniques, and products.</li>
            <li>Hopefully they come out with something more new and improved.</li>
            <li>If you have an instagram account and if you love posting new nail design on your bio</li>
            <li>I have many compliments every time I put on new nail arts.</li>
            <li>The stamper was great at first as well, but now the rubber pieces often fall out which is less than great when you&#x27;re trying to be careful while doing your nails.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy order fast shipment.</li>
            <li>This stamper really does make stamping easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very durable, and easy to clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once figured, like others said, it was fast and easy.</li>
            <li>Overall good product, I got exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Make sure you file both ends before using it the first time or the images won&#x27;t really stick.</li>
            <li>I think this would be a good gift for a little girl, so easy a kid could use it.</li>
            <li>The large one is perfect for my thumb, and the smaller side is great for my other fingers, especially my pinky.</li>
            <li>Very professional looking, easy and just fun!</li>
            <li>The following ones are better!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I love unexpected surprises!</li>
            <li>Nail polish cleans off very well with almost no acetone!!</li>
            <li>Works pretty well!</li>
            <li>stamper and plates arrived the same day, so I immediately used them, and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>First time I tried the Konad scraper I was floored!  </li>
            <li>Works very well!!</li>
            <li>good stuff, does a great job with picking up the patterns off the plates big or small.</li>
            <li>Works really well!!</li>
            <li>Stamper broke on first use!</li>
            <li>I can have cute professional looking designs on my nails and change them every day if I want!</li>
            <li>I should of gotten it first and saved myself some money!</li>
            <li>as a recent obsessor over nails, I was so happy to stumble upon this lovely invention.</li>
            <li>but this really makes stamping easy and fun.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and the small end is perfect for my pinky nail or smaller stamps.</li>
            <li>However, an old credit card or the like works very well (better even!)    </li>
            <li>your curious about this whole stamping process, if you can do it, if the results are easy and look as good</li>
            <li>Stamping is a great way to add a  little bit of flair to your nails.</li>
            <li>Great product, could use a little work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little tricky for kids to use, but they were just as happy picking out the designs and colors and letting me do the stamping.</li>
            <li>I do find that using a credit card is more effective than the little metal scraper they include because 1.</li>
            <li>You paint on the image plate with the konad special polish, scrape the excess off, dab the stamper on it, and PRESTO the image is ready to apply to your nail!</li>
            <li>the local mall u can find these for 20 but this price is amazing</li>
            <li>It took some trial  and error to figure out how to use the product and a few YouTube videos, however I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>scrapper is great, you just have to use it carefully to avoid scratching your plates, do not use too much force against the plates and</li>
            <li>it works great after you have practiced a few times.</li>
            <li>While you can use different stamping plates or do it free hand, use different brands of nail polish, or use a business or playing card as the scraper the one thing you NEED to become a great nail stamper and can&#x27;t do without is the stamping tool.</li>
            <li>these are fun and it works great - gives a salon look without the price and trouble</li>
            <li>Must use a fast, light hand to transfer designs from stamper to nail.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t even pull up a whole stamp from a plate because it doesn&#x27;t fit on it.  </li>
            <li>I use the metal scraper too, worked better than an old card for me.</li>
            <li>This works well, purchased it with the bundle monster manicure plates and now am sporting some fun finger and toe nail art</li>
            <li>all in all, it&#x27;s a fun tool</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have the two sizes for smaller designs and nails!  </li>
            <li>Fun stamper.  </li>
            <li>As regards to the scraper, I have found that using an old credit card/gift card works better than the scraper that comes with this kit.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Konad double ended stamper on Friday morning and received it in Saturday&#x27;s mail, I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting it until Monday</li>
            <li>and i thought it was pretty cool.</li>
            <li>and it is really useful.</li>
            <li>Go all the way with Konad, it&#x27;s worth your money.</li>
            <li>However, you may be okay with not buying the scraper because I&#x27;ve used an old gift card</li>
            <li>handy if you are doing a design the same color as the stamp-</li>
            <li>You get 20-some plates with 4-8 designs on them and they&#x27;re lots of fun.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to people of all ages who want to be a bit more experimental with their nails.</li>
            <li>Idk if its worth it to buy their stamping polish at this point....</li>
            <li>It fits well in your hand and it is nice to have several sizes to choose.</li>
            <li>So far it is my wife&#x27;s favorite stamper and scraper.</li>
            <li>i hope its worth the wait!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I think the quality of this item is well worth</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re golden.</li>
            <li>For the price it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>This item takes practice to master, but is worth the effort once you fet the hang of it.</li>
            <li>so far I love it.</li>
            <li>, instead I use an old gift card which works out well because it is rather easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare though and it works 99% of the time.</li>
            <li>Over all, the stamper its self is worth the money</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s was worth buying for my nail art collection accessories.</li>
            <li>the sponge part on the stamper fell out, poorly manufactured however great for stamping!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much worth it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the scraper, old gift cards work better.  </li>
            <li>Still learning how to use properly, but so far I&#x27;m happy with this stamper.</li>
            <li>I think it is definitely worth it even just for the stamper and to use something else for the scraper.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>This product is fun</li>
            <li>I find that an old credit/ID card works SO much better.</li>
            <li>The konad stamper is by far much better</li>
            <li>This helps it to pick up the image more completely.  </li>
            <li>A lot of fun.</li>
            <li>have purchased four stampers, this one is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>but this is totally worth buying.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny I paid for it.</li>
            <li>it works well, the 2 sides are useful.</li>
            <li>and it took me a couple tries before I got a good image to come off the stamp.</li>
            <li>I was able to use this on my cheap plates and konad plates and it picked up polish so much better than my old generic stamper.</li>
            <li>it will keep forever,  the product arrived in a timely fashion, I was thrilled and will be using it next weekend.</li>
            <li>This has been fun for me to use and I have received a lot of comments from others that they like it.</li>
            <li>since is the only stamper i own</li>
            <li>I feel that the difference in quality when applying the stamps makes this set worth the price difference.</li>
            <li>Still worth it</li>
            <li>Just grab an old gift card :)</li>
            <li>I just use an old hotel key card as my scraper and it works great.</li>
            <li>Me and my daughter have so much fun with this stamper and scraper.  </li>
            <li>So well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s worth mentioning that the rubber ends of the stamper can be pulled out, if you need them to for whatever reason.</li>
            <li>One time I put the rhinestones that I was going to use for a friends manicure in there, that way all I had to do was open up the stamper, it came in handy, so there&#x27;s an idea.</li>
            <li>Instead, use an old credit card - that&#x27;s what I do, and it&#x27;s much more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did find using an old credit card to rub off the excess polish works better than the blade in this package.  </li>
            <li>I liked the actual stamper piece.  </li>
            <li>I rarely do my nails until now.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This system took me a lot of getting used to, but it&#x27;s so worth</li>
            <li>Also found that an old credit card as a scraper worked consistently much better than the metal or plastic versions I got in these kits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found out that an old credit card works a lot better.</li>
            <li>I have found that using an old credit card or store loyalty card works WAY better than the scrapper.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t as picky about something being perfectly even or straight as we are when we get a little older.</li>
            <li>Period.n&#x27;t as picky about something being perfectly even or straight as we are when we get a little older.</li>
            <li>and I think I got the hang of it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>This item Arrived quickly and exactly as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>The green end is perfect for single detail items and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>Once the image is on the nail make sure you&#x27;re very careful about putting on a top coat as that can smudge your image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>With a credit/gift card, you don&#x27;t have to dig deep with a q-tip to make sure the polish is gone, you just have to run it between some cotton soaked in acetone and behold, it&#x27;s as clean as when you started.</li>
            <li>The double-ended design is nice - the small end is great for smaller images and/or doing my pinky nails</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the scraper, but just as good as other scrapers I have used.  </li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>I purchased this stamper due to the good reviews Konad received from nail design blogs.</li>
            <li>We are brand new to stamping our nails and this little stamper works very good.</li>
            <li>But right now its now meeting my expectations.</li>
            <li>and i know im doing it right...</li>
            <li>After about 3 uses, one of the stampers fell right off the end.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t get it to work well and look right.</li>
            <li>I use the stamper right away</li>
            <li>One customer has offered a right picture but it concludes a plate which is not concluded in the package.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It picked up images clearly right away.</li>
            <li>I got this right away.</li>
            <li>I like that this stamper doesn&#x27;t need to be &amp;#34;primed&amp;#34;; it works perfectly right out of the package.  </li>
            <li>I have used every polish on the face of this planet and NOTHING works right.</li>
            <li>The polish wipes right off when done.</li>
            <li>Works great, love the two sided design, very easy to hold and easy to see pink and red polishes on the green side.</li>
            <li>All positive things to say about this set!</li>
            <li>first attempting to do my own and create different designs...</li>
            <li>Now, I know how (you need to clean the plate really fast and use the scraper in an angle.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the smaller side because the larger side is just so much more efficient, but more power to you if you think you need it. :)</li>
            <li>The price was pretty nice and it only took three days to get to me.</li>
            <li>Also very east to clean.</li>
            <li>dazzling possibilities become super exciting, and the fact that once you get this down, you can make pretty sweet insta-amaze-o designs on your nails in less than 10 minutes is handy and feels like winning/</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean and makes the whole process simple and efficient!</li>
            <li>If you are new to Konading, here are the two sites that really helped me get started on Konadicure :)    </li>
            <li>a very smart purchase</li>
            <li>I like that it is easy and comfortable to use and that the stamper has 2 different sizes.  </li>
            <li>I just got my Konad stamper a few days ago and am loving it!  </li>
            <li>all it takes is a normal to light amount of pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its great for small details when using the konad plates.</li>
            <li>This kit looks cool but does not work very well.</li>
            <li>Hope you guys have fun with your Stamper and Scraper, I really do recommend it!</li>
            <li>I read multiple times that Konad is the best of the best and even if you fail with other stampers, try again with the Konad.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how fast it goes (I can stamp all of ours in under 10 min), and everyone assumes we&#x27;ve gotten them professionally done!  :-)</li>
            <li>(Squishy is something to look for so when you&#x27;re doing full nail designs the stamper can reach every curve/groove/edge of the nail for a clean, complete look.)</li>
            <li>I was really skeptical of this entire concept, but I was too impressed and envious of all the cool nail-art I was seeing online (mostly on Pinterest and some blogs).</li>
            <li>Stamper and Scraper is a good buy for someone that has small nails, I also have the original one that Konad came out with first</li>
            <li>I took one star away only because the scraper is hard to clean and sometimes not the best, depending on what plate I&#x27;m using.  </li>
            <li>I use Sinful Colors nail polish because it is thick enough (and cheap but great) that the nail stamper picks up the color easily.</li>
            <li>The polish transfers from plate to nail seamlessly and excess polish cleans off easily with a bit of nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The konad stamper transfers the image from my plates clearly and easily.</li>
            <li>I noticed the stamper was slightly tacky (which is good)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping time was good, but you can imagine how surprised I got when instead of getting the Konad Nail Art Double Ended Stamper And Scraper, I got a Klean Color Neon Lacquer Mini Collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the rubber is soft which makes it much easier to get the design on your nails, I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>When I received this one yesterday I was really surprised how easy it was.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with polishes and plates of tons of different brand, and I&#x27;ve never felt like I was missing anything because of that...</li>
            <li>Also the shipping was quick and price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>my nails are short so the smaller is great for them.</li>
            <li>The stamp is great and I like the double end since I do my daughter&#x27;s nails as well and need the smaller end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how they do it, but it&#x27;s MAGIC!!</li>
            <li>and it was a major success!!</li>
            <li>did exactly what i expected it to and smoothly :]</li>
            <li>The larger end is great for my first four nails and the smaller end</li>
            <li>The only problem I had was that the rubber came off, but just krazy glue it and your fine!</li>
            <li>Very cheap looking and the scraper is the cheapest I have ever seen, will definitely scratch your plates.</li>
            <li>very very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>Lost it when moving houses and miss it very much.</li>
            <li>so I did so very gently before using.</li>
            <li>I very much recommend this stamper.</li>
            <li>Very ready to use picks up images well.</li>
            <li>The green end is nice for more precise placement of smaller accent images.</li>
            <li>I wore my old one out after a few years of use and was very happy to receive my new one.</li>
            <li>I chose to buy this product because of the high reviews posted &amp; I made the right choice!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this stamper that often, however, as I&#x27;ve found others I enjoy more from other companies.</li>
            <li>Mainly do to reviews that old gift cards work better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used and loved Konad&#x27;s regular stamper, and wondered if purchasing this one would be redundant, but I&#x27;ve enjoyed using the smaller, more precise stamping end more than I expected.</li>
            <li>The rubber ends are easy to clean and are large enough for the designs I use.  </li>
            <li>First time stamper here.</li>
            <li>First look up tutorials on YouTube.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s a double ended stamper</li>
            <li>I LOVE the double ended stamper.</li>
            <li>Other than that I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>LOVE the two different size stampers.</li>
            <li>I love this, I wish I could purchase just the double stamper because the scraper will just scrape my shiney plates away.</li>
            <li>I love my Konad double stamper!</li>
            <li>Did not work at all at first.</li>
            <li>Bought it a while back and still using it till this day and buying more as gifts when needed.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty nifty tool.</li>
            <li>All in all, the product does exactly what it is advertised to do.</li>
            <li>Product is exactly like it is stated in the description and looks identical to the image.</li>
            <li>hopefully I will have a better luck in gettin my money back (wish me luck).</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong for the low price and great product!! :)</li>
            <li>Absolutely dissatisfied!  </li>
            <li>I did have some problems using it at first, so I&#x27;m going to share some tips with you.  </li>
            <li>The first one I used had a moisturizer in it, and the polish would not stick well to the stamper  2)</li>
            <li>I love the double ended Konad Nail Stamper!</li>
            <li>i am getting ready to try it out now!</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t work for me at first.</li>
            <li>First off pitch</li>
            <li>White might be better</li>
            <li>This is the first stamp we have purchased</li>
            <li>I made sure to purchase the stamper from a seller that had amazon fulfillment, especially because of some of the reviews that reported receiving knockoffs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I went for a double sided one</li>
            <li>To anyone buying their first stamper, do NOT immediately file the stamper.</li>
            <li>it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>If you love doing your nails pretty, DEFINITELY get one of these!!!!!</li>
            <li>It works really well!</li>
            <li>Well when I when to use it first I just couldn&#x27;t get it to transfer on the stamper.</li>
            <li>does exactly what it says it does though.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying nail stamping.</li>
            <li>This is my first foray into stamping</li>
            <li>but it actually works better then</li>
            <li>I just bought this to go along with my first konad stamping plate.  </li>
            <li>I just received this today and the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>so it seemed logical to go with this one</li>
            <li>Takes time but us much cheaper then visiting the nail salon!</li>
            <li>Coincidently, the larger side&#x27;s &amp;#34;stampy thing&amp;#34; picks up polish from my nail plates better that the skinny side.</li>
            <li>but this works really well!</li>
            <li>I thoroughly checked the product descriptions and reviews to determine if this was a suitable and complete gift for a young girl.  </li>
            <li>This was the first stamper I purchased for myself.</li>
            <li>do my nails different for work and people just love how it looks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this exact Konad stamper and scraper for about 3 months.  </li>
            <li>Only warning--- I love using acetone to take off my polish because I&#x27;m a glitter girl</li>
            <li>Nice and wide.</li>
            <li>First off, I rate the shipping 1 star.</li>
            <li>do recommend watching a tutorial on YouTube before first use.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t pick up the image at first, so I filed it a bit....</li>
            <li>I love that it has a smaller end.</li>
            <li>Same product, MUCH better value.  </li>
            <li>Costs about as much as a bottle of nail polish so its worth it, because it&#x27;ll outlast any bottle of polish.</li>
            <li>After the first 2 were flops</li>
            <li>Love this and have used it several times with my daughter.  </li>
            <li>The plastic feels cheap, but so far, it&#x27;s done what I need it to.</li>
            <li>Package was exactly as shown (as of today&#x27;s date).</li>
            <li>I did and regret not just buying the konad stamper first.</li>
            <li>It was my first time using nail art</li>
            <li>I thought it would make it easier to be more accurate when applying small designs - and this proved true.)  </li>
            <li>You actually have more control over where you put the stamp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First time user for any of the design stuff for nails and</li>
            <li>I will definately do more business with this vendor in the future.</li>
            <li>This is the first stamper I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>but this is by KONAD and it looks exactly like it is in the picture.</li>
            <li>I have small hands so this perfect for the french manicure.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li>This takes a quick and steady hand.</li>
            <li>I first assumed it was defective..</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s double sided</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t scratch your plates, and they work the first time.</li>
            <li>Thanks Konad!</li>
            <li>I had to do some extensive YouTube research to get the hang of this, but now I love it.</li>
            <li>At first I thought I could use the polish I already had</li>
            <li>this stamper is pretty neat.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s my first time stamping</li>
            <li>konad has the best products, other people have complained about other stampers not working, this worked great for me</li>
            <li>my mother gave me this for Christmas and the funny thing is between her and my daughter</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first experience with nail stamping</li>
            <li>I wiped it off with acetone first, of course).</li>
            <li>I was able to use it with regular nail polish as well without having to file the ends.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is my first stamper</li>
            <li>did not get the first set bought from another seller.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have bothered with the Salon Express kit if I found this first.</li>
            <li>I love the double sides</li>
            <li>Makes doing nails much simpler!</li>
            <li>I ordered a MASH stamper when I first started stamping, but was having nothing but problems with it.</li>
            <li>THIS WORKS EXACTLY</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly how the item is described.</li>
            <li>Not worth the cheap price because you won&#x27;t be able to get the excess polish off of the stamp plates.</li>
            <li>also because it is SO much easier to use!</li>
            <li>This was the first time i tried stamping</li>
            <li>and i absolutely was thankful for how easy this was to use, they also clean up very easily, definitely recommend this for anyone interested in stamping</li>
            <li>Exactly as the product is described.</li>
            <li>The two different sizes allow better precision when stamping.</li>
            <li>This was my FIRST time with Konard</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>There are some that&#x27;s really pretty and easier to make imprints of.</li>
            <li>I ordered this stamper and scraper set and upon my first use, I couldn&#x27;t get an image to appear on the stamper.  </li>
            <li>My friend has this exact stamper</li>
            <li>Truly gets the image on the first time..</li>
            <li>and there is no way I would be able to transfer an image consistently with the two stampings I would need for my entire nail.</li>
            <li>My tween and teen can use this themselves and love doing their nails.</li>
            <li>I can do so many nails and its so simple.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m obsessed with nail stuff, this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li>This was my first time using ANY nail stamper.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but it arrived exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Package arrived on time and was exactly as described online.</li>
            <li>When I became interested in nail stamping</li>
            <li>At first, it wasn&#x27;t picking up anything on the plates, and then I did some research</li>
            <li>, it is my first time using stamping tools.</li>
            <li>First the stamper.</li>
            <li>The first use it scratched my plate</li>
            <li>I like this one much better because the stamping surface is much larger</li>
            <li>Fun to do , fast service</li>
            <li>(but there are a lot that look exactly like the konad plates)</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m a first time stamper, I still have to practice centering the images in my nails.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying my konad double side stamping kit.</li>
            <li>The first 10 or so times I tried to use this</li>
            <li>I love that it had two different sizes to stamp with.</li>
            <li>art is become very simple for me :)</li>
            <li>So much tireless fun.</li>
            <li>It also needs a few good scrapings in order to remove all of the nail polish.</li>
            <li>I have been playing with the stamper since I got it earlier today and its easy to use and a lot of fun.</li>
            <li>from what I seen so far on Youtube and other reviews seem so cute can&#x27;t wait to try it out once my plate stamps arrive in the mail :)</li>
            <li>The Konad Nail Stamper is a great way to add a little more oomph to your average at-home mani.  </li>
            <li>the smaller end is useful for more precise placement of smaller designs.  </li>
            <li>works great after buffing the end a little, even my 13 year old uses it.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that this was so straightforward.</li>
            <li>I know some people who have been able to transfer images successful using a regular thick nail polish.</li>
            <li>The small side is perfect for smaller nails to be more precise as well as with the smaller designs and with the French Manicures.    </li>
            <li>The double sided stamper is great because it has the larger side for full nail images, and the smaller side for smaller images so you can get a more precision</li>
            <li>Works great with ALL nail polishes: from the cheap $.99 to the expensive $10 ones.</li>
            <li>The more they get scratched the less of a clean stamping design you get and eventually it will ruin them.</li>
            <li>I tried multiple times and it just never really was that great.</li>
            <li>It is way easier to clean up; I just smear what&#x27;s scraped on to paper towel or old T-shirt.</li>
            <li>The Stamper is awesome and works really well however the scraper is useless</li>
            <li>I love this stamper, I have learned how to double stamp with it, so that my whole nail is covered.</li>
            <li>In order to overcome this, I&#x27;m able to use the smaller side for my whole nail.</li>
            <li>The Konad stamper&#x27;s rubber is soft and kind of &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;, yet firm and strong.</li>
            <li>The pink side seems to transfer the image much more thoroughly, but it isn&#x27;t ideal when trying to stamp small designs on my young daughters&#x27; nails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told you need to use some really old gloppy polish or get the special polish.</li>
            <li>...i&#x27;ve used my own polish a few times its just finding the right one to work</li>
            <li>its nice that it has both a small end for details and the large end for full nail prints.</li>
            <li>the stamper on the nail from left to right lightly.  </li>
            <li>When I did this, the rubber stoppers both came out, but they popped right back in and have been relatively secure since.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that using an old credit card works so much better than the cute little scraper that comes with the Konad</li>
            <li>this makes konad/ bundle monster stamping so easy the small side lets you be more persice and</li>
            <li>I love the ridges that are on the stamper for your fingers, sometimes I get in such a hurry to stamp my image and am afraid the stamper will fly out of my hand but the ridges make it easy to grip.</li>
            <li>Some of the plates compliment each other and are great for layering multiple colors.</li>
            <li>On the other hand the scraper really isn&#x27;t as necessary or that great.</li>
            <li>At first it wasnt picking up much product from the plate</li>
            <li>Came pretty fast.</li>
            <li>The stamper works really well, though I did have some doubts at first when it wouldn&#x27;t stamp.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and works very well.</li>
            <li>I used it with the white Konad nail polish - but also tried it on some paper with other brand nail polishes and it seemed to work great as well.</li>
            <li>thanks first stamper bought and it seems to work</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and arrived exactly as pictured</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no success even when using Konad&#x27;s own plates &amp; polish.  </li>
            <li>A credit card works just as good though, if not better.</li>
            <li>The Konad stamper is FAR superior to all three other brands and if I had started with another brand stamper, I&#x27;d probably have given up after a day.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re going to use a white or a lighter color, older or goopy polishes work better.  </li>
            <li>The double end is handy for full nail patterns or single stamp designs.</li>
            <li>No where near as good as i thought it was gonna be.. Wouldnt pick up alot of the images and its not the plates because my other stamper i ordered at the same time as this one picked up just fine.</li>
            <li>It is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Make sure you clean off extra nail polish left on the image plate after you already put it on the stamper.</li>
            <li>This is such an easy process to do.</li>
            <li>The stamper was smaller than I thought and its easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>This item comes exactly as advertized, (a cute pink stamper and scraper).</li>
            <li>It has instructions on the back, and is easily learned.</li>
            <li>its really easy to use, just add your color of polish on your design, scrap off extra with scraper, stamp design with stamper then roll onto your nail...</li>
            <li>like the two different sizes, easy to hold and use.  </li>
            <li>Two years later and this stamper is still going strong.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this works way better than the single sided stamper...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a single sided Konad stamper now for over a year and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>This product is really a smart idea.</li>
            <li>I used Pure Ice and Sally Hansen Xtreme</li>
            <li>and i needed some help on certain prints.</li>
            <li>I was using the large pad.</li>
            <li>This is going to become a new obsession!!</li>
            <li>It works great, I also love the small green side.</li>
            <li>but I honestly don&#x27;t care because it doesn&#x27;t mess up the image one bit.</li>
            <li>In time I got the hang of it, though its takes a few tries to get it perfect...when it does, its beautiful and therefore worth the price vs going to a nail salon.</li>
            <li>Okay, first off: I am guilty of loving my stamping plates a whole lot.  </li>
            <li>so I can have more control over single designs and my pinky finger witch dose not need that much stamping area.</li>
            <li>make sure not to press down too hard on the design as the more gentle you are the better it will work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, for the regular stamping polishes... what I have found is that any basecoat color is fine.  </li>
            <li>The small green side is great to pick up the smaller images and for more precise stamping.  </li>
            <li>and you have short nails, it should work fine.</li>
            <li>the large side lets you cover the whole nail</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice little investment.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that using a nail buffer (not the more abrasive file, but y&#x27;know, a softer buff) on the new stamper did help take some of the waxy sheen off that made initial stamp transfers extra challenging, while also not destroying the equipment.</li>
            <li>You can even use the image plates and the small green stamp side to do full nail designs on kids nails :) Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new at doing my own nails with anything thing than plain ol&#x27; simple polish, and I love this stamper</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the scraper since it seemed a little too narrow for some of the stamps I was using</li>
            <li>is flat and SO easy.</li>
            <li>Another thing I found out is: you can use plastic tapes to clean up most of the image that got onto your finger instead of using nail polish remover as long as you are using regular nail polishes.</li>
            <li>Good product, it get hard at the beginning to use it</li>
            <li>It is fun, easy, and really convenient because now both the designs left and right hand look the same!</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think it really makes a difference if you use THE/THIS Konad stamper versus an off brand one.</li>
            <li>I am still in the experimental stage with it, but having fun.  </li>
            <li>I had to practice to get image straight.</li>
            <li>the metal on metal pulls all the nail polish off and then the stamper will not pick up the whole image.</li>
            <li>, I am happy that I got this double ended one, its very convenient to use the smaller side for smaller images.</li>
            <li>It shipped incredibly fast.</li>
            <li>so much cheaper then buying one plate at 7 bucks a piece...</li>
            <li>(otherwise polish will build up there and your scraping will become very inefficient).</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>Work FAST.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>This is for children nails-the stamper doesn&#x27;t pick up the whole image.</li>
            <li>I was worried about whether or not it really works, and it does.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use it as much as I&#x27;d like to, but this is tool that has changed the way that I can do my nails sometimes.</li>
            <li>we use this item all the time works very well</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>She plays with it every night thank you so much</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really think this is a quality product</li>
            <li>This stamper also seems to have a \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; quality to it that lets it pick up the stamp and transfer to your nail much easier.   </li>
            <li>The only thing that could improve this is if it also came with a square stamper, since that might make it easier to precisely position square-shaped designs.</li>
            <li>Not like the real one from TV had to buy the one from the TV which does work not unlike this one...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>But the product itself works very well</li>
            <li>Stongly recommended to everyone that wants one.</li>
            <li>The scraper doesn&#x27;t cover much surface area.</li>
            <li>The scraper doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li>for good reason because if your design is pink.. and you use the larger end you cant really see it .. and vise verse</li>
            <li>there are tons of videos that really helped me decide and teach me some techniques.  </li>
            <li>The rubber on the stamper is very flexable so it picks up all of the design and deposits it evenly on my nails.</li>
            <li>much  </li>
            <li>Trust me, it makes stamping MUCH easier.</li>
            <li>unless you order the konad polish very $$$$$.</li>
            <li>and she loves to stamp her nails and all kinds of things that she wants to make look cooler.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think this would have been an issue, but now that I have used it a bunch of times, I wish I would have spent more time looking at the white/clear stampers.</li>
            <li>My stamp wont really pick all of the image</li>
            <li>This item works really well</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Very convenient that it&#x27;s two ended.</li>
            <li>also work fast, as the polish dries really fast.</li>
            <li>With all of the raving about this product I expected it to be better.</li>
            <li>I really like it, the problem that I encountered is with the scrapper, it has scratched a lots of my plates</li>
            <li>but I got the real deal.</li>
            <li>Item is as described, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like the doubled ended stamp.</li>
            <li>Absolute a must have for anyone who spends a lot of time doing nails.</li>
            <li>the stamper works very well but the scraper scratches all my metal plates.</li>
            <li>when i dont have much time to decorate my nails myself i just grab this and the stamps and its so fast the product</li>
            <li>i would recommend this to anyone that wants to learn how to stamp.</li>
            <li>The scraper did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and in condition described.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The order comes fast.</li>
            <li>nail polishes for way too much money.  </li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and goes well with the konad plates I got.</li>
            <li>It shipped really fast and there weren&#x27;t any defects.</li>
            <li>I received this item extremely fast</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>, i have a stamper from another brand and even though it stamps well, sometime it takes many tries, however it broke</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t see much the design on the sta[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>FYI, I used it with the Konad white polish in combination with a cheap polish I had on hand.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It works really well.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and just as described.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already tried massaging, gently kneading it, gently running it across a nail file and buffer and still doesn&#x27;t pick it up.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>, I shouldn&#x27;t have to mod a product to make it work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>shake the bottle of Konad Polish VERY well before you use it, otherwise it will not stick to the pad like it</li>
            <li>so my daughter does not use it very often.  </li>
            <li>That also had to do with how fast you work when stamping and what type of nail polish you use.</li>
            <li>It also stamps very well.</li>
            <li>I guess I need the real konad polish.</li>
            <li>It work very well.</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the scraper because it leaves marks on my plates</li>
            <li>try not to put to much nail polish in the image plate.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>hahaha</li>
            <li>, that really helped.</li>
            <li>You could use a plastic card instead if it bothered you that much.</li>
            <li>I use it a couple of times a week when I do my nails or my friend&#x27;s nails, and it&#x27;s made it much easier.</li>
            <li>At the price, it really can&#x27;t be beat, either.</li>
            <li>But when it works, it really works well.</li>
            <li>I solved filing it with a gentle  nail file.</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier to put designs on my nails than when i used to paint them on myself.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t have much to say, It works well though.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much kinder to the design on the plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes some mistakes before you can really get the hang of it, but I like it</li>
            <li>I really like the Konad brand.</li>
            <li>It was fast to ship and packaged well.</li>
            <li>The scraper, of course, also works very well.</li>
            <li>Order arrived much sooner than the estimated date.</li>
            <li>It is KONAD- the real deal.</li>
            <li>the stamp is just fantastic and it works with any stamping plates not only konad....totally recommended ..</li>
            <li>It is better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Have to work fast.</li>
            <li>This set works very well.</li>
            <li>It picks up the design very well.&lt;br /&gt;Nail</li>
            <li>The whole concept of nail stamping takes practice and patience.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>If you have smaller hands/fingernails, it is definitely nice to have the option of the smaller side.  </li>
            <li>The price was fair, so if it&#x27;s something you want to try or for a teenager to use if you&#x27;re not ready to go all into getting the actual product that started it all, this could be a backup.</li>
            <li>The smaller size is good for small images you&#x27;re trying to get just right on that certain exact spot on your nail.</li>
            <li>Then when you go to pick up an image make sure you do the process quick, paint, scrap, then roll your stamper over it with a firm steady hand.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get a clear stamp on nail.!!!</li>
            <li>It picks very crisp images like no other stamper will do.</li>
            <li>It costs less than $2 at CVS or WalMart and it is by far the best black out there.</li>
            <li>Overall, recommended for everyone who wants to start nail stamping and loves to have fun!</li>
            <li>To me, the result isn&#x27;t worth the trouble of having to paint the plate, swipe it clean, and try picking up the design seven times before you get it right for just one nail.</li>
            <li>The Konad stamper works much better than any other stamper.  </li>
            <li>I am so excited to finally have one.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use with my Konad and other image stamping plates, and found that I love the dual sided stamper.</li>
            <li>So many other rubber stampers have some imperfection or texture that will leave your stamp looking not-as-nice as it could.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to use a thick nailpolish it sticks better to the stamps in general.</li>
            <li>For someone who has short and small nails, this double ended stamper works absolutely perfect for me.</li>
            <li>It picked up soo much more than my other winstonia</li>
            <li>:) I have yet to try it with anything other than konad polish.</li>
            <li>Love that it is slimmer than other</li>
            <li>The other set worked much better.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s kind of hard getting it exactly where you want on the nail</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to use at first,</li>
            <li>This item came fast and it was brand new!</li>
            <li>This nail stamper is easy to use and great for a beginner nail artist like me.&lt;br /&gt;Two caveats to this stamper: 1) one rubber end is pink, this makes it hard to see if my pink nail polish has transferred cleanly to the pad before I stamp my nails.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a pain to clean the excess nail polish out of all the grooves in the plastic, but it&#x27;s no big</li>
            <li>We can stamp multiple designs in rapid succession now that we have 2-3 stampers, as you do not have to clean 1 ea.</li>
            <li>I found that I just had to swipe my stamper across my paper towel to clean off left over polish.</li>
            <li>The key to using them is to keep the surfaces of both clean of polish before stamping with them each time, otherwise it messes with the crispness of the designs.</li>
            <li>but I was sad that you have to buy special nail polish for it to even work but other than that perfect</li>
            <li>You just have to make sure you don&#x27;t press to hard and move quickly.</li>
            <li>That combo worked great; the Color Cosmetic black goes on opaque and is super for stamping (the WnW gold chrome is a little too faint as a stamping color but great as a base).&lt;br</li>
            <li>You definitely need to purchase the special Konad nail polishes in order to make it work, though.</li>
            <li>You do not necessarily need to use Konad special polish.</li>
            <li>I am a total amateur, but right out of the box, my first nails were amazing</li>
            <li>Very effective, would recommend this to an amateur as its that simple to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wanted to try stamping for a long time, the price on the konad stamper was fantastic and I took the plunge in buying this and 25 MASH plates.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I use both sides of the stamper, but I find that it is better to use an old gift card or credit card rather than the scraper, since they are sharp and they are hard to clean.</li>
            <li>I like the larger end for full nail designs and</li>
            <li>and I use the larger end for full nail and longer tip images.</li>
            <li>Other stampers I have used in the past work perfectly upon first try, however this one only works about 25-50 percent of the time.</li>
            <li>the White polish, Sally Hansen French Tip White is a good one.  </li>
            <li>the White polish, Sally Hansen French Tip White is a good one.  </li>
            <li>I had no trouble with it the first time.  </li>
            <li>A little on the cheap side, but using the right nail polishes is the key to this product working half as good as it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>Still trying to find inexpensive polishes that work well with the plates but other than that I love this little doohickey and will never lose track of it. :-)</li>
            <li>I love that the smaller side enables me to easily transfer small images.</li>
            <li>i am new to the stamping scene !</li>
            <li>when I need a new one I will order from you again!</li>
            <li>The small green end is great for smaller images, more control over where you stamp it.</li>
            <li>felt bad because I based it on the product review I read,if any of you have had a good experience with this product and is able to share it with us</li>
            <li>ok, i got my stamp in less then a week.</li>
            <li>Some formulas are thicker than others, my best suggestion for a dupe of Konad Stamping Polish is &amp;#34;Sally Hansen Insta Dri WHIRLWIND WHITE&amp;#34; for the white polish and &amp;#34;Rimmel Black Satin&amp;#34; for the black polish.</li>
            <li>so be careful if you don&#x27;t use easy you could ruin them</li>
            <li>I may go over it again with a slightly rougher grit file to see if I can get it to pick up images better.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend getting the double ended stamper and scraper. :)</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t really bother me, but if you wanted, you could use an old gift/credit card so that it doesn&#x27;t scratch as much.</li>
            <li>I have this particular set</li>
            <li>does what it&#x27;s suppose to for a decent price.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend getting stamping polish though most standard polishes we try wont show up well.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive this, and rightfully so; I used this stamper with Shany stamping plates and, with a little practice, it worked very well.</li>
            <li>The larger end popped off in my suitcase, but luckily I found it -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I bought the double ended stamper instead of the regular one.</li>
            <li>The double ended stamper is definitely one of the better ones out there.</li>
            <li>I do not have steady hands at all, when I came across nail stamping</li>
            <li>Love it, just wish the larger side was a bit bigger for longer nails.</li>
            <li>Small side works perfect for small finger nails or designs.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I got the double stamper for the smaller nails.  </li>
            <li>plates are not quite big enough to cover your nail, just add polish to a portion of the plate and use that to add more of the pattern.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually looking for something bigger in order to cover better my nails but</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s double sided to accommodate for larger designs.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easier to do my toenails with the larger side for my big toe :-)</li>
            <li>I have gotten a few of my family members into nail stamping because I love nail stamping so much.</li>
            <li>I switched to a simple hotel key card and magically my stamping skillzzz have improved exponentially.  </li>
            <li>although the scraper doesn&#x27;t get close enough to really smooth out the polish on the design, I ended up having to use an old credit card.</li>
            <li>Although I did not receive my entire order 1st time thru, they were quick to remedy problem.  </li>
            <li>but I needed the smaller one to be able to pinpoint landing for smaller stamps.</li>
            <li>I love the small end for individual designs and the large one for full nail designs.  </li>
            <li>The smaller side allow for more accurate prints on small nails.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, just look up a few YouTube tutorials first</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>this I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>its high quality</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend getting the Konad nail polish with it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for doing nail art.</li>
            <li>for almost everyone else, I highly recommend this stamper.</li>
            <li>If you are getting into nail air using mail plates, I highly recommend getting the Konad stamper and Konad polish.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>the small one is great for just single designs.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t mess around with cheap imitations, this is the real deal!</li>
            <li>Slightly rough your stamper up with a fine grit nail file.</li>
            <li>I bought this stamping kit and have had no problems other than my own technique failures in properly using the stamping plates.  </li>
            <li>When I first got it, I tried it with some Sinful Colors polishes, and they didn&#x27;t work because the designs barely picked up at all, and when they did pick up a little bit, the result was a very light, almost transparent design on my nails that looked like it was chipping off.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need to practice a little more.</li>
            <li>Only stamper I&#x27;ve ever tried, so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else, but it does exactly what it&#x27;s meant to do, so no complaints!</li>
            <li>Just dont forget to take a medium file and scruff it up a little before using, it makes the polish stick better.</li>
            <li>I am like most users and choose not to use the little metal scraper.  </li>
            <li>The little scraper thing works, but it could be a lot better.  </li>
            <li>I just tried my Konad stamper again last night, for only the second time, and I&#x27;m already getting better at it!</li>
            <li>I love this little stamp.</li>
            <li>so glad I opted to pay a little exra and get the double-ended Konad stamper.</li>
            <li>I love this product because of it has a large and small stamper.</li>
            <li>(Make sure you get nail polish that is thick--thin polish you usually have to apply several coats of when regularly painting your nails will create a very light, hard-to-see stamp).</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;About the stamper, the pink bigger side works great and has the perfect texture, but I decided to stop using the green smaller side because the texture is a little harder</li>
            <li>I notice that I scrape off far too much polish when I use this metal scraper.</li>
            <li>The two sizes on the stamper is very useful/helpful, but the scraper damages the plates - just use an old credit card instead.</li>
            <li>The smaller, green stamper is obviously great for smaller images, but I like using it for the precision and control it gives me while placing images.</li>
            <li>I much prefer using old gift cards to scrape instead.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very please with it so far.</li>
            <li>It also picks up the image very well because of the soft and squishy tips.</li>
            <li>I found the red side much more useful and practically never use the green one.</li>
            <li>THE STAMPER ONLY KONAD ITS WORTH</li>
            <li>Great product for anyone...especially my 8 year old &amp; me who are mildly addicted to our\\&quot; professional looking\\&quot; at home mani &amp; pedis</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said - you&#x27;re only paying for the stamper, and that&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>The larger end is not soft, so many images don&#x27;t pick up on my CHEEKY plates.  </li>
            <li>though wow what a cool and simple design, sooooo i jumped on amazon and bought it for myself</li>
            <li>for polishes, I tried this stamper with both konad stamping polishes as well as normal polishes</li>
            <li>and I used normal polishes for stamping.</li>
            <li>I like this long rubber stamper I want to try the smaller version just to maybe travel with and to see how much more of an impression...</li>
            <li>The scraper that my set came with had a blade that was tilted at a bit of an angle, so the construction looked kind of shoddy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also experimented with non-Konad polishes, and found good luck getting a solid stamp out of really any thick opaque polishes out there.</li>
            <li>This is a super fun little thing, and it worked just as described.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would really work, but I have an 8 year old who loves mani/pedis, and that can easily get expensive</li>
            <li>the black \\&quot;Konad Special Polish\\&quot;, I have found (after trying 11 different products) that WET &#x27;N WILD black velvet nailpolish is the best.  </li>
            <li>there are some stampers that are a little shoter and in m opinion are harder to use this one is perfect and has duel sides a small and large!</li>
            <li>and it was not hard on my nails.  </li>
            <li>They are thick, quick drying and accurate.  </li>
            <li>It makes nail stamping easy for beginners with the dual sided stamper for smaller &amp; larger images.</li>
            <li>my pack was black insted of pink but really good</li>
            <li>also the rubber parts are detachable for cleaning they pop right back in no problem.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t highly recommend it for young adults or older adults.</li>
            <li>This stamper and scraper are very easy to work with, and it is double ended with different size for different designs.</li>
            <li>I love how there&#x27;s two sides to this, it gives you more control when you use the small end for little stamps.</li>
            <li>I have tragically short nail beds, and the smaller stamper really helps me align designs more accurately on my last two fingernails.</li>
            <li>The scraper was a little harder to clean up and still has some staining on the plastic handle, but I&#x27;m probably going to try using an old gift card instead, as the metal blade put some very light scratches on my stamping</li>
            <li>/&gt;-You really need to buy the special Konad polish, it is different than regular nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;-Always</li>
            <li>I should also point out the wells of the image plates are so shallow that the polish dries quite quickly, so you have to be quick!</li>
            <li>I used it for small designs only but the larger end works great as well.</li>
            <li>I lightly filed the stamper as I has seen suggested in other reviews.  </li>
            <li>These are great because you have a small stamp for tiny nails (my granddaughters) and larger nails like my toenails.  </li>
            <li>so I like to try new things.  </li>
            <li>The product I received was brand new.</li>
            <li>For those new to stamping, it does take practice so don&#x27;t give up.</li>
            <li>and it might as well be brand new.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the world of nail stamping - discovered it from a kiosk in a shopping mall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to nail stamping.</li>
            <li>Well you live and learn.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to nail stamping</li>
            <li>Look up videos for tips if you&#x27;re new to stamping.</li>
            <li>so when I scrape the nail polish across, it leaves like new where it doesn&#x27;t quite connect to the design.</li>
            <li>It always works like new.</li>
            <li>I am new to this nail art stamping</li>
            <li>I used it on a brand new Konad plate, so I don&#x27;t see the reason it wouldn&#x27;t work as it should.</li>
            <li>It was too new for the polish to be picked up by the stamper.</li>
            <li>New in package.</li>
            <li>already it still is like brand new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to nail stamping</li>
            <li>I will be looking to buy a new scraper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s really all I say about this product other then some quick tips about doing stamping itself.</li>
            <li>but as usual my left hand would look lovely and the right one was a mess.&lt;br /&gt;i decided on the stamping kit</li>
            <li>The scraper is not very useful, an old gift card works just fine in it&#x27;s place.</li>
            <li>I love having my nails done, and being a single mom who&#x27;s a full time student means very little spending money.</li>
            <li>I am considering using a marker to put a dot at the top center of the stamper to help with proper placement.</li>
            <li>I prefer the super squishy black and white stampers, but this one is my next favorite.</li>
            <li>but the scraper don&#x27;t really slide even and not very easy to clean</li>
            <li>Love the double ends, the small end is great for tiny designs or kids nails as they are small.</li>
            <li>But you must act quickly so the polish doesn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li>I love that you can choose from a really wide or smaller stamp face.</li>
            <li>I myself like to use old kind of thick ones.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to file the stamper part down worked just fine.</li>
            <li>If you are using a regular polish, you need to be VERY fast, applying the polish to the pattern plate, wiping excess immediately, and using the stamper immediately.</li>
            <li>the small one also works better when your testing a color combination on a nail design wheel, its easier to see where your stamping the smaller images on your nails and center it better.</li>
            <li>The two ends of the stamper are perfect for either stamping the whole nail (wide end) or stamping a small design on (green end).</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has one end to use for the large images and the smaller end to use for the smaller single prints.  </li>
            <li>The first one I bought was the as seen on TV stamper to try it out and see if i like it, it was really stiff but still cool</li>
            <li>Of course I had to clean and file the ends with a nail file to rough them up a little before it would work well, but that&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>The scraper works well also, but I found that its hole often got a little clogged, but that wasn&#x27;t much of an inconvenience, merely an observation that it works best when cleaned after each use!  </li>
            <li>Be fast when your stamping because its been known to dry really fast!        </li>
            <li>The double sided stamper is perfect because it has a small green stamper on one end which works for all the small designs, and the large red stamper on the other end is perfect for the larger designs and designs for the tips and entire nail.</li>
            <li>The scraper is a metal scraper which worried me at first, but gives a cleaner pick-up than the plastic scrapers I have; especially on off-brand plates that are not etched as well.</li>
            <li>I guess this is unavoidable though as nail polish comes in every conceivable color under the sun!</li>
            <li>When pressing tje Stamper on plate press firmly but not too firm or too light in a rolling position from the bottom to the top of the image plate then immediately press to nail from side to side roll and not in every direction.</li>
            <li>something I did not know which I was surprised with, is that the rubber stamper part itself comes out!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying to use a red or pink to stamp with, the green end on this is absolutely great - allows you to see the stamp image.</li>
            <li>It was really simple to use for a first timer.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to go with the plates I purchased earlier, and exactly what was advertised came.</li>
            <li>This one actually has worked better than I had expected!</li>
            <li>Also, you want to be QUICK when stamping your nails as you do not want the design to DRY on the stamper!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen people use a credit card or something similar and am willing to try that.</li>
            <li>the plus is it has double sided the bigger side I have found to work better then the smaller and</li>
            <li>Although, the scraper can be compared to each other as performing the same the quailty of konad is better..  </li>
            <li>Way better than the plastic scraper you usually get when buying these products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really a big deal, but something to be aware of when buying.</li>
            <li>initially was interested in stampers when a vendor in the street showed it to me.</li>
            <li>My first and only!</li>
            <li>I did run a fine-grit buffing block over the rubber ends prior to the first use</li>
            <li>Stamping LIGHTLY on the plate and (rolling it) lightly on the nail works much better than pressing the crap out of it</li>
            <li>and I totally love the double sided stamper for different sizes and the different color I use to stamp the images</li>
            <li>They sell this same exact thing in the mall for $25.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am fairly new to nail stamping, and this was dead easy to figure out.</li>
            <li>It came in a clear plastic bag, not a hard plastic one like in the picture.</li>
            <li>The store card will still leave marks on your plate, but only very fine marks where you scrap it, and nothing at all that will mess up your image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first because a few reviewers said they received knock off brands, but I received it exactly as described!</li>
            <li>I liked that there were two different sized sides, but I&#x27;ve found that the smaller green side does not stamp very well.  </li>
            <li>Extra stampers, especially one with two different sized ends and and extra scrapers will always be handy.</li>
            <li>In fact, I haven&#x27;t purchased any type of special polish, i&#x27;ve found regular polish actually does the trick.  </li>
            <li>The rubber ends are nice and pliable not hard or tough.</li>
            <li>A little hint, to save nail polish only put polish on the top half of the design and when you scrape down, the excess nail polish from the top will fill into the bottom half, saving you more nail polish!</li>
            <li>I have tried different nail polish and still doesn&#x27;t work it leaves half the stamp on the nail and is very light in color</li>
            <li>First off: You do NOT have to use stamping polish (Thicker polish does work better, however thin polish works as well</li>
            <li>The stamper itself works great with the MASH plates and regular nail polish, and having both the large and small end makes it easy for even a beginner to stamp perfectly in no time at all.</li>
            <li>its a little messy especially trying to clean up without messing up your own nails</li>
            <li>but I tried to be positive and tried all different methods.</li>
            <li>, I like how there is a smaller side its good for small designs like maybe doing multiple flowers on a nail</li>
            <li>I went ahead and ordered a white and a black actuan Konad polishes, since those will be the colours I will use the most for my patterns.</li>
            <li>I feel like the normal stamper is too small (the handle part), this one is easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Very cool little tool!</li>
            <li>Like previous reviewers said, nail polish gets stuck in the scraper, but its easy to clean by soaking it in remover for a few minutes, wiping it off, and getting into the nooks and cranies with a tooth pick.</li>
            <li>but after a few times, I got used to it just fine.  </li>
            <li>and I have not had as good of luck with some of the other stampers I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>Double Ended Large Stamp and Plastic Scraper Set]] or  </li>
            <li>so I can see the red nail polish I use a little better.</li>
            <li>If you end up losing your scraper or if it stops working, gift cards work just as well :) the scraper seems to get dull over time</li>
            <li>This picks up images extremely well and cleans up quickly.  </li>
            <li>sometimes the top coat smudges the designe and it can be hard to line up the pictures</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s because I find as several others have said, that an old gift card is much easier to do the scraping with.</li>
            <li>This was a great way to allow me to have several friends together to do a nail spa day without having to purchase an expensive kit.</li>
            <li>we not that clear.</li>
            <li>The package is clearly labeled Stamping Nail Art as the brand,and says it is made in China.</li>
            <li>but if you use an old credit card or gift card as the scraper you wont end up scratching your stamping plates</li>
            <li>I tried a gift card and it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well &#x3D;</li>
            <li>or I might just use an old debit card or something.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an old gift card as a scraper, but not anymore.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of different brands of image plates, and they all work very well with this.</li>
            <li>I did not like the scraper, so I used an old cancelled credit card instead.</li>
            <li>Used old credit card to clear polish off plates.</li>
            <li>Waist of money it doesn&#x27;t transfer to nail completely</li>
            <li>but wow, I will defiantly order from this company again.....  </li>
            <li>I prefer to use an old credit card instead of the scraper.  </li>
            <li>but I prefer to use an old gift card or credit card.</li>
            <li>my 16 year old sister keeps wanting me to do her nails and gets rave reviews at school and</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I received the item after two days of purchasing because i ordered it in Saturday.</li>
            <li>I prefer to use an old gift card instead.</li>
            <li>Instead, use an old gift card or credit card you won&#x27;t be using anymore.</li>
            <li>I like to do my nails a lot and for the more complex nail designs, I often use Konad templates.</li>
            <li>I instead just use a plastic credit card or gift card for scraping and have had no trouble with this method.</li>
            <li>Stamping directly to my nails doesn&#x27;t work so well  </li>
            <li>It picks up your stamp completely.</li>
            <li>I have been practiving and reading how to&#x27;s but so far no luck.</li>
            <li>Tip is too soft to transfer images?</li>
            <li>the scraper and use an old license card.</li>
            <li>But i found that using a old credit card</li>
            <li>remember everyone press lightly to get the design off the stamp and press firmly to press onto the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s nails are tiny, so this makes stamping &amp; clean-up much easier.</li>
            <li>Some people have suggested using an old gift card instead of the scraper.</li>
            <li>and this set makes professional results even for me with no training</li>
            <li>So in a sense, the company is ripping you off completely.</li>
            <li>but i was surprised that it was just a plug.</li>
            <li>No scraper has ever beat an old credit card.  </li>
            <li>You can use any old credit card too.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to be a professional to use this, you just have to have patience and practice a couple times.</li>
            <li>I even bought one for my 16 year old sister &amp; she&#x27;s having a blast with it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>not good,do not waste your money and time</li>
            <li>For the scraper, I rather use an old credit card so my plates don&#x27;t get scratched.</li>
            <li>The scraper doesn&#x27;t work as well as an old gift card.</li>
            <li>The scraper, while conveniently included, was not an absolute necessity as a well-maintained ID/credit card would have served the same purpose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten more into keeping up with my nails lately and have been trying some off brands of stamping accessories.  </li>
            <li>I use my old AAA card instead.</li>
            <li>I use an old credit card.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell it does not ruin the image on the plate.</li>
            <li>you are really into nail designs and don&#x27;t like the hassle of individually painting each nail then buying this product</li>
            <li>one is perfect for making small adjustment to the nail (eg: the plate image is too small to cover the entire nail) and you have to make a second &#x27;swipe&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I used an old gift card instead, which worked just as well and didn&#x27;t scratch the image plate.  </li>
            <li>(old credit card, old license, etc)</li>
            <li>Just use an old plastic credit card for a scraper if need be.</li>
            <li>i suggest you use an old gift card or piece of plastic for a scraper.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for nearly a year</li>
            <li>Not so much guess-work with where you got the design, as on the larger stamp.</li>
            <li>As far as the scraper, I found that it doesn&#x27;t work as well as an old credit card or gift card.  </li>
            <li>I was told by people that use the Stamper to use a old credit card instead of the Scraper, because the Scraper would scratch your stamping plates.</li>
            <li>so far becasue my girls ages 10 &amp; 11</li>
            <li>My seven year old</li>
            <li>Stamp Works well, just use an old credit card or gift card, instead of the metal scraper</li>
            <li>I use an old credit card in lieu of the scraper provided in this package.</li>
            <li>The only issue I really have is the scraper scratches the surface area of the stamp plate.</li>
            <li>An old business card or credit card works well and won&#x27;t scratch up your surface.</li>
            <li>I suppose it does what it supposed to it was a gift for my 14yr old daughter</li>
            <li>so I just tossed it and use an old gift card instead.</li>
            <li>I use old club cards instead.  </li>
            <li>I had also been given the recommendation to use an old credit card or gift card to scrape the excess polish from the stamp plate.</li>
            <li>Instead use and old credit card, or gift</li>
            <li>I use an old gift card to scrape instead of the razor edge scraper.</li>
            <li>I use an old gift card</li>
            <li>I prefer to use an old gift card instead of the scraper provided, it scratches the plates</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on the scrapper because I threw it in a draw immediately, instead using an old gift card.</li>
            <li>+ Wish I could find the plates near me</li>

            <li>Stampers everywhere will tell you to use an old gift card or credit card instead.</li>
            <li>Because they don&#x27;t dry until cured, the working time is unlimited (nearly) before you have to clean your plates and stampers for the next finger.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m finding that glitter polishes in gel brands don&#x27;t stamp well.</li>
            <li>(you can switch to using an old credit card for the scraper.)</li>
            <li>The small green side is the reason I use it the most because it&#x27;s really good for placing small designs where you want them.</li>
            <li>I realized that an old gift card works perfect--better than the scraper ever did.  </li>
            <li>I USED AN OLD CREDIT CARD.</li>
            <li>I just used an old plastic membership card of credit card to scrape off polish from the plates instead of the metal scraper.</li>
            <li>I did not use the scraper cause of the reviews and instead used an old gift card.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lasted me well over a year so far.  </li>
            <li>but I would recommend a plastic scraper or an old credit card.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably going to use an old gift card to do the job instead.</li>
            <li>so I just use an old credit card instead.</li>
            <li>To use regular polish just gently buff the surface of the stamper with a nail file</li>
            <li>do not use this scraper, I use old gift cards and old credit cards instead.</li>
            <li>Not had any problems so far.</li>
            <li>As others suggested here I used an old store card instead of the metal scraper, I&#x27;ve never used it as the idea of it did not appeal to me.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the stamper doesn&#x27;t pick up the pattern completely either, although that may be because of the type of polish.</li>
            <li>Of course the scraper doesn&#x27;t work as effectively as a old gift card but it gets the job done without an issue.</li>
            <li>We use an old gift card for a scraper though...</li>
            <li>so I just use old gift cards.</li>
            <li>/&gt;YouTube videos suggested to use an old credit card instead of the scraper that comes with the stamper, and I agree--</li>
            <li>I replaced the scraper with an old gift card though..</li>
            <li>Some people use an old credit card or gift card instead.</li>
            <li>though so I use an old gift card instead of the metal scraper.  </li>
            <li>I often use an old gift card instead.</li>
            <li>The scraper scratches plates, so use an old ID or credit card for the scraping.</li>
            <li>, I opted for an old membership card.</li>
            <li>I use an old plastic card in place of the scraper.</li>
            <li>professionally done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it scratches the heck out of the plates, and so I had to use and old credit card.</li>
            <li>and I immediately traded it for an old membership card that works just as well.</li>
            <li>I use an old gift card instead of the metal scraper to save me plates from being scratched.</li>
            <li>I really like the double ended stamper...</li>
            <li>it definitely picks up the images off of the stamping plates really well.</li>
            <li>but its not for sensitive design.</li>
            <li>The stamper is fantastic quality, transfers images clearly without too much trouble.</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen Chrome nailpens are good, but expensive.  </li>
            <li>it is very easy and I love decorating my nails with it - I did buy the less expensive plates not from Konad</li>
            <li>So as long as I can get that metal scraper part clean, I really don&#x27;t care what other nail colors are painted all over the thing.</li>
            <li>the scraper can be quite a mess to use and clean though.</li>
            <li>Now I need to practice as usually I&#x27;m all thumbs, so far it&#x27;s been fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have a short, one-sided stamper that came with my original plate sets and prefer it for larger patterns simply because I find it easier to hold and place.  </li>
            <li>The larger red size i found not to be as larger as my original konad stamper.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to buy that or Wet &#x27;N Wild nail polish, because their consistencies are formulated to be think enough to print a dark enough image, while other nail polish comes out VERY light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me about 4 tries to get one image right, after watching 4-5 youtube videos on how to do it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use on small hands for my daughters</li>
            <li>The smaller end is great for partial designs or small designs u want in a specific area of the nail</li>
            <li>My first one was a single ended one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to clean and doesn&#x27;t always scrape smoothly.</li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;s just a general learning curve but certain designs required different amounts of pressure in order to pick them up correctly.</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewers who have said the double-sided stamper is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I do need to prime it with a file pretty frequently, but overall not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li>The larger end of the stamper can be used on full nail designs where as the smaller can be used on smaller designs.</li>
            <li>Not overly easy to use and very messy</li>
            <li>this does the job it is intented to do..... gets really messy if you dont keep the blade clean though</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what another reviewer meant about \\&quot;filing\\&quot; your stamper before you use it; I didn&#x27;t do anything to prep the stamper or scraper except for taking them out of the package, and they worked just fine.</li>
            <li>The stamper itself is fine, but it seems a bit small for my use.</li>
            <li>This is the first stamper I&#x27;ve ever purchased and the only one I will purchase in the future.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found an opportunity to use the small side since most of the designs I use are larger than that side.</li>
            <li>I love this stamp pad because you can use the small end for tiny nails.</li>
            <li>I prefer a different brand stamper that I have for most small designs.</li>
            <li>I mainly do full-nail stamps, so I use the bigger end for those, but for full-nail toenail stamps</li>
            <li>For use with nail design plates, highly recommend the double end.</li>
            <li>However, I decided to give it another try, so I went out and bought some thicker polishes, and still, the design only picks up halfway most of the time, and it is very messy.</li>
            <li>Its nice to have the double side with the big and the small side and it pics up and transfers images nicely but the pink color makes it hard to see the images that you have picked up.</li>
            <li>The small end works wonderful for the little flowers and small designs that Konad has to offer.    </li>
            <li>Sure, they&#x27;re a little more expensive</li>
            <li>A lot of people I know like to use plain paper towel to clean off the plates.</li>
            <li>If you have long nails you aren&#x27;t going to get some of the images across tour whole nail..</li>
            <li>I generally use an old credit card to scrape the excess polish from the plate, so I havent used the scraper yet</li>
            <li>And I love that I can see white on the red and green sides.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I was looking for and expected.</li>
            <li>You may have to &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; it up a little with a fine nail file to allow it to &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; at first, or it might be too slick to &amp;#34;take&amp;#34; the image, but it&#x27;s not hard to do.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It works well for medium designs, but if you use the extra large plates, you will need a larger stamper.</li>
            <li>and you have to file the tops of the stamps to make it a little more rough.</li>
            <li>Prior to this, I had the normal stamp which was very wide which made it more difficult to do precise stamping.</li>
            <li>seems to dry too fast and doesn&#x27;t transfer to the stamper so that it can be applied to my nail.  </li>
            <li>I really like that I don&#x27;t have to wait for it to dry forever like I would when painting the tip.</li>
            <li>I really like the double sides that are different size.</li>
            <li>Love this stamper, takes a few tries to get the hang of it but can make the cutest nails ever</li>
            <li>Works really well, but for some reason the green side it doesn&#x27;t really hold the image that well</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would use the smaller end at all, but I use it just as much as the larger end.</li>
            <li>I like the green side better than the pink one.</li>
            <li>The larger stamp measures one inch exactly, so if you have long nails it may not work for you as well.</li>
            <li>I only really use the smaller side of stamper, its easier to control.  </li>
            <li>The scrapper here left too much polish and actually scratched one of my plates.</li>
            <li>Stamping polish is MUCH more thick and sticky than regular polish.</li>
            <li>and it just dried way too quickly to be used with this.</li>
            <li>Why waste money on decals when you can recreate your own images with this stamper and a few imaging plates.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, down to the review - it&#x27;ll be short and sweet.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous trying this for the first time!</li>
            <li>first i bought the other pack &amp;#34;as seen on tv&amp;#34; from walmart i forgot what it&#x27;s call</li>
            <li>This product was purchased with some of the other Knoad line, my wife loves to get her nails done and it always costs more for those little design things they put on.  </li>
            <li>other other&#x27;s for being able too pick up tiny images</li>
            <li>Durable and pretty in pink!</li>
            <li>I use a squishy-firm stamper nowadays, but this is the one I use when a polish/plate is being troublesome and no other stamper works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very small fingers (I wear a size 3 wedding ring) and the smaller, green side works perfectly for applying full-nail designs to my pinky nail and index finger nail, for instance, while the larger, pink side works well for my thumb, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had bought a small stamper for nail art with the original kit.</li>
            <li>The only problems I&#x27;ve had with it is when I opened it, the pink side of the stamper fell right out.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to get it wrong at first.</li>
            <li>To sandwich conventional stamp polish onto a gel mani, I have to remove the sticky layer first and let it dry really well, before the topcoat cure, or the image is smudgy.</li>
            <li>[...]  My only complain is that the scraper could have been better designed, not that it doesn&#x27;t work, but the metal scratch up the image plates and it is not very easy to clean; the polish gets inside the holes and between the thin ridges of the blade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very new to nail stamping (this was my second attempt) and I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>can use the plate on no more than 2 or 3 nails before you need to clean it and</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s taken a little practice to learn how to use it but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>, the blade is pefrectly flat on the edge for running across the stamping base and the rubber is perfect for putting the design on your nail, no regrets in buying this.</li>
            <li>I got so much compliment from using this product and it works well whether you are doing large or small designs.</li>
            <li>I have recently purchased the same stamp set with a white large end to use for this purpose.  </li>
            <li>I was a little iffy when I bought this stamper, most of the tutorials I have seen on nail art stamping use the basic Konad stamper, in pink, and I didn&#x27;t know if there was a difference.</li>
            <li>However, the small side of this is great for smaller patterns as I can center them on the nail a little easier.</li>
            <li>I tried this method first, and it was a huge fail.</li>
            <li>Generally speaking it picked up and released designs</li>
            <li>Directions were clear and simple.</li>
            <li>The rubber is a different texture on the store bought stamper and doesn&#x27;t transfer images completely or clearly.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the scraping blade were wider; and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to clean ALL the polish from the crevices, but not really a functional problem.</li>
            <li>It is long enough to be comfortable to hold, and the dual ends make stamping your whole nail possible and centering a small stamp easier.</li>
            <li>I can see this being a problem in the near future.  </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I have only tried nail stamping twice so far</li>
            <li>is the only stamper that gave me a complete image instead of pieces.  </li>
            <li>This double ended stamper definitely fixed that problem.</li>
            <li>I was pleasently surprised when the Konad Nail Art Double Ended Stamper and Scraper arrived before the estimated shipping date!</li>
            <li>My stamper required absolutely no filing, it worked straight out of the package.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s complete user error on the part of me and my friend, or maybe I need a different shaped stamper.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as soft as I think is necessary.</li>
            <li>Use an old gift card or hotel key card instead of the scraper that comes with it.</li>
            <li>I did not really like this as much as I</li>
            <li>, I usually like to jump in feet first when doing things so after hours of trial and error, I finally watched a very informational video and got my stamper to work.</li>
            <li>I like the smaller side to use on my pinky and my 3yr old nails.</li>
            <li>I am a licensed professional, but found that I needed to read Konad&#x27;s instructions (or watch a YouTube video) to ensure I was using this tool properly.</li>
            <li>Both ends had the same amount of squish as far as I could tell.</li>
            <li>but at the same time it scratches my plates, so I use an old credit card instead.</li>
            <li>I almost gave up stamping completely when I decided to order this stamper as a last result</li>
            <li>I dont really care if it scratches the empty spots I am concerned that it will scratch and distort an adjacent image.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a plastic Konad scraper, but actually prefer to use my old Kroger Plus card.</li>
            <li>The green side really makes applying the smaller images so much easier.</li>
            <li>If you are trying to decide between the double ended stamper and just the normal one, I would definately go for the double!</li>
            <li>Before discovering this I used nail decals, which although nice, were expensive and one time use.</li>
            <li>The stamper head is big enough to cover my nails and the small one is very useful for stamping the small images precisely.</li>
            <li>Also the blade is small and can be a little tricky to clean ( think about the fact you might be cleaning it with nail polish remover using your freshly painted nails so your not going to want to get to nitty gritty.)</li>
            <li>It does pick up regular polish just have to be quick at tje process or the Stamper won&#x27;t pick it up cuz it has dried.</li>
            <li>As long as the scraper doesn&#x27;t ruin a design, I can live with the scraping.</li>
            <li>I really like the double side to print small and large prints.</li>
            <li>This double ended stamper works really well for large images and small images.</li>
            <li>cuz u hav a small side that prints and washes really well and also a big side that does the exact same.</li>
            <li>I have had a lot of problems with the scraper and thanks to other reviews, have discovered that a gift card does work wonders.  </li>
            <li>Small enough to fit my tiny pinky.</li>
            <li>Also I recieved mine really fast, it came even before the expected shipping date!</li>
            <li>Compared to other stamper/scraper sets, this one really delivers.</li>
            <li>I followed other people&#x27;s advice and gently filed the ends before using.</li>
            <li>The scraper is a bit hard to clean because of the holes and designs, but hey - it scrapes.</li>
            <li>It is a nice size in your hand, and creates a clean image, some nail colors are hard to see if they stamped properly (ex: its hard to see if the stamper picked up the image properly with red or pink colors)</li>
            <li>my only other complaint is that&#x27;s its pink, but that&#x27;s just aesthetic.all in all, a good product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soooo much easier than painting your own designs on your nail and getting frustrated that it&#x27;ll not all come out the same!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The stamp itself is easy to clean, though I&#x27;ve stained the handle with black nail polish, which is difficult to get</li>
            <li>If you are stamping with pink, red etc you can&#x27;t see the design very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d actually recommend using an old plastic shoppers card such as...</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it wastes a lot of nail polish, but i think that it is still worth it to get the design.</li>
            <li>Before I could not get the plate to scrape clean, there was always too much polish left behind to pick up - multiple scrapes didn&#x27;t work either.  </li>
            <li>My advise to you is watch the video tutorial on youtube, DON&#x27;T GO TO SLOW, and clean off everything after each nail.</li>
            <li>It works MUCH better than the single sided as if you use a pink polish, the green end will show it.</li>
            <li>A little tricky to use at first, but I get it now.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like this scraper very much for a few reasons.</li>
            <li>) Wipe everything down with pure acetone, or use a nail polish remover that does NOT contain any oils.</li>
            <li>The scraper seems a bit small and so with a few swipes of cleaning the polish off the stencil you have to clean the scraper otherwise it will stain or clump that whole bottom area.</li>
            <li>-No, you really DON&#x27;T need to cover the whole image and waste your nail polish(es)!!:</li>
            <li>Being impatient and a \\&quot;learn by doing\\&quot; type, although I did watch a YouTube video while I was waiting for this to arrive, I tore it open and got right to stamping.</li>
            <li>Shipping time was great considering Christmas and all...was a lil disappointed about the quality of the stamp</li>
            <li>I love the fact it has two ends: one end is small and the other bigger because that helps when you have smaller nails or images on the plates.</li>
            <li>For those of you who are having trouble with the scraper not scraping very well... you need to buy stamping polish!</li>
            <li>My first few attempts were failures but after some practice (and some YouTube tutorials)</li>
            <li>do i really need to break down and buy their nail polish?</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t listen to those who say stamp straight down on the plate.</li>
            <li>Very well put together and holds the stamp extremely well!</li>
            <li>Yes, PURE ICE nailpolishs in &#x27;Outrageous&#x27; and others stamp up beautifully.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to press down hard, just be sure to hold it at a 45 degree angle  4)</li>
            <li>I used it last night for the first time, its a bit messy</li>
            <li>It has a large side for full nail designs and a small side for small icons.</li>
            <li>When stamping the plate only push straight down and up.</li>
            <li>You have to file down the rubber before your first use, because when I first started stamping I had a hard time trying to pick up the designs and transferring them to my nails.</li>
            <li>For the small items you can see darker colors on the green better than on the red.  </li>
            <li>Pretty sad, but all in all the double ended stamper is well worth the price and quality.</li>
            <li>It came new in the package and arrived earlier than I&#x27;d expected.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of warm colors on my nails so the bigger end of the stamper, which is a dark pink, makes it really hard to see the designs in order to line it up with my fingernail.</li>
            <li>The scraper is useless, but that is easily solved with using an old credit card or gift card.</li>
            <li>but it was actually just the right size not to big and not to small.</li>
            <li>I bought it thinking that was big enough for my nails that are not long.</li>
            <li>But the scraper is a little odd, and you have to have it at JUST the right angle to transfer clearly.</li>
            <li>Works really well, but takes a little while to get the hang of stamping.</li>
            <li>Not great quality, but fine for occasional use.</li>
            <li>Large patterns pick up veerrrryyy easily, thin patterns, not so much.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient having two sizes for stamping, especially when you just need a little decorative stamp.</li>
            <li>(otherwise it will dry and it&#x27;ll be hard to clean out.    </li>
            <li>My stamper and scraper arrived much quicker than expected!!!</li>
            <li>Tried expensive nail polish, cheap ones and everything in between and images never transfers complete.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft enough to provide flexibility when stamping but still firm enough to pick up a clear image.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Great stamper/scraper set!</li>
            <li> Took a bit of practice to getting a perfect stamp without smudging</li>
            <li> which is AWESOME!</li>

            <li> I have mine for over 3 years now, and is still working great!</li>
            <li> The best nailpolishes for stamping are ones that have some metallic in them.  </li>
            <li> I have found that the best stamping polishes are at WalMart.  </li>
            <li> works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> So I thought that one would be best to start.</li>
            <li> The stamper is awesome, but don&#x27;t use their scraper.</li>

            <li> ; I wish I had more image plates to use with it though!</li>

            <li> and they make my manicures look amazing.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing stamper.</li>
            <li> it has worked amazingly.</li>
            <li> This Works great :)  I love stamping my nails.</li>
            <li> This is nice.</li>
            <li> but it does a good job most of the time.</li>
            <li> if you find a konad stamper w/o the scraper, good for you, but if not, having the scraper won&#x27;t kill you. :)</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and it works great!</li>
            <li> &amp; she wasn&#x27;t able to get any good results as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But over all i liked this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be honest, I did too at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if it is effective with its duty it seams like it would solve both my problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but all u need is practice it works nice</li>
            <li> and u can always do your own designs</li>
            <li> its nice nedw</li>
            <li> I can purchase this item without having to purchase a kit of some kind.</li>
            <li> DId not stay on well or appy on nicely.</li>
            <li> Stamper is really nice with the 2 sizes.</li>
            <li> i have started to do my own nail art</li>
            <li> I can do my own nails and save money.</li>
            <li> and I honestly can&#x27;t ask for anything else considering</li>
            <li> While the concept is a good one, I have to believe there is a better way.</li>
            <li> This is another great product from konad have many stampers glad to add this to my nail stamping collection .</li>
            <li> Scrapper was kind of bent</li>
            <li> but she really liked it</li>
            <li> Must have for every girl who loves to style her own nails.</li>
            <li> It is well made and picks up design nicely.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys stamping, also the scraper is perfect, It does not scratch the plates if held at a 45 degree angle towards yourself plastic cards are over rated and remove too much polish</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li> i can tell you it picks up the image nicely.</li>
            <li> I am buying more for some friends, so that should tell you that I thought this product was good.</li>
            <li> I really liked it.</li>
            <li> I could not find anyone to do nice designs after we moved at the nail places in my area.</li>
            <li> Rolls the image on nicely.</li>
            <li> and I am able to practice my stamper alittle more now that I am happy with the Mash plates and Konad stamper.</li>
            <li> I wish it came with more templates, but for the price a good product.</li>
            <li> Since my wife loves to do her own nails</li>
            <li> This is a really nice set.  </li>
            <li> The stamper works as intended and it is nice to have two stamps in one.  </li>
            <li> The rubber stamp is really nice and cleans up well.</li>
            <li> nice.  </li>
            <li> so I could give some to the girls as well with their own kits.  </li>

            <li> The stamper is nice, well made and has pliable ends.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased :)</li>
            <li> This is a great stamper, and if you want to create your own starter kit the price can&#x27;t be beat when bought alongside one of the many stamp plate kits available.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to play with, and it makes beautiful nail arts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to nail stamping and was told this was the best stamper to use.  </li>
            <li> I am new to the &amp;#34;konading&amp;#34; world but this stamper and scraper has been awesome!</li>

            <li> I have found it very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> , it makes it very easy to work with.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m already dying to buy more plates and more polish colors!</li>

            <li> Amazing I love it .</li>

            <li> Nails look great and fun designs without having to purchase those stickers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so impressed with the scraper, so I just use an old gift card, instead.</li>

            <li> Honestly, I would have paid a lot more for it now</li>

            <li> The ends are soft and pick up images perfectly.</li>
            <li> I followed the recommendation on chickettes.com and using an old credit card really is best.</li>
            <li> the product itself though is amazing, used many times</li>
            <li> Honestly I have not been able to use this item yet</li>
            <li> and I actually liked it MUCH better.</li>
            <li> so glad i bought it because it stamps my nail amazingly</li>

            <li> Love love love it!  </li>
            <li> I love love love this stamper!</li>
            <li> fun and Enjoy!!!</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t imagine trying to perfectly place the single designs perfectly with the large side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not to impressed with this stamper I prefer a different kind of stamper .</li>
            <li> The stamper is great, picks up images well, is easy to clean, and I appreciate the two sizes.</li>
            <li> Great quality, the stamper itself is quite easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> Love this product nice to be able to switch ends and not have to pull out another stamper.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing, the stamper is great but the scraper not to much ...</li>
            <li> Also really easy to clean, great brand for nail art.</li>
            <li> This stamper works awesome and the double ended feature is nice as the size of the stamps and people&#x27;s nails vary.</li>
            <li> I used pure acetone to clean the stamper and plates and it cleaned off perfectly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the polish gets picked up pretty great</li>
            <li> so i heard this was great, and shipped fast, but mine still has not come!the polish and plates have already come though!</li>
            <li> Some nail polishes don&#x27;t work so just because it won&#x27;t stamp the first time it could be the nail polish over all great product.</li>
            <li> works great the first time, needs no buffing to get it to work.</li>
            <li> Product was great &amp; fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Worked great even as a first time stamper.</li>
            <li> When I first received this item, I thought they were both great.</li>
            <li> Great quality, works and came right away totally satisfied. : )</li>
            <li> But after trying this stamper set out, I thought the scraper worked just fine!</li>
            <li> Very important to have in order to transfer the design onto the nail.  </li>
            <li> This is extremely easy to work with, we started doing our own nail art</li>
            <li> The size is handy and it&#x27;s easy to grip, but I&#x27;d rather not scratch up my plates.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent product i highly recommend very good.i loved it.</li>
            <li> It was easy for her to use even the first time, her nails turned out beautifully.  </li>
            <li> The designs picked up and transfered perfectly, looks like a professional did my nails, the plate and scraper were very easy to clean up.  </li>
            <li> This is so easy to use and clean (I use a Q-tip to clean the scrapper)!!!</li>
            <li> its very good and arrived early</li>
            <li> This stamper and scraper are durable, cute, and yield very good and clear results for nail stamping.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a huge hit!</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter&#x27;s 8th birthday &amp; it was a huge hit with all the kids!  </li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I love this stamper</li>
            <li> it picks up most nail polish.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used it multiple times and it&#x27;s consistently excellent.  </li>
            <li> Polish sticks a bit more thsn it should.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Konad stamper...when it is working correctly.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the others who said to be sure to view the youtube tutorial.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to file your stamper and also rubbing the rubber end between your hands and warming it up helps as well.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to use the Konad nail polish as well.  </li>
            <li> This stamper also gives you more pressure when you&#x27;re stamping your design and has more of a handle to roll the stamper across your nail.</li>
            <li> I love the Konad Stamper with scraper.  </li>
            <li> But over all I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I ended up using a gift card instead and that worked much better.</li>
            <li> ive watched many tutorials</li>
            <li> some work better then</li>
            <li> Just remember to file it to get better pickup.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I do recommend it to those who love nail stamping art.</li>
            <li> and I love the stamper</li>
            <li> ENJOY!  </li>
            <li> I already know I will love this product.</li>
            <li> i love this stamper.  </li>
            <li> and she said she&#x27;s never gotten so many compliments before in her life.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cheap way to do your nails.</li>
            <li> but I hope to get some more practice with it when I get some time.</li>
            <li> I love the concept of being able to stamp on all kinds of designs on your nails.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s more to it than you.think.</li>
            <li> Its a cute idea</li>
            <li> ..need more opaque polished out come.</li>
            <li> and I am glad that I have 2 sizes to choose from with the stamper.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and if the scrapper ever rusts or gets lost you can always use a credit card or something similar to scrape the polish.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
            <li> or id works alot better then</li>
            <li> but I am getting it! :)</li>
            <li> enjoy!</li>
            <li> The double ended stamper is great!</li>
            <li> go with this one, works well with all brands of plates! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> So I knew for sure it was me that was doing something wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is what make the magic happen on your nails &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.</li>
            <li> I love my stamper set, it works just like it is supposed to and looks just like the picture.</li>
            <li> This item wouldve made me even more happier if it came with the plastic scraper instead of the metal.</li>
            <li> Ditch the scraper that comes with it - a gift/credit card is so much better.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> I have tried different kinds of stampers and this is the very best.  </li>
            <li> so it would pick up the stamping polish better.  </li>
            <li> the top part&lt;br /&gt;of</li>
            <li> Overall, its great!</li>
            <li> Nothing more.</li>
            <li> the double ends are wonderful..   </li>
            <li> Wear the most.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget the image plates!! :)</li>
            <li> OK SO BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS</li>
            <li> SURE</li>
            <li> Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great idea of putting this together.</li>
            <li> Nothing I read suggested I had to buy more components to use this product.  </li>
            <li> Most people keep saying, \\&quot;I use a gift</li>
            <li> :).</li>
            <li> I know they will love them.</li>
            <li> I just have to practice more</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s overall the best stamping kit I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li> The stamper works most of the time, but it is not Konad.</li>
            <li> I use a flexible plastic ID card and it works much better.</li>
            <li> Since I have purchased this one, I have gotten many more</li>
            <li> but this is still my trusted stamper that I use most times.</li>
            <li> I love my konad stamper.</li>
            <li> The photo I&#x27;ve attached is one of many manicures I did using my konad stamper and image plates.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m wondering if a sponge might work better?</li>
            <li> Was perfect for me as a beginner stamper with short nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but otherwise I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love love love these products.</li>
            <li> Make sure to keep around some non-acetone polish remover when cleaning the stamper or scraper.  </li>
            <li> I have 200+ polishes, nail blog, and have used many products-</li>
            <li> /&gt;i thought it was better than that&lt;</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this set.  </li>
            <li> and I love this stamper</li>
            <li> WOrks much better, the way it should</li>
            <li> I love stamping my nails, and it works well.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend it for girls who love to do their nails.</li>
            <li> Love the quality of the stamp.</li>
            <li> The scraper is ok</li>
            <li> it was better than the one i had before i purchase this one.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments on my nails than ever before, and always bring it with me when I visit friends or family.</li>
            <li> i like this stamp better than any of the others that i have tried.</li>
            <li> the scraper thing is also better than most.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of it, but I know I will with more practice.</li>
            <li> The scraper is ok and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> and I love the product.  </li>
            <li> And you can&#x27;t do any better than the konad brand</li>
            <li> You can use a business card or a playing card and it will scrape off the excess polish just as well or (for me) better than the scraper that comes with this.</li>
            <li> Most of the designs do not come-out or transfer to nail.  </li>
            <li> The scraper takes off most of the polish.  </li>
            <li> but im glad i bout this</li>
            <li> Try use different nail polishes to find the one the works best for you.</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE this stamper.</li>
            <li> but I am confident it will work.</li>
            <li> I thought when I ordered this I would be satisfied.</li>
            <li> Simply the best</li>
            <li> Much better price than eBay.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this stamper with a set of 25 stamping plates and all my friends are wondering how I got such perfect designs on my nails!</li>
            <li> Love this thing.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of the rubber stamping ends and the fact that it is removable.</li>
            <li> My granddaughters and I are enjoying the nail stamper.  </li>
            <li> but I think a plastic scraper might work better.</li>
            <li> cute package</li>
            <li> Also bought many of the Konad plates and polish colors for her.  </li>
            <li> Stamper is ok</li>
            <li> It works better if you have the specials nail paints for this.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it would have been better if it came with a plastic scrapper instead of a metal one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute still have to work it with the plates</li>
            <li> love it, and so do I</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve also heard that some folks scratch up the stamping pads to get the image to transfer better, I did not do this and do not recommend this.</li>

            <li> being said, I LOVE the double-ended stamper.</li>

            <li> I  love it</li>
            <li> - really glad I got this one.</li>
            <li> and more times this makes the nail polish blur.</li>
            <li> I heard that people sand there stamper a bit to get a better results.</li>
            <li> it works and i am glad i got it..</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product.</li>
            <li> The scraper is better too, with a metal blade that doesn&#x27;t leave remains.</li>
            <li> but I am SOOOOO glad I tried the Konad</li>
            <li> so I love love love love love this stamper.</li>

            <li> So glad I decided on this one.</li>
            <li> In love with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this Konad stamper.</li>
            <li> Much better than the stamper that comes in the starter kit, I would recommend getting this stamper and buys a cheaper brand of plates to go with them.</li>
            <li> So be patient! :)</li>
            <li> Love them both</li>
            <li> An edge piece of a cereal box works better.</li>
            <li> Glad that others shared this tip.  </li>
            <li> I am in love with my stamper :)</li>
            <li> The scraper works better than the M.A.S.H. one.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stamper and scraper.</li>
            <li> I love that it has two sized ends to use.</li>
            <li> I think the stamper is ok,</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s 2 sided</li>
            <li> With that being said make sure you use a nail polish that doesn&#x27;t stain.</li>
            <li> I feel like I need to use it more and more to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> But i love the idea</li>
            <li> I really love the stamper i even bought one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I love that I can do my fingers and toes with this stamper.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that it is two-sided.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a cheaper stamper and scraper and this is definitely better.</li>
            <li> and now I use the scraper only with the plastic part and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> and i am so glad i did.  </li>
            <li> This one works so much better.</li>
            <li> its really cute</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It just works better.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that for my 1st stamper and for me being a beginner to nail stamping</li>
            <li> This scraper wasn&#x27;t working and this wasn&#x27;t the authentic Konad.</li>
            <li> so then more gets on the scraper</li>
            <li> Pleased with the stamp.  </li>
            <li> Love the stamper.</li>
            <li> The stamper is simply the best.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad this thing is two-sided....</li>
            <li> It is still usable, but people have mentioned alternative scrapers that may work better.</li>
            <li> This stamper works well and would be even better if the stamps I purchased worked better.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully if used properly.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting into nail stamping after seeing so many cute manicures online.  </li>
            <li> ok you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> So much better than the Pueen one that I also ordered.</li>
            <li> No matter how many times i read the instructions and even look up tutorials on youtube, this does not work.</li>
            <li> I love this....</li>
            <li> what more can i say...</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Even with no practice and cheap polish, my nails look amazing and</li>
            <li> I have tried so many times to stamp on my nails with this product with no results whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> you like and the larger side works perfect for the whole finger nail stamp works great.</li>
            <li> Love this...doesn&#x27;t what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you wipe the end</li>
            <li> I love the metal scrapper I prefer it to the plastic one</li>
            <li> fast shipment and great product :)</li>
            <li> Stamper worked ok after buffing the surface.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to everyone! :)</li>
            <li> So my thoughts is if some of the reviewers have the same problem they should add it to the product description, besides that  this was a great buy!</li>
            <li> Deep matte polishes make especially great stamps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this makes using my stamping plates much better</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Good quality, fast shipping, nice packaging.</li>
            <li> I love the Konad stamper.</li>
            <li> I have created so many nail designs with this.</li>
            <li> Love this thing.</li>
            <li> The stampers that come with many of the stamping plates just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This product meets my expectations for the most part.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of youtube videos and tutorials of people doing it, I guess I just need more practice.</li>
            <li> just okay.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t regret buying it. :)</li>
            <li> This nail stamper was very easy to use and very easy to clean in between stamps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this allows you to be creative on your own ways and with your own materials, because no, Konad special nailpolish is not absolutely nesesary, i have tried it all, and it works perfectly with ANY nailpolish if you know how to use it</li>
            <li> this one is really good, works perfectly with most of my polishes, super easy to clean, cheap and just really good overall.</li>
            <li> but it is very worth it for that price!</li>
            <li> I just received this today, and was very excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> however, it looks like it&#x27;ll be very useful!</li>
            <li> I use a old credit card it seems to work just as good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and would reccomend it to anyone who wants to add more design to their nails in a fun and easy way.</li>
            <li> It truly does work great and makes my nails look detailed and pretty.</li>
            <li> picks up the paint pretty good, but sometimes needs sanded a bit for more grip.</li>
            <li> The stamper picks up pretty much any nail polish - saturated colors of course work best.</li>
            <li> I get nice clean stamps with this stamper.  </li>
            <li> I love nail art and trying new ways of getting great designs.</li>
            <li> You will have to buy your own designs and special nail polish.</li>
            <li> It stamps very clean and just wipes away excess polish.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good.</li>
            <li> i loved how fast my order came in!</li>
            <li> On my first try I was delighted to get it</li>
            <li> eh, it pretty good.</li>
            <li> it to, just need to figure out which polishes work best; love the different sizes available on double-ended stamper</li>
            <li> but I would say this one is pretty good for what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> It cleans up very nicely and the price was decent.  </li>
            <li> The stamp itself is great, and super easy to use, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> , my, my am i happy i did, clean and crisp images as well as</li>
            <li> very good and the double stampers allow for more variability.  </li>
            <li> We were not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy the cheap drug store kind when you can get this for such a good deal and know that it works!</li>
            <li> is worth it!!</li>
            <li> I was NOT disappointed!  </li>
            <li> This product worked great with my new Konad stamp stencil.</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> Two sides makes it able to switch easily.  </li>
            <li> Love how easy it is to use this product:D</li>
            <li> I heard how you have to get good ones or else they wont work very well and many times people give up!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Overall its a good set for a good price.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much I got my own.</li>
            <li> so even if it picked up the image at all, which was rare, it just wasn&#x27;t a smooth process and didn&#x27;t have good results.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to clean, use, &amp; store.</li>
            <li> I ordered this the 20th of March, and got it the 26th, wasn&#x27;t happy with the shipping, but it was totally worth it!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great quality and the fact that it has a larger and smaller size makes it even more awesome.</li>
            <li> Good quality fun to try new techniques feels good in your hand well balanced I would recommend</li>
            <li> To tell you the truth it is fine and you will love it.</li>
            <li> I decided to get the original Konand along with a sheet of stamps and it is pretty amazing!</li>
            <li> Its easy to roll across your nails and also very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It works much better than any free stamper that may come with your plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and wow it works great</li>
            <li> product is good and the two sides are useful but the scraper is not always easy to clean</li>
            <li> I purchased that cheap stamping kit which you can find at most Sally&#x27;s and drugstores, and I had no luck with that kit.  </li>
            <li> However, with this stamper I am able to use those plates which were included in the cheap stamper kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It came sooner than expected and works perfectly!</li>
            <li> It cam early and works great</li>
            <li> and I find that it helps me &#x27;place&#x27; the image more precisely.  </li>
            <li> So far she says that it is working great.</li>
            <li> She loved the idea of being able to do her own nails without having to go outside of her room.</li>
            <li> Good quality and works really well with</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast on the Konad kit &amp; the price was fair, so I&#x27;d still recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is also easy to clean!  </li>
            <li> very useful stamps bundle, this was a gift to my cousin, and she love it when she use it on her nails.</li>
            <li> However, when it comes out right it comes out amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome, and it makes it easy to do stamps quickly since it&#x27;s double sided.</li>
            <li> It picks up the images perfectly, and it is a lot softer than the other stamper I was using.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get the nail art plate, and polish, and stamper, and scraper to do my nails really cute.  </li>
            <li> I have used other stampers and scraper and have the Konad to be the best.  </li>
            <li> This stamper works the best out of the other stampers I tried.</li>
            <li> Best 6 bucks I&#x27;ve ever spent!</li>
            <li> I use this to put cute and unique designs on my nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool!</li>
            <li> The scraper does its job well but scratches the plates easily.  </li>
            <li> Came quickly, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold</li>
            <li> , I opted against that since it will scrape your discs easily.</li>
            <li> So let me start with saying this is so easy</li>
            <li> I love this stamper, it&#x27;s works flawlessly after just a few practice runs.</li>

            <li> These are so easy to use</li>

            <li> So easy to use with either hand.  </li>
            <li> The seller shipped it to me very quickly.</li>
            <li> Makes stamping easy.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy peasy.</li>

            <li> This stamping set from konad is fantastically priced and surprising high quality for the price.  </li>
            <li> The metal scraper WILL scratch your metal plates - throw it away and use an expired credit card or used up gift card - i.e. plastic that won&#x27;t scratch your beautiful (and potentially pricy) plates.  </li>
            <li> The ends are squishy and I get nice crisp images with no distortion.</li>

            <li> Once you get it down, you can make some awesome nail designs.</li>
            <li> Mine worked fine for picking up the design &amp; placing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold and comfortable to work with.</li>
            <li> What I was MOST pleased with was the seriously FAST delivery!</li>
            <li> and it worked fine,</li>
            <li> so I have to say that I like it just fine.</li>
            <li> This one works just fine with the plates.</li>
            <li> and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that works, but the scraper worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> It probably would&#x27;ve been fine if I had received the stencils</li>
            <li> scraper works just fine, but</li>
            <li> Works just fine</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, easy to store or travel with.</li>
            <li> Better for acrylic nails, not natural nails but does pick up the images great.</li>
            <li> and they both work fine.  </li>
            <li> Once I got used to it, it works fine.</li>
            <li> Stamper works like magic without the need to file it like so many forums suggest when you first start stamping.</li>
            <li> It picks up and applies designs smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li> The stamper works fine though I guess...</li>
            <li> :) ugh, love it so much!</li>
            <li> The holder works fine but the scraper scratches the plates.  </li>
            <li> The holder and stamper work fine.</li>
            <li> The stamp in this kit works just fine, but I would have never found that out if it weren&#x27;t for me already owning a stamp and scraper that I got from a mall vendor.</li>
            <li> No need to buff the stamp, the scraper worked fine, if you are worried about scratching your plate try using a credit card instead.</li>
            <li> Both the stamper and the scraper worked fine.  </li>
            <li> We did not need to wipe it off w/ polish remover each time &amp; the images came out fine.  </li>
            <li> It arrived in a very timely manner and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Very fun and easy to use</li>
            <li> Easily transfers the design and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, easy to use.</li>
            <li> its so easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and easy to take with you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun &amp; really easy to have cute images without going to a nail salon.</li>
            <li> Such cute &amp; fun things I can do with my nails!!!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use my first time</li>
            <li> Time after time her nails looked perfect with little effort.</li>
            <li> I love this stamper so much!!</li>
            <li> This little gem is awesome.</li>
            <li> BAM you got some cute nails for that hot date or work or for the heck of it!</li>
            <li> Very good everything I expected.</li>
            <li> I cut it in half for better grip and it worked!!!</li>
            <li> I was super excited when I got my konad stamping kit because I&#x27;ve seen so many youtube tutorials using this</li>
            <li> The seller should put an accurate pic of the product being sold and lower the price.</li>
            <li> This product was a huge let-down.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge hit.</li>
            <li> Since most people would use the pink side anyway I think this is still a great choice.</li>
            <li> The stamper is fabulous though</li>
            <li> It was worth the purchase price and even with the frustrations, I still do enjoy using it!</li>
            <li> Lightly sand the two tips with your nail filer.</li>
            <li> It sometimes takes a few times to get the image perfect.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and use.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy doing my nails now, and with so many different nail art stamp plates out there, it&#x27;s totally worth it and great price.</li>
            <li> If you want perfectly smooth nail designs saturated with color, you need this stamper.</li>
            <li> So happy, I might even order a second one!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> no one tells you online is that you have to press lightly onto the stamp for the color to transfer.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve ever tried the nail decals you know how bothersome and messy they can be, this is a great alternative to those!</li>
            <li> The stamper is easy to clean, and you can peel off the polish, easy, but the scraper is a PAIN to clean.</li>
            <li> Stamper is sooo easy to clean.</li>
            <li> So I did a bunch of research on these after i &amp;#34;got burned&amp;#34; buying a cheap one from another site.  </li>
            <li> the big end is great for an all-over design.</li>
            <li> This double end stamper works  great</li>
            <li> This stamper is GREAT quality, especially for its affordable price!!!!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s lots of free tutorials online that help get you started.</li>
            <li> You def need some practice but its fun to get creative with them.</li>
            <li> my opinion, it is quicker and easier to pain onto your nail free style...</li>
            <li> The ends of the stamper clean easy and and the scraper works well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but will condition it as the videos tell you to, by lightly sanding with an emery board (nail file).</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> it just takes practice to get the whole stamp on nicely.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t give up, be patient with yourself and most of all have fun.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t give up, be patient with yourself and most of all have fun.</li>
            <li> It easy  to clean too</li>
            <li> Do not buy, it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> it picks up nicely and works very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to spend any more money on polishes (I have around $500 worth of polish already).</li>
            <li> What came in the mail was a genuine Konad stamper.</li>
            <li> It also probably requires the Konad nail polishes because not every color I had went on smoothly and visibly.</li>
            <li> Did not work with cheap polishes</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t regret buying at all .. totally worth this price and more</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to clean the scraper and stamp.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t as smooth as this one</li>
            <li> The larger end of the stamper is great, the smaller end didnt work that great for me.</li>
            <li> However the stamper is to smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The stamper is to smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the genuine konad stamper</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like the sound of metal on metal.</li>
            <li> It even works great with regular polishes.</li>
            <li> The double ended stamper works great.  </li>
            <li> This is such a great thing to buy some one into nails.  </li>
            <li> For this, I make a ring of tape and have it available before I stamping.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice (don&#x27;t know how) that it was a double stamper and that works out great for my pinky nails.</li>
            <li> Both the sides the rubber stamp part actually comes all the way off which is great for cleaning.</li>
            <li> The surface of the stamper is sufficiently sized and the scraper doesn&#x27;t scratch the stamp plate like the cheap one does.</li>
            <li> it is just really light colored when you stamp)</li>
            <li> I have had the most success with Orly Luxe, China Glaze Champagne Bubbles and Celeb City by Sally Hansen.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s easy to transfer designs and easier to clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> Cleanly applies the image and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> It smoothly picks up the polish and transfers it to your nail.</li>
            <li> Overall, for the price, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great for smaller images on the narrower of the two ends.</li>
            <li> cheating at being fabulous.</li>
            <li> It would save your plates from the damaging effects of the metal scraper &amp; it&#x27;s free.</li>
            <li> They work great and this is my second one.</li>
            <li> The product is great enough..</li>
            <li> I read the reviews thinking I was about to get a lovely, cheap, and fun nail art device.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap ones, this works perfect.  </li>
            <li> After stamping the image, I wait for a couple of minutes so to avoid smearing, then put top coat on gently without letting the brush touching the design.</li>
            <li> its the templates I am trying to use that do not make a good clear shape.</li>
            <li> With Konad stamper and some nail stamping plates, I can create whatever design in whatever color I desire, and if I find a design I love I can use it as much as I want :)</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and it worked with other nail polishes than konad nail art polish, which is great since I never bought any :)</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described, easy to use and easy to clean!</li>
            <li> I was able to start using it right away</li>
            <li> that´s where I am right now, I have to wait up to two weeks for the guarantee team at Amazon to investigate my case and see if they will be able to refund my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Had to see many YouTube videos to use it right way but still not</li>
            <li> at home results more fun, quick and easy now</li>
            <li> I think this was very worth the price, and I can see myself using it over and</li>
            <li> The stamps are perfect sizes the big one gets the whole design and the small side is perfect for pinky toes and nails</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast and even though the stamper comes in protective plastic, the seller also put it in a nice thick padded envelope, so it arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> The company very kindly issued a refund without me having to deal with shipping it back.  </li>
            <li> If you have the patience to stamp, and even more patience to clean up, then these tools are fun to use.</li>
            <li> i had seen reviews on youtube about other brands of stamper and scraper and the overall consensus is that to get a good clean stamp, it is best to use a scrape with a metal blade as opposed to one with a plastic end.</li>
            <li> So far I really love how it performs because the stamper is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Other than that, works great and is super easy to use!</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s my first time, I need a bit practice to be more accurate to get the designs on my nails.</li>
            <li> I just filed both the stamper heads lightly with a filer and then used a piece of scotch tape to clean the stamper.</li>
            <li> The larger end works great for a full nail design and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a noob to stamping but this stamper is super easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use, even for beginners.</li>
            <li> This is my first stamper and scrapper set, so far the stamper has worked great</li>
            <li> Easy payment options and quick shippment.</li>
            <li> The shipping came pretty fast which was good.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Her 9 year old friend tried it and she was able to do it on her own after a quick demo.</li>
            <li> Quick, easy, no prepping needed.</li>
            <li> It is also perfect for use on my neices little fingers!</li>
            <li> and I find this simple setup fascinating and easy.  </li>
            <li> It is super simple to use and gives great results.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dubble sided, nice and soft, picks up design easily.</li>
            <li> I love doing nail art, but sometimes I just don&#x27;t feel like doing it, so an easy fast fun way to spice up my fingertips is to use the stamping art!</li>
            <li> It requires some skill, but it&#x27;s definitely worth trying if you&#x27;re a nail enthusiast!</li>
            <li> This product is well worth it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for small fingers.</li>
            <li> Excited to use this with the group of design plates.</li>
            <li> THAT WHEN U DO YOUR FIRST STAMP MAKE SURE AFTERWARDS</li>
            <li> This Konad Nail Art Double Ended Scraper and Stamper is the best in its class by far!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not user friendly.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered and it works most of the time.</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t want to splurge on the Konad plates, the stamper is worth it!  </li>
            <li> worth the 5 dollars no problem!</li>
            <li> Ok the first time i knew about konad was on YouTube</li>
            <li> I know that on Christmas morning she is going to be so excited to see this.   </li>
            <li> If i had known this stamper was so great i would have bought it a long time ago</li>
            <li> Some of the images don&#x27;t work so well, but it&#x27;s alot of fun to use with my step daughter!</li>
            <li> so the small one worked best for my pinky.</li>
            <li> my first purchase and many of the women said the metal scraper would scratch the stamp plates</li>
            <li> fun with this!  </li>
            <li> I like this stamp better than the one that came with my first kit.  </li>
            <li> so you are able to stamp exactly where you want.</li>
            <li> but when you do, it&#x27;s so much fun!</li>
            <li> We have so much fun with these!</li>
            <li> Pretty ok, but you cant get the exactdesigns as they show on TV</li>
            <li> Definitly buy alooooooot of plates, and make sure you have pure acetoneso it can be cleaned smoothly.</li>
            <li> The scraper is great - you need to make sure you clean it well ( the nail polish will get stuck in the little holes that hold the metal in place )</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s to new and won&#x27;t work effectively.  </li>
            <li> Makes doing nail art fun and easy.  </li>
            <li> AND it doesn&#x27;t have the pesky rim that you have to clean every time you do a nail</li>
            <li> You can clean the rubber off w/your finger nail or rub it w/your finger.  </li>
            <li> a damp washcloth- a clean stamp helps designs transfer.&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li> Clean the plate and Stamper and card after each apply with acetone remover with a CLOTH not cotton balls.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use acetone to clean it just scotch tape..</li>
            <li> I have used several nail art products but Konad is by far the best!</li>
            <li> This made stamping so easy and fun to do.  </li>
            <li> As I mentioned, easy to use and a lot of fun.</li>
            <li> product, just wish it was easier to clean.</li>
            <li> It transfers so cleanly.</li>
            <li> THAT U CLEAN EACH STAMPING</li>
            <li> like others said, a gift card works just as well and is easier to clean.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find it locally and was thrilled to get it here :-)</li>
            <li> One thing, in rode rto attach well the image, you have to clean it every time otherwise, doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Best way to clean the stamper: one of those lint rollers that&#x27;s an over-sized cylinder of sticky tape.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still doesn&#x27;t come clean.</li>
            <li> This works much better and my nail art looks more professional.</li>
            <li> IMO, an expired giftcard works just as well and is easier to clean off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fun and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> clean looking on the nail</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t clean the stamper with nail remover.</li>
            <li> I heard acetone gets absorbed into your skin very quickly</li>
            <li> And always clean the stamp, image plate, and scraper after each use with Acetone nail polish remover (I use a Q-tip dipped in acetone.</li>
            <li> I clean it with alcohol between uses</li>
            <li> and I clean the stamper with acetone between each application.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it will come more naturally to others. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to use for easy designs.  </li>
            <li> One tip is to clean the stampers, scraper and plate with rubbing alcohol instead of acetone nail polish remover, so you won&#x27;t damage the plate and melt away the rubber stamp tips.</li>
            <li> gotta clean each time after use....ummm</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, not bad, but really, the scraper doesn&#x27;t work any better than a credit card.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you practiced a lot more with it, you&#x27;d be good, but it never really cut it for me.</li>
            <li> But I still think this is a great stamper to have if it will be your first cause you certainly will get much use out of both sides.</li>
            <li> and it came with the single ended stamper which works great.</li>
            <li> I got these dupe suggestions from a famous nail-tutorial youtuber (elleandish) and they are pretty good replacements if you don&#x27;t wanna spend the extra money.</li>
            <li> this by FAR is my favorite!</li>
            <li> It  picks up the polish great, and as long as I work quickly</li>
            <li> (Special Introductory Price)]]</li>
            <li> The scraper is nothing special, it does scratch the plates though.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have to be the Konad \\&quot;special polish\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> but they sell special polish for it</li>
            <li> However, the large side of this stamper is fantastic for doing toe nails or an all over nail print!</li>
            <li> just right!</li>
            <li> They were so right!  </li>
            <li> A credit card is probably a cleaner way to go since nail polish will be harder to clean in the corners of the metal/plastic, but this still works great.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and works like it says; just be sure to clean it after every use with nail-polish remover.</li>
            <li> The scraper works really well; just make sure you clean it after each use.</li>
            <li> This little stamper worked awesome, exactly like it was supposed, to no complaints here.</li>
            <li> Came in quick works great haven&#x27;t had a single problem with it</li>
            <li> Great little stamper, really like that it is a simple yet a great tool for giving your nail a bit more.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to &#x27;file&#x27; the end of the stamper as some users mentioned to get the image to transfer; it worked just fine right out of the package.</li>
            <li> It works just fine right out of the box(well</li>
            <li> With the right polishes, you can quickly and easily give yourself a fancy professional-looking manicure.</li>
            <li> delivery was great and the seller got it to me way before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always use the scraper with some designs I use the straight edge of a scrap of tag board, like packaging inserts, it works better on wider designs (because you can cut it to size) and you can just toss it out instead of cleaning it.</li>
            <li> I was taking my dear sweet time and the polish dries and then won&#x27;t stick to the stamper or your nail  5)</li>
            <li> but I heard only good things about the konad stamper.</li>
            <li> I clean the product and try to do everything quickly</li>
            <li> I personally have not had a good experience with this product I bought one for myself and my daughter got one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li> I recommend using a different scrapper if you make this purchase, but the stamper itself is a good one.</li>
            <li> LOVE the whole stamping \\&quot;thing\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> n most of them seem to work very well.</li>
            <li> ,It picks the images very nicely.but its better to use the plastic scraper to avoid scratches on plate..</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stamper.</li>
            <li> i liked this product but now i replaced the scraper with old credit card as it was scratching my plates.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because sometimes it doesn&#x27;t pick up the designs, but overall it does a good job.</li>
            <li> I read that one should file the stamper gently to help it grip the nail polish better</li>
            <li> Nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It picks up patterns well especially if you use a good polish.</li>
            <li> My teen loved them.</li>
            <li> She loves to do peoples nails and paints her own nearly every day.</li>
            <li> this item is way to cool</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably have to buy some stamping polish to get the full utility out of it.</li>
            <li> I had a Salon Express stamper before this one &amp; this enabled me to get a full transfer.  </li>
            <li> I had problems transferring full sized images and couldn&#x27;t get some images to pick up period.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It helps a lot to have one of the manicure clean-up pens for your cuticles (full of nail polish remover) because some of the pattern will stick to your skin.</li>
            <li> [...] My absolute favorite konading polishes are Sally Hansen Insta-Dri</li>
            <li> I tried this stamping product at a friends and it worked so well and looked so cool</li>
            <li> Always check the stamp before stamping it onto your nail to make sure the whole image has transferred.</li>
            <li> Overall it is was a good purchase</li>
            <li> i use regular polish and it work really good</li>
            <li> Go straight to Konad Brand, this one takes away all the hasle :)</li>
            <li> Sometimes you have to stamp a nail twice for full coverage which could ruin the look of the design.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend this to ANYONE who wants to start stamping :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for about $5 and it was the most reasonable price I found throughout the websites.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s smaller than I was expecting which is good because it&#x27;s easier to hold.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also read that gently filing the stamp heads with a nail file helps your polish grab onto the stamper better, if you&#x27;re having transferring problems.</li>
            <li> I think the animal prints plate is a good starting point for beginers because you don&#x27;t have to worry about placement looking off with those designs.</li>
            <li> I can use such a good scraper with but will hang on it.</li>
            <li> After much research, I decided not to use the scraper as so many people warned it would scratch the plates.</li>
            <li> This is a good brand though and not generic.</li>
            <li> This stamp is great for full nail and partial nail designs.  </li>
            <li> One thing I want to say about this product, which as far as I know wasn&#x27;t in any of the reviews, if this is your first time buying a stamper, make sure you look at the tutorial on YouTube and also make sure that you FILE YOUR STAMPER before the first use!!</li>
            <li> From the first try everything stamped so easily without using Konad special polish because they haven&#x27;t arrived as of today.  </li>
            <li> It is perfect for full nail designs and for small detail designs!</li>
            <li> The excess polish left on the stamper peels right off, it&#x27;s freaking amazing!</li>
            <li> The stamper is super easy to use and feels good in your hand, I didn&#x27;t use the scraper only because I heard that using an old gift card or credit card would be better and it does work.</li>
            <li> It was be nice if the stamp was in a less popular color though.</li>
            <li> I just got my first stamper and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, even for a first time</li>
            <li> HAVE YET TO TRY IT, BUT LOOKS PRETTY EASY.</li>
            <li> The large red end is great for full nail designs.</li>
            <li> The small end is perfect for single images while the big side is perfect for full nail and tip designs.      </li>
            <li> Other than that it is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Other than that the stamper works great.</li>
            <li> This stamp system is so fun and unique.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews, they are great products.</li>
            <li> This stamper works great, and I have not had problems with the scraper damaging my plates, as I have read other people mention.</li>
            <li> It definitely worked best to apply the stamper with some pressure in one smooth motion from left to right.</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, I did use a nail file to \\&quot;buff\\&quot; the stamper, and I&#x27;ve gotten perfect stamping results, Overall, great product and an obvious must if you want to do nail art stamping!</li>
            <li> Results with this stamper can be awesome -- but mastering it takes serious practice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit time consuming having to clean after every stamp to remove the polish from the plate, scraper, and any from the stamper, but it&#x27;s certainly worth it.</li>
            <li> After MANY tries I was able to do it easily.</li>
            <li> Is so easy to decorate nail with and looks so professional with easy clean up....</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> many many times I finally got the image to stick onto it.</li>
            <li> Love the double end stamper but the scraper is just ok.</li>
            <li> , he nails look more professional than the free hand designs I sometimes get at the salon.</li>
            <li> arrived pretty quickly!</li>
            <li> Im hoping the seller will reply quickly or Im going to ask for my refund.</li>
            <li> Item shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> The image dries to quickly when trying to put it on your nails</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I think this stamper will save you a lot of money all need is some  different design nail plates  to go alone with it and some cute polish, and you are set :)</li>
            <li> it ships quick.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once and find that it makes a difference when you file the stamper bottom with a nail file to ensure you are able to get the most defined design patterns.</li>
            <li> Quickly sent.</li>
            <li> Quick ship.</li>

            <li> I love the way that there are many different plates I can get.  </li>
            <li> Works very well, easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m usually successful, but then I fail on my own nails!</li>
            <li> (Which is 10 times at least) all in all, it was the best purchase and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Quick response, as well.  </li>
            <li> Received item quickly.  </li>
            <li> Quickly shipped.</li>
            <li> It is so much better to just use an old credit card or old reward card it works 100 times better!</li>
            <li> Overall, very pleased.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this stamper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> File the ends of the Stamper lightly before first use.</li>
            <li> This is my very first experience with stamping.</li>
            <li> It felt somewhat cheap and it did not transfer the design onto the finger consistently.</li>
            <li> The scraper itself has not been used as I don&#x27;t want to damage my plates due to the metal edge, but an old gift card or credit card works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This was cheap, but has been holding up very well!</li>
            <li> Very First Stamper...</li>
            <li> I dont have a lot of experience with nail art but had no difficulty using it the very first time.</li>
            <li> I use a normal razor blade because it&#x27;s neater and seems to do the job better.</li>
            <li> I am also attaching a photo of my very first manicure with this stamper</li>
            <li> The scraper is nice too, easy to hold though harder to clean.</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times and love it, It is very easy to use and cleans fairly easy.</li>
            <li> It was here super fast and works like a charm!!</li>
            <li> This is great for those smaller designs that you want in a particular place.  </li>
            <li> Awesome for doing large or small designs.</li>
            <li> but its fun and is great for the big toe nail where the design doesnt need the top coat and the margin for error is bigger</li>
            <li> The only thing you have to make sure is that your card isn&#x27;t chipped, make sure its smooth and straight.    </li>
            <li> I refuse to buy special polishes at this point, as I have seen loads of tutorials on Youtube using polishes I already own, but I may decide to in the future if I can&#x27;t get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I love new nail ideas, techniques, and products.</li>
            <li> Hopefully they come out with something more new and improved.</li>
            <li> If you have an instagram account and if you love posting new nail design on your bio</li>
            <li> I have many compliments every time I put on new nail arts.</li>
            <li> The stamper was great at first as well, but now the rubber pieces often fall out which is less than great when you&#x27;re trying to be careful while doing your nails.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> easy order fast shipment.</li>
            <li> This stamper really does make stamping easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very durable, and easy to clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once figured, like others said, it was fast and easy.</li>
            <li> Overall good product, I got exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Make sure you file both ends before using it the first time or the images won&#x27;t really stick.</li>
            <li> I think this would be a good gift for a little girl, so easy a kid could use it.</li>
            <li> The large one is perfect for my thumb, and the smaller side is great for my other fingers, especially my pinky.</li>
            <li> Very professional looking, easy and just fun!</li>
            <li> The following ones are better!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I love unexpected surprises!</li>
            <li> Nail polish cleans off very well with almost no acetone!!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well!</li>
            <li> stamper and plates arrived the same day, so I immediately used them, and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> First time I tried the Konad scraper I was floored!  </li>
            <li> Works very well!!</li>
            <li> good stuff, does a great job with picking up the patterns off the plates big or small.</li>
            <li> Works really well!!</li>
            <li> Stamper broke on first use!</li>
            <li> I can have cute professional looking designs on my nails and change them every day if I want!</li>
            <li> I should of gotten it first and saved myself some money!</li>
            <li> as a recent obsessor over nails, I was so happy to stumble upon this lovely invention.</li>
            <li> but this really makes stamping easy and fun.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and the small end is perfect for my pinky nail or smaller stamps.</li>
            <li> However, an old credit card or the like works very well (better even!)    </li>
            <li> your curious about this whole stamping process, if you can do it, if the results are easy and look as good</li>
            <li> Stamping is a great way to add a  little bit of flair to your nails.</li>
            <li> Great product, could use a little work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky for kids to use, but they were just as happy picking out the designs and colors and letting me do the stamping.</li>
            <li> I do find that using a credit card is more effective than the little metal scraper they include because 1.</li>
            <li> You paint on the image plate with the konad special polish, scrape the excess off, dab the stamper on it, and PRESTO the image is ready to apply to your nail!</li>
            <li> the local mall u can find these for 20 but this price is amazing</li>
            <li> It took some trial  and error to figure out how to use the product and a few YouTube videos, however I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> scrapper is great, you just have to use it carefully to avoid scratching your plates, do not use too much force against the plates and</li>
            <li> it works great after you have practiced a few times.</li>
            <li> While you can use different stamping plates or do it free hand, use different brands of nail polish, or use a business or playing card as the scraper the one thing you NEED to become a great nail stamper and can&#x27;t do without is the stamping tool.</li>
            <li> these are fun and it works great - gives a salon look without the price and trouble</li>
            <li> Must use a fast, light hand to transfer designs from stamper to nail.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t even pull up a whole stamp from a plate because it doesn&#x27;t fit on it.  </li>
            <li> I use the metal scraper too, worked better than an old card for me.</li>
            <li> This works well, purchased it with the bundle monster manicure plates and now am sporting some fun finger and toe nail art</li>
            <li> all in all, it&#x27;s a fun tool</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have the two sizes for smaller designs and nails!  </li>
            <li> Fun stamper.  </li>
            <li> As regards to the scraper, I have found that using an old credit card/gift card works better than the scraper that comes with this kit.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Konad double ended stamper on Friday morning and received it in Saturday&#x27;s mail, I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting it until Monday</li>
            <li> and i thought it was pretty cool.</li>
            <li> and it is really useful.</li>
            <li> Go all the way with Konad, it&#x27;s worth your money.</li>
            <li> However, you may be okay with not buying the scraper because I&#x27;ve used an old gift card</li>
            <li> handy if you are doing a design the same color as the stamp-</li>
            <li> You get 20-some plates with 4-8 designs on them and they&#x27;re lots of fun.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to people of all ages who want to be a bit more experimental with their nails.</li>
            <li> Idk if its worth it to buy their stamping polish at this point....</li>
            <li> It fits well in your hand and it is nice to have several sizes to choose.</li>
            <li> So far it is my wife&#x27;s favorite stamper and scraper.</li>
            <li> i hope its worth the wait!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I think the quality of this item is well worth</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re golden.</li>
            <li> For the price it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> This item takes practice to master, but is worth the effort once you fet the hang of it.</li>
            <li> so far I love it.</li>
            <li> , instead I use an old gift card which works out well because it is rather easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare though and it works 99% of the time.</li>
            <li> Over all, the stamper its self is worth the money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was worth buying for my nail art collection accessories.</li>
            <li> the sponge part on the stamper fell out, poorly manufactured however great for stamping!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the scraper, old gift cards work better.  </li>
            <li> Still learning how to use properly, but so far I&#x27;m happy with this stamper.</li>
            <li> I think it is definitely worth it even just for the stamper and to use something else for the scraper.</li>
            <li> definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> This product is fun</li>
            <li> I find that an old credit/ID card works SO much better.</li>
            <li> The konad stamper is by far much better</li>
            <li> This helps it to pick up the image more completely.  </li>
            <li> A lot of fun.</li>
            <li> have purchased four stampers, this one is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> but this is totally worth buying.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny I paid for it.</li>
            <li> it works well, the 2 sides are useful.</li>
            <li> and it took me a couple tries before I got a good image to come off the stamp.</li>
            <li> I was able to use this on my cheap plates and konad plates and it picked up polish so much better than my old generic stamper.</li>
            <li> it will keep forever,  the product arrived in a timely fashion, I was thrilled and will be using it next weekend.</li>
            <li> This has been fun for me to use and I have received a lot of comments from others that they like it.</li>
            <li> since is the only stamper i own</li>
            <li> I feel that the difference in quality when applying the stamps makes this set worth the price difference.</li>
            <li> Still worth it</li>
            <li> Just grab an old gift card :)</li>
            <li> I just use an old hotel key card as my scraper and it works great.</li>
            <li> Me and my daughter have so much fun with this stamper and scraper.  </li>
            <li> So well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s worth mentioning that the rubber ends of the stamper can be pulled out, if you need them to for whatever reason.</li>
            <li> One time I put the rhinestones that I was going to use for a friends manicure in there, that way all I had to do was open up the stamper, it came in handy, so there&#x27;s an idea.</li>
            <li> Instead, use an old credit card - that&#x27;s what I do, and it&#x27;s much more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did find using an old credit card to rub off the excess polish works better than the blade in this package.  </li>
            <li> I liked the actual stamper piece.  </li>
            <li> I rarely do my nails until now.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This system took me a lot of getting used to, but it&#x27;s so worth</li>
            <li> Also found that an old credit card as a scraper worked consistently much better than the metal or plastic versions I got in these kits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found out that an old credit card works a lot better.</li>
            <li> I have found that using an old credit card or store loyalty card works WAY better than the scrapper.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as picky about something being perfectly even or straight as we are when we get a little older.</li>
            <li> Period.n&#x27;t as picky about something being perfectly even or straight as we are when we get a little older.</li>
            <li> and I think I got the hang of it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> This item Arrived quickly and exactly as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> The green end is perfect for single detail items and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Once the image is on the nail make sure you&#x27;re very careful about putting on a top coat as that can smudge your image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> With a credit/gift card, you don&#x27;t have to dig deep with a q-tip to make sure the polish is gone, you just have to run it between some cotton soaked in acetone and behold, it&#x27;s as clean as when you started.</li>
            <li> The double-ended design is nice - the small end is great for smaller images and/or doing my pinky nails</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the scraper, but just as good as other scrapers I have used.  </li>
            <li> other wise</li>
            <li> I purchased this stamper due to the good reviews Konad received from nail design blogs.</li>
            <li> We are brand new to stamping our nails and this little stamper works very good.</li>
            <li> But right now its now meeting my expectations.</li>
            <li> and i know im doing it right...</li>
            <li> After about 3 uses, one of the stampers fell right off the end.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t get it to work well and look right.</li>
            <li> I use the stamper right away</li>
            <li> One customer has offered a right picture but it concludes a plate which is not concluded in the package.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It picked up images clearly right away.</li>
            <li> I got this right away.</li>
            <li> I like that this stamper doesn&#x27;t need to be &amp;#34;primed&amp;#34;; it works perfectly right out of the package.  </li>
            <li> I have used every polish on the face of this planet and NOTHING works right.</li>
            <li> The polish wipes right off when done.</li>
            <li> Works great, love the two sided design, very easy to hold and easy to see pink and red polishes on the green side.</li>
            <li> All positive things to say about this set!</li>
            <li> first attempting to do my own and create different designs...</li>
            <li> Now, I know how (you need to clean the plate really fast and use the scraper in an angle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the smaller side because the larger side is just so much more efficient, but more power to you if you think you need it. :)</li>
            <li> The price was pretty nice and it only took three days to get to me.</li>
            <li> Also very east to clean.</li>
            <li> dazzling possibilities become super exciting, and the fact that once you get this down, you can make pretty sweet insta-amaze-o designs on your nails in less than 10 minutes is handy and feels like winning/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to clean and makes the whole process simple and efficient!</li>
            <li> If you are new to Konading, here are the two sites that really helped me get started on Konadicure :)    </li>
            <li> a very smart purchase</li>
            <li> I like that it is easy and comfortable to use and that the stamper has 2 different sizes.  </li>
            <li> I just got my Konad stamper a few days ago and am loving it!  </li>
            <li> all it takes is a normal to light amount of pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its great for small details when using the konad plates.</li>
            <li> This kit looks cool but does not work very well.</li>
            <li> Hope you guys have fun with your Stamper and Scraper, I really do recommend it!</li>
            <li> I read multiple times that Konad is the best of the best and even if you fail with other stampers, try again with the Konad.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how fast it goes (I can stamp all of ours in under 10 min), and everyone assumes we&#x27;ve gotten them professionally done!  :-)</li>
            <li> (Squishy is something to look for so when you&#x27;re doing full nail designs the stamper can reach every curve/groove/edge of the nail for a clean, complete look.)</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical of this entire concept, but I was too impressed and envious of all the cool nail-art I was seeing online (mostly on Pinterest and some blogs).</li>
            <li> Stamper and Scraper is a good buy for someone that has small nails, I also have the original one that Konad came out with first</li>
            <li> I took one star away only because the scraper is hard to clean and sometimes not the best, depending on what plate I&#x27;m using.  </li>
            <li> I use Sinful Colors nail polish because it is thick enough (and cheap but great) that the nail stamper picks up the color easily.</li>
            <li> The polish transfers from plate to nail seamlessly and excess polish cleans off easily with a bit of nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The konad stamper transfers the image from my plates clearly and easily.</li>
            <li> I noticed the stamper was slightly tacky (which is good)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping time was good, but you can imagine how surprised I got when instead of getting the Konad Nail Art Double Ended Stamper And Scraper, I got a Klean Color Neon Lacquer Mini Collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the rubber is soft which makes it much easier to get the design on your nails, I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> When I received this one yesterday I was really surprised how easy it was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with polishes and plates of tons of different brand, and I&#x27;ve never felt like I was missing anything because of that...</li>
            <li> Also the shipping was quick and price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> my nails are short so the smaller is great for them.</li>
            <li> The stamp is great and I like the double end since I do my daughter&#x27;s nails as well and need the smaller end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how they do it, but it&#x27;s MAGIC!!</li>
            <li> and it was a major success!!</li>
            <li> did exactly what i expected it to and smoothly :]</li>
            <li> The larger end is great for my first four nails and the smaller end</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was that the rubber came off, but just krazy glue it and your fine!</li>
            <li> Very cheap looking and the scraper is the cheapest I have ever seen, will definitely scratch your plates.</li>
            <li> very very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it very much</li>
            <li> Lost it when moving houses and miss it very much.</li>
            <li> so I did so very gently before using.</li>
            <li> I very much recommend this stamper.</li>
            <li> Very ready to use picks up images well.</li>
            <li> The green end is nice for more precise placement of smaller accent images.</li>
            <li> I wore my old one out after a few years of use and was very happy to receive my new one.</li>
            <li> I chose to buy this product because of the high reviews posted &amp; I made the right choice!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this stamper that often, however, as I&#x27;ve found others I enjoy more from other companies.</li>
            <li> Mainly do to reviews that old gift cards work better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used and loved Konad&#x27;s regular stamper, and wondered if purchasing this one would be redundant, but I&#x27;ve enjoyed using the smaller, more precise stamping end more than I expected.</li>
            <li> The rubber ends are easy to clean and are large enough for the designs I use.  </li>
            <li> First time stamper here.</li>
            <li> First look up tutorials on YouTube.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s a double ended stamper</li>
            <li> I LOVE the double ended stamper.</li>
            <li> Other than that I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> LOVE the two different size stampers.</li>
            <li> I love this, I wish I could purchase just the double stamper because the scraper will just scrape my shiney plates away.</li>
            <li> I love my Konad double stamper!</li>
            <li> Did not work at all at first.</li>
            <li> Bought it a while back and still using it till this day and buying more as gifts when needed.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty nifty tool.</li>
            <li> All in all, the product does exactly what it is advertised to do.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly like it is stated in the description and looks identical to the image.</li>
            <li> hopefully I will have a better luck in gettin my money back (wish me luck).</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong for the low price and great product!! :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely dissatisfied!  </li>
            <li> I did have some problems using it at first, so I&#x27;m going to share some tips with you.  </li>
            <li> The first one I used had a moisturizer in it, and the polish would not stick well to the stamper  2)</li>
            <li> I love the double ended Konad Nail Stamper!</li>
            <li> i am getting ready to try it out now!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me at first.</li>
            <li> First off pitch</li>
            <li> White might be better</li>
            <li> This is the first stamp we have purchased</li>
            <li> I made sure to purchase the stamper from a seller that had amazon fulfillment, especially because of some of the reviews that reported receiving knockoffs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I went for a double sided one</li>
            <li> To anyone buying their first stamper, do NOT immediately file the stamper.</li>
            <li> it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> If you love doing your nails pretty, DEFINITELY get one of these!!!!!</li>
            <li> It works really well!</li>
            <li> Well when I when to use it first I just couldn&#x27;t get it to transfer on the stamper.</li>
            <li> does exactly what it says it does though.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying nail stamping.</li>
            <li> This is my first foray into stamping</li>
            <li> but it actually works better then</li>
            <li> I just bought this to go along with my first konad stamping plate.  </li>
            <li> I just received this today and the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> so it seemed logical to go with this one</li>
            <li> Takes time but us much cheaper then visiting the nail salon!</li>
            <li> Coincidently, the larger side&#x27;s &amp;#34;stampy thing&amp;#34; picks up polish from my nail plates better that the skinny side.</li>
            <li> but this works really well!</li>
            <li> I thoroughly checked the product descriptions and reviews to determine if this was a suitable and complete gift for a young girl.  </li>
            <li> This was the first stamper I purchased for myself.</li>
            <li> do my nails different for work and people just love how it looks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this exact Konad stamper and scraper for about 3 months.  </li>
            <li> Only warning--- I love using acetone to take off my polish because I&#x27;m a glitter girl</li>
            <li> Nice and wide.</li>
            <li> First off, I rate the shipping 1 star.</li>
            <li> do recommend watching a tutorial on YouTube before first use.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t pick up the image at first, so I filed it a bit....</li>
            <li> I love that it has a smaller end.</li>
            <li> Same product, MUCH better value.  </li>
            <li> Costs about as much as a bottle of nail polish so its worth it, because it&#x27;ll outlast any bottle of polish.</li>
            <li> After the first 2 were flops</li>
            <li> Love this and have used it several times with my daughter.  </li>
            <li> The plastic feels cheap, but so far, it&#x27;s done what I need it to.</li>
            <li> Package was exactly as shown (as of today&#x27;s date).</li>
            <li> I did and regret not just buying the konad stamper first.</li>
            <li> It was my first time using nail art</li>
            <li> I thought it would make it easier to be more accurate when applying small designs - and this proved true.)  </li>
            <li> You actually have more control over where you put the stamp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First time user for any of the design stuff for nails and</li>
            <li> I will definately do more business with this vendor in the future.</li>
            <li> This is the first stamper I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> but this is by KONAD and it looks exactly like it is in the picture.</li>
            <li> I have small hands so this perfect for the french manicure.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li> This takes a quick and steady hand.</li>
            <li> I first assumed it was defective..</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s double sided</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t scratch your plates, and they work the first time.</li>
            <li> Thanks Konad!</li>
            <li> I had to do some extensive YouTube research to get the hang of this, but now I love it.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I could use the polish I already had</li>
            <li> this stamper is pretty neat.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s my first time stamping</li>
            <li> konad has the best products, other people have complained about other stampers not working, this worked great for me</li>
            <li> my mother gave me this for Christmas and the funny thing is between her and my daughter</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first experience with nail stamping</li>
            <li> I wiped it off with acetone first, of course).</li>
            <li> I was able to use it with regular nail polish as well without having to file the ends.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my first stamper</li>
            <li> did not get the first set bought from another seller.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have bothered with the Salon Express kit if I found this first.</li>
            <li> I love the double sides</li>
            <li> Makes doing nails much simpler!</li>
            <li> I ordered a MASH stamper when I first started stamping, but was having nothing but problems with it.</li>
            <li> THIS WORKS EXACTLY</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly how the item is described.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cheap price because you won&#x27;t be able to get the excess polish off of the stamp plates.</li>
            <li> also because it is SO much easier to use!</li>
            <li> This was the first time i tried stamping</li>
            <li> and i absolutely was thankful for how easy this was to use, they also clean up very easily, definitely recommend this for anyone interested in stamping</li>
            <li> Exactly as the product is described.</li>
            <li> The two different sizes allow better precision when stamping.</li>
            <li> This was my FIRST time with Konard</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> There are some that&#x27;s really pretty and easier to make imprints of.</li>
            <li> I ordered this stamper and scraper set and upon my first use, I couldn&#x27;t get an image to appear on the stamper.  </li>
            <li> My friend has this exact stamper</li>
            <li> Truly gets the image on the first time..</li>
            <li> and there is no way I would be able to transfer an image consistently with the two stampings I would need for my entire nail.</li>
            <li> My tween and teen can use this themselves and love doing their nails.</li>
            <li> I can do so many nails and its so simple.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m obsessed with nail stuff, this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> This was my first time using ANY nail stamper.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but it arrived exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time and was exactly as described online.</li>
            <li> When I became interested in nail stamping</li>
            <li> At first, it wasn&#x27;t picking up anything on the plates, and then I did some research</li>
            <li> , it is my first time using stamping tools.</li>
            <li> First the stamper.</li>
            <li> The first use it scratched my plate</li>
            <li> I like this one much better because the stamping surface is much larger</li>
            <li> Fun to do , fast service</li>
            <li> (but there are a lot that look exactly like the konad plates)</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m a first time stamper, I still have to practice centering the images in my nails.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying my konad double side stamping kit.</li>
            <li> The first 10 or so times I tried to use this</li>
            <li> I love that it had two different sizes to stamp with.</li>
            <li> art is become very simple for me :)</li>
            <li> So much tireless fun.</li>
            <li> It also needs a few good scrapings in order to remove all of the nail polish.</li>
            <li> I have been playing with the stamper since I got it earlier today and its easy to use and a lot of fun.</li>
            <li> from what I seen so far on Youtube and other reviews seem so cute can&#x27;t wait to try it out once my plate stamps arrive in the mail :)</li>
            <li> The Konad Nail Stamper is a great way to add a little more oomph to your average at-home mani.  </li>
            <li> the smaller end is useful for more precise placement of smaller designs.  </li>
            <li> works great after buffing the end a little, even my 13 year old uses it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this was so straightforward.</li>
            <li> I know some people who have been able to transfer images successful using a regular thick nail polish.</li>
            <li> The small side is perfect for smaller nails to be more precise as well as with the smaller designs and with the French Manicures.    </li>
            <li> The double sided stamper is great because it has the larger side for full nail images, and the smaller side for smaller images so you can get a more precision</li>
            <li> Works great with ALL nail polishes: from the cheap $.99 to the expensive $10 ones.</li>
            <li> The more they get scratched the less of a clean stamping design you get and eventually it will ruin them.</li>
            <li> I tried multiple times and it just never really was that great.</li>
            <li> It is way easier to clean up; I just smear what&#x27;s scraped on to paper towel or old T-shirt.</li>
            <li> The Stamper is awesome and works really well however the scraper is useless</li>
            <li> I love this stamper, I have learned how to double stamp with it, so that my whole nail is covered.</li>
            <li> In order to overcome this, I&#x27;m able to use the smaller side for my whole nail.</li>
            <li> The Konad stamper&#x27;s rubber is soft and kind of &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;, yet firm and strong.</li>
            <li> The pink side seems to transfer the image much more thoroughly, but it isn&#x27;t ideal when trying to stamp small designs on my young daughters&#x27; nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told you need to use some really old gloppy polish or get the special polish.</li>
            <li> ...i&#x27;ve used my own polish a few times its just finding the right one to work</li>
            <li> its nice that it has both a small end for details and the large end for full nail prints.</li>
            <li> the stamper on the nail from left to right lightly.  </li>
            <li> When I did this, the rubber stoppers both came out, but they popped right back in and have been relatively secure since.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that using an old credit card works so much better than the cute little scraper that comes with the Konad</li>
            <li> this makes konad/ bundle monster stamping so easy the small side lets you be more persice and</li>
            <li> I love the ridges that are on the stamper for your fingers, sometimes I get in such a hurry to stamp my image and am afraid the stamper will fly out of my hand but the ridges make it easy to grip.</li>
            <li> Some of the plates compliment each other and are great for layering multiple colors.</li>
            <li> On the other hand the scraper really isn&#x27;t as necessary or that great.</li>
            <li> At first it wasnt picking up much product from the plate</li>
            <li> Came pretty fast.</li>
            <li> The stamper works really well, though I did have some doubts at first when it wouldn&#x27;t stamp.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and works very well.</li>
            <li> I used it with the white Konad nail polish - but also tried it on some paper with other brand nail polishes and it seemed to work great as well.</li>
            <li> thanks first stamper bought and it seems to work</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and arrived exactly as pictured</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no success even when using Konad&#x27;s own plates &amp; polish.  </li>
            <li> A credit card works just as good though, if not better.</li>
            <li> The Konad stamper is FAR superior to all three other brands and if I had started with another brand stamper, I&#x27;d probably have given up after a day.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re going to use a white or a lighter color, older or goopy polishes work better.  </li>
            <li> The double end is handy for full nail patterns or single stamp designs.</li>
            <li> No where near as good as i thought it was gonna be.. Wouldnt pick up alot of the images and its not the plates because my other stamper i ordered at the same time as this one picked up just fine.</li>
            <li> It is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Make sure you clean off extra nail polish left on the image plate after you already put it on the stamper.</li>
            <li> This is such an easy process to do.</li>
            <li> The stamper was smaller than I thought and its easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> This item comes exactly as advertized, (a cute pink stamper and scraper).</li>
            <li> It has instructions on the back, and is easily learned.</li>
            <li> its really easy to use, just add your color of polish on your design, scrap off extra with scraper, stamp design with stamper then roll onto your nail...</li>
            <li> like the two different sizes, easy to hold and use.  </li>
            <li> Two years later and this stamper is still going strong.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this works way better than the single sided stamper...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a single sided Konad stamper now for over a year and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This product is really a smart idea.</li>
            <li> I used Pure Ice and Sally Hansen Xtreme</li>
            <li> and i needed some help on certain prints.</li>
            <li> I was using the large pad.</li>
            <li> This is going to become a new obsession!!</li>
            <li> It works great, I also love the small green side.</li>
            <li> but I honestly don&#x27;t care because it doesn&#x27;t mess up the image one bit.</li>
            <li> In time I got the hang of it, though its takes a few tries to get it perfect...when it does, its beautiful and therefore worth the price vs going to a nail salon.</li>
            <li> Okay, first off: I am guilty of loving my stamping plates a whole lot.  </li>
            <li> so I can have more control over single designs and my pinky finger witch dose not need that much stamping area.</li>
            <li> make sure not to press down too hard on the design as the more gentle you are the better it will work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, for the regular stamping polishes... what I have found is that any basecoat color is fine.  </li>
            <li> The small green side is great to pick up the smaller images and for more precise stamping.  </li>
            <li> and you have short nails, it should work fine.</li>
            <li> the large side lets you cover the whole nail</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little investment.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that using a nail buffer (not the more abrasive file, but y&#x27;know, a softer buff) on the new stamper did help take some of the waxy sheen off that made initial stamp transfers extra challenging, while also not destroying the equipment.</li>
            <li> You can even use the image plates and the small green stamp side to do full nail designs on kids nails :) Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new at doing my own nails with anything thing than plain ol&#x27; simple polish, and I love this stamper</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the scraper since it seemed a little too narrow for some of the stamps I was using</li>
            <li> is flat and SO easy.</li>
            <li> Another thing I found out is: you can use plastic tapes to clean up most of the image that got onto your finger instead of using nail polish remover as long as you are using regular nail polishes.</li>
            <li> Good product, it get hard at the beginning to use it</li>
            <li> It is fun, easy, and really convenient because now both the designs left and right hand look the same!</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it really makes a difference if you use THE/THIS Konad stamper versus an off brand one.</li>
            <li> I am still in the experimental stage with it, but having fun.  </li>
            <li> I had to practice to get image straight.</li>
            <li> the metal on metal pulls all the nail polish off and then the stamper will not pick up the whole image.</li>
            <li> , I am happy that I got this double ended one, its very convenient to use the smaller side for smaller images.</li>
            <li> It shipped incredibly fast.</li>
            <li> so much cheaper then buying one plate at 7 bucks a piece...</li>
            <li> (otherwise polish will build up there and your scraping will become very inefficient).</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> Work FAST.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> This is for children nails-the stamper doesn&#x27;t pick up the whole image.</li>
            <li> I was worried about whether or not it really works, and it does.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use it as much as I&#x27;d like to, but this is tool that has changed the way that I can do my nails sometimes.</li>
            <li> we use this item all the time works very well</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> She plays with it every night thank you so much</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really think this is a quality product</li>
            <li> This stamper also seems to have a \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; quality to it that lets it pick up the stamp and transfer to your nail much easier.   </li>
            <li> The only thing that could improve this is if it also came with a square stamper, since that might make it easier to precisely position square-shaped designs.</li>
            <li> Not like the real one from TV had to buy the one from the TV which does work not unlike this one...</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> But the product itself works very well</li>
            <li> Stongly recommended to everyone that wants one.</li>
            <li> The scraper doesn&#x27;t cover much surface area.</li>
            <li> The scraper doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li> for good reason because if your design is pink.. and you use the larger end you cant really see it .. and vise verse</li>
            <li> there are tons of videos that really helped me decide and teach me some techniques.  </li>
            <li> The rubber on the stamper is very flexable so it picks up all of the design and deposits it evenly on my nails.</li>
            <li> much  </li>
            <li> Trust me, it makes stamping MUCH easier.</li>
            <li> unless you order the konad polish very $$$$$.</li>
            <li> and she loves to stamp her nails and all kinds of things that she wants to make look cooler.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this would have been an issue, but now that I have used it a bunch of times, I wish I would have spent more time looking at the white/clear stampers.</li>
            <li> My stamp wont really pick all of the image</li>
            <li> This item works really well</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very convenient that it&#x27;s two ended.</li>
            <li> also work fast, as the polish dries really fast.</li>
            <li> With all of the raving about this product I expected it to be better.</li>
            <li> I really like it, the problem that I encountered is with the scrapper, it has scratched a lots of my plates</li>
            <li> but I got the real deal.</li>
            <li> Item is as described, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like the doubled ended stamp.</li>
            <li> Absolute a must have for anyone who spends a lot of time doing nails.</li>
            <li> the stamper works very well but the scraper scratches all my metal plates.</li>
            <li> when i dont have much time to decorate my nails myself i just grab this and the stamps and its so fast the product</li>
            <li> i would recommend this to anyone that wants to learn how to stamp.</li>
            <li> The scraper did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and in condition described.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The order comes fast.</li>
            <li> nail polishes for way too much money.  </li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and goes well with the konad plates I got.</li>
            <li> It shipped really fast and there weren&#x27;t any defects.</li>
            <li> I received this item extremely fast</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> , i have a stamper from another brand and even though it stamps well, sometime it takes many tries, however it broke</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t see much the design on the sta[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> FYI, I used it with the Konad white polish in combination with a cheap polish I had on hand.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;It works really well.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and just as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already tried massaging, gently kneading it, gently running it across a nail file and buffer and still doesn&#x27;t pick it up.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> Price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> , I shouldn&#x27;t have to mod a product to make it work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> shake the bottle of Konad Polish VERY well before you use it, otherwise it will not stick to the pad like it</li>
            <li> so my daughter does not use it very often.  </li>
            <li> That also had to do with how fast you work when stamping and what type of nail polish you use.</li>
            <li> It also stamps very well.</li>
            <li> I guess I need the real konad polish.</li>
            <li> It work very well.</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the scraper because it leaves marks on my plates</li>
            <li> try not to put to much nail polish in the image plate.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> hahaha</li>
            <li> , that really helped.</li>
            <li> You could use a plastic card instead if it bothered you that much.</li>
            <li> I use it a couple of times a week when I do my nails or my friend&#x27;s nails, and it&#x27;s made it much easier.</li>
            <li> At the price, it really can&#x27;t be beat, either.</li>
            <li> But when it works, it really works well.</li>
            <li> I solved filing it with a gentle  nail file.</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier to put designs on my nails than when i used to paint them on myself.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t have much to say, It works well though.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much kinder to the design on the plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes some mistakes before you can really get the hang of it, but I like it</li>
            <li> I really like the Konad brand.</li>
            <li> It was fast to ship and packaged well.</li>
            <li> The scraper, of course, also works very well.</li>
            <li> Order arrived much sooner than the estimated date.</li>
            <li> It is KONAD- the real deal.</li>
            <li> the stamp is just fantastic and it works with any stamping plates not only konad....totally recommended ..</li>
            <li> It is better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Have to work fast.</li>
            <li> This set works very well.</li>
            <li> It picks up the design very well.&lt;br /&gt;Nail</li>
            <li> The whole concept of nail stamping takes practice and patience.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> If you have smaller hands/fingernails, it is definitely nice to have the option of the smaller side.  </li>
            <li> The price was fair, so if it&#x27;s something you want to try or for a teenager to use if you&#x27;re not ready to go all into getting the actual product that started it all, this could be a backup.</li>
            <li> The smaller size is good for small images you&#x27;re trying to get just right on that certain exact spot on your nail.</li>
            <li> Then when you go to pick up an image make sure you do the process quick, paint, scrap, then roll your stamper over it with a firm steady hand.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get a clear stamp on nail.!!!</li>
            <li> It picks very crisp images like no other stamper will do.</li>
            <li> It costs less than $2 at CVS or WalMart and it is by far the best black out there.</li>
            <li> Overall, recommended for everyone who wants to start nail stamping and loves to have fun!</li>
            <li> To me, the result isn&#x27;t worth the trouble of having to paint the plate, swipe it clean, and try picking up the design seven times before you get it right for just one nail.</li>
            <li> The Konad stamper works much better than any other stamper.  </li>
            <li> I am so excited to finally have one.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my Konad and other image stamping plates, and found that I love the dual sided stamper.</li>
            <li> So many other rubber stampers have some imperfection or texture that will leave your stamp looking not-as-nice as it could.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to use a thick nailpolish it sticks better to the stamps in general.</li>
            <li> For someone who has short and small nails, this double ended stamper works absolutely perfect for me.</li>
            <li> It picked up soo much more than my other winstonia</li>
            <li> :) I have yet to try it with anything other than konad polish.</li>
            <li> Love that it is slimmer than other</li>
            <li> The other set worked much better.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s kind of hard getting it exactly where you want on the nail</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to use at first,</li>
            <li> This item came fast and it was brand new!</li>
            <li> This nail stamper is easy to use and great for a beginner nail artist like me.&lt;br /&gt;Two caveats to this stamper: 1) one rubber end is pink, this makes it hard to see if my pink nail polish has transferred cleanly to the pad before I stamp my nails.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a pain to clean the excess nail polish out of all the grooves in the plastic, but it&#x27;s no big</li>
            <li> We can stamp multiple designs in rapid succession now that we have 2-3 stampers, as you do not have to clean 1 ea.</li>
            <li> I found that I just had to swipe my stamper across my paper towel to clean off left over polish.</li>
            <li> The key to using them is to keep the surfaces of both clean of polish before stamping with them each time, otherwise it messes with the crispness of the designs.</li>
            <li> but I was sad that you have to buy special nail polish for it to even work but other than that perfect</li>
            <li> You just have to make sure you don&#x27;t press to hard and move quickly.</li>
            <li> That combo worked great; the Color Cosmetic black goes on opaque and is super for stamping (the WnW gold chrome is a little too faint as a stamping color but great as a base).&lt;br</li>
            <li> You definitely need to purchase the special Konad nail polishes in order to make it work, though.</li>
            <li> You do not necessarily need to use Konad special polish.</li>
            <li> I am a total amateur, but right out of the box, my first nails were amazing</li>
            <li> Very effective, would recommend this to an amateur as its that simple to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try stamping for a long time, the price on the konad stamper was fantastic and I took the plunge in buying this and 25 MASH plates.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I use both sides of the stamper, but I find that it is better to use an old gift card or credit card rather than the scraper, since they are sharp and they are hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I like the larger end for full nail designs and</li>
            <li> and I use the larger end for full nail and longer tip images.</li>
            <li> Other stampers I have used in the past work perfectly upon first try, however this one only works about 25-50 percent of the time.</li>
            <li> the White polish, Sally Hansen French Tip White is a good one.  </li>
            <li> the White polish, Sally Hansen French Tip White is a good one.  </li>
            <li> I had no trouble with it the first time.  </li>
            <li> A little on the cheap side, but using the right nail polishes is the key to this product working half as good as it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Still trying to find inexpensive polishes that work well with the plates but other than that I love this little doohickey and will never lose track of it. :-)</li>
            <li> I love that the smaller side enables me to easily transfer small images.</li>
            <li> i am new to the stamping scene !</li>
            <li> when I need a new one I will order from you again!</li>
            <li> The small green end is great for smaller images, more control over where you stamp it.</li>
            <li> felt bad because I based it on the product review I read,if any of you have had a good experience with this product and is able to share it with us</li>
            <li> ok, i got my stamp in less then a week.</li>
            <li> Some formulas are thicker than others, my best suggestion for a dupe of Konad Stamping Polish is &amp;#34;Sally Hansen Insta Dri WHIRLWIND WHITE&amp;#34; for the white polish and &amp;#34;Rimmel Black Satin&amp;#34; for the black polish.</li>
            <li> so be careful if you don&#x27;t use easy you could ruin them</li>
            <li> I may go over it again with a slightly rougher grit file to see if I can get it to pick up images better.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend getting the double ended stamper and scraper. :)</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t really bother me, but if you wanted, you could use an old gift/credit card so that it doesn&#x27;t scratch as much.</li>
            <li> I have this particular set</li>
            <li> does what it&#x27;s suppose to for a decent price.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend getting stamping polish though most standard polishes we try wont show up well.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this, and rightfully so; I used this stamper with Shany stamping plates and, with a little practice, it worked very well.</li>
            <li> The larger end popped off in my suitcase, but luckily I found it -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I bought the double ended stamper instead of the regular one.</li>
            <li> The double ended stamper is definitely one of the better ones out there.</li>
            <li> I do not have steady hands at all, when I came across nail stamping</li>
            <li> Love it, just wish the larger side was a bit bigger for longer nails.</li>
            <li> Small side works perfect for small finger nails or designs.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got the double stamper for the smaller nails.  </li>
            <li> plates are not quite big enough to cover your nail, just add polish to a portion of the plate and use that to add more of the pattern.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually looking for something bigger in order to cover better my nails but</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s double sided to accommodate for larger designs.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easier to do my toenails with the larger side for my big toe :-)</li>
            <li> I have gotten a few of my family members into nail stamping because I love nail stamping so much.</li>
            <li> I switched to a simple hotel key card and magically my stamping skillzzz have improved exponentially.  </li>
            <li> although the scraper doesn&#x27;t get close enough to really smooth out the polish on the design, I ended up having to use an old credit card.</li>
            <li> Although I did not receive my entire order 1st time thru, they were quick to remedy problem.  </li>
            <li> but I needed the smaller one to be able to pinpoint landing for smaller stamps.</li>
            <li> I love the small end for individual designs and the large one for full nail designs.  </li>
            <li> The smaller side allow for more accurate prints on small nails.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, just look up a few YouTube tutorials first</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> this I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> its high quality</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend getting the Konad nail polish with it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for doing nail art.</li>
            <li> for almost everyone else, I highly recommend this stamper.</li>
            <li> If you are getting into nail air using mail plates, I highly recommend getting the Konad stamper and Konad polish.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> the small one is great for just single designs.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t mess around with cheap imitations, this is the real deal!</li>
            <li> Slightly rough your stamper up with a fine grit nail file.</li>
            <li> I bought this stamping kit and have had no problems other than my own technique failures in properly using the stamping plates.  </li>
            <li> When I first got it, I tried it with some Sinful Colors polishes, and they didn&#x27;t work because the designs barely picked up at all, and when they did pick up a little bit, the result was a very light, almost transparent design on my nails that looked like it was chipping off.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need to practice a little more.</li>
            <li> Only stamper I&#x27;ve ever tried, so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else, but it does exactly what it&#x27;s meant to do, so no complaints!</li>
            <li> Just dont forget to take a medium file and scruff it up a little before using, it makes the polish stick better.</li>
            <li> I am like most users and choose not to use the little metal scraper.  </li>
            <li> The little scraper thing works, but it could be a lot better.  </li>
            <li> I just tried my Konad stamper again last night, for only the second time, and I&#x27;m already getting better at it!</li>
            <li> I love this little stamp.</li>
            <li> so glad I opted to pay a little exra and get the double-ended Konad stamper.</li>
            <li> I love this product because of it has a large and small stamper.</li>
            <li> (Make sure you get nail polish that is thick--thin polish you usually have to apply several coats of when regularly painting your nails will create a very light, hard-to-see stamp).</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;About the stamper, the pink bigger side works great and has the perfect texture, but I decided to stop using the green smaller side because the texture is a little harder</li>
            <li> I notice that I scrape off far too much polish when I use this metal scraper.</li>
            <li> The two sizes on the stamper is very useful/helpful, but the scraper damages the plates - just use an old credit card instead.</li>
            <li> The smaller, green stamper is obviously great for smaller images, but I like using it for the precision and control it gives me while placing images.</li>
            <li> I much prefer using old gift cards to scrape instead.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very please with it so far.</li>
            <li> It also picks up the image very well because of the soft and squishy tips.</li>
            <li> I found the red side much more useful and practically never use the green one.</li>
            <li> THE STAMPER ONLY KONAD ITS WORTH</li>
            <li> Great product for anyone...especially my 8 year old &amp; me who are mildly addicted to our\\&quot; professional looking\\&quot; at home mani &amp; pedis</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said - you&#x27;re only paying for the stamper, and that&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> The larger end is not soft, so many images don&#x27;t pick up on my CHEEKY plates.  </li>
            <li> though wow what a cool and simple design, sooooo i jumped on amazon and bought it for myself</li>
            <li> for polishes, I tried this stamper with both konad stamping polishes as well as normal polishes</li>
            <li> and I used normal polishes for stamping.</li>
            <li> I like this long rubber stamper I want to try the smaller version just to maybe travel with and to see how much more of an impression...</li>
            <li> The scraper that my set came with had a blade that was tilted at a bit of an angle, so the construction looked kind of shoddy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also experimented with non-Konad polishes, and found good luck getting a solid stamp out of really any thick opaque polishes out there.</li>
            <li> This is a super fun little thing, and it worked just as described.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would really work, but I have an 8 year old who loves mani/pedis, and that can easily get expensive</li>
            <li> the black \\&quot;Konad Special Polish\\&quot;, I have found (after trying 11 different products) that WET &#x27;N WILD black velvet nailpolish is the best.  </li>
            <li> there are some stampers that are a little shoter and in m opinion are harder to use this one is perfect and has duel sides a small and large!</li>
            <li> and it was not hard on my nails.  </li>
            <li> They are thick, quick drying and accurate.  </li>
            <li> It makes nail stamping easy for beginners with the dual sided stamper for smaller &amp; larger images.</li>
            <li> my pack was black insted of pink but really good</li>
            <li> also the rubber parts are detachable for cleaning they pop right back in no problem.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t highly recommend it for young adults or older adults.</li>
            <li> This stamper and scraper are very easy to work with, and it is double ended with different size for different designs.</li>
            <li> I love how there&#x27;s two sides to this, it gives you more control when you use the small end for little stamps.</li>
            <li> I have tragically short nail beds, and the smaller stamper really helps me align designs more accurately on my last two fingernails.</li>
            <li> The scraper was a little harder to clean up and still has some staining on the plastic handle, but I&#x27;m probably going to try using an old gift card instead, as the metal blade put some very light scratches on my stamping</li>
            <li> /&gt;-You really need to buy the special Konad polish, it is different than regular nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;-Always</li>
            <li> I should also point out the wells of the image plates are so shallow that the polish dries quite quickly, so you have to be quick!</li>
            <li> I used it for small designs only but the larger end works great as well.</li>
            <li> I lightly filed the stamper as I has seen suggested in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> These are great because you have a small stamp for tiny nails (my granddaughters) and larger nails like my toenails.  </li>
            <li> so I like to try new things.  </li>
            <li> The product I received was brand new.</li>
            <li> For those new to stamping, it does take practice so don&#x27;t give up.</li>
            <li> and it might as well be brand new.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of nail stamping - discovered it from a kiosk in a shopping mall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to nail stamping.</li>
            <li> Well you live and learn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to nail stamping</li>
            <li> Look up videos for tips if you&#x27;re new to stamping.</li>
            <li> so when I scrape the nail polish across, it leaves like new where it doesn&#x27;t quite connect to the design.</li>
            <li> It always works like new.</li>
            <li> I am new to this nail art stamping</li>
            <li> I used it on a brand new Konad plate, so I don&#x27;t see the reason it wouldn&#x27;t work as it should.</li>
            <li> It was too new for the polish to be picked up by the stamper.</li>
            <li> New in package.</li>
            <li> already it still is like brand new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to nail stamping</li>
            <li> I will be looking to buy a new scraper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s really all I say about this product other then some quick tips about doing stamping itself.</li>
            <li> but as usual my left hand would look lovely and the right one was a mess.&lt;br /&gt;i decided on the stamping kit</li>
            <li> The scraper is not very useful, an old gift card works just fine in it&#x27;s place.</li>
            <li> I love having my nails done, and being a single mom who&#x27;s a full time student means very little spending money.</li>
            <li> I am considering using a marker to put a dot at the top center of the stamper to help with proper placement.</li>
            <li> I prefer the super squishy black and white stampers, but this one is my next favorite.</li>
            <li> but the scraper don&#x27;t really slide even and not very easy to clean</li>
            <li> Love the double ends, the small end is great for tiny designs or kids nails as they are small.</li>
            <li> But you must act quickly so the polish doesn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> I love that you can choose from a really wide or smaller stamp face.</li>
            <li> I myself like to use old kind of thick ones.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to file the stamper part down worked just fine.</li>
            <li> If you are using a regular polish, you need to be VERY fast, applying the polish to the pattern plate, wiping excess immediately, and using the stamper immediately.</li>
            <li> the small one also works better when your testing a color combination on a nail design wheel, its easier to see where your stamping the smaller images on your nails and center it better.</li>
            <li> The two ends of the stamper are perfect for either stamping the whole nail (wide end) or stamping a small design on (green end).</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it has one end to use for the large images and the smaller end to use for the smaller single prints.  </li>
            <li> The first one I bought was the as seen on TV stamper to try it out and see if i like it, it was really stiff but still cool</li>
            <li> Of course I had to clean and file the ends with a nail file to rough them up a little before it would work well, but that&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> The scraper works well also, but I found that its hole often got a little clogged, but that wasn&#x27;t much of an inconvenience, merely an observation that it works best when cleaned after each use!  </li>
            <li> Be fast when your stamping because its been known to dry really fast!        </li>
            <li> The double sided stamper is perfect because it has a small green stamper on one end which works for all the small designs, and the large red stamper on the other end is perfect for the larger designs and designs for the tips and entire nail.</li>
            <li> The scraper is a metal scraper which worried me at first, but gives a cleaner pick-up than the plastic scrapers I have; especially on off-brand plates that are not etched as well.</li>
            <li> I guess this is unavoidable though as nail polish comes in every conceivable color under the sun!</li>
            <li> When pressing tje Stamper on plate press firmly but not too firm or too light in a rolling position from the bottom to the top of the image plate then immediately press to nail from side to side roll and not in every direction.</li>
            <li> something I did not know which I was surprised with, is that the rubber stamper part itself comes out!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to use a red or pink to stamp with, the green end on this is absolutely great - allows you to see the stamp image.</li>
            <li> It was really simple to use for a first timer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to go with the plates I purchased earlier, and exactly what was advertised came.</li>
            <li> This one actually has worked better than I had expected!</li>
            <li> Also, you want to be QUICK when stamping your nails as you do not want the design to DRY on the stamper!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen people use a credit card or something similar and am willing to try that.</li>
            <li> the plus is it has double sided the bigger side I have found to work better then the smaller and</li>
            <li> Although, the scraper can be compared to each other as performing the same the quailty of konad is better..  </li>
            <li> Way better than the plastic scraper you usually get when buying these products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a big deal, but something to be aware of when buying.</li>
            <li> initially was interested in stampers when a vendor in the street showed it to me.</li>
            <li> My first and only!</li>
            <li> I did run a fine-grit buffing block over the rubber ends prior to the first use</li>
            <li> Stamping LIGHTLY on the plate and (rolling it) lightly on the nail works much better than pressing the crap out of it</li>
            <li> and I totally love the double sided stamper for different sizes and the different color I use to stamp the images</li>
            <li> They sell this same exact thing in the mall for $25.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am fairly new to nail stamping, and this was dead easy to figure out.</li>
            <li> It came in a clear plastic bag, not a hard plastic one like in the picture.</li>
            <li> The store card will still leave marks on your plate, but only very fine marks where you scrap it, and nothing at all that will mess up your image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first because a few reviewers said they received knock off brands, but I received it exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I liked that there were two different sized sides, but I&#x27;ve found that the smaller green side does not stamp very well.  </li>
            <li> Extra stampers, especially one with two different sized ends and and extra scrapers will always be handy.</li>
            <li> In fact, I haven&#x27;t purchased any type of special polish, i&#x27;ve found regular polish actually does the trick.  </li>
            <li> The rubber ends are nice and pliable not hard or tough.</li>
            <li> A little hint, to save nail polish only put polish on the top half of the design and when you scrape down, the excess nail polish from the top will fill into the bottom half, saving you more nail polish!</li>
            <li> I have tried different nail polish and still doesn&#x27;t work it leaves half the stamp on the nail and is very light in color</li>
            <li> First off: You do NOT have to use stamping polish (Thicker polish does work better, however thin polish works as well</li>
            <li> The stamper itself works great with the MASH plates and regular nail polish, and having both the large and small end makes it easy for even a beginner to stamp perfectly in no time at all.</li>
            <li> its a little messy especially trying to clean up without messing up your own nails</li>
            <li> but I tried to be positive and tried all different methods.</li>
            <li> , I like how there is a smaller side its good for small designs like maybe doing multiple flowers on a nail</li>
            <li> I went ahead and ordered a white and a black actuan Konad polishes, since those will be the colours I will use the most for my patterns.</li>
            <li> I feel like the normal stamper is too small (the handle part), this one is easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Very cool little tool!</li>
            <li> Like previous reviewers said, nail polish gets stuck in the scraper, but its easy to clean by soaking it in remover for a few minutes, wiping it off, and getting into the nooks and cranies with a tooth pick.</li>
            <li> but after a few times, I got used to it just fine.  </li>
            <li> and I have not had as good of luck with some of the other stampers I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Double Ended Large Stamp and Plastic Scraper Set]] or  </li>
            <li> so I can see the red nail polish I use a little better.</li>
            <li> If you end up losing your scraper or if it stops working, gift cards work just as well :) the scraper seems to get dull over time</li>
            <li> This picks up images extremely well and cleans up quickly.  </li>
            <li> sometimes the top coat smudges the designe and it can be hard to line up the pictures</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s because I find as several others have said, that an old gift card is much easier to do the scraping with.</li>
            <li> This was a great way to allow me to have several friends together to do a nail spa day without having to purchase an expensive kit.</li>
            <li> we not that clear.</li>
            <li> The package is clearly labeled Stamping Nail Art as the brand,and says it is made in China.</li>
            <li> but if you use an old credit card or gift card as the scraper you wont end up scratching your stamping plates</li>
            <li> I tried a gift card and it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well &#x3D;</li>
            <li> or I might just use an old debit card or something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an old gift card as a scraper, but not anymore.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different brands of image plates, and they all work very well with this.</li>
            <li> I did not like the scraper, so I used an old cancelled credit card instead.</li>
            <li> Used old credit card to clear polish off plates.</li>
            <li> Waist of money it doesn&#x27;t transfer to nail completely</li>
            <li> but wow, I will defiantly order from this company again.....  </li>
            <li> I prefer to use an old credit card instead of the scraper.  </li>
            <li> but I prefer to use an old gift card or credit card.</li>
            <li> my 16 year old sister keeps wanting me to do her nails and gets rave reviews at school and</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I received the item after two days of purchasing because i ordered it in Saturday.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use an old gift card instead.</li>
            <li> Instead, use an old gift card or credit card you won&#x27;t be using anymore.</li>
            <li> I like to do my nails a lot and for the more complex nail designs, I often use Konad templates.</li>
            <li> I instead just use a plastic credit card or gift card for scraping and have had no trouble with this method.</li>
            <li> Stamping directly to my nails doesn&#x27;t work so well  </li>
            <li> It picks up your stamp completely.</li>
            <li> I have been practiving and reading how to&#x27;s but so far no luck.</li>
            <li> Tip is too soft to transfer images?</li>
            <li> the scraper and use an old license card.</li>
            <li> But i found that using a old credit card</li>
            <li> remember everyone press lightly to get the design off the stamp and press firmly to press onto the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s nails are tiny, so this makes stamping &amp; clean-up much easier.</li>
            <li> Some people have suggested using an old gift card instead of the scraper.</li>
            <li> and this set makes professional results even for me with no training</li>
            <li> So in a sense, the company is ripping you off completely.</li>
            <li> but i was surprised that it was just a plug.</li>
            <li> No scraper has ever beat an old credit card.  </li>
            <li> You can use any old credit card too.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to be a professional to use this, you just have to have patience and practice a couple times.</li>
            <li> I even bought one for my 16 year old sister &amp; she&#x27;s having a blast with it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> not good,do not waste your money and time</li>
            <li> For the scraper, I rather use an old credit card so my plates don&#x27;t get scratched.</li>
            <li> The scraper doesn&#x27;t work as well as an old gift card.</li>
            <li> The scraper, while conveniently included, was not an absolute necessity as a well-maintained ID/credit card would have served the same purpose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten more into keeping up with my nails lately and have been trying some off brands of stamping accessories.  </li>
            <li> I use my old AAA card instead.</li>
            <li> I use an old credit card.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell it does not ruin the image on the plate.</li>
            <li> you are really into nail designs and don&#x27;t like the hassle of individually painting each nail then buying this product</li>
            <li> one is perfect for making small adjustment to the nail (eg: the plate image is too small to cover the entire nail) and you have to make a second &#x27;swipe&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I used an old gift card instead, which worked just as well and didn&#x27;t scratch the image plate.  </li>
            <li> (old credit card, old license, etc)</li>
            <li> Just use an old plastic credit card for a scraper if need be.</li>
            <li> i suggest you use an old gift card or piece of plastic for a scraper.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for nearly a year</li>
            <li> Not so much guess-work with where you got the design, as on the larger stamp.</li>
            <li> As far as the scraper, I found that it doesn&#x27;t work as well as an old credit card or gift card.  </li>
            <li> I was told by people that use the Stamper to use a old credit card instead of the Scraper, because the Scraper would scratch your stamping plates.</li>
            <li> so far becasue my girls ages 10 &amp; 11</li>
            <li> My seven year old</li>
            <li> Stamp Works well, just use an old credit card or gift card, instead of the metal scraper</li>
            <li> I use an old credit card in lieu of the scraper provided in this package.</li>
            <li> The only issue I really have is the scraper scratches the surface area of the stamp plate.</li>
            <li> An old business card or credit card works well and won&#x27;t scratch up your surface.</li>
            <li> I suppose it does what it supposed to it was a gift for my 14yr old daughter</li>
            <li> so I just tossed it and use an old gift card instead.</li>
            <li> I use old club cards instead.  </li>
            <li> I had also been given the recommendation to use an old credit card or gift card to scrape the excess polish from the stamp plate.</li>
            <li> Instead use and old credit card, or gift</li>
            <li> I use an old gift card to scrape instead of the razor edge scraper.</li>
            <li> I use an old gift card</li>
            <li> I prefer to use an old gift card instead of the scraper provided, it scratches the plates</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the scrapper because I threw it in a draw immediately, instead using an old gift card.</li>
            <li> + Wish I could find the plates near me</li>
            <li> &#x27;n Wild</li>
            <li> Stampers everywhere will tell you to use an old gift card or credit card instead.</li>
            <li> Because they don&#x27;t dry until cured, the working time is unlimited (nearly) before you have to clean your plates and stampers for the next finger.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m finding that glitter polishes in gel brands don&#x27;t stamp well.</li>
            <li> (you can switch to using an old credit card for the scraper.)</li>
            <li> The small green side is the reason I use it the most because it&#x27;s really good for placing small designs where you want them.</li>
            <li> I realized that an old gift card works perfect--better than the scraper ever did.  </li>
            <li> I USED AN OLD CREDIT CARD.</li>
            <li> I just used an old plastic membership card of credit card to scrape off polish from the plates instead of the metal scraper.</li>
            <li> I did not use the scraper cause of the reviews and instead used an old gift card.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasted me well over a year so far.  </li>
            <li> but I would recommend a plastic scraper or an old credit card.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably going to use an old gift card to do the job instead.</li>
            <li> so I just use an old credit card instead.</li>
            <li> To use regular polish just gently buff the surface of the stamper with a nail file</li>
            <li> do not use this scraper, I use old gift cards and old credit cards instead.</li>
            <li> Not had any problems so far.</li>
            <li> As others suggested here I used an old store card instead of the metal scraper, I&#x27;ve never used it as the idea of it did not appeal to me.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the stamper doesn&#x27;t pick up the pattern completely either, although that may be because of the type of polish.</li>
            <li> Of course the scraper doesn&#x27;t work as effectively as a old gift card but it gets the job done without an issue.</li>
            <li> We use an old gift card for a scraper though...</li>
            <li> so I just use old gift cards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;YouTube videos suggested to use an old credit card instead of the scraper that comes with the stamper, and I agree--</li>
            <li> I replaced the scraper with an old gift card though..</li>
            <li> Some people use an old credit card or gift card instead.</li>
            <li> though so I use an old gift card instead of the metal scraper.  </li>
            <li> I often use an old gift card instead.</li>
            <li> The scraper scratches plates, so use an old ID or credit card for the scraping.</li>
            <li> , I opted for an old membership card.</li>
            <li> I use an old plastic card in place of the scraper.</li>
            <li> professionally done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it scratches the heck out of the plates, and so I had to use and old credit card.</li>
            <li> and I immediately traded it for an old membership card that works just as well.</li>
            <li> I use an old gift card instead of the metal scraper to save me plates from being scratched.</li>
            <li> I really like the double ended stamper...</li>
            <li> it definitely picks up the images off of the stamping plates really well.</li>
            <li> but its not for sensitive design.</li>
            <li> The stamper is fantastic quality, transfers images clearly without too much trouble.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen Chrome nailpens are good, but expensive.  </li>
            <li> it is very easy and I love decorating my nails with it - I did buy the less expensive plates not from Konad</li>
            <li> So as long as I can get that metal scraper part clean, I really don&#x27;t care what other nail colors are painted all over the thing.</li>
            <li> the scraper can be quite a mess to use and clean though.</li>
            <li> Now I need to practice as usually I&#x27;m all thumbs, so far it&#x27;s been fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have a short, one-sided stamper that came with my original plate sets and prefer it for larger patterns simply because I find it easier to hold and place.  </li>
            <li> The larger red size i found not to be as larger as my original konad stamper.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to buy that or Wet &#x27;N Wild nail polish, because their consistencies are formulated to be think enough to print a dark enough image, while other nail polish comes out VERY light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me about 4 tries to get one image right, after watching 4-5 youtube videos on how to do it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use on small hands for my daughters</li>
            <li> The smaller end is great for partial designs or small designs u want in a specific area of the nail</li>
            <li> My first one was a single ended one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to clean and doesn&#x27;t always scrape smoothly.</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s just a general learning curve but certain designs required different amounts of pressure in order to pick them up correctly.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers who have said the double-sided stamper is worth it.  </li>
            <li> I do need to prime it with a file pretty frequently, but overall not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> The larger end of the stamper can be used on full nail designs where as the smaller can be used on smaller designs.</li>
            <li> Not overly easy to use and very messy</li>
            <li> this does the job it is intented to do..... gets really messy if you dont keep the blade clean though</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what another reviewer meant about \\&quot;filing\\&quot; your stamper before you use it; I didn&#x27;t do anything to prep the stamper or scraper except for taking them out of the package, and they worked just fine.</li>
            <li> The stamper itself is fine, but it seems a bit small for my use.</li>
            <li> This is the first stamper I&#x27;ve ever purchased and the only one I will purchase in the future.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found an opportunity to use the small side since most of the designs I use are larger than that side.</li>
            <li> I love this stamp pad because you can use the small end for tiny nails.</li>
            <li> I prefer a different brand stamper that I have for most small designs.</li>
            <li> I mainly do full-nail stamps, so I use the bigger end for those, but for full-nail toenail stamps</li>
            <li> For use with nail design plates, highly recommend the double end.</li>
            <li> However, I decided to give it another try, so I went out and bought some thicker polishes, and still, the design only picks up halfway most of the time, and it is very messy.</li>
            <li> Its nice to have the double side with the big and the small side and it pics up and transfers images nicely but the pink color makes it hard to see the images that you have picked up.</li>
            <li> The small end works wonderful for the little flowers and small designs that Konad has to offer.    </li>
            <li> Sure, they&#x27;re a little more expensive</li>
            <li> A lot of people I know like to use plain paper towel to clean off the plates.</li>
            <li> If you have long nails you aren&#x27;t going to get some of the images across tour whole nail..</li>
            <li> I generally use an old credit card to scrape the excess polish from the plate, so I havent used the scraper yet</li>
            <li> And I love that I can see white on the red and green sides.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for and expected.</li>
            <li> You may have to &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; it up a little with a fine nail file to allow it to &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; at first, or it might be too slick to &amp;#34;take&amp;#34; the image, but it&#x27;s not hard to do.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It works well for medium designs, but if you use the extra large plates, you will need a larger stamper.</li>
            <li> and you have to file the tops of the stamps to make it a little more rough.</li>
            <li> Prior to this, I had the normal stamp which was very wide which made it more difficult to do precise stamping.</li>
            <li> seems to dry too fast and doesn&#x27;t transfer to the stamper so that it can be applied to my nail.  </li>
            <li> I really like that I don&#x27;t have to wait for it to dry forever like I would when painting the tip.</li>
            <li> I really like the double sides that are different size.</li>
            <li> Love this stamper, takes a few tries to get the hang of it but can make the cutest nails ever</li>
            <li> Works really well, but for some reason the green side it doesn&#x27;t really hold the image that well</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would use the smaller end at all, but I use it just as much as the larger end.</li>
            <li> I like the green side better than the pink one.</li>
            <li> The larger stamp measures one inch exactly, so if you have long nails it may not work for you as well.</li>
            <li> I only really use the smaller side of stamper, its easier to control.  </li>
            <li> The scrapper here left too much polish and actually scratched one of my plates.</li>
            <li> Stamping polish is MUCH more thick and sticky than regular polish.</li>
            <li> and it just dried way too quickly to be used with this.</li>
            <li> Why waste money on decals when you can recreate your own images with this stamper and a few imaging plates.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, down to the review - it&#x27;ll be short and sweet.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous trying this for the first time!</li>
            <li> first i bought the other pack &amp;#34;as seen on tv&amp;#34; from walmart i forgot what it&#x27;s call</li>
            <li> This product was purchased with some of the other Knoad line, my wife loves to get her nails done and it always costs more for those little design things they put on.  </li>
            <li> other other&#x27;s for being able too pick up tiny images</li>
            <li> Durable and pretty in pink!</li>
            <li> I use a squishy-firm stamper nowadays, but this is the one I use when a polish/plate is being troublesome and no other stamper works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very small fingers (I wear a size 3 wedding ring) and the smaller, green side works perfectly for applying full-nail designs to my pinky nail and index finger nail, for instance, while the larger, pink side works well for my thumb, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had bought a small stamper for nail art with the original kit.</li>
            <li> The only problems I&#x27;ve had with it is when I opened it, the pink side of the stamper fell right out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to get it wrong at first.</li>
            <li> To sandwich conventional stamp polish onto a gel mani, I have to remove the sticky layer first and let it dry really well, before the topcoat cure, or the image is smudgy.</li>
            <li> [...]  My only complain is that the scraper could have been better designed, not that it doesn&#x27;t work, but the metal scratch up the image plates and it is not very easy to clean; the polish gets inside the holes and between the thin ridges of the blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very new to nail stamping (this was my second attempt) and I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> can use the plate on no more than 2 or 3 nails before you need to clean it and</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s taken a little practice to learn how to use it but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> , the blade is pefrectly flat on the edge for running across the stamping base and the rubber is perfect for putting the design on your nail, no regrets in buying this.</li>
            <li> I got so much compliment from using this product and it works well whether you are doing large or small designs.</li>
            <li> I have recently purchased the same stamp set with a white large end to use for this purpose.  </li>
            <li> I was a little iffy when I bought this stamper, most of the tutorials I have seen on nail art stamping use the basic Konad stamper, in pink, and I didn&#x27;t know if there was a difference.</li>
            <li> However, the small side of this is great for smaller patterns as I can center them on the nail a little easier.</li>
            <li> I tried this method first, and it was a huge fail.</li>
            <li> Generally speaking it picked up and released designs</li>
            <li> Directions were clear and simple.</li>
            <li> The rubber is a different texture on the store bought stamper and doesn&#x27;t transfer images completely or clearly.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if the scraping blade were wider; and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to clean ALL the polish from the crevices, but not really a functional problem.</li>
            <li> It is long enough to be comfortable to hold, and the dual ends make stamping your whole nail possible and centering a small stamp easier.</li>
            <li> I can see this being a problem in the near future.  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have only tried nail stamping twice so far</li>
            <li> is the only stamper that gave me a complete image instead of pieces.  </li>
            <li> This double ended stamper definitely fixed that problem.</li>
            <li> I was pleasently surprised when the Konad Nail Art Double Ended Stamper and Scraper arrived before the estimated shipping date!</li>
            <li> My stamper required absolutely no filing, it worked straight out of the package.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s complete user error on the part of me and my friend, or maybe I need a different shaped stamper.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as soft as I think is necessary.</li>
            <li> Use an old gift card or hotel key card instead of the scraper that comes with it.</li>
            <li> I did not really like this as much as I</li>
            <li> , I usually like to jump in feet first when doing things so after hours of trial and error, I finally watched a very informational video and got my stamper to work.</li>
            <li> I like the smaller side to use on my pinky and my 3yr old nails.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed professional, but found that I needed to read Konad&#x27;s instructions (or watch a YouTube video) to ensure I was using this tool properly.</li>
            <li> Both ends had the same amount of squish as far as I could tell.</li>
            <li> but at the same time it scratches my plates, so I use an old credit card instead.</li>
            <li> I almost gave up stamping completely when I decided to order this stamper as a last result</li>
            <li> I dont really care if it scratches the empty spots I am concerned that it will scratch and distort an adjacent image.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a plastic Konad scraper, but actually prefer to use my old Kroger Plus card.</li>
            <li> The green side really makes applying the smaller images so much easier.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to decide between the double ended stamper and just the normal one, I would definately go for the double!</li>
            <li> Before discovering this I used nail decals, which although nice, were expensive and one time use.</li>
            <li> The stamper head is big enough to cover my nails and the small one is very useful for stamping the small images precisely.</li>
            <li> Also the blade is small and can be a little tricky to clean ( think about the fact you might be cleaning it with nail polish remover using your freshly painted nails so your not going to want to get to nitty gritty.)</li>
            <li> It does pick up regular polish just have to be quick at tje process or the Stamper won&#x27;t pick it up cuz it has dried.</li>
            <li> As long as the scraper doesn&#x27;t ruin a design, I can live with the scraping.</li>
            <li> I really like the double side to print small and large prints.</li>
            <li> This double ended stamper works really well for large images and small images.</li>
            <li> cuz u hav a small side that prints and washes really well and also a big side that does the exact same.</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of problems with the scraper and thanks to other reviews, have discovered that a gift card does work wonders.  </li>
            <li> Small enough to fit my tiny pinky.</li>
            <li> Also I recieved mine really fast, it came even before the expected shipping date!</li>
            <li> Compared to other stamper/scraper sets, this one really delivers.</li>
            <li> I followed other people&#x27;s advice and gently filed the ends before using.</li>
            <li> The scraper is a bit hard to clean because of the holes and designs, but hey - it scrapes.</li>
            <li> It is a nice size in your hand, and creates a clean image, some nail colors are hard to see if they stamped properly (ex: its hard to see if the stamper picked up the image properly with red or pink colors)</li>
            <li> my only other complaint is that&#x27;s its pink, but that&#x27;s just aesthetic.all in all, a good product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soooo much easier than painting your own designs on your nail and getting frustrated that it&#x27;ll not all come out the same!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stamp itself is easy to clean, though I&#x27;ve stained the handle with black nail polish, which is difficult to get</li>
            <li> If you are stamping with pink, red etc you can&#x27;t see the design very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d actually recommend using an old plastic shoppers card such as...</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it wastes a lot of nail polish, but i think that it is still worth it to get the design.</li>
            <li> Before I could not get the plate to scrape clean, there was always too much polish left behind to pick up - multiple scrapes didn&#x27;t work either.  </li>
            <li> My advise to you is watch the video tutorial on youtube, DON&#x27;T GO TO SLOW, and clean off everything after each nail.</li>
            <li> It works MUCH better than the single sided as if you use a pink polish, the green end will show it.</li>
            <li> A little tricky to use at first, but I get it now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this scraper very much for a few reasons.</li>
            <li> ) Wipe everything down with pure acetone, or use a nail polish remover that does NOT contain any oils.</li>
            <li> The scraper seems a bit small and so with a few swipes of cleaning the polish off the stencil you have to clean the scraper otherwise it will stain or clump that whole bottom area.</li>
            <li> -No, you really DON&#x27;T need to cover the whole image and waste your nail polish(es)!!:</li>
            <li> Being impatient and a \\&quot;learn by doing\\&quot; type, although I did watch a YouTube video while I was waiting for this to arrive, I tore it open and got right to stamping.</li>
            <li> Shipping time was great considering Christmas and all...was a lil disappointed about the quality of the stamp</li>
            <li> I love the fact it has two ends: one end is small and the other bigger because that helps when you have smaller nails or images on the plates.</li>
            <li> For those of you who are having trouble with the scraper not scraping very well... you need to buy stamping polish!</li>
            <li> My first few attempts were failures but after some practice (and some YouTube tutorials)</li>
            <li> do i really need to break down and buy their nail polish?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to those who say stamp straight down on the plate.</li>
            <li> Very well put together and holds the stamp extremely well!</li>
            <li> Yes, PURE ICE nailpolishs in &#x27;Outrageous&#x27; and others stamp up beautifully.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to press down hard, just be sure to hold it at a 45 degree angle  4)</li>
            <li> I used it last night for the first time, its a bit messy</li>
            <li> It has a large side for full nail designs and a small side for small icons.</li>
            <li> When stamping the plate only push straight down and up.</li>
            <li> You have to file down the rubber before your first use, because when I first started stamping I had a hard time trying to pick up the designs and transferring them to my nails.</li>
            <li> For the small items you can see darker colors on the green better than on the red.  </li>
            <li> Pretty sad, but all in all the double ended stamper is well worth the price and quality.</li>
            <li> It came new in the package and arrived earlier than I&#x27;d expected.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of warm colors on my nails so the bigger end of the stamper, which is a dark pink, makes it really hard to see the designs in order to line it up with my fingernail.</li>
            <li> The scraper is useless, but that is easily solved with using an old credit card or gift card.</li>
            <li> but it was actually just the right size not to big and not to small.</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking that was big enough for my nails that are not long.</li>
            <li> But the scraper is a little odd, and you have to have it at JUST the right angle to transfer clearly.</li>
            <li> Works really well, but takes a little while to get the hang of stamping.</li>
            <li> Not great quality, but fine for occasional use.</li>
            <li> Large patterns pick up veerrrryyy easily, thin patterns, not so much.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient having two sizes for stamping, especially when you just need a little decorative stamp.</li>
            <li> (otherwise it will dry and it&#x27;ll be hard to clean out.    </li>
            <li> My stamper and scraper arrived much quicker than expected!!!</li>
            <li> Tried expensive nail polish, cheap ones and everything in between and images never transfers complete.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft enough to provide flexibility when stamping but still firm enough to pick up a clear image.</li>
            <li> You must place your polish, hold at a 90 scrape the plate then with the stamper push left to right ... not to hard then on your nails place</li>
            <li> Lining it up right is hard.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and easy to hold, some of the stampers are small and awkward.  </li>
            <li> the green side doesn&#x27;t pick up and the pink side (the bigger side) isn&#x27;t level, one side has less thickness than the other, doesn&#x27;t make stamping very easy with it.</li>
            <li> I usually keep a cotton pad soaked in nail polish remover sandwiched in a layer of paper towel, and it lets me wipe off the stamp and scraper quickly as I go without getting cotton fluff all over both of them.</li>
            <li> The stamper as well as the plates are very hard to get a clean design on your nails.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with stamping until I got down a system where I could do it quickly</li>
            <li> The scraper is fine to work with, although, the small grooves and holes in it collect nailpolish and need to be cleaned off every few swipes.  </li>
            <li> Just use an old gift card or other plastic card you no longer need instead.</li>
            <li> And it was very convenient to have the double sides, one for big pictures and one for small pictures.</li>
            <li> so I tossed it out and tried what one of the other reviewers suggested, an old credit card or bonus card.</li>
            <li> (As for the other piece in this package, I find old credit/gift cards easier to scrape image plates with-</li>
            <li> First I thought it was the nail polish because it wasn&#x27;t thick enough, but later I realized it was the stamper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to stamping and nail art in general and with just a little practice, my nails look like a work of art!</li>
            <li> I noticed that if you delay even just a few seconds, the regular polish will dry too fast to transfer to the stamper.</li>
            <li> , Wild Shine nail polish in silver metalic, black creme, and french white creme over my existing Shellac manicure.  </li>
            <li> One side small and one side large.</li>
            <li> I think these are flimsy tools, but I like having a large and small side stamper for image transfer.</li>
            <li> I almost bought the all in one unit, but went with this wanting less polish mess by keeping them separated for easier cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, polishes dry really fast after scraping, so you&#x27;ve gotta move fast between the two tool moves and there&#x27;s not much time to gauge nail image placement.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m assuming the problem is nailing down the roll necessary to transfer the image to a natural nail shape, mine are sort of a &amp;#34;c&amp;#34; shape.</li>
            <li> For the simple picture, it is easy to pick up; For the complex design...It seems not easy to do</li>
            <li> I was hard at first to get the nail polish on the tamp</li>
            <li> Be sure to put down a base coat (clear or colored) first.</li>
            <li> Serves my purpose very well since I&#x27;m new to the game of stamping manicures.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s difficult when you have to wait for each coat to dry to make sure it doesn&#x27;t ruin your design</li>
            <li> I do have a little trouble with the small green stamp, but the pink works great.</li>
            <li> The scraper is essentially useless as it gets gunked up quickly and is hard to clean.</li>
            <li> It is small and works very well.</li>
            <li> Polish transfers seamlessly, there are no grooves for polish to get trapped in (or leave that texture on your stamp to drive you CRAZY), and the finished product looks nice.  </li>
            <li> I had heard the metal scraper was no good in this kit, but for the price I paid, the stamper itself was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> The stamper works fantastically, but the scraper was a crooked mess that made me think I suck as a professional Nail Tech.  </li>
            <li> First and foremost... the scraper sucks, so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> My pink &amp;/or red designs are much easier to see on the green stamper 3)</li>
            <li> But it actually seemed to make it more complicated and harder to stamp.</li>
            <li> I wish it were larger since my nails are long.</li>
            <li> Like I said, this is only because my nails are long.</li>
            <li> Not bad not great.</li>
            <li> Some people who are a little timid think it might be easier if they start out by using one of the new sliding &amp;#34;stamping&amp;#34; machines they have come out with.</li>
            <li> I use the smaller green side for single images, and the bigger pink end for whole nail designs.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice rolling the images on, but once mastered your nails will look very professional.</li>
            <li> i use regular nail polish, like wet and wild or revlon, only thing is with that you may have to stick with dark polish for the stamp so it can pop.</li>
            <li> Even the larger side gives me no extra room for user error when doing my big toe, and I don&#x27;t have larger than average toenails.  </li>
            <li> larger ones needed much less pressure or else the polish smudged, and designs with tiny lines required much more in order to fully pick it up, the mix between the two are really hard, such as the paw print, I was often either not picking up the little toes or was smudging the center of the paw</li>
            <li> so now I am using an old grocery store savings card that I cut in half as my scraper.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that you need to clean the scrapper blade after every few scraps because the polish gets clogged in the blade.</li>
            <li> The stamps are not very deep - had trouble getting clear stamps.</li>
            <li> but apparently my nails are bigger than average.</li>
            <li> The smaller end of the stamper is a firmer rubber, and the larger pink end is a squishy rubber that picks up the polish well.</li>
            <li> /polish quite well, but there are times when it won&#x27;t pick up the design without extra pressure, which results in extra polish outside the design and a potential mess.</li>
            <li> That was the positive, the negative to this is that the scraper although it works well</li>
            <li> Its little and hard to clean.</li>
            <li> The stamper is east to use but the scraper is a little hard to clean.</li>
            <li> First time using it was a little difficult (pictures got smudged) but it takes patience and focus to get it right.</li>
            <li> its hard to work with this one and  for large objects</li>
            <li> Wet n&#x27; Wild as my base color, and a black polish from Color Cosmetic that I picked up super cheap - six polishes for $5.</li>
            <li> i can stamp on the larger images with the red side, and use the green side for smaller images, rather than stamping with the really big side.  </li>
            <li> Had to buy different kinds other than this doesn&#x27;t work with different plates</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re planning to stamp a lot in pink or red, you may want to consider the single sided stamp with the white surface.  </li>
            <li> Even then, I found myself cleaning the scraper after each nail, and the nail polish would seep into the upper plastic part which made it difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is the large side is pink</li>
            <li> The large side, of course, I use for larger or full-nail images, only draw back is if I am stamping red or pink it is difficult to see the image on the red stamp.  </li>
            <li> Even though it was late I still received it within a reasonable time.</li>
            <li> I tried with a few gel polishes and so far none have worked well with this.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot of practice and patience, but it pays off in the long run.</li>
            <li> The smaller green side definitely helps when placing smaller images.</li>
            <li> Having this double ended stamper with 2 different sizes made a big difference in ease of use especially if you have small nails.</li>
            <li> I learned long ago to avoid using a metal scraper as it can create scratches and damage your plates.</li>
            <li> HAVE LONG  NAILS.</li>
            <li> It does what I need it to do but the scraper scratches my mash plates (minor ones).</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know why the tiny patterns doesn&#x27;t stick on it so well as they do on the pink side.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> I received much earlier than expected</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, it&#x27;s far easier to remove excess or dried up polish from a card than it is the nooks and crannies of the scraper.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the pink side caves in</li>
            <li> The color of the big stamp is a darkish pink which of course can make transferring pink polish a pain, but that is the only problem that I have encountered with the stamper.</li>
            <li> Have had this for a long time now.</li>
            <li> Which I can do but it takes way too long to do.</li>
            <li> I like the long handle</li>
            <li> It will save you a LOT of frustration in the long run.</li>
            <li> It took me a only a couple of tries to get the hang of this...</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s about the big pink side.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fully cover long nails.</li>
            <li> It worked while it lasted, which wasn&#x27;t long at all.</li>
            <li> I just got my Konad stamper, and I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve gone this long without it.</li>
            <li> , I failed so utterly that I was sure the product was a waste.</li>
            <li> This is not clear in the description</li>
            <li> The prints are not clear, the images on the disc to copy are not engraved well to pick up and transfer the images.</li>
            <li> Even when wiped off right away, and nail polish remover a little polish always gets stuck in the holes or some small crevice-- never to be removed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m being picky my only complaint would be the color of the large end of the stamper - I like to stamp red images onto my nails sometimes and red polish is really hard to see against the red stamp.</li>
            <li> Warning - if you have super long nails, this could be difficult to use and I would recommend a larger stamper.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyone wondering what whites can be used for stamping other than Konad&#x27;s \\&quot;special\\&quot; nail polish should try Sally Hansen&#x27;s Insta-Dri Whirlwind White.</li>
            <li> Although, the blade wasn&#x27;t sharp enough, it worked well.</li>
            <li> Smaller applicator/rubber end is extremely convenient.</li>
            <li> Took me a few attemps to transer the whole image to the stamper ends from the plate but with me being a first-time user, it got easier with a little practice.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have tried numerous times and it is not consistent at all.</li>
            <li> Received it earlier than expected as well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper here then other websites which is a big plus</li>
            <li> it has a big end and a little end for different design sizes.</li>
            <li> and it had came earlier then expected!</li>
            <li> I decided to buy the double ended stamper because the smaller tip for little nails like my granddaughter and her friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used the Konad plates, or the Konad stamping polish, I just didn&#x27;t want to bother with Konad when there&#x27;s plenty of other interchangeable brands that -don&#x27;t- claim to be The Only One.</li>
            <li> I used it with the MASH plates and Sally Hansen Insta Dry nail polish.</li>
            <li> I have an older one-sided stamper from Konad that I bought years ago, but it hasn&#x27;t been working for me lately, and the scraper wasn&#x27;t working well either.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the scraper didn&#x27;t work really well, so I ended up using an old credit card to do my scraping instead.</li>
            <li> sometimes the green size is big enough to solve this problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if you were to improve it, it should be bigger and squared instead of round since thumb nails are bigger.</li>
            <li> The stamper is firm yet squishy enough to transfer entire designs to the nail.</li>
            <li> so I decided to get this one since its double sided, one tip smaller for small designs and the other for larger designs.</li>
            <li> The pink side works for larger designs and green side for smaller images.</li>
            <li> Total let down.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and order this one waited 2weeks for it to come in</li>
            <li> We had a tiny bit of a learning curve, but my 13 yo DD had it down pat in no time.  </li>
            <li> The stamping surface of the larger end moves up and down within the holder.</li>
            <li> I find it a little hard to use the larger side with a steady hand.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a few tests to find out how long it takes the polish to dry in the tray.</li>
            <li> but as long as it&#x27;s firm, flat, and can scrape cleanly, you can&#x27;t go wrong with a scraper tool)</li>
            <li> It works perfectly right out of the packaging, red polish is a little hard to see on the pink base but it works just fine!</li>
            <li> I did black and white zebra print on my sister&#x27;s nails</li>
            <li> It arrived in about 2 weeks time.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it takes quite a bit of hassling with the stamp to actually get it to pick up the image from the plate and then to transfer it to your nails without smudging or half transfers...</li>
            <li> Usually always use the larger end for the big patterns.</li>
            <li> I got this, the 25 plate kit and the Konad black and white polishes.</li>
            <li> The only reason this doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because the scraper pretty much failed on me.  </li>
            <li> (Only reason I needed to replace previous one is because if a mischievous puppy, if it weren&#x27;t for her I wouldn&#x27;t needed the replacement )</li>
            <li> I ended up giving her my single sided Konad stamper instead with the plates that came in the Walmart kit and bought this one for myself to replace mine!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to see pink polish on a hot pink stamper!  </li>
            <li> I did a little research before purchasing the double sided stamper.</li>
            <li> However, the scraper that came with&lt;br /&gt;mine was a little different than the one in the picture and</li>
            <li> Takes  a little getting used to picking up the polish and properly aligning to the nail.</li>
            <li> My bed spread is a little red now because the scraper dripped.</li>
            <li> My last one broke after little use.</li>
            <li> I bought a set from the kiosk; was really having a tough time making it work (this kit came with the little shorty nail stamper with only a pink end).</li>
            <li> The bigger ones for me are a little bit harder because it is seems harder to determine if you are stamping on point where you want.  </li>
            <li> There are other Konad products out there that have only one stamper and are about one dollar less-</li>
            <li> I do wish the larger end was white because it is hard to see some polishes on pink.  </li>
            <li> The stamper is great, but the scraper is TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> The blade sucks, use an old credit card.</li>
            <li> the stamper is grea, i try not to use colors similar to the red/pink end b/c you lose sight of the design and can mess up, but other than that-</li>
            <li> I really like this stamper, you and use the small end for the small images and stamp them anywhere</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected</li>
            <li> The only thing I would suggest, would be to remove the (green and red) plastics and add a dot of glue to firmly attached them.</li>
            <li> Not really feeling d scraper tho</li>
            <li> Both sides of the stamp work as expected.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> Worked exactly as expected and prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> I use the green side for my toddler who has tiny</li>
            <li> for example its easier to see that a pink design went on the stamper properly on the green side than the pink.</li>
            <li> i will write a reveiw on how it works but the shipping was as expected and came just as seen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a nail specialist</li>
            <li> Maybe my nails are just too wide.</li>
            <li> I think if you use this regularly you&#x27;ll need to buy a few sets.</li>
            <li> I am a beginner but after a couple of tries I had the hang of it.</li>
            <li> &quot; It was just a flimsy pink piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> I can solve this by using the green rubber end, but it is smaller.</li>
            <li> Had to rough up the surface of the stamper (couple of swipes with an Emory board).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for roughly a month now</li>
            <li> so I really do not recommend the metallic scraper.</li>
            <li> the ends are not glued to the pink stamper body but unless you are tossing this around a lot, there shouldn&#x27;t be any problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This what I expected.</li>
            <li> Its when you need one to stamp with that you have to be careful.  </li>
            <li> I found the technique tedious to master but worth the time to learn.</li>
            <li> so I have not really used it.</li>
            <li> it is not what i really expected.</li>
            <li> Also, the plate holder didn&#x27;t work &amp; my plates were slipping.</li>
            <li> (If it just fell apart, I would have a harder time deciding whether or not to try another brand, I suppose.)</li>
            <li> not happy with the scraper, doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need to prime the pink side.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to put tape onto the image you just stamped.</li>
            <li> I used Wet</li>
            <li> works as I expected</li>
            <li> It was picking up images but not very well.</li>
            <li> pink stamping Polish</li>
            <li> i spent 30 min trying to do my nails.</li>
            <li> but it is expected.</li>
            <li> I feel like the red side picks up colors and the green one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> However, I have only gotten the stamp to transfer from the template to the stamper a few times.  </li>
            <li> My daughter loves this has been using for sometime now and does what it advertises for a minimal investment.</li>
            <li> until I realized that it too was partially falling out.</li>
            <li> It took my a few tries, but I finally got the hang of using this product.  </li>
            <li> You do not need to glob it onto the entire design on the plate, but only a thick strip on the side of the design and</li>
            <li> Red Carpet Manicure colors seem to be thick enough.  </li>
            <li> Been wanting one of these kits for a very long time!!</li>
            <li> The scraper works like any other scraper, you can also use a little key chain credit card to scrape the design if you prefer not to use the metal one.</li>
            <li> I like to do dark blue with a black argyle pattern on them.  </li>
            <li> The little holes that hold the metal tend to collect nail polish, and are difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> This was a disappointment because I bought it mainly for the larger stamper (the red colored one), and it just took a scatter of the design</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I could say is that the scraper is difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> (which obviously is to be expected due to the fact the stamp end is pink).</li>
            <li> i bought the white and black polish specifically for this (the black i&#x27;ve noticed stains</li>
            <li> Although I have to say be careful of the scraper because it is really sharp.</li>
            <li> Just as expected from comparing and reading other peoples&#x27; reviews.</li>
            <li> The other is rounded and harder to use the konad</li>
            <li> Double Ended Stamper And Scraper]]mper, and the nail polish is kind of thick when i got it. :(</li>
            <li> product was of poor quality and hard to keep frpm smearing, took lots of practice to get it right, I only used it a few times and decied I didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> So I got my product and was afraid to use the scraper from reading reviews, so I skipped right to a gift card!</li>
            <li> a side note, make sure you wait until your base coat of nail polish is COMPLETELY dry...</li>
            <li> You have a small amount of time to position the image after you have it on the stamp, but don&#x27;t wait too long as the image is so thin it will dry fast and probably mess up when you go to put it on.</li>
            <li> This was my most disappointing purchase!</li>
            <li> I have not found any other brand that works with the stamper.  </li>
            <li> BUT I GUESS THE OTHER BRANDS DONT MAKE</li>
            <li> As other reviewers wrote, I did have to file mine to get to work, I tried using it without doing that, but it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> other then the polish situation...</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not really much to say as it&#x27;s either hit or miss, but this product is a hit!  </li>
            <li> having two stamps is a bonus since you can work with small and larger images.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a given since the stamper end is pink!</li>
            <li> The konad scraper is not as sharp therefor it doesn&#x27;t cause the damage a razor blade would cause.</li>
            <li> Other than that it does the job.</li>
            <li> Only a few of my 50+ nail polishes would work because they aren&#x27;t thick enough to transfer without drying.</li>
            <li> And the where I got it from is not willing to work with me.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I were so excited to get this, only to be so disappointed when we used it.</li>
            <li> I have not tried any other stamps, but also have no desire to.</li>
            <li> The image is sharp.</li>
            <li> The scraper does scratch the plates, but I tried using a card like other reviewers</li>
            <li> Other brands don&#x27;t hold the paint as well during transfer.  </li>
            <li> With other stampers, maybe.</li>
            <li> I tried all suggestions from other reviews, none worked for us.</li>
            <li> One for small images and one for larger images.  </li>
            <li> I tried other surfaces just to test and it did it on all of them.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other stamper.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t think I will give any other ones a chance.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not interested in scratching my plates at all</li>
            <li> If anyone is looking to buy a stamper, just get this one and don&#x27;t bother trying any other ones.  </li>
            <li> If you can master the nail art stamping technique you can have endless nail art design possibilities and save money on your manicures.</li>
            <li> At first I had a difficult time getting the nail polish onto the stamper.</li>
            <li> Also the small side helps with smaller designs.</li>
            <li> The rubber doesn&#x27;t fall apart like other ones.</li>
            <li> I read on other reviews that the scraper scratched the images plates, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with that</li>
            <li> I like it, I will recommend this item to other.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of medal and has terribly sharp corners, so it does nothing but scratch up your plates, so do not use it.</li>
            <li> , I use it every other day</li>
            <li> I got this as a seconded stamper in case someone in my family or friends want to use it as I am using my other stamping kit.</li>
            <li> I almost gave up using the other</li>
            <li> But after a couple of tries you will be a pro!</li>
            <li> but I wont use any other brand of stamper or scraper</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews of crappy stampers and I didn&#x27;t want to risk getting cheaper ones not knowing how well they worked.</li>
            <li> I watched endless videos on Youtube on stamping.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to other family and friends.</li>
            <li> I like this because it has two sides i can the small side and use patterns from the big plates to transfer smaller images to my small nails.  </li>
            <li> I took the recommendations from other buyers in purchasing the Konad brand stamper.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried any other stampers</li>
            <li> other colors</li>
            <li> Followed tips from other reviewers</li>
            <li> I was extremely anxious to use it with the konad plates  i purchased at the same time (they showed up in 3 days...)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t scratch the plate like other scrapers.</li>
            <li> I have even used it with other polish besides Konads.</li>
            <li> i would have given it a 5 star if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that for me like some of the other reviewers have stated that you have to file the stamper (both sides) because it didn&#x27;t transfer the image at all until i filed the rubber part (gotta confess i thought it would damage the stamper to do this</li>
            <li> it is the scraper because it&#x27;s so small and difficult to clean</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with any other imitation scraper and stamper.</li>
            <li> I had the one-sided stamper, and it was frigging hard to do smaller designs... especially since my hands/nails are already really small.</li>
            <li> Definitely rough up the surface a little though.</li>
            <li> This one is not squishy but the head is softer than the little pink konad stamper that I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried the scraper several times and i think its just to hard.</li>
            <li> It was a little difficult to use at first</li>
            <li> I was pressing really hard, and instead of picking the polish up, it was just pushing it further in to the plate.</li>
            <li> It is sturdy and hard which helps when trying to apply different colors with the picture that you want.</li>
            <li> It takes some practice to get used to applying it so that it&#x27;s actually visible, but it isn&#x27;t hard.</li>
            <li> I picked up a $5 stamping kit at a local grocery store and I was having a really hard time with it.</li>
            <li> if it still doesn&#x27;t work, file it down a little bit with a rough file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought about buying a Konad stamper for quite some time (at least 6 months) and finally decided to do it.</li>
            <li> Some of course don&#x27;t show up as dark as others but that&#x27;s not because of the stamper performance.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to this, I am addicted to stamping!</li>
            <li> Not really worth it</li>
            <li> It also came with one set of fake eye lashes, really???</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t  like is that is comes with a very shiny surface what makes difficult  to get the stamp from the plates.</li>
            <li> Expensive polishes versus cheap-o versions really didn&#x27;t make a difference, it was the thickness/opaqueness that won out.</li>
            <li> you have the patience to potentially fail a lot and go through a lot of cleaning &amp; re-work, you really will get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Probably because they aren&#x27;t thick enough.</li>
            <li> Need to buy a nail polish the same brand, it has to be thick for this to work.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars due to the fact that it was really hard to see pink polish on the pink stamp end</li>
            <li> It took a minute of filing it down</li>
            <li> The stamper works well with practice, you don&#x27;t need to file it down.</li>
            <li> One thing I learned was that you need to file down the stamper before use.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to file mine down</li>
            <li> You might have to sand it down.</li>
            <li> So, I guess, word of advice, plan on spending some time nailing down your technique.</li>
            <li> i recommend putting down news paper or something you don&#x27;t mind gets ruined.</li>
            <li> It takes practice to get using this product down</li>
            <li> other removers require a little scrubbing</li>
            <li> Not any other brand, just konad!</li>
            <li> I have other two stampers and nothing works like this!</li>
            <li> mine wasnt the knock-off other people were talking about!</li>
            <li> The scrapper scratches the plates a little, which based on other reviews I already knew would happen.</li>
            <li> I use large and small stamping plates, and my old stamper just wasn&#x27;t cutting it for the small ones.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve had a hard time stamping images with really thick lines or shapes.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that since the stamper is red it is difficult to stamp with pinks or reds as you can&#x27;t see it on the stamper pad.</li>
            <li> I took others advice and \\&quot;roughed up\\&quot; the stamper just slightly with my nail file before using it, since I was worried about the reviews of people having problems.</li>
            <li> It picked up the black polish (Sally Girl) with ease.  </li>
            <li> less than 15 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;more</li>
            <li> I am going to try and find a way to cover the metal on the scraper and make it less damaging to my nail plates.</li>
            <li> THE PREVIOUS STAMP I PURCHASED</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put up with with any other scraper that scratches your plates or stamper that is too stiff to pick up the image.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to have a little down time to use again.</li>
            <li> it does the job... but took a little work to get it down..</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointing....</li>
            <li> No more hours and money spent at the salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is kinda awkward to hold, it is metal and scratches my plates, and it has quite a few nooks and crannies which make it impossible to get clean without practically soaking the whole thing in acetone.</li>
            <li> New to the stamping and wondering what I&#x27;m doing wrong.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money at retail stores or kiosks when you can just get online for much less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m majorly cosmetically/beauty product challenged, but now get compliments from random folks &amp; even the ladies at the nail salons for the fancy crap I&#x27;ve been able to pull off with this nifty little</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky to use</li>
            <li> Just a little tip.</li>
            <li> It took a little pratice</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about the metal scraper</li>
            <li> When I got home I thought I got scammed because I lost the little scraper thing and couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use them.</li>
            <li> I have had little issues using it to pick up polish -</li>
            <li> but it has there are little ridges and corners</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to try a little softer option.</li>
            <li> The length of stamper is easier to handle than other stampers w a small handle.</li>
            <li> But I do how ever like the little stamper.</li>
            <li> But without plate holder, I hope the price are a little bit cheaper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little unwieldy to use a credit card, so it&#x27;s a pain, and I wish the scraper included with this set was made of plastic.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to get used to holding this.  </li>
            <li> that will help you to master the technique with a little practice.</li>
            <li> With a little practice, it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Works well except for one little thing.</li>
            <li> I had a little trouble with the scraper</li>
            <li> The little holes and channels on the scraper catch polish which is messy.</li>
            <li> Some tips: Don&#x27;t press to hard - I noticed if I press the stamp to hard onto the plate the image transfers crooked from the pressure.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product hands down!</li>
            <li> So, if your scraper lets you down, too, don&#x27;t despair!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy and you waste a bit of nailpolish</li>
            <li> so if you do pink polish it is hard to see.</li>
            <li> Also be careful not to press the hard edges of the stamper into your nail if it&#x27;s still drying, as it will dent your polish.</li>
            <li> I tried it a few times it works</li>
            <li> (It gets messy sometimes)    </li>
            <li> I have the Konad polish and stamp plates, but clearly I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I was impatient and tried stamping too soon.</li>
            <li> no directions and seemed to be missing pieces.  </li>
            <li> i still have a few of the items..</li>
            <li> I got few images but they were fuggy and messed up.</li>
            <li> see some of my indi polish &amp; a few stamped designs, my page is&lt;br /&gt;[</li>
            <li> But this nail stamp is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is time-consuming, messy, and ineffective.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old niece found it difficult to use the way it should be.  </li>
            <li> Then press firmly when applying it to your nails.</li>
            <li> I purchased the one that was fulfilled by amazon, because i heard a few people in reviews getting fakes.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a few troubleshooting steps</li>
            <li> also had some trouble with the stamp picking up some images, but I believe that was because I used an off-brand image plate &amp; the images</li>
            <li> It was a waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> Product is garbage, wasted our money.</li>
            <li> The scraper does seem a bit uneven</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $$</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, there are no cheap substitutes for the stamper.  </li>
            <li> The stamp end is about 1\\&quot; round.  </li>
            <li> It applies it in such a thin layer, that any that got on the skin of my fingers washed off after a shower.</li>
            <li> This picks up the design nicely(except the green side) and I don&#x27;t use the scraper because it scratches the plate.</li>
            <li> I had some trouble getting the naipolish to &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34;, but that may have just been because the nailpolish I used.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble picking up images or placing them on my nail.</li>
            <li> by the time you get the stamper onto the image plate, the polish has already dried and you end up with nothing on your nail</li>
            <li> When I use the CC, the polish is left behind.</li>
            <li> The green side I&#x27;m still struggling with even after priming.</li>
            <li> Some are too thin to work, such as Nailluv.  </li>
            <li> It can also get a bit messy with the scraper.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now with no problems.</li>
            <li> Wasted money</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t want to put anything too heavy in there of course as it would push the ends</li>
            <li> I sometimes have trouble with the scraper.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Try it a few times to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> The green side was slanted</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal because the seller gave me a dollar refund</li>
            <li> Pics are from my first try, only room for improvement but not too bad!</li>
            <li> I bough this expecting to have the same quality as my other stamper from konad, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> The scraper is cheap-feeling, and has left a few very shallow scratches on my plates, although that doesn&#x27;t seem to have affected the designs I&#x27;m stamping.</li>
            <li> so I can stamp my nails and my little niece&#x27;s nails without having trouble centering the image on their small nails.</li>
            <li> I practice on false nails that are quite flat</li>
            <li> I have been doing my nails for about 10 years now, and not just plain polishing.</li>
            <li> It turned into a gooey mess!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also hard to track down the orientation on the stamps you&#x27;re applying.</li>
            <li> The scraper scratches my image plates pretty badly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to remove from the scraper and stamper with certain nail polishes.</li>
            <li> I asked for a refund and was given a rude dressing down by the seller.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Orly, Chanel, and others, and none of them are this thick and black.  </li>
            <li> So other than pushing them back into place every once in awhile (until I can get some crazy glue)</li>
            <li> The stamper required very little cleaning because 98% of the image transferred to my fingernail.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why but the rubber is softer on this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it all doesn&#x27;t work, or if it is the stamper and scraper.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> have small, chubby hands.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a small set at one of those carts in the mail in las vegas.</li>
            <li> but wanted one with the small end</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I agree with those who say it&#x27;s Konad or Nothing for stamping, but this does work well.</li>
            <li> It is a bit difficult to get it to work with regular nail polishes (rather than the Konad nail polish).  </li>
            <li> My nails are small</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I can pinpoint where my small art image will appear on my nails.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it helped</li>
            <li> I got the wrong product, I proceeded to contact the seller ( Herbal Beauty Supply (USA SELLER)), and talked to Amazon cust support, they told me that the seller had two business days to get back to me,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the small end too often-</li>
            <li> a number of them told me I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with the Konad Double Ended Stamper.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> Waste!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the Konad double sided stamper.  </li>
            <li> gives me versatility with my pinkie and small</li>
            <li> I like the quality of this stamper, and I did receive a Konad brand, I&#x27;m not sure why others did not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because of the stamp or because of the polish</li>
            <li> Not sure what else</li>
            <li> The scraper that comes with it is useless, (which is why I only gave it four stars)</li>
            <li> Its also a bit small for my nails</li>
            <li> You need something hard and stiff...</li>
            <li> lookes very very messy.</li>
            <li> I originally had the stamper and scraper from the salon express kit from Sally&#x27;s, hated it.</li>
            <li> I tried the stamper it was very hard to use and not worth the time.  </li>
            <li> surface of stamper small and hard</li>
            <li> I do believe I had to take a pencil eraser across the base part at first, but it works like a charm now.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t adhere to nail very well:-(</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that the rubber part is too hard and sometimes stamping with it is a little bit painful, especially if I have long nails at that time.</li>
            <li> It gets frustrating to be half done my nails and then have it quit working.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a lot of nail polish behind which will mess up your stamp.</li>
            <li> As it says on the packaging, use a rolling motion and don&#x27;t push too hard.</li>
            <li> and it is hard to get it out.</li>
            <li> Too hard.</li>
            <li> like with the plates, it hard to find nail poish that will pick up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard some people have a hard time</li>
            <li> Hard Stamper.  </li>
            <li> I could hardly get an image on the stamp.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these in another brand, and the stamper was too hard, and tended to smudge some of the designs.  </li>
            <li> but then i realized i was scraping too hard</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way</li>
            <li> Do not press on the plate too hard with the scraper because you will scratch it.</li>
            <li> she said she had a hard time using it</li>
            <li> only downside I have with this is that the scraper left some ugly scratch marks on my plate!</li>
            <li> Also the rubber is a bit hard</li>
            <li> The plate was a disappointment, but this stamper seems to work well enough.  </li>
            <li> My complaint is that once you get the polish on the stamper, you can&#x27;t tell if you are applying the stamp evenly.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me or at least it takes a lot of time to do it.</li>
            <li> The scraper sucks</li>
            <li> in the complex I&#x27;m satisfy..</li>
            <li> Use the Konad nail polish or find a really thick nail polish to transfer the designs.</li>
            <li> and it went well when I used a thick nail polish for the stamping.</li>
            <li> It lifts images from any brand plates, any brand of thick polish, and it just... works.</li>
            <li> The other brands had awful hard plasticy rubber that wouldn&#x27;t hold an image, and two of them had very rounded ends</li>
            <li> What I was missing!!</li>
            <li> Holy moly this was messy!!</li>
            <li> Makes my boring nails fun!</li>
            <li> and I used the small side of the stamp!</li>
            <li> That alone changed my failure rate from 1 in 3 and some designs not working at all, to 1 in 10 attempts not stamping as I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> Always disappointed so far.  </li>
            <li> Very messy and a bit frustrating.</li>
            <li> It broke too quick horrible</li>
            <li> Also because there is a little ledge where the scraper blade is inserted into the scraper polish tends to collect on the scraper blade and makes it difficult to scrape with (it leaves a film of polish around the image).</li>
            <li> It could only work but so bad.</li>
            <li> Well, yes it will, but it may be so faint that it will be a waste of your time.  </li>
            <li> some nail paints are not good for stamping .</li>
            <li> and that is just no good for your finger nor cuticle, so</li>
            <li> If you are thinking about starting to do nail stamping do NOT use Salon Express, it will just make you frustrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really good with these yet,</li>
            <li> Within just a few uses, though, the scraper got some nicks in it that rendered it totally useless in some places.</li>
            <li> STOP PRESSING SO HARD!</li>
            <li> Any thick type nail polish will do!</li>
            <li> waste of money and time!!!</li>
            <li> If your not sure, GO FOR IT!!</li>
            <li> Complicated and hard to use.</li>
            <li> Im addicted to nail stuff</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already addicted.</li>
            <li> I immediately discarded the scraper because it scratches the plates and will leave smeared designs, and replaced it with a thin plastic gift card instead.</li>
            <li> It has scratched up my plates a bit which im not happy with.  </li>
            <li> Not happy  that the metal scraped my stencils.</li>
            <li> BUT TAKE THE WORD OF AN ADDICTED STAMPER....</li>
            <li> BUT TAKE THE WORD OF AN ADDICTED STAMPER....</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using a thin, transparent nail polish, it&#x27;s not going to work.</li>
            <li> Maybe there is some secret to the process...</li>
            <li> stamper is a must for anyone who&#x27;s addicted to doing their nails.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the scraper.  </li>
            <li> but this thing is just frustrating.</li>
            <li> I for one was seriously over thinking this!</li>
            <li> However, the scraper did a horrible job of actually scrapping off the excessive polish from the groves.  </li>
            <li> just left an awful mess!!!</li>
            <li> I used it a few times and it scratched up my nail plates so badly.</li>
            <li> The scraper piece is pretty worthless, but I jusst use the base piece to transfer the design and have substituted a credit card, gift card, etc.</li>
            <li> it can get difficult and frustrating.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I applied the image and the rubber end pushed down into the tube.</li>
            <li> The scraper is crap; listen to other reviewers and throw it away.  </li>
            <li> In all of the nail stamping sets I&#x27;ve found, the included scraper is just a piece of crap and doesn&#x27;t do much other than scratch up your plates.</li>
            <li> the green stopper pops out sometimes but crazy glue can take care of that!</li>
            <li> I also like having the scraper, I would hate to have improvised and made a mess all over the place.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> (the stamper doesn&#x27;t pick them up off the plate), and cleanup can be difficult.</li>
            <li> Did not work well and sadly, will never use.</li>
            <li> that I know how obsessed I am.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s difficult to take off glitter with non acetone polish.  </li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this product after watching a you tuber do her nails with this.</li>
            <li> scraper is metal, which ended up scratching one of my plates, unfortunately.</li>

            <li> Not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong</li>
            <li> Difficult to print on nails.</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical</li>
            <li> It was difficult to use.</li>
            <li> what i do wrong is</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> Kinda sad.</li>
            <li> I am addicted !</li>
            <li> Some of the prints were really difficult to make imprints.</li>
            <li> should have known by the price that something was wrong with it, but i have it a chance and they screwed me over.</li>
            <li> are useless.  </li>
            <li> scrapper is useless.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating</li>
            <li> Just hard (impossible!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep just because to inconvenient to return.</li>
            <li> the disks are highly dangerous.</li>
            <li> highly dangerous.</li>
            <li> The rubber tip might come off, but all you need is a crazy glue...</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Konad products!</li>
            <li> Too complicated to use!</li>
            <li> so it was impossible to pick up an image and then put it on your nail without rolling it around -</li>
            <li> Bad Life Choice.  </li>
            <li> Based on the ammount of people giving 5 starts to this product, it looks I was the one with bad luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad thing its that my expectation was lowered by this product.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this product, I read a lot of bad reviews on the scraper.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s AWSOME , I have not had any bad transfers.  </li>
            <li> The metal one scratches the plates so bad.</li>
            <li> I often get asked where I get my nails done and people are shocked when I tell them that I do it myself.</li>
            <li> I am now a stamping fanatic!!!!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed I couldn&#x27;t do the designs I wanted.</li>
            <li> When I try to use the stamper with what I already have it leaves nothing on my nails :(</li>
            <li> I was so upset :(</li>
            <li> The reason I gave 4 stars is because the scraper is made of metal rather than plastic in which I was a somewhat disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just wish the scraper wasn&#x27;t metal, it tends to scratch up my Gals stamping plates :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and although it dose what it should it also has damaged on of my plates :(</li>
            <li> disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed and now it seems I can&#x27;t get a replacement, as it was not fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I guess all the reviews here are fake!!</li>
            <li> I hate d scraper.  </li>
            <li> , polish gets stuck in the grooves and it&#x27;s annoying to get rid of</li>
            <li> The metal scraper will scratch the crap out of your stamping tray 2.</li>
            <li> Idiot proof.  </li>
            <li> saves time, saves nailpolish and saves annoying visits to beauty salons for fancy manicure and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I hate it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an idiot</li>
            <li> Very difficult for use.!</li>
            <li> I was very wrong!</li>
            <li> This thing is impossible to use!</li>
            <li> This it bad one ..don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> but idk if its because of the nail polish or im just a retard</li>
            <li> Very disappointed since this was a gift for my sister.</li>

            <li> -TERRIBLE.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My daughter loves using this for nail art.</li>
            <li> The stamp and scraper work great but if you use an old credit card or gift card as the scraper you wont end up scratching your stamping plates</li>
            <li> I really like this and it picks up the polish from my nail pates. I really like the double sides that are different size. I had another stamper that did not work at all so I am very pleased with this one and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very new to nail stamping (this was my second attempt) and I definitely recommend this product. It picks up the images perfectly, and it is a lot softer than the other stamper I was using.</li>
            <li> Great stamper/scraper set! Serves my purpose very well since I&#x27;m new to the game of stamping manicures. Shipped quickly. Arrived ahead of schedule. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t slide properly</li>
            <li> I do t like the metal scrapper that scratches your plated, so I just use a credit card instead.</li>
            <li> My scraper was bent when I received it. :/ The stamper is fabulous though</li>
            <li> Took a bit of practice to getting a perfect stamp without smudging but now it&#x27;s easy-peasy.  Arrived sooner than expected which is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times and love it, It is very easy to use and cleans fairly easy.</li>
            <li> This item is just ok! I tried it a few times it works okay. Maybe I need to practice a little more. But right now its now meeting my expectations.</li>
            <li> I love this stamper It doesn&#x27;t require any prep it picks up most nail polish.  This one is by far the best</li>
            <li> I would have liked the plastic slider better than the metal one given.</li>
            <li> First time stamper here. First look up tutorials on YouTube. This Works great :)  I love stamping my nails. I use the metal scraper too, worked better than an old card for me.</li>
            <li> I read extensive reviews before buying this, and was a bit concerned about the mixed reviews.&lt;br /&gt;After I got it, I ended up having to file the surface with a coarse file like others suggested, because it was too sticky and the polish wouldn&#x27;t transfer properly. After filing and cleaning it, it works well. If you are using a regular polish, you need to be VERY fast, applying the polish to the pattern plate, wiping excess immediately, and using the stamper immediately. I noticed that if you delay even just a few seconds, the regular polish will dry too fast to transfer to the stamper. But if you do it very quickly, the results are great! I tried with a few gel polishes and so far none have worked well with this. Probably because they aren&#x27;t thick enough. I went ahead and ordered a white and a black actuan Konad polishes, since those will be the colours I will use the most for my patterns.</li>
            <li> It really works. It is simple and easy to use. The only thing I would suggest, would be to remove the (green and red) plastics and add a dot of glue to firmly attached them.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking it was actually a Konad product  and would come as pictured. But alas; what I got was a cheap knock-off which came in a \\&quot;made in China\\&quot; package. Very cheap looking and the scraper is the cheapest I have ever seen, will definitely scratch your plates. I will toss the scraper and keep the stamper. The seller should put an accurate pic of the product being sold and lower the price. I would not recommend this to anyone. This was my most disappointing purchase! The following ones are better! [[ASIN:B00CJIOG0Q Winstonia Nail Art Double Ended Large Stamp and Plastic Scraper Set]] or  [[ASIN:B005V2LLXC MASH Double Sided Nail Art Plate Stamp and Scraper (Special Introductory Price)]] Mind you the plastic scrapers are always best so as to not scratch your nice image plates.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s the fastest and easiest way to add nail art to my service menu without having to charge a lot for it.  It&#x27;s a little tricky to use but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This works well, purchased it with the bundle monster manicure plates and now am sporting some fun finger and toe nail art</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with nail image plates - great lift of polish designs, and I like the two sizes of stamper.  We&#x27;ve used it multiple times and it&#x27;s consistently excellent.  Thank you for this great product.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I chose to buy this product because of the high reviews posted &amp; I made the right choice! I love that it&#x27;s a double ended stamper so I can stamp my nails and my little niece&#x27;s nails without having trouble centering the image on their small nails. This product truly met my expectations.</li>
            <li> Just arrived and I can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
            <li> There are other Konad products out there that have only one stamper and are about one dollar less- I say stick with this one!  The small side is perfect for smaller nails to be more precise as well as with the smaller designs and with the French Manicures.    The scraper works well also, but I found that its hole often got a little clogged, but that wasn&#x27;t much of an inconvenience, merely an observation that it works best when cleaned after each use!  A little hint, to save nail polish only put polish on the top half of the design and when you scrape down, the excess nail polish from the top will fill into the bottom half, saving you more nail polish! Overall, this is a must!</li>
            <li> Polish sticks a bit more thsn it should.</li>
            <li> I ordered this the 20th of March, and got it the 26th, wasn&#x27;t happy with the shipping, but it was totally worth it!!!  here are some tips if you need some,    1. File Your Stamper Before use! (It helps the images show up on the stamper)    2. If you don&#x27;t have a \\&quot;Plate Holder\\&quot; I suggest you use some paper towels to help it not get it on the table lol. (It gets messy sometimes)    3. Make sure you clean off extra nail polish left on the image plate after you already put it on the stamper. (otherwise it will dry and it&#x27;ll be hard to clean out.    4. Be fast when your stamping because its been known to dry really fast!        Once you get the hang of it, You will be stamping all day! (Like me lol)    I definitely recommend getting the double ended stamper and scraper. :)</li>
            <li> Im addicted to nail stuff and when I came across the Konad stamper, I just had to have it! Works great!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Konad stamper...when it is working correctly.  I agree with the others who said to be sure to view the youtube tutorial.  I too jumped in feet first without watching the video and wasted hours!  Be sure to file your stamper and also rubbing the rubber end between your hands and warming it up helps as well.  Still, there are times when the stamper just won&#x27;t pick up the design, no matter what tricks I use.  It gets frustrating to be half done my nails and then have it quit working.  Be sure to use the Konad nail polish as well.  I have not found any other brand that works with the stamper.  The scraper is essentially useless as it gets gunked up quickly and is hard to clean. However, an old credit card or the like works very well (better even!)    all in all, it&#x27;s a fun tool and if it always worked well, I&#x27;d give it a five star rating.  It was worth the purchase price and even with the frustrations, I still do enjoy using it!</li>
            <li> This it bad one ..don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the double ended stamper. Awesome for doing large or small designs. Mine worked fine for picking up the design &amp; placing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the scraper. Its little and hard to clean. Polish gets caked in the grooves just above the metal scraper part &amp; is a pain to get off. Other than that I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this works way better than the single sided stamper...I&#x27;m not sure why but the rubber is softer on this one.</li>
            <li> I did a little research before purchasing the double sided stamper. It works MUCH better than the single sided as if you use a pink polish, the green end will show it. The scraper works like any other scraper, you can also use a little key chain credit card to scrape the design if you prefer not to use the metal one. The small end works wonderful for the little flowers and small designs that Konad has to offer.    If you&#x27;re going to spend the money, get the one with both ends. This stamper also gives you more pressure when you&#x27;re stamping your design and has more of a handle to roll the stamper across your nail.</li>
            <li> The stamper is absolutely amazing, there is no replacement and it works a ton better than anything in my house I tried before buying this.  The small end is perfect for single images while the big side is perfect for full nail and tip designs.      The scraper does its job well but scratches the plates easily.  I can see this being a problem in the near future.  I tried a gift card and it didn&#x27;t work nearly as well &#x3D;[</li>
            <li> I was glad I purchased this stamper!   It&#x27;s nice to have the two sizes for smaller designs and nails!  A couple of tips...  Lightly sand the two tips with your nail filer. Sometimes it&#x27;s to new and won&#x27;t work effectively.  Use only Acetone nail polish remover  When stamping the plate only push straight down and up. No rolling or wiggling.  The nail polish does matter. I have used Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear and it does work.  and of course..Tutorials...Tutorials...Tutorials!!!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have only tried nail stamping twice so far and I have never taken a cosmetology course, nor do I do this for a living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that using an old credit card works so much better than the cute little scraper that comes with the Konad Stamper.&lt;br /&gt;Metal against metal makes me cringe. &amp;lt;&amp;lt; that might be why I cant scrape correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me about 4 tries to get one image right, after watching 4-5 youtube videos on how to do it. They make it look so easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it really makes a difference if you use THE/THIS Konad stamper versus an off brand one. The excess nail polish does come off the stamper end very very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. FYI you do NOT HAVE to use Konad nailpolish with either of these products. Just try and find a thicker cream nailpolish, most china glaze colors are perfect.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t bother using the scraper but the stamper does a great job picking up my images from metal plates for nail stamping.</li>
            <li> I Have been doing nails for years so I like to try new things.  I tried the stamper it was very hard to use and not worth the time.  I tried to return the product but the company will not take it back.  So I would think twice about buying this product or anything from this company.</li>
            <li> This is nice. I like it! Not really feeling d scraper tho but I guess I&#x27;ll get used 2 it or I might just use an old debit card or something. The stamper is lightweight and the tips just mold 2 ur fingers n make stamping e-z. I took off a star bcoz I hate d scraper.  NB: Anyone wondering what whites can be used for stamping other than Konad&#x27;s \\&quot;special\\&quot; nail polish should try Sally Hansen&#x27;s Insta-Dri Whirlwind White. It stamps rlly well n is inexpensive compared to Konad&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a very timely manner and I LOVE IT! Although, the blade wasn&#x27;t sharp enough, it worked well. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Can not use a konad disc without the stamper and scraper.  Very important to have in order to transfer the design onto the nail.  A must have.</li>
            <li> I love the Konad Stamper with scraper.  I highly recommend this product.  And the person who sold it to me did a great job as well.  The order was sent on time and in great condition as well.</li>
            <li> I just got my Konad stamper a few days ago and am loving it!  I have had a lot of problems with the scraper and thanks to other reviews, have discovered that a gift card does work wonders.  I am still in the experimental stage with it, but having fun.  It takes a lot of practice and patience, but it pays off in the long run.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to be nail stamping than this is the stamper to get. It works great even with non-Konad polishes and provides beautiful images. The smaller green side definitely helps when placing smaller images. The scraper works great.  This set is a must have.</li>
            <li> I always use theses nail plates and get lots of complements on my nails. Alot of people think I get them done at a salon.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well. it doesn&#x27;t create any good impressions. I guess all the reviews here are fake!!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I tried for over an hour trying to use this product, but to no avail.  I have the Konad polish and stamp plates, but clearly I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good. It sometimes takes a few times to get the image perfect.</li>
            <li> not to impressed with this stamper I prefer a different kind of stamper . its hard to work with this one and  for large objects this isn&#x27;t good for it at all .</li>
            <li> AMAZING. I have an older one-sided stamper from Konad that I bought years ago, but it hasn&#x27;t been working for me lately, and the scraper wasn&#x27;t working well either. I don&#x27;t know why. So I bought this, and I am amazed at how well the stamps transfer over. As it says on the packaging, use a rolling motion and don&#x27;t push too hard. This is the best stamper in my book. The scraper works great too. I&#x27;ve been using an old gift card as a scraper, but not anymore. If you end up losing your scraper or if it stops working, gift cards work just as well :) the scraper seems to get dull over time and it&#x27;s a pain to clean the excess nail polish out of all the grooves in the plastic, but it&#x27;s no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the two different size stampers. I use large and small stamping plates, and my old stamper just wasn&#x27;t cutting it for the small ones. I have used a lot of different brands of image plates, and they all work very well with this. I love that the smaller side enables me to easily transfer small images. This stamper is amazing.</li>
            <li> What I was missing!! Thanks!! Good stamp!</li>
            <li> For use with nail design plates, highly recommend the double end. One side small and one side large.</li>
            <li> Fun stamper.  Does the job.  Remember to remove with nail polish the prior stamp before moving on to the next nail.</li>
            <li> perfect, konad is what you want</li>
            <li> Works great, does as described.  Easy to clean and use.  Makes doing nail art fun and easy.  I really enjoy doing my nails now, and with so many different nail art stamp plates out there, it&#x27;s totally worth it and great price.</li>
            <li> Great price with no s/h. worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> In my opinion the double-ended stamper is a must for Konad-ing.  I like the larger end for full nail designs and the smaller end is useful for more precise placement of smaller designs.  As regards to the scraper, I have found that using an old credit card/gift card works better than the scraper that comes with this kit. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Loved Loved Loved this product</li>
            <li> Once I received my plates, I couldn&#x27;t wait for the stamper to come in the mail so I can get started! Since it&#x27;s my first time, I need a bit practice to be more accurate to get the designs on my nails. Overall, it&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li> Great for nail art stamping</li>
            <li> Amazing I love it . Besides that I do agree you have to prep it . And no you don&#x27;t always need that stamping nail polish . Use what you have . I myself like to use old kind of thick ones. Just a little tip.</li>
            <li> the green side doesn&#x27;t pick up and the pink side (the bigger side) isn&#x27;t level, one side has less thickness than the other, doesn&#x27;t make stamping very easy with it.</li>
            <li> It works well for medium designs, but if you use the extra large plates, you will need a larger stamper.</li>
            <li> Works excellently with the Konad stamping plates, and I can&#x27;t see needing to try another stamp with the results I am getting!  Very happy!</li>
            <li> I love this, I wish I could purchase just the double stamper because the scraper will just scrape my shiney plates away. But over all I love it. It works great, I also love the small green side. Small enough to fit my tiny pinky.</li>
            <li> This is a super fun little thing, and it worked just as described. I used it with the MASH plates and Sally Hansen Insta Dry nail polish. I did not like the scraper, so I used an old cancelled credit card instead. I didn&#x27;t have to &#x27;file&#x27; the end of the stamper as some users mentioned to get the image to transfer; it worked just fine right out of the package. I used pure acetone to clean the stamper and plates and it cleaned off perfectly. I think this was very worth the price, and I can see myself using it over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, make sure you wait until your base coat of nail polish is COMPLETELY dry...I was impatient and tried stamping too soon. It turned into a gooey mess!</li>
            <li> no directions and seemed to be missing pieces.  I returned it with no problems.</li>
            <li> I love my Konad double stamper! It works perfectly right out of the packaging, red polish is a little hard to see on the pink base but it works just fine! I was expecting shipping in 3-5 days but I ordered on Friday Afternoon and it was at my door by Monday morning! I love unexpected surprises! I definitely recommend this item wholeheartedly.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all at first. I almost threw it out!&lt;br /&gt;After finagling with it many many times I finally got the image to stick onto it. The blade sucks, use an old credit card.</li>
            <li> The Konad stamper works much better than any other stamper.  I&#x27;ve tried several manufacturers and Konad is the only stamper that gave me a complete image instead of pieces.  The scraper is a metal scraper which worried me at first, but gives a cleaner pick-up than the plastic scrapers I have; especially on off-brand plates that are not etched as well.</li>
            <li> Worked well. Used old credit card to clear polish off plates. Transfer stamp worked after i got use to it. I had to practice to get image straight.</li>
            <li> The product I received was brand new. The stamper is east to use but the scraper is a little hard to clean. Overall, very pleased.</li>
            <li> Waist of money it doesn&#x27;t transfer to nail completely</li>
            <li> The Stamper is awesome and works really well however the scraper is useless the metal on metal pulls all the nail polish off and then the stamper will not pick up the whole image. It is so much better to just use an old credit card or old reward card it works 100 times better!</li>
            <li> I KEPT LOOKING FOR A CHEAPER ONE BUT I GUESS THE OTHER BRANDS DONT MAKE THE STAMPER ONLY KONAD ITS WORTH THE PRICE JUST TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT</li>
            <li> I ordered the Konad double ended stamper on Friday morning and received it in Saturday&#x27;s mail, I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting it until Monday but wow, I will defiantly order from this company again.....  Now I am a stamping newbie and I think I got the hang of it pretty quickly. The stamper is super easy to use and feels good in your hand, I didn&#x27;t use the scraper only because I heard that using an old gift card or credit card would be better and it does work.</li>
            <li> i loved how fast my order came in! The stamper works great and scraper does too. I wish it was the newer plastic one instead of the metal one, that can ruin your image plates.</li>
            <li> I love doing my nails now! This stamper works great, I am happy that I got this double ended one, its very convenient to use the smaller side for smaller images. As other reviewers wrote, I did have to file mine to get to work, I tried using it without doing that, but it wouldn&#x27;t work. It took a minute of filing it down and I was able to stamp perfect images onto my nails. I&#x27;ve been trying out different images every week and get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> Love it. Bought it a while back and still using it till this day and buying more as gifts when needed. Thank you</li>
            <li> Hi all. I had order a set from another buyer and not the brand which didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;work on me (I have license in manicure and nail art by the way), so I decided to go&lt;br /&gt;for the brand. Still no luck.&lt;br /&gt;Had to return it.</li>
            <li> My gf is happy with the purchase and that makes me happy.</li>
            <li> Both sides of the stamp work as expected. I tried the scraper several times and i think its just to hard. The metal doesn&#x27;t let it flex. I ended up using a gift card instead and that worked much better.</li>
            <li> Great quality, works and came right away totally satisfied. : )</li>
            <li> very good and the double stampers allow for more variability.  Although I have to say be careful of the scraper because it is really sharp.</li>
            <li> Love the double end stamper but the scraper is just ok. I prefer to use an old credit card instead of the scraper.  Could be personal preference.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty nifty tool. It works good... Sometimes doesn&#x27;t pick up the image well but it does a good job most of the time.</li>
            <li> Stamp is no longer sticky and polish will not transfer to it any longer!</li>
            <li> I gave this to a friend for christmas this year. She loved it. I heard about it from a friend that got it online and i thought it was pretty cool. She showed me how to use it and it worked well. The only problem is that it wastes a lot of nail polish, but i think that it is still worth it to get the design. Also i would like to point out that this item only comes with the double sided stamper and the scraper. You will have to buy your own designs and special nail polish. Overall though i would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this double ended stamper to be used along side my nail plates that I ordered from Bundle Monster. I love the fact that it has one end to use for the large images and the smaller end to use for the smaller single prints.  The scraper works perfectly well but I prefer to use an old gift card or credit card. I notice that I scrape off far too much polish when I use this metal scraper. All in all, the product does exactly what it is advertised to do. It shipped incredibly fast. 5 starts</li>
            <li> Very impressive shipping results. Product is exactly like it is stated in the description and looks identical to the image. I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Shipping time was great considering Christmas and all...was a lil disappointed about the quality of the stamp but idk if its because of the nail polish or im just a retard lol. ive watched many tutorials and i know im doing it right...do i really need to break down and buy their nail polish? other then the polish situation...im happy :D</li>
            <li> years ago my mom bought me something like this..and ironically now 27 i still have a few of the items..i never used it much back then..but recently gotten into painting my nails and different designs..somehow i found this and had to buy it...its a little messy especially trying to clean up without messing up your own nails (tweezers holding cotton ball is helpful)...theres loads of videos on this on youtube from different designs to helpful tips..such has rubbing the ends with a nail filer to grip the pattern..i&#x27;ve also found that when starting to dab your polish then swipe then go back and add another layer of polish and swipe..my 16 year old sister keeps wanting me to do her nails and gets rave reviews at school and a bunch of them want me to do their nails..i bought the white and black polish specifically for this (the black i&#x27;ve noticed stains the scrapper)...i&#x27;ve used my own polish a few times its just finding the right one to work i think..some work better then others..I also bought the SHANY plates that was in a bundle..so much cheaper then buying one plate at 7 bucks a piece...so not happenin!</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I received the item after two days of purchasing because i ordered it in Saturday. I like it very much and it is really useful.</li>
            <li> It was a little difficult to use at first but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s a bit easier. The nail polishes I have don&#x27;t work as well so I assume you need the special polish in order for it to work perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is a joke. Plates do not have deep indentation for figures. Nothing shows up on the stamper. Sorry but I tried to be positive and tried all different methods. I even tried on white paper, but still no luck. It Didn&#x27;t work. I got few images but they were fuggy and messed up. Imma try to get refund hopefully I will have a better luck in gettin my money back (wish me luck).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy  doesn&#x27;t even work !!!!</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  I dislike the scraper because it scrubs my plates.  I prefer to use an old gift card instead.</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to use. Just remember to file it to get better pickup. It even arrived way earlier than it said. :)</li>
            <li> Worked exactly as expected and prompt shipping. For those new to stamping, it does take practice so don&#x27;t give up. Having this double ended stamper with 2 different sizes made a big difference in ease of use especially if you have small nails.</li>
            <li> Works great. I prefer the &amp;#34;marshmallow&amp;#34; stamper but for this being on the firmer side, it works quite well. And I love that I can see white on the red and green sides. It works all every plate I have, and that&#x27;s a lot.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to decide between the double ended stamper and just the normal one, I would definately go for the double! I feel like the normal stamper is too small (the handle part), this one is easy to work with. The larger end works great for a full nail design and the small one is great for just single designs. The scraper is nothing special, it does scratch the plates though. That doesn&#x27;t really bother me, but if you wanted, you could use an old gift/credit card so that it doesn&#x27;t scratch as much. Based on other reviews, I did use a nail file to \\&quot;buff\\&quot; the stamper, and I&#x27;ve gotten perfect stamping results, Overall, great product and an obvious must if you want to do nail art stamping!</li>
            <li> My stamper and scraper arrived much quicker than expected!!! It was sealed and was in PERFECT condition! Works great with ALL nail polishes: from the cheap $.99 to the expensive $10 ones. I love the fact it has two ends: one end is small and the other bigger because that helps when you have smaller nails or images on the plates. Nail polish cleans off very well with almost no acetone!! LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! Its very comfortable in your hands and scraper is effecient as well! I def recommend this product 110% and will def buy from this seller again in the future!! You can&#x27;t go wrong for the low price and great product!! :)</li>
            <li> Came quickly, easy to use. Good quality and very happy with this product. I do recommend it to those who love nail stamping art.</li>
            <li> But the scraper is ineffective. Instead, use an old gift card or credit card you won&#x27;t be using anymore. The stamp itself is great. Easy to hold and I like the dual sides</li>
            <li> If you want perfectly smooth nail designs saturated with color, you need this stamper. you can get away with buying the \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; plates but definitely not the stamper. Go all the way with Konad, it&#x27;s worth your money. However, you may be okay with not buying the scraper because I&#x27;ve used an old gift card and it&#x27;s worked virtually the same as the scraper AND it doesn&#x27;t have the pesky rim that you have to clean every time you do a nail (otherwise polish will build up there and your scraping will become very inefficient). With a credit/gift card, you don&#x27;t have to dig deep with a q-tip to make sure the polish is gone, you just have to run it between some cotton soaked in acetone and behold, it&#x27;s as clean as when you started. if you find a konad stamper w/o the scraper, good for you, but if not, having the scraper won&#x27;t kill you. :)</li>
            <li> hi, this is amzing , now at the local mall u can find these for 20 but this price is amazing and i received it soo quick!!!!! is makes my nails look amazing !! now this along with my disc m45</li>
            <li> You can clean the rubber off w/your finger nail or rub it w/your finger.  a damp washcloth- a clean stamp helps designs transfer.&lt;br /&gt;great price &amp; still works great- I use the green side for my toddler who has tiny nails.&lt;br /&gt;To see some of my indi polish &amp; a few stamped designs, my page is&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> I got this within a day! It works great! I&#x27;m very pleased with this product! I&#x27;d definitely recommend buying it if you haven&#x27;t already!</li>
            <li> I have this particular set and I love the stamper, I like how there is a smaller side its good for small designs like maybe doing multiple flowers on a nail the small one also works better when your testing a color combination on a nail design wheel, its easier to see where your stamping the smaller images on your nails and center it better. Also it has 2 colors which comes in handy if you are doing a design the same color as the stamp- for example its easier to see that a pink design went on the stamper properly on the green side than the pink. It&#x27;s easy to hold and comfortable to work with. I don&#x27;t always use the scraper with some designs I use the straight edge of a scrap of tag board, like packaging inserts, it works better on wider designs (because you can cut it to size) and you can just toss it out instead of cleaning it.</li>
            <li> I like to do my nails a lot and for the more complex nail designs, I often use Konad templates. Prior to this, I had the normal stamp which was very wide which made it more difficult to do precise stamping. This double ended stamper definitely fixed that problem.</li>
            <li> I have tried this on multiple occasions and it doesn&#x27;t work.  Absolutely dissatisfied!  I purchased all supplies with it as well.</li>
            <li> I just got it in and it looks totally different but works the same</li>
            <li> i havent used this yet because i am still waiting for my plates to come in the mail so as soon as they do i will write a reveiw on how it works but the shipping was as expected and came just as seen</li>
            <li> My daughter (11) bought this and has watched youtube videos on designs and how-tos and I have to tell you, he nails look more professional than the free hand designs I sometimes get at the salon. Very professional looking, easy and just fun!</li>
            <li> I still use this periodically.  The scraper piece is pretty worthless, but I jusst use the base piece to transfer the design and have substituted a credit card, gift card, etc. for the scraper.  Works really well.  I do believe I had to take a pencil eraser across the base part at first, but it works like a charm now.</li>
            <li> This stamper works perfectly with my MASH plates! The polish transfers from plate to nail seamlessly and excess polish cleans off easily with a bit of nail polish remover. The double-ended design is nice - the small end is great for smaller images and/or doing my pinky nails and I use the larger end for full nail and longer tip images. If I&#x27;m being picky my only complaint would be the color of the large end of the stamper - I like to stamp red images onto my nails sometimes and red polish is really hard to see against the red stamp. I guess this is unavoidable though as nail polish comes in every conceivable color under the sun! Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this stamper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the scraper, I can&#x27;t comment. I learned long ago to avoid using a metal scraper as it can create scratches and damage your plates. I instead just use a plastic credit card or gift card for scraping and have had no trouble with this method.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well! I did have some problems using it at first, so I&#x27;m going to share some tips with you.  1) Wipe everything down with pure acetone, or use a nail polish remover that does NOT contain any oils. The first one I used had a moisturizer in it, and the polish would not stick well to the stamper  2) Slightly rough your stamper up with a fine grit nail file. This will help pick up the polish from the plates  3) The metal scraper will scratch your plates. You don&#x27;t need to press down hard, just be sure to hold it at a 45 degree angle  4) Work FAST. I was taking my dear sweet time and the polish dries and then won&#x27;t stick to the stamper or your nail  5) Be sure to put down a base coat (clear or colored) first. Stamping directly to my nails doesn&#x27;t work so well  6) You can use ANY polish you want. It doesn&#x27;t have to be the Konad \\&quot;special polish\\&quot;. However, thinner polishes won&#x27;t show up well. So if you&#x27;re going to use a white or a lighter color, older or goopy polishes work better.  7) The plates from BUNDLE MONSTER are great! You get 20-some plates with 4-8 designs on them and they&#x27;re lots of fun. Some of the plates compliment each other and are great for layering multiple colors. [[ASIN:B003ILUQPM Bundle Monster Nail Art 21pc Stamping Plates]]  or  [[ASIN:B004XJNQXW Bundle Monster Nail Art Nailart 25pc Stamping Plates]]  Hope this helps everyone out there. ENJOY!  ~MJ!~</li>
            <li> This is a great stamper, the only one I have tried but it works perfectly and I love the two sizes on each end.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and it works great!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It picks up your stamp completely. I have the Salon Express Stamper as well but  there is no comparison. The Konad is the original and the best one.</li>
            <li> I love the double ended Konad Nail Stamper! It is very convenient having two sizes for stamping, especially when you just need a little decorative stamp. It is also perfect for use on my neices little fingers! I love the ridges that are on the stamper for your fingers, sometimes I get in such a hurry to stamp my image and am afraid the stamper will fly out of my hand but the ridges make it easy to grip. I also like having the scraper, I would hate to have improvised and made a mess all over the place. The scraper however does have some holes that are close to the scraper that get polish inside and it is hard to get it out. I was pleasently surprised when the Konad Nail Art Double Ended Stamper and Scraper arrived before the estimated shipping date!</li>
            <li> arrived pretty quickly! i am new to the stamping scene ! i am getting ready to try it out now!</li>
            <li> Great stamper. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I heard only good things about the konad stamper. Can&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li> I already know I will love this product. What I was MOST pleased with was the seriously FAST delivery!</li>
            <li> Just as described... both items do their job. Good buy.Fast and easy to use. No messes. I WOULD recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is really a smart idea. I didn&#x27;t think that such an inexpensive gadget would work so well but if you follow the instructions you will get really good results every time. I love new nail ideas, techniques, and products. I would recommend this product to people of all ages who want to be a bit more experimental with their nails.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get the nail art plate, and polish, and stamper, and scraper to do my nails really cute.  I&#x27;m not sure if it all doesn&#x27;t work, or if it is the stamper and scraper.  I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just received it yesterday. It is small and works very well. It is easy to clean and it worked with other nail polishes than konad nail art polish, which is great since I never bought any :)</li>
            <li> Basically served its purpose. Definitly buy alooooooot of plates, and make sure you have pure acetoneso it can be cleaned smoothly. other removers require a little scrubbing</li>
            <li> i love this stamper.  i can stamp on the larger images with the red side, and use the green side for smaller images, rather than stamping with the really big side.  the price was great and it works great with the bundle monster 21 plate stamping plate kit i bought.  both are truely awesome!!!</li>
            <li> Results with this stamper can be awesome -- but mastering it takes serious practice. Not all nail polishes work well (the stamper doesn&#x27;t pick them up off the plate), and cleanup can be difficult. I watched a lot of videos about how to use this before I ever tried. However, when it comes out right it comes out amazing. I did black and white zebra print on my sister&#x27;s nails and she said she&#x27;s never gotten so many compliments before in her life. It requires some skill, but it&#x27;s definitely worth trying if you&#x27;re a nail enthusiast!</li>
            <li> This is a nice cheap way to do your nails. I recommend buying this with the bundle monster plates. There&#x27;s not really much to say as it&#x27;s either hit or miss, but this product is a hit!  Shipped fast and works like it says; just be sure to clean it after every use with nail-polish remover.</li>
            <li> I have been practiving and reading how to&#x27;s but so far no luck. I clean the product and try to do everything quickly but I just cannot get this stampt to work. I thought it is a selling poind that you can use polish you have in hand but they sell special polish for it so they might want to mension that.  Idk if its worth it to buy their stamping polish at this point....It could be just me though. Everybody seems to like this product</li>
            <li> does what it&#x27;s suppose to for a decent price. shipping was fast. having two stamps is a bonus since you can work with small and larger images.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get it work but I hope to get some more practice with it when I get some time. I bought a ton of plates and tried to use the stamping kit one day, I could get a good transfer on the stamp but I couldn&#x27;t get the stamp on my nail. I love the concept of being able to stamp on all kinds of designs on your nails.</li>
            <li> Tip is too soft to transfer images? I have a different brand and order this to replace and add to my collection and doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a nail specialist probably the reason it didn&#x27;t work for me. But this nail stamp is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is for children nails-the stamper doesn&#x27;t pick up the whole image. Maybe my nails are just too wide. I&#x27;ll keep just because to inconvenient to return.</li>
            <li> This product was a huge let-down. When I first got it, I tried it with some Sinful Colors polishes, and they didn&#x27;t work because the designs barely picked up at all, and when they did pick up a little bit, the result was a very light, almost transparent design on my nails that looked like it was chipping off. However, I decided to give it another try, so I went out and bought some thicker polishes, and still, the design only picks up halfway most of the time, and it is very messy. To me, the result isn&#x27;t worth the trouble of having to paint the plate, swipe it clean, and try picking up the design seven times before you get it right for just one nail. This is time-consuming, messy, and ineffective.</li>
            <li> I bought this with a set of plates and i have only used them once because it is time consuming.  Other than that it is a great buy.</li>
            <li> TAKE INTO EFFECT NONE OF THE CUSTOMER PHOTOS HAVE LONG  NAILS. If you have long nails you aren&#x27;t going to get some of the images across tour whole nail..like zebra print and cheers print for example. It does pick up regular polish just have to be quick at tje process or the Stamper won&#x27;t pick it up cuz it has dried. This didn&#x27;t work for me at first. There&#x27;s more to it than you.think. Very messy and a bit frustrating. First off pitch the scraper and use an old license card. File the ends of the Stamper lightly before first use. Clean the plate and Stamper and card after each apply with acetone remover with a CLOTH not cotton balls. And when scraping use a 45 degree angle. When pressing tje Stamper on plate press firmly but not too firm or too light in a rolling position from the bottom to the top of the image plate then immediately press to nail from side to side roll and not in every direction. Lining it up right is hard. Its a cute idea but I think some of the designs come out crappy looking..need more opaque polished out come.</li>
            <li> The stamper itself works just great. The scrapper I never use because an old credit card or shopping card works the best and doesn&#x27;t scratch the image plate. My only gripe is that since the stamper is red it is difficult to stamp with pinks or reds as you can&#x27;t see it on the stamper pad. White might be better but then you couldn&#x27;t see white polish.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for the stamper \\&quot;as seen on TV\\&quot; and the ones for the Konad, I opted to go with the Konad as a birthday gift for my teen.  We were not disappointed at all! It was easy for her to use even the first time, her nails turned out beautifully.  I agree with the other reviewers who have said the double-sided stamper is worth it.  If you have smaller hands/fingernails, it is definitely nice to have the option of the smaller side.  So happy, I might even order a second one!</li>
            <li> This is the first stamp we have purchased and I don&#x27;t think we have to look any further!  Love iT!</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and again my daughter loved it. her friends started stamping nails as soon as they figured out how to work it. no one reads directions anymore!</li>
            <li> best stamper for a beginner! But I don&#x27;t recommend the scraper as it will scratch your plates.</li>
            <li> It took awhile for this product to be delivered. I had to wait almost two weeks. It took some trial  and error to figure out how to use the product and a few YouTube videos, however I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> The stamper is awesome! I just got my first stamper and it is easy to use. No problems what so ever and I am glad that I have 2 sizes to choose from with the stamper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try stamping for a long time, the price on the konad stamper was fantastic and I took the plunge in buying this and 25 MASH plates. I made sure to purchase the stamper from a seller that had amazon fulfillment, especially because of some of the reviews that reported receiving knockoffs. I received the Konad brand and didn&#x27;t need to do any prep work to it (i.e filing) to get it to pick up the polish. I&#x27;m so glad I went for a double sided one, I can&#x27;t imagine trying to perfectly place the single designs perfectly with the large side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stamper and plates arrived the same day, so I immediately used them, and I LOVE IT! It&#x27;s a little messy and you waste a bit of nailpolish but my nails come out so cute! I really only had one hiccup and I don&#x27;t know if it was the plates or the stamper or the polish, or maybe it&#x27;s just a general learning curve but certain designs required different amounts of pressure in order to pick them up correctly. larger ones needed much less pressure or else the polish smudged, and designs with tiny lines required much more in order to fully pick it up, the mix between the two are really hard, such as the paw print, I was often either not picking up the little toes or was smudging the center of the paw pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m already dying to buy more plates and more polish colors!</li>
            <li> this stamping set is perfect!! there are some stampers that are a little shoter and in m opinion are harder to use this one is perfect and has duel sides a small and large!</li>
            <li> While I refuse to spend the outrageous amounts to buy Konad-brand plates, it truly is best to buy this stamper as opposed to a knockoff.    I&#x27;ve had my stamper for 9 months and used it dozens of times and cleaned it over and over again and it might as well be brand new.    To anyone buying their first stamper, do NOT immediately file the stamper. My stamper required absolutely no filing, it worked straight out of the package.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get this product to work. It doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;Seem to have the sticky residue to pull the stamp from the plate</li>
            <li> It works! I love it. Some stamping colors don&#x27;t show up on the stamper such as: pink&amp;red but that&#x27;s a given since the stamper end is pink! Other than that the stamper works great.</li>
            <li> If you have the patience to stamp, and even more patience to clean up, then these tools are fun to use. I was worried about whether or not it really works, and it does. It does depend on which stamping plate you are using. Large patterns pick up veerrrryyy easily, thin patterns, not so much. but it&#x27;s good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Almost 6 months later)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it as much as I&#x27;d like to, but this is tool that has changed the way that I can do my nails sometimes. I think it&#x27;s remarkable and it works great.</li>
            <li> great stamper and scraper. It stamps very clean and just wipes away excess polish.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been getting into nail art recently. first attempting to do my own and create different designs...but as usual my left hand would look lovely and the right one was a mess.&lt;br /&gt;i decided on the stamping kit and i&#x27;m completely happy with mu purchase. there&#x27;s no big deal about it, it&#x27;s just a two-sided rubber stamp and a metal scrapper.&lt;br /&gt;the polish gets picked up pretty great and if the scrapper ever rusts or gets lost you can always use a credit card or something similar to scrape the polish.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
            <li> It does what I need it to do but the scraper scratches my mash plates (minor ones). Not bad not great.</li>
            <li> I personally have not had a good experience with this product I bought one for myself and my daughter got one &amp; she wasn&#x27;t able to get any good results as well.&lt;br /&gt;I felt bad because I based it on the product review I read,if any of you have had a good experience with this product and is able to share it with us then please feel free to help us with any good suggestions or tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> we use this item all the time works very well</li>
            <li> This one worked perfect without have to do all the prep work (washing, filing, etc.) !</li>
            <li> Nice stamper for beginner stampers like myself!!!</li>
            <li> Just received this and tried it.. its very good and arrived early so I give it a 5 star.. I don&#x27;t use acetone to clean it just scotch tape.. im very happy with my purchase thank you.</li>
            <li> This stamper is almost perfect!&lt;br /&gt;The scrapper is great, you just have to use it carefully to avoid scratching your plates, do not use too much force against the plates and that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;About the stamper, the pink bigger side works great and has the perfect texture, but I decided to stop using the green smaller side because the texture is a little harder and I don&#x27;t know why the tiny patterns doesn&#x27;t stick on it so well as they do on the pink side.&lt;br /&gt;Even so, I give it five!</li>
            <li> I have only had this brand and it worked fine, so I have to say that I like it just fine.</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to use and clean. I definitely recommend getting the double end stamper. It fits well in your hand and it is nice to have several sizes to choose. I bought 2 sets and paired them with the 25 disc set (here on Amazon)for my friend and me. Nails look great and fun designs without having to purchase those stickers. I can&#x27;t wait to try it with the gel polish for longer lasting designs.</li>
            <li> this makes konad/ bundle monster stamping so easy the small side lets you be more persice and the large side lets you cover the whole nail</li>
            <li> I like the stamper it works pretty well. But i found that using a old credit card or id works alot better then the scraper. But over all i liked this product.</li>
            <li> Been wanting one of these kits for a very long time!! I am so excited to finally have one. They take a lot of time off of nail art work. If you love doing your nails pretty, DEFINITELY get one of these!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love my Konad stamper!  I read all the various tips that people submitted, which made all the difference. Now I do my and my middle school daughter&#x27;s nails almost every week.  Can&#x27;t believe how fast it goes (I can stamp all of ours in under 10 min), and everyone assumes we&#x27;ve gotten them professionally done!  :-)</li>
            <li> Glad it came how it looks! Sometimes you never know. I love this brand for nail art! Works great! Thanks</li>
            <li> The two sizes on the stamper is very useful/helpful, but the scraper damages the plates - just use an old credit card instead.</li>
            <li> So far it is my wife&#x27;s favorite stamper and scraper.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous trying this for the first time! I heard how you have to get good ones or else they wont work very well and many times people give up!&lt;br /&gt;This one had good reviews and a good reputation! So I gave it a try! It works really well! It took a little pratice but I am getting it! :)</li>
            <li> I have used several nail art products but Konad is by far the best! It&#x27;s good quality, the nail color sticks perfectly to the rubber stampers and works perfectly on the nails. If you&#x27;re a nail art person or are just starting out this is the product to use!</li>
            <li> Nice idea to decorate your nails with some awesome designs!</li>
            <li> hey! so i heard this was great, and shipped fast, but mine still has not come!the polish and plates have already come though! i hope its worth the wait!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- this is a revised review of the product. This product is well worth it! it works great after you have practiced a few times. A tip you may want to use is to rub the rubber part on carpet before use, this helps the image to stick. enjoy!</li>
            <li> Stamper works great!&lt;br /&gt;I had bought a set of plates that came with a stamper and that one sucked. This one works just fine with the plates.</li>
            <li> The double ended stamper is great! The green end is perfect for single detail items and easy to maneuver. The large red end is great for full nail designs. The scraper is great - you need to make sure you clean it well ( the nail polish will get stuck in the little holes that hold the metal in place ) I used nail polish remover and a q tip and it worked just fine. I have seen on youtube that you can use a razor blade too, I opted against that since it will scrape your discs easily. The konad scraper is not as sharp therefor it doesn&#x27;t cause the damage a razor blade would cause.</li>
            <li> I had the one-sided stamper, and it was frigging hard to do smaller designs... especially since my hands/nails are already really small. This made it easy!</li>
            <li> We received the Konad timely and my daughter is very pleased.  We all have beautiful nails and get great compliments.</li>
            <li> A little on the cheap side, but using the right nail polishes is the key to this product working half as good as it&#x27;s supposed to. The price was fair, so if it&#x27;s something you want to try or for a teenager to use if you&#x27;re not ready to go all into getting the actual product that started it all, this could be a backup.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get any polishes to stick to it. I&#x27;ve tried several brands.</li>
            <li> LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE this stamper! its light, the stamp molds to your nail and cleans wonderfully. If you want the best stamper def. go with this one, works well with all brands of plates! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> My daugther loved this it was a great gift for her. She plays with it every night thank you so much</li>
            <li> I have used other stampers and scraper and have the Konad to be the best.  I am very pleased with this product and feel that is a quality material and well made.</li>
            <li> Love it! Came 2 weeks earlier than the given date. Good quality. Smaller applicator/rubber end is extremely convenient.</li>
            <li> This made stamping so easy and fun to do.  It cleans up very nicely and the price was decent.  My daughter and I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> This stamper and scraper are a great way to start with nail stamping.  If you&#x27;re planning to stamp a lot in pink or red, you may want to consider the single sided stamp with the white surface.  It&#x27;s tough to see pink polish on a hot pink stamper!  The green end is nice for more precise placement of smaller accent images.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old niece found it difficult to use the way it should be.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a product fault or just her age.</li>
            <li> works great after buffing the end a little, even my 13 year old uses it. Definitely recommend getting stamping polish though most standard polishes we try wont show up well.</li>
            <li> So let me start with saying this is so easy it&#x27;s easy to get it wrong at first. I was so excited to use this. I saw others use just regular nail polish so I didn&#x27;t buy the Konad. Well when I when to use it first I just couldn&#x27;t get it to transfer on the stamper. So I ran to the store to buy a polish that I thought was &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34;. Well that didn&#x27;t work either. I gave up and ordered the Konad online and waited for it to come. When it came I tried it again and still nothing! So I knew for sure it was me that was doing something wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What no one tells you online is that you have to press lightly onto the stamp for the color to transfer. Then press firmly when applying it to your nails. Each with a side rolling motion. Start from one side and roll to the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still working on the technique, but now that I get how to do it it&#x27;s just a matter of time before I&#x27;m a pro at this. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So remember everyone press lightly to get the design off the stamp and press firmly to press onto the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun and Enjoy!!!</li>
            <li> I love how there&#x27;s two sides to this, it gives you more control when you use the small end for little stamps. It  picks up the polish great, and as long as I work quickly it transfers perfectly.</li>
            <li> Having never done nail art before, I bought this kit and some stamping disks and off to do my nails I went! This is such an easy process to do. Unfortunately, the scraper didn&#x27;t work really well, so I ended up using an old credit card to do my scraping instead. Otherwise, things went very smooth, and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> In the begining I could not figure out how to make them work. Now, I know how (you need to clean the plate really fast and use the scraper in an angle. They are great together (all the products that I purchased). Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really think this is a quality product and I would buy it again. Really good!! Loved IT! So happy I got this!</li>
            <li> I love this stamper, it&#x27;s works flawlessly after just a few practice runs. I do not, however, use the metal scraper, I use a plastic credit or gift card so my plates don&#x27;t get scratched. This is an excellent product at an amazing price!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for small fingers. Makes it very easy when I am doing my daughters nails and my toe nails.</li>
            <li> If you are getting the art image plates from Konad, this tool is a MUST HAVE!  this is what make the magic happen on your nails &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. I bought it years ago and it still works great!</li>
            <li> I already owned a Konad stamper, but got this to solve 3 problems. 1) My daughter&#x27;s nails are tiny, so this makes stamping &amp; clean-up much easier. 2) My pink &amp;/or red designs are much easier to see on the green stamper 3) We can stamp multiple designs in rapid succession now that we have 2-3 stampers, as you do not have to clean 1 ea. Time. The reason I gave it 4 stars vs. 5 was that one of the rubber stamps popped off the 2nd time I used it.  Superglue should fix that.  Great product for anyone...especially my 8 year old &amp; me who are mildly addicted to our\\&quot; professional looking\\&quot; at home mani &amp; pedis</li>
            <li> This product worked great with my new Konad stamp stencil. The scraper seems a bit small and so with a few swipes of cleaning the polish off the stencil you have to clean the scraper otherwise it will stain or clump that whole bottom area. Other than that it does the job.</li>
            <li> I thought about buying a Konad stamper for quite some time (at least 6 months) and finally decided to do it. I took others advice and \\&quot;roughed up\\&quot; the stamper just slightly with my nail file before using it, since I was worried about the reviews of people having problems. On my first try I was delighted to get it just right! It&#x27;s a bit time consuming having to clean after every stamp to remove the polish from the plate, scraper, and any from the stamper, but it&#x27;s certainly worth it. This was way easier than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> This is my very first experience with stamping. I&#x27;m loving it so far. Still trying to find inexpensive polishes that work well with the plates but other than that I love this little doohickey and will never lose track of it. :-)</li>
            <li> The stamper &amp; scraper does a real good job, I just had to learn how to use it the right way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how they do it, but it&#x27;s MAGIC!! You paint on the image plate with the konad special polish, scrape the excess off, dab the stamper on it, and PRESTO the image is ready to apply to your nail! All you then do it roll the image on your nail and you&#x27;re done!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve ever tried the nail decals you know how bothersome and messy they can be, this is a great alternative to those! The double sided stamper is great because it has the larger side for full nail images, and the smaller side for smaller images so you can get a more precision application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI- something I did not know which I was surprised with, is that the rubber stamper part itself comes out! Which is great for cleaning bc sometimes the ink can get all over! I was super happy with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there are others out there that are cheaper, but I think the quality of this item is well worth the (I think it was 5 something with shipping)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy stamping!</li>
            <li> I like the stamper, but not the metal scrapper. The smaller, green stamper is obviously great for smaller images, but I like using it for the precision and control it gives me while placing images. I don&#x27;t use this stamper that often, however, as I&#x27;ve found others I enjoy more from other companies. I don&#x27;t like the metal scrapper because it leaves a lot of scratches on nail plates, another obvious fact, but one I dislike nonetheless; so, I actually use a different scrapper to protect the quality of my stamping plates. I recommend using a different scrapper if you make this purchase, but the stamper itself is a good one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of nail stamping - discovered it from a kiosk in a shopping mall. I bought a set from the kiosk; was really having a tough time making it work (this kit came with the little shorty nail stamper with only a pink end). Saw this stamper and decided to give it a try since it was so inexpensive.  Makes all the difference in the world! If you&#x27;re trying to use a red or pink to stamp with, the green end on this is absolutely great - allows you to see the stamp image. This stamper also seems to have a \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; quality to it that lets it pick up the stamp and transfer to your nail much easier.   Strongly suggest anyone wanting to try nail stamping get this stamper!  **Edit to add**   I forgot to mention the scraper that also comes with the stamper - that&#x27;s because I find as several others have said, that an old gift card is much easier to do the scraping with. So now I have an extra scraper. The stamper is what I was after here.</li>
            <li> I love how i can use the small side for small designes, and the big side for the big ones. It is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love my stamper set, it works just like it is supposed to and looks just like the picture. I was able to start using it right away and I am very pleased! Great Seller.</li>
            <li> Bad Life Choice.  Did not work well and sadly, will never use.</li>
            <li> This product is meant for someone who has a flat-ish nail bed. If the image has a lot of detail, it does not pick it up. I also miss the outside edges of my nail because I have a curved nail bed.</li>
            <li> I purchased the one that was fulfilled by amazon, because i heard a few people in reviews getting fakes. This was shipped to my home in 2 days! The product is as described and the stamp works perfectly. The only thing i didnt like about this was the metal scraper, when using image plates to stamp you dont wanna use a metal scraper or else it would scratch your plates (doesnt effect images though). This item wouldve made me even more happier if it came with the plastic scraper instead of the metal. Overall, recommended for everyone who wants to start nail stamping and loves to have fun!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this, and rightfully so; I used this stamper with Shany stamping plates and, with a little practice, it worked very well. The only thing that could improve this is if it also came with a square stamper, since that might make it easier to precisely position square-shaped designs. Some people have suggested using an old gift card instead of the scraper. I don&#x27;t know if that works, but the scraper worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> The stamp is easy to use and I have gotten a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> This nail stamper was very easy to use and very easy to clean in between stamps. I found that I just had to swipe my stamper across my paper towel to clean off left over polish. I don&#x27;t really use the smaller side because the larger side is just so much more efficient, but more power to you if you think you need it. :)</li>
            <li> A lot of people have posted they have issues with this product..... and I&#x27;ll be honest, I did too at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does exactly what it says it does though. Here&#x27;s a few troubleshooting steps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. STOP PRESSING SO HARD! I for one was seriously over thinking this! I was pressing really hard, and instead of picking the polish up, it was just pushing it further in to the plate. all it takes is a normal to light amount of pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. if it still doesn&#x27;t work, file it down a little bit with a rough file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That should be all it takes to do the trick.</li>
            <li> Not like the real one from TV had to buy the one from the TV which does work not unlike this one...</li>
            <li> Received this product and some of the stamps.  Attempted several different designs and none of them worked.  The scraper worked and the stamper...well some times I got the polish on it and then it wouldn&#x27;t transfer to my nail.  Guess i&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
            <li> This was a great way to allow me to have several friends together to do a nail spa day without having to purchase an expensive kit. I really like the double side to print small and large prints. The smaller side allow for more accurate prints on small nails.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This is extremely easy to work with, we started doing our own nail art and this set makes professional results even for me with no training I just watched videos online</li>
            <li> LOVE the whole stamping \\&quot;thing\\&quot;. The double-ended stamper is the way to go. I bought 2 for my daughter, so if a friend wanted to stamp with her, they could. Ditch the scraper that comes with it - a gift/credit card is so much better. The company should even stop making them and save themselves some $$ by putting in a \\&quot;gift\\&quot; card instead.</li>
            <li> GREAT QUALITY, A+,item as described.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for the stamping plates....and it works so well!!  The final results are awesome and look great!</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying nail stamping. It took some practice and getting use. But the product itself works very well and I&#x27;m pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> I think this would be a good gift for a little girl, so easy a kid could use it. It&#x27;s great for fun nail designs if you&#x27;re not that great doing them yourself. As I mentioned, easy to use and a lot of fun. The designs always turn out looking awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have had with this product is cleaning. The stamper is easy to clean, and you can peel off the polish, easy, but the scraper is a PAIN to clean. Even when wiped off right away, and nail polish remover a little polish always gets stuck in the holes or some small crevice-- never to be removed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cool product, just wish it was easier to clean. I think if you use this regularly you&#x27;ll need to buy a few sets.</li>
            <li> Excited to use this with the group of design plates. The dabber is a good size and easy to  hold onto and not bulky so you can control it when you roll it over you nail.</li>
            <li> it is a great product, very practical to use, easy and looks very nice!! Stongly recommended to everyone that wants one.</li>
            <li> Very difficult for use.! I never recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the second scraper and stamper that I bought to work with my Shany image plates.  I was so frustraed with the credit card method and the Mash stamper/scraper I almost gave up.  Then I started reading the reviews of this combination and decided $6 was the last amount I was going to spend to attempt this, and what a difference the quality in the material and results you get!  Before I could not get the plate to scrape clean, there was always too much polish left behind to pick up - multiple scrapes didn&#x27;t work either.  First time I tried the Konad scraper I was floored!  Then the stamper picked up the image and transferred it perfectly the first time.  I am so happy I bought this set, there are many nail designs in my future!</li>
            <li> Very cool little tool! You definitely need to purchase the special Konad nail polishes in order to make it work, though. Only a few of my 50+ nail polishes would work because they aren&#x27;t thick enough to transfer without drying. With the right polishes, you can quickly and easily give yourself a fancy professional-looking manicure.</li>
            <li> Works just how it&#x27;s supposed to. Stamper is sooo easy to clean. And scrapper works great. Price is awesome for the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Works very well!! This is my first foray into stamping and I&#x27;m already addicted. Easy to use, just look up a few YouTube tutorials first and you&#x27;re golden. Pics are from my first try, only room for improvement but not too bad!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about the metal scraper but it actually works better then the plastic ones that I have, I just hope my plates don&#x27;t get scratched. This stamper works the best out of the other stampers I tried. It picks up the image great and it&#x27;s easy to transfer. I am a beginner but after a couple of tries I had the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I have tried different kinds of stampers and this is the very best.  It transfers so cleanly. I&#x27;m not so impressed with the scraper, so I just use an old gift card, instead. The scraper doesn&#x27;t cover much surface area. If I was rating the scraper, I would give it a 2 star.  The stamper I give a 5 star.</li>
            <li> I just bought this to go along with my first konad stamping plate.  I have never done any nail stamping before.  I found it extremely easy to use and got perfect images on the first try!  Its easy to roll across your nails and also very easy to clean.  I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I roughed the surface of the stamper a bit with an emery board so it would pick up the stamping polish better.  I have used the metal scraper without any problem scratching my plates, maybe because it has rounded corners.</li>
            <li> For the price it is well worth it. The stamper is great and I like that it has two different sizes. The scraper doesn&#x27;t work very well but I just used an old gift card and that works perfectly.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS BRILLIANT. DON&#x27;T HAVE TO BE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE. GREAT ITEM TO HAVE ON HAND IN CASE ANY UNSCHEDULED EVENTS POPS UP.</li>
            <li> I just received this today and the shipping was fast! It is a great&lt;br /&gt;product and I&#x27;ll be using it a lot. However, the scraper that came with&lt;br /&gt;mine was a little different than the one in the picture and the top part&lt;br /&gt;of it was not curvy like in the picture. Overall, its great!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Konad products! I immediately discarded the scraper because it scratches the plates and will leave smeared designs, and replaced it with a thin plastic gift card instead.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews thinking I was about to get a lovely, cheap, and fun nail art device. but when it came in the mail, I said to myself, \\&quot;This is it?\\&quot; It was just a flimsy pink piece of plastic. Nothing more. Also, it&#x27;s not functional if you don&#x27;t purchase the stamps and patterns. So in a sense, the company is ripping you off completely. And you only figure that out after you opened the plastic packaging, which means you can&#x27;t return it for your money back. Personally, I would never buy a product like this again.</li>
            <li> the double ends are wonderful..   they sell the one ended stamper but it is sometimes too big for what your design or nail size is   also ive found that each end is obviously a different color. for good reason because if your design is pink.. and you use the larger end you cant really see it .. and vise verse so it seemed logical to go with this one and im very glad i did..</li>
            <li> This item takes practice to master, but is worth the effort once you fet the hang of it. I often get asked where I get my nails done and people are shocked when I tell them that I do it myself. Takes time but us much cheaper then visiting the nail salon!</li>
            <li> So I did a bunch of research on these after i &amp;#34;got burned&amp;#34; buying a cheap one from another site.  Everyone said that this was the best quality, at a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one Konad nail plate and a couple of Monster plates.  I can&#x27;t seem to get this to work.  Either it&#x27;s complete user error on the part of me and my friend, or maybe I need a different shaped stamper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have small, chubby hands.  I find it a little hard to use the larger side with a steady hand.  Coincidently, the larger side&#x27;s &amp;#34;stampy thing&amp;#34; picks up polish from my nail plates better that the skinny side.</li>
            <li> Love love love it!  Two sides makes it able to switch easily.  The smaller side for a smaller konad stamp and the bigger for a bigger one.  I&#x27;ve never tried the one side stamper so I cannot compare them but this works really well!</li>
            <li> This nail stamper is easy to use and great for a beginner nail artist like me.&lt;br /&gt;Two caveats to this stamper: 1) one rubber end is pink, this makes it hard to see if my pink nail polish has transferred cleanly to the pad before I stamp my nails. I can solve this by using the green rubber end, but it is smaller. 2) the rubber pads comes out. This probably makes it easy cleanup but i was surprised that it was just a plug. It does NOT fall out, so don&#x27;t worry.</li>
            <li> This stamping set from konad is fantastically priced and surprising high quality for the price.  I would recommend this set to anyone over any of the others.</li>
            <li> I got my stamper and scraper today n so far I love it. Been playing around with different polishes n most of them seem to work very well. I used Pure Ice and Sally Hansen Xtreme Wear the most. The smaller end is great for partial designs or small designs u want in a specific area of the nail n the big end is great for an all-over design. Took me a few attemps to transer the whole image to the stamper ends from the plate but with me being a first-time user, it got easier with a little practice. It came new in the package and arrived earlier than I&#x27;d expected. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and would reccomend it to anyone who wants to add more design to their nails in a fun and easy way. Don&#x27;t forget the image plates!! :)</li>
            <li> Too hard. get a silicone head from an &amp;#34;Indie&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My stamper wont work. I Just emailed the seller to ask for advice. Weather I use Konad polish or any others I saw on youtube videos NOTHING gets a design on my stamper. Im hoping the seller will reply quickly or Im going to ask for my refund.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to get this stamper to work.  All the tricks only using their paint everything.  And the where I got it from is not willing to work with me.  IM PISSED!</li>
            <li> OK SO BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS I ALSO BOUGHT THE KONAD PLATES WHICH WAS THE 25 PLATES THE STANPER WAS GREAT BUT JUST MAKE SURE THAT WHEN U DO YOUR FIRST STAMP MAKE SURE AFTERWARDS EACH NAIL THAT U CLEAN EACH STAMPING BUT OVER ALL GREAT IDEM U SHOULD BUY THIS VERY GOOD.....</li>
            <li> I only received the scraper and a stamp  Did not receive any stencils. It probably would&#x27;ve been fine if I had received the stencils</li>
            <li> Works great!  After reviewing videos and reading reviews I knew not to use the metal scrapper it came with.  But the stamper itself works awesome, it takes a bit of practice to get the image to line up and look perfect.</li>
            <li> Great product. Definitely rough up the surface a little though. Easy to clean and comfortable to hold.Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new at doing my own nails with anything thing than plain ol&#x27; simple polish, and I love this stamper, it&#x27;s very easy to use. I use the smaller green side for single images, and the bigger pink end for whole nail designs. I would recommend this my friends!</li>
            <li> The stamper works like a charm.  It is a nice size in your hand, and creates a clean image, some nail colors are hard to see if they stamped properly (ex: its hard to see if the stamper picked up the image properly with red or pink colors) sometimes the green size is big enough to solve this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scraper I&#x27;m not so big a fan of.  It has scratched up my plates a bit which im not happy with.  hopefully on the plates I use over and over, there is no damage done that effects the art.  Also the blade is small and can be a little tricky to clean ( think about the fact you might be cleaning it with nail polish remover using your freshly painted nails so your not going to want to get to nitty gritty.) I have seen in videos people using credit cards or plastic plates.  I have not tried this but if it is effective with its duty it seams like it would solve both my problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your curious about this whole stamping process, if you can do it, if the results are easy and look as good then you do it as the pictures posted, go to youtube  there are tons of videos that really helped me decide and teach me some techniques.  I am a total amateur, but right out of the box, my first nails were amazing and I cant stop stamping!</li>
            <li> She loved the idea of being able to do her own nails without having to go outside of her room. Thanks for the great idea of putting this together.</li>
            <li> This little stamper worked awesome, exactly like it was supposed, to no complaints here. Konad is definitely the way to go.</li>
            <li> The stamper works great.  I find that I need to apply two coats of my polish to the plate for the stamper to pick up, but I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly checked the product descriptions and reviews to determine if this was a suitable and complete gift for a young girl.  Nothing I read suggested I had to buy more components to use this product.  I asked for a refund and was given a rude dressing down by the seller.  They reluctantly agreed to give me a refund then cancelled it before I had a chance to ship the product back.  I will never again order anything from this seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally a beginner at stamping and as I was reading reviews, I decided I buy this combo. The stamper is awesome and it works great. Most people keep saying, \\&quot;I use a gift card\\&quot; well I had no one why they kept saying that, until I tried with this scraper. It literally scrapes all the polish off the stamp plate so you have nothing to stamp with. I didn&#x27;t scratch my plates with it. It&#x27;s just easier to use a gift card.</li>
            <li> This Konad Nail Art Double Ended Scraper and Stamper is the best in its class by far! I will not use anything else ever again. The metal on the scraper is very thin, but durable and very smooth so it leaves no scratches at all on my nail plates. The rubber on the stamper is very flexable so it picks up all of the design and deposits it evenly on my nails. I would recommend this product to anyone getting into nail art stamping. Don&#x27;t bother with any other imitation scraper and stamper. You will be wasting your money, just like I did until I took the plunge and paid for the Konad Nail Art Double Ended Scraper and Stamper. I promise you won&#x27;t regret buying this product.</li>
            <li> Konad is probably the best nail stamper out of all of them.</li>
            <li> Love the stamper!  I don&#x27;t care for the scraper, but just as good as other scrapers I have used.  No scraper has ever beat an old credit card.  That works best. :). However, the stamper is great!!  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Works great...delivered in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> the best stamper out of all the ones I have tried. I will be buying these for my daughters as a gift.  I know they will love them.</li>
            <li> This double end stamper works  great,It picks the images very nicely.but its better to use the plastic scraper to avoid scratches on plate..I am using my subway rewards card as a scraper and it works great.You can use any old credit card too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter. She loves to do LOTS of nail art and does an excellent job! This stamper/ scraper is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This works well!  I just have to practice more so I don&#x27;t slide as I use it.  It was easy to use!</li>
            <li> This stamper is GREAT quality, especially for its affordable price!!!! I received much earlier than expected so I was very happy with that, and it&#x27;s overall the best stamping kit I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I were so excited to get this, only to be so disappointed when we used it. The polish would not stick to the stamper. Total let down.</li>
            <li> 100% recommended, this stamper is great for nail stamping is a very functional product and a very good brand, i love it</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews on amazon, I decided to buy this item, and not a bundled package. I&#x27;m glad that I did. I&#x27;m still trying to learn how to use it, but I think as I continue to practice and play, I will get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product! You don&#x27;t need to be a professional to use this, you just have to have patience and practice a couple times. Honestly, I would have paid a lot more for it now that I know how obsessed I am. I even bought one for my 16 year old sister &amp; she&#x27;s having a blast with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had some trouble with the stamp picking up some images, but I believe that was because I used an off-brand image plate &amp; the images just might not be deep enough. I never have that issue when I use a Konad plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scraper works just fine, but like others said, a gift card works just as well and is easier to clean. The small green end is great for smaller images, more control over where you stamp it.</li>
            <li> I was hard at first to get the nail polish on the tamp but all u need is practice it works nice and u can always do your own designs</li>
            <li> This item came fast and it was brand new! The only problem I had was that the rubber came off, but just krazy glue it and your fine!</li>
            <li> its nice nedw and im like it its so grate looking and im happy with it som much  thats whats imcan say</li>
            <li> The stamper works most of the time, but it is not Konad. There is no brand on anything that I could find. It came in a plastic baggie with no text or stickers, not in the plastic packaging as shown in the photo. My set did not come from China. The seller is Lala &amp; Co. and is based in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scraper scratched my plates and doesn&#x27;t work at all. I use a flexible plastic ID card and it works much better.</li>
            <li> Great Stamper! This was the first stamper I purchased for myself. I had no idea how to use it at the time but I figured I would watch videos and ask friends. It was really simple to use for a first timer. The only part that I didn&#x27;t understand was priming the stamper with a lint roller. After I finally did that correctly this stamper has been my go to. Since I have purchased this one, I have gotten many more but this is still my trusted stamper that I use most times. Once it is primed it is very simple to use. I love my konad stamper. The photo I&#x27;ve attached is one of many manicures I did using my konad stamper and image plates.</li>
            <li> The scraper is awesome - you have to have it. But I&#x27;m wondering if a sponge might work better? New to the stamping and wondering what I&#x27;m doing wrong.</li>
            <li> do my nails different for work and people just love how it looks. they ask if i went to a salon</li>
            <li> The stamper is great, picks up images well, is easy to clean, and I appreciate the two sizes. Use this frequently and it does a great job! Was perfect for me as a beginner stamper with short nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scraper; however, is abysmal. Don&#x27;t even let this touch any of your plates. It may scratch them and does not scrape well at all, forcing multiple scrapes. Just use an old gift card or other plastic card you no longer need instead. Trust me, it makes stamping MUCH easier.</li>
            <li> I like that I can purchase this item without having to purchase a kit of some kind. I just needed the scraper.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully! I would recommend the stamper to my friends! I have been playing with the stamper since I got it earlier today and its easy to use and a lot of fun.</li>
            <li> I am changing my review cause the stamp started to work with the KONAD nail polish! I am happy with the results now!</li>
            <li> I do nails for a living I ordered this stamp and it does not work!! I have tried different nail polish and still doesn&#x27;t work it leaves half the stamp on the nail and is very light in color no matter what u use! Have had no luck getting a refund either!! waste of money and time!!!</li>
            <li> This is a stamper set that has no design.  In order to use it you must purchase a design plate separately.  This is not clear in the description</li>
            <li> I am happy with this item. I didn&#x27;t use the scrapper cuz I didn&#x27;t want scratch marks on my plates.</li>
            <li> The stamper as well as the plates are very hard to get a clean design on your nails. My daughter and I have tried numerous times and it is not consistent at all. Save your money and get something that works.</li>
            <li> ok, i got my stamp in less then a week. easy order fast shipment. like with the plates, it hard to find nail poish that will pick up. unless you order the konad polish very $$$$$. i have tried sale hasen pick up some. you need to clean with nail polish and scratch the top with a nail file.</li>
            <li> I got so much compliment from using this product and it works well whether you are doing large or small designs. My designs always come out well, but the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the scraper because it&#x27;s so small and difficult to clean, polish gets stuck in the grooves and it&#x27;s annoying to get rid of but otherwise I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love love love these products. I purchased a small set at one of those carts in the mail in las vegas. When I got home I thought I got scammed because I lost the little scraper thing and couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use them. I&#x27;m so happy that I found these tools on here and with practice I&#x27;m getting pretty good at using them. There&#x27;s lots of free tutorials online that help get you started. You def need some practice but its fun to get creative with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this exact Konad stamper and scraper for about 3 months.  It works like a charm. In fact, I haven&#x27;t purchased any type of special polish, i&#x27;ve found regular polish actually does the trick.  Some of course don&#x27;t show up as dark as others but that&#x27;s not because of the stamper performance.  Only warning--- I love using acetone to take off my polish because I&#x27;m a glitter girl and it&#x27;s difficult to take off glitter with non acetone polish.  Well, acetone gradually eats away at the padding of the stamper. Make sure to keep around some non-acetone polish remover when cleaning the stamper or scraper.  I have 200+ polishes, nail blog, and have used many products- this I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good Stamper and scraper. Some of the stamps came off easy and some were&lt;br /&gt;not so easy. Overall its a good set for a good price.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend and she loves to stamp her nails and all kinds of things that she wants to make look cooler.</li>
            <li> i did not like it at all&lt;br /&gt;i thought it was better than that&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t buy it&lt;br /&gt;it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> This is just what i was expecting. both parts came ahead of time, in their original packaging, and in perfect;y good shape, and make nice, clean nail polish stamps, and at a great price!</li>
            <li> Works great once I used my nail file to scratch up the end.</li>
            <li> Love it. Nice and wide. Great price!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use my first time</li>
            <li> Excellent product i highly recommend very good.i loved it. What we wanted. Very good everything I expected. comprenlo - guaranteed.</li>
            <li> Great my wife loves it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally inexpensive for the value you obtain for it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a very smart purchase, I hope we can do business in future</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not working as well as i would have predicted..i didn&#x27;t buy the monad polish and it seems that the regular polishes don&#x27;t stick to the transfer well</li>
            <li> I use a lot of warm colors on my nails so the bigger end of the stamper, which is a dark pink, makes it really hard to see the designs in order to line it up with my fingernail. I didn&#x27;t think this would have been an issue, but now that I have used it a bunch of times, I wish I would have spent more time looking at the white/clear stampers.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my Konad and other image stamping plates, and found that I love the dual sided stamper. It is perfect for full nail designs and for small detail designs! The scraper, however, leaves something to be desired. It scratches my plates and compromises the crispness of my images. I found that using a credit card is much better both for image crispness and for the plates!</li>
            <li> not good,do not waste your money and time</li>
            <li> This was recommended by several You Tube nail art tutorials. I couldn&#x27;t find it locally and was thrilled to get it here :-)</li>
            <li> good stuff, does a great job with picking up the patterns off the plates big or small. I would reccommend.</li>
            <li> It took my a few tries, but I finally got the hang of using this product.  You must use a bold/metallic color when stamping in order for the designs to appear.</li>
            <li> So many other rubber stampers have some imperfection or texture that will leave your stamp looking not-as-nice as it could.  Not this one!  Polish transfers seamlessly, there are no grooves for polish to get trapped in (or leave that texture on your stamp to drive you CRAZY), and the finished product looks nice.  It works much better than any free stamper that may come with your plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said - you&#x27;re only paying for the stamper, and that&#x27;s worth it.  The metal scraper WILL scratch your metal plates - throw it away and use an expired credit card or used up gift card - i.e. plastic that won&#x27;t scratch your beautiful (and potentially pricy) plates.  As an added bonus, it&#x27;s far easier to remove excess or dried up polish from a card than it is the nooks and crannies of the scraper.</li>
            <li> Had to rough up the surface of the stamper (couple of swipes with an Emory board).</li>
            <li> My stamp wont really pick all of the image</li>
            <li> Love this set.  The only thing is that the pink side caves in and I have to readjust it every time I between stamping.</li>
            <li> First off the shipping was great! Great service. I just started stamping and I love this stamper, I feel like for a beginner I should&#x27;ve bought a squishier stamper. I feel like this one is for the more advance girls that know who to stamp lol</li>
            <li> first i bought the other pack &amp;#34;as seen on tv&amp;#34; from walmart i forgot what it&#x27;s call but it&#x27;s the purple pack. DId not stay on well or appy on nicely. Then I saw this konad pack and bought it. WOrks much better, the way it should</li>
            <li> First off, I rate the shipping 1 star. It arrived in about 2 weeks time.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it takes quite a bit of hassling with the stamp to actually get it to pick up the image from the plate and then to transfer it to your nails without smudging or half transfers...&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, it is quicker and easier to pain onto your nail free style...</li>
            <li> Lol i was so happy that this can in today b/c i was waiting for this so i could use the ne shanty plates i bought &lt;3 it works great so i give it 5 stars. I am very happy with this stamper and scraper if anyone needs one you should buy this.</li>
            <li> Love this stamper, takes a few tries to get the hang of it but can make the cutest nails ever</li>
            <li> takes practice to get the hang of it but i loved it my friends all want me 2 do their nails after they saw mines!</li>
            <li> Great product!! Super fast shipping. This item works really well and I highly recommend it! If you&#x27;re into nail art I recommend this product hands down!</li>
            <li> I love stamping my nails, and it works well.  After about 3 uses, one of the stampers fell right off the end. Pretty disappointing....</li>
            <li> Everything is perfect!  I&#x27;m still learning how to use it but I love it!</li>
            <li> Lost it when moving houses and miss it very much. Buying again soon.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE AND HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> This is a great stamper, and I have not had many problems with it. The color of the big stamp is a darkish pink which of course can make transferring pink polish a pain, but that is the only problem that I have encountered with the stamper. As for the scraper, it is metal so I haven&#x27;t used it at all (metal scrapers can scratch the plates), instead I use an old gift card which works out well because it is rather easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I love the stamper!! Works great! For the scraper, I rather use an old credit card so my plates don&#x27;t get scratched.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this product after watching a you tuber do her nails with this. Time after time her nails looked perfect with little effort. I recommend this for anyone and everyone regardless of age. No more hours and money spent at the salon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend watching a tutorial on YouTube before first use. Happy Stamping!!</li>
            <li> We have yet to get this product to work correctly. The materials it is made of seems like quality, however we just can&#x27;t get it to work. We have awesome stamp sets, and I wanted this Konad stamper. It could be the nail polish, but we have tried LOTS of polishes, so I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s this. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I bought this with image discs.  I have found it very easy to use.  The ends of the stamper clean easy and and the scraper works well.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product... have been using it for over a year and no complaints for sure.. Love it!</li>
            <li> I use this all the time with my Cheeky nail stamping plates and LOVE IT! This stamper has two sides that you can use depending on the design and shape of your nail. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now and it still works great.</li>
            <li> I like it. I&#x27;d prefer the rubber be a different color because red is a color I use to stamp with but it&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li> Works just fine but it takes awhile to get use to how it works. Would recommend it for girls who love to do their nails.</li>
            <li> Stamper is really nice with the 2 sizes. It didn&#x27;t pick up the image at first, so I filed it a bit....still didn&#x27;t work, then after watching some videos I popped out the rubber piece and warmed it up in my hand a bit then it worked great.</li>
            <li> I use this stamp, but not the scraper. Mainly do to reviews that old gift cards work better. I have not tried any other stamps, but also have no desire to. I&#x27;m happy with this.</li>
            <li> I love this stamper so much!! I love that it has a smaller end. I do need to prime it with a file pretty frequently, but overall not that big of a deal. I don&#x27;t like this scraper very much for a few reasons. It is kinda awkward to hold, it is metal and scratches my plates, and it has quite a few nooks and crannies which make it impossible to get clean without practically soaking the whole thing in acetone. I much prefer using old gift cards to scrape instead.</li>
            <li> Same product, MUCH better value.  Don&#x27;t waste your money at retail stores or kiosks when you can just get online for much less.</li>
            <li> Great stamper! Of course I had to clean and file the ends with a nail file to rough them up a little before it would work well, but that&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a noob to stamping but this stamper is super easy and convenient to use. I have had little issues using it to pick up polish - sometimes it won&#x27;t but I haven&#x27;t figured out if its the stamp issue or just a mistake on my part. It&#x27;s rare though and it works 99% of the time. Easy to clean and the small end is perfect for my pinky nail or smaller stamps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to nail stamping. I ordered this because it was a recommendation on several stamping videos. I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but will condition it as the videos tell you to, by lightly sanding with an emery board (nail file). Item shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Good quality fun to try new techniques feels good in your hand well balanced I would recommend</li>
            <li> does the job. picks up the paint pretty good, but sometimes needs sanded a bit for more grip.</li>
            <li> stamper works really good!</li>
            <li> Not happy  that the metal scraped my stencils. I now use my plastic scraper. The stamper works great though.</li>
            <li> Love the quality of the stamp.Very convenient that it&#x27;s two ended. Easy to clean. The image is sharp. The scraper is ok</li>
            <li> The scraper scratches plates.</li>
            <li> I love this stamper, I have learned how to double stamp with it, so that my whole nail is covered. The scraper will scratch your plates though.</li>
            <li> Works really well!! Just as expected from comparing and reading other peoples&#x27; reviews. Costs about as much as a bottle of nail polish so its worth it, because it&#x27;ll outlast any bottle of polish.</li>
            <li> Before I got this one I had tried 2 others what a wast of money they were.  I was wanting something now and did not want to wait 2 weeks for this one to come in. Well you live and learn. After the first 2 were flops I finally broke down and order this one waited 2weeks for it to come in and wow it works great</li>
            <li> This set is easy to work with. Like previous reviewers said, nail polish gets stuck in the scraper, but its easy to clean by soaking it in remover for a few minutes, wiping it off, and getting into the nooks and cranies with a tooth pick. The scraper does scratch the plates, but I tried using a card like other reviewers said and it didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> good for the price i like this product will recommend for any one that like do it at home art for nails</li>
            <li> This stamper is great! Super easy to use, even for beginners. I&#x27;ve heard some people have a hard time but I had no issues. The stamper picks up and transfers images with ease. I use it all the time!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to go with the plates I purchased earlier, and exactly what was advertised came. Even though it was late I still received it within a reasonable time.</li>
            <li> Love this and have used it several times with my daughter.  Can&#x27;t wait to have a little down time to use again.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would recommend is that you use a plastic ė grift card instead of the metal b/c the metal can scratch the image plates</li>
            <li> The stamper works well with practice, you don&#x27;t need to file it down. However it does take practice. The scraper doesn&#x27;t work as well as an old gift card.</li>
            <li> The scraper is cheap-feeling, and has left a few very shallow scratches on my plates, although that doesn&#x27;t seem to have affected the designs I&#x27;m stamping. I&#x27;m concerned how that will last over time. The little holes that hold the metal tend to collect nail polish, and are difficult to clean. The plastic feels cheap, but so far, it&#x27;s done what I need it to. The stamp itself is great, and super easy to use, and easy to clean.  It makes great stamps!</li>
            <li> its awesome it was better than the one i had before i purchase this one. I always use this one. and i do recommend.</li>
            <li> Great little stamper, really like that it is a simple yet a great tool for giving your nail a bit more.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my nails for about 10 years now, and not just plain polishing. I like to do hand painted designs, gems, studs, glitter, you name it. This stamp system is so fun and unique. I get more compliments on my nails than ever before, and always bring it with me when I visit friends or family. It&#x27;s a huge hit. Easy to use, easy to clean, easy to store or travel with. Any one can use it, even children.</li>
            <li> Came in quick works great haven&#x27;t had a single problem with it</li>
            <li> i like this stamp better than any of the others that i have tried. make sure not to press down too hard on the design as the more gentle you are the better it will work. also work fast, as the polish dries really fast. the scraper thing is also better than most.</li>
            <li> this is like one of those things you see on a commercial but when it arrives, it doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Hard Stamper.  Better for acrylic nails, not natural nails but does pick up the images great.</li>
            <li> The stamps are not very deep - had trouble getting clear stamps. Regular nail polish does not work well at all.</li>
            <li> Package was exactly as shown (as of today&#x27;s date). Using the stamps is a mixture of acquired skill and the quality of the plate. Generally speaking it picked up and released designs/polish quite well, but there are times when it won&#x27;t pick up the design without extra pressure, which results in extra polish outside the design and a potential mess. The polish cleans off easily with polish remover. The scraper, while conveniently included, was not an absolute necessity as a well-maintained ID/credit card would have served the same purpose.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t settle and buy a diff brand bc it&#x27;s cheaper! I did and regret not just buying the konad stamper first. Clean stamping the scraper works great!</li>
            <li> Works great it just takes practice to get the whole stamp on nicely.  Don&#x27;t give up keep practicing and you will have beautiful nails without paying to get them done.</li>
            <li> The stamp does not pick up the ink to transfer.  It was a waste of time and money.  I threw it away within a week.</li>
            <li> This is the first stamper I&#x27;ve ever purchased and the only one I will purchase in the future.  I filed it lightly before I used it and it worked perfectly from the very first stamp!  It arrived quickly and works beautifully.  Best 6 bucks I&#x27;ve ever spent!</li>
            <li> It was my first time using nail art and I found it to work well. I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of it, but I know I will with more practice.</li>
            <li> With all of the raving about this product I expected it to be better. I could hardly get an image on the stamp.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a stamper a while back from Walmart and there is not a difference in quality.</li>
            <li> THis thing is so cool!!! I bought a knock off one last summer and omg what a crappy device. I decided to get the original Konand along with a sheet of stamps and it is pretty amazing! I like that it is double ended for smaller or bigger nails. I do find that using a credit card is more effective than the little metal scraper they include because 1. The metal scraper will scratch the crap out of your stamping tray 2. It leaves a lot of nail polish behind which will mess up your stamp. Over all, the stamper its self is worth the money but if you have a spare CC that is expired or something, I would use that instead so you don&#x27;t scratch up your stamping plate!</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome! I haven&#x27;t found an opportunity to use the small side since most of the designs I use are larger than that side. The stamp itself is easy to clean, though I&#x27;ve stained the handle with black nail polish, which is difficult to get off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scraper is metal, which ended up scratching one of my plates, unfortunately. I would recommend using a gift card to scrape rather than the one that comes in this kit.</li>
            <li> I had to order in order to do art nail designs. Good product, it get hard at the beginning to use it but with practice you got it. Once you know how to do it, nobody can stop you. One thing, in rode rto attach well the image, you have to clean it every time otherwise, doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Having issues with this specific stamper. Not impressed</li>
            <li> The konad stamper transfers the image from my plates clearly and easily. Make sure to use a thick nailpolish it sticks better to the stamps in general. And using a plastic card keeps the plates from getting scratched. It&#x27;s was worth buying for my nail art collection accessories.</li>
            <li> i have started to do my own nail art and i needed some help on certain prints. now i can do all KINDS of art work on my nails. it works perfectly! (watching step by step videos help)</li>
            <li> This is a Good stamper. Very smooth and picks up designs very easy. The scraper is ok and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I like it but the sponge part on the stamper fell out, poorly manufactured however great for stamping!</li>
            <li> If your doing nail stamping, use konad! Not any other brand, just konad! I&#x27;ve tried every brand under the sun and konad is the only one that works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten more into keeping up with my nails lately and have been trying some off brands of stamping accessories.  Always disappointed so far.  Even with a stamper!  I have a regular Konad stamper which I have used for 4-5 years (a lot) but wanted one with the small end (the reason being is I thought it would make it easier to be more accurate when applying small designs - and this proved true.)  Other brands don&#x27;t hold the paint as well during transfer.  If you&#x27;re considering this versus another brand - go with this if you can afford a dollar extra or whatever.  It&#x27;s much worth it.</li>
            <li> Both the stamper and scraper get the job done and done well. I&#x27;ve had this for roughly a month now and it&#x27;s taken a little practice to learn how to use it but definitely worth it. The key to using them is to keep the surfaces of both clean of polish before stamping with them each time, otherwise it messes with the crispness of the designs. Both ends of the stamper pick up the polishes well and apply the designs evenly. The shipment arrived on time and was in perfect condition. Would definitely recommend this product (:</li>
            <li> This is my first stamper and scrapper set, so far the stamper has worked great I really like it, the problem that I encountered is with the scrapper, it has scratched a lots of my plates (I notice the scratches after a while) so I really do not recommend the metallic scraper. I recently ordered a plastic one from winstonia so I&#x27;ll let you know how it goes with that one.</li>
            <li> They got it to me quickly, the price was great and I love the product.  I would definitely recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This product not only took an eternity to arrive, but does not work. I know others are saying to &amp;#34;watch tutorials online&amp;#34;, but the product should work without a step-by-step instructional. Other stampers I have used in the past work perfectly upon first try, however this one only works about 25-50 percent of the time. Very disappointed since this was a gift for my sister.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I agree with those who say it&#x27;s Konad or Nothing for stamping, but this does work well. However, when using this stamper, roll it across the design on the plate, then roll it across the nail. Don&#x27;t listen to those who say stamp straight down on the plate. With other stampers, maybe. With this one, roll on, roll off! That alone changed my failure rate from 1 in 3 and some designs not working at all, to 1 in 10 attempts not stamping as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best way to clean the stamper: one of those lint rollers that&#x27;s an over-sized cylinder of sticky tape. Works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skip the scraper, it&#x27;s metal and can scratch plates. I use my old AAA card instead.</li>
            <li> Out of everything you need to become a great nailart specialist, or &amp;#34;stamper&amp;#34; this is the one thing there is NO Substitute  for! While you can use different stamping plates or do it free hand, use different brands of nail polish, or use a business or playing card as the scraper the one thing you NEED to become a great nail stamper and can&#x27;t do without is the stamping tool. And you can&#x27;t do any better than the konad brand and I wouldn&#x27;t even try. Whether it is one or two sided the konad stamper is the one item you can&#x27;t do without.&lt;br /&gt;  Some people who are a little timid think it might be easier if they start out by using one of the new sliding &amp;#34;stamping&amp;#34; machines they have come out with. I was one of them. But it actually seemed to make it more complicated and harder to stamp. The best thing is to jump in with &amp;#34;both hands&amp;#34;and start out by using the stamper. You actually have more control over where you put the stamp.&lt;br /&gt;  On the other hand the scraper really isn&#x27;t as necessary or that great. You can use a business card or a playing card and it will scrape off the excess polish just as well or (for me) better than the scraper that comes with this. You need something hard and stiff...um ...preferably not metal. Although metal scrapers work great they also will scratch the stamping plates. The more they get scratched the less of a clean stamping design you get and eventually it will ruin them. The plastic one that comes with this works but it has there are little ridges and corners etc  that collect the polish and even after scraping it,  it&#x27;s still doesn&#x27;t come clean. A lot of people I know like to use plain paper towel to clean off the plates. So I think you&#x27;ll find something that you will prefer over another.&lt;br /&gt;  No matter what you decide to do remember that this is like everything you try to do in life...It takes time and practice to get good at it. Get your kids or grandkids involved, telling them you want to do their nails. They aren&#x27;t as picky about something being perfectly even or straight as we are when we get a little older. Don&#x27;t give up, be patient with yourself and most of all have fun. That&#x27;s the reason for doing this isn&#x27;t it?&lt;br /&gt;  BUT TAKE THE WORD OF AN ADDICTED STAMPER....DONT DO IT WITHOUT YOUR KONAD STAMPER!!! That&#x27;s the one tool you need to guard with your life because without the stamper you just can&#x27;t stamp. Period.n&#x27;t as picky about something being perfectly even or straight as we are when we get a little older. Don&#x27;t give up, be patient with yourself and most of all have fun. That&#x27;s the reason for doing this isn&#x27;t it?&lt;br /&gt;  BUT TAKE THE WORD OF AN ADDICTED STAMPER....DONT DO IT WITHOUT YOUR KONAD STAMPER!!! That&#x27;s the one tool you need to guard with your life because without the stamper you just can&#x27;t stamp. Period.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.  For someone who has short and small nails, this double ended stamper works absolutely perfect for me. I recommend this brand to anyone who is doing nail art. Don&#x27;t buy the cheap drug store kind when you can get this for such a good deal and know that it works!</li>
            <li> I tried all suggestions from other reviews, none worked for us. Product is garbage, wasted our money. Bought dotting tools set and love them!</li>
            <li> First time user for any of the design stuff for nails and this is definitely a keeper! Easy to do on yourself or another person. Directions were clear and simple.</li>
            <li> Product was as described. Easy payment options and quick shippment. I will definately do more business with this vendor in the future.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these in another brand, and the stamper was too hard, and tended to smudge some of the designs.  This stamper is quite a bit better, and I am very pleased!  I have had no issues with this set, and I have used it with several brands of polish, and with several different designs.  This one actually has worked better than I had expected!</li>
            <li> Most of the designs do not come-out or transfer to nail.  The scraper takes off most of the polish.  I&#x27;ve had no success even when using Konad&#x27;s own plates &amp; polish.  It&#x27;s not user friendly.</li>
            <li> I bought this stamping kit and have had no problems other than my own technique failures in properly using the stamping plates.  The rubber ends are easy to clean and are large enough for the designs I use.  The larger end popped off in my suitcase, but luckily I found it - the ends are not glued to the pink stamper body but unless you are tossing this around a lot, there shouldn&#x27;t be any problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scrapper works well with the plates I have.  Cleans well with a cotton and nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to nail stamping and was told this was the best stamper to use.  I bought two of them and they both work fine.  There are two ends.  One for small images and one for larger images.  I haven&#x27;t used the scraper because I prefer the plastic ones, so I can&#x27;t rate it, but the stamper is a good buy.</li>
            <li> The Konad Nail Stamper is a great way to add a little more oomph to your average at-home mani.  It is a bit difficult to get it to work with regular nail polishes (rather than the Konad nail polish).  However, I have found that by using a nail file and brushing it over the edge of the stamper (2 or 3 swipes will do), then cleaning it off with a cotton ball dipped in nail polish, will enable you to use any nail polishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to nail stamping and I find this simple setup fascinating and easy.  The stamper works great and cleans easily.  The scraper is perfect and works way better than a credit card.  I was surprised that this was so straightforward.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and in great condition, we have lots of fun using it, we even have nail parties and share with friends.</li>
            <li> This scraper is so flimsy that it does not do the job and the stamper does not pick up the design properly. Very frustrating and so I am using another stamper and scraper I got in the gold set I ordered from amazon as well.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was great and the seller got it to me way before the expected delivery date. However the actual product is subpar and I wish there was a no star or an icon for a dud.</li>
            <li> This is the first stamper I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s not as soft as I think is necessary. It doesn&#x27;t like to transfer to my nail because my nails are obviously a rounded surface. This is made for flatter surfaces. It&#x27;s also hard to track down the orientation on the stamps you&#x27;re applying. In order to overcome this, I&#x27;m able to use the smaller side for my whole nail. I think I&#x27;m going to try a little softer option.</li>
            <li> Holy moly this was messy!! But the end result was awesome i loved it. At first it wasnt picking up much product from the plate but then i realized i was scraping too hard hence there was no product for the stamp to pick up... Takes some practice but im glad i bout this</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do. I do use a credit card as some have suggested to avoid scratching and scraping up my plates though.</li>
            <li> Very effective, would recommend this to an amateur as its that simple to use. It transfers the design from the plate to the nail so perfectly, its surreal. It easy  to clean too</li>
            <li> This product works great once you know which side to use. the instructions printed on the back of the insert we not that clear. But I did eventually figure out how to use the scraper correctly.</li>
            <li> Works really well, but takes a little while to get the hang of stamping. Look up videos for tips if you&#x27;re new to stamping. Use an old gift card or hotel key card instead of the scraper that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Good product.  The larger end is not soft, so many images don&#x27;t pick up on my CHEEKY plates.  I also don&#x27;t use the metal scraper and not to scrape the nail plate.  I use an old credit card.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I bought the double ended stamper instead of the regular one. Its great having two sizes I can use. Also I recieved mine really fast, it came even before the expected shipping date! Really happy with it!</li>
            <li> This is the best stamper and scraper combo I have used to date.  This picks up images extremely well and cleans up quickly.  Don&#x27;t mess around with cheap imitations, this is the real deal!</li>
            <li> Product is as described. Great stamper and scraper. Scraper is metal and plates are metal, so you will end up scraping your metal plates. As far as I can tell it does not ruin the image on the plate. TIP: Use the Konad nail polish or find a really thick nail polish to transfer the designs. If you&#x27;re using a thin, transparent nail polish, it&#x27;s not going to work. Try use different nail polishes to find the one the works best for you. Sally Hansen&#x27;s Insta-Dry works good for me. This nail art technique takes practice. Your transfers may not be perfect right away. Don&#x27;t give up. It works really good.</li>
            <li> Still the best.  I don&#x27;t use the scraper, old gift cards work better.  I&#x27;ve tried others since and always go back to this one.</li>
            <li> The metal edged scraper will scratch your stamping plate. I would not recommend this at all. Pueen has one with a plastic edged card that works beautifully.</li>
            <li> The stamper works great!! Easily transfers the design and easy to clean. The scraper does seem a bit uneven so when I scrape the nail polish across, it leaves like new where it doesn&#x27;t quite connect to the design. I tried other surfaces just to test and it did it on all of them. Other than that, works great and is super easy to use!</li>
            <li> Stamper broke on first use! Do not buy, it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> it picks up nicely and works very well. I did not need to prime it</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product. Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong but it don&#x27;t work me. Doesn&#x27;t adhere to nail very well:-(</li>
            <li> Idiot proof.  So easy to use.</li>
            <li> Good , came like the photo.</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE this stamper. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stamper. The scraper is useless, but that is easily solved with using an old credit card or gift card. Transfers from the plate to my nail were so easy. And it was very convenient to have the double sides, one for big pictures and one for small pictures. Definitely something I would recommend to my friends and family. The price was pretty nice and it only took three days to get to me.</li>
            <li> This is the best stamper I have seen.  I wore my old one out after a few years of use and was very happy to receive my new one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this stamper to use with Nail Art Stamping plate QA63.  The plate was a disappointment, but this stamper seems to work well enough.  My complaint is that once you get the polish on the stamper, you can&#x27;t tell if you are applying the stamp evenly.  I am considering using a marker to put a dot at the top center of the stamper to help with proper placement.</li>
            <li> Maybe they were out of KONAD brand before but they have them now! After reading some reviews I was worried I would get a knockoff but this is by KONAD and it looks exactly like it is in the picture. Haven&#x27;t tried it out yet but I am confident it will work.</li>
            <li> Still learning how to use properly, but so far I&#x27;m happy with this stamper. It works great, now if I can just get the knack of&lt;br /&gt;transferring the design properly, I figure it&#x27;s a work in progress.</li>
            <li> KEEP IN MIND THIS IS THE STAMP ONLY, YOU HAVE TO ORDER THE ACTUAL FIGURE.IT WORKS WELL, JUST WISH IT WOULD BE FLATTER</li>
            <li> Konad has distinguished themselves with good quality products and this product is a great addition to my stamp collection since it does a fabulous job scrapping the polish and picking up and stamping the image.</li>
            <li> I have a short, one-sided stamper that came with my original plate sets and prefer it for larger patterns simply because I find it easier to hold and place.  However, the small side of this is great for smaller patterns as I can center them on the nail a little easier.</li>
            <li> This what I expected. I already used it for my nail art. Its great for small details when using the konad plates. My nails are small I have small hands so this perfect for the french manicure.</li>
            <li> This stamper doesn&#x27;t pick up on my plates. I was disappointed I couldn&#x27;t do the designs I wanted. I thought when I ordered this I would be satisfied. I am not at all . Not even close. Don&#x27;t waste your $$</li>
            <li> This kit looks cool but does not work very well. The image dries to quickly when trying to put it on your nails</li>
            <li> The best nail art stamping set I have ever tried. (Trust that I have tried about every brand stamper) Simply the best</li>
            <li> Have had this for a long time now. It always works like new. Great starter nail stamping kit.</li>
            <li> I did not really like this as much as I though I would. It felt somewhat cheap and it did not transfer the design onto the finger consistently.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other stamper. And I don&#x27;t think I will give any other ones a chance. Very well put together and holds the stamp extremely well! So easy to apply the stamps. The only set back I have is I wish The ends where white or off white so I can see the red nail polish I use a little better.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Shipped quickly. Works great. Much better price than eBay.  Scraper will scratch plates but doesn&#x27;t affect images.</li>
            <li> I bought a stamping kit but was having issues with the scrapper... This works much better and my nail art looks more professional.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this stamper. I&#x27;ve been told you need to use some really old gloppy polish or get the special polish. I don&#x27;t want to spend any more money on polishes (I have around $500 worth of polish already). When I try to use the stamper with what I already have it leaves nothing on my nails :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a single sided Konad stamper now for over a year and absolutely love it. When my niece expressed an interest in nail stamping, I purchased her one of those kits from Walmart thinking it looked similar and would get the job done. I was very wrong! The rubber is a different texture on the store bought stamper and doesn&#x27;t transfer images completely or clearly. I ended up giving her my single sided Konad stamper instead with the plates that came in the Walmart kit and bought this one for myself to replace mine! Works great, love the two sided design, very easy to hold and easy to see pink and red polishes on the green side.</li>
            <li> This was a disappointment because I bought it mainly for the larger stamper (the red colored one), and it just took a scatter of the design and I tried a lot of them.  I would not recommend at all.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these. and would buy for a friend. works awesome. I can do my own nails and save money.</li>
            <li> I love this stamp pad because you can use the small end for tiny nails. It cleans up easily and transfers the design like a charm.</li>
            <li> i liked this product but now i replaced the scraper with old credit card as it was scratching my plates.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered and it works most of the time.</li>
            <li> No where near as good as i thought it was gonna be.. Wouldnt pick up alot of the images and its not the plates because my other stamper i ordered at the same time as this one picked up just fine.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and original ^-^</li>
            <li> Konad brand is the best stamping kit on the market.</li>
            <li> This stamper works perfectly. I will probably buy another one to have as a back up because it works so well and I have not had as good of luck with some of the other stampers I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Not overly easy to use and very messy</li>
            <li> Works really well, but for some reason the green side it doesn&#x27;t really hold the image that well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over 6 months and I honestly can&#x27;t ask for anything else considering I got exactly what I paid for. What came in the mail was a genuine Konad stamper. I was scared to purchase this and have it be a knock-off but I got the real deal. I ordered this stamper with a set of 25 stamping plates and all my friends are wondering how I got such perfect designs on my nails! For those of you who are having trouble with the scraper not scraping very well... you need to buy stamping polish! Stamping polish is MUCH more thick and sticky than regular polish. You do not need to glob it onto the entire design on the plate, but only a thick strip on the side of the design and when you scrape it, the scraper should spread it over the plate design (I hope that makes sense). This will avoid streaks and frustration!! Of course, you can use regular polish to stamp with, but it will not be as opaque. Some formulas are thicker than others, my best suggestion for a dupe of Konad Stamping Polish is &amp;#34;Sally Hansen Insta Dri WHIRLWIND WHITE&amp;#34; for the white polish and &amp;#34;Rimmel Black Satin&amp;#34; for the black polish. I got these dupe suggestions from a famous nail-tutorial youtuber (elleandish) and they are pretty good replacements if you don&#x27;t wanna spend the extra money. Another tip would be to ROLL on the design (when picking up the design from the plate and also when putting the design on your nails). ROLL ROLL ROLL ROLL ROLL!!!! Also, you want to be QUICK when stamping your nails as you do not want the design to DRY on the stamper! Hope you guys have fun with your Stamper and Scraper, I really do recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this thing. I love the texture of the rubber stamping ends and the fact that it is removable. The ends are squishy and I get nice crisp images with no distortion. Very happy.</li>
            <li> works well and I even used the scraper which left no scratches on my plates at all.  The stamper was smaller than I thought and its easy to hold.  It picked up the black polish (Sally Girl) with ease.  I noticed the stamper was slightly tacky (which is good) and it was not hard on my nails.  I love it! Thank you Konad!</li>
            <li> My daughter like this but not for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Rosie</li>
            <li> I got this done in a salon on my nails and though wow what a cool and simple design, sooooo i jumped on amazon and bought it for myself, the blade is pefrectly flat on the edge for running across the stamping base and the rubber is perfect for putting the design on your nail, no regrets in buying this.</li>
            <li> Item is as described, fast shipping. Great!</li>
            <li> Great quality, the stamper itself is quite easy to use and clean.  The scraper is nice too, easy to hold though harder to clean.</li>
            <li> Difficult to print on nails. Didn&#x27;t work for me or at least it takes a lot of time to do it. Overall, I would not recommended.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work well at all.  I went and purchased the &amp;#34;As seen on TV&amp;#34; stamper and it works well.</li>
            <li> Works great! I love it!</li>
            <li> While the concept is a good one, I have to believe there is a better way. This takes a quick and steady hand. It also probably requires the Konad nail polishes because not every color I had went on smoothly and visibly. Get it if you like experimenting!</li>
            <li> good, convenient and high-quality</li>
            <li> I was super excited when I got my konad stamping kit because I&#x27;ve seen so many youtube tutorials using this and it looked so easy! The shipping came pretty fast which was good. When I got it though I used it on my mom to try it out and it&#x27;s kind of hard getting it exactly where you want on the nail so it  takes a bit of practice. Also it&#x27;s difficult when you have to wait for each coat to dry to make sure it doesn&#x27;t ruin your design so I started using it for my gel nails and it works like a beauty! it&#x27;s soooo much easier than painting your own designs on your nail and getting frustrated that it&#x27;ll not all come out the same!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are really into nail designs and don&#x27;t like the hassle of individually painting each nail then buying this product is worth it!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Best gift for my granddaughter I every bought.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied, a product of excellent quality. I put 5 stars for all categories. I have recommended this product to my friends</li>
            <li> The stamper works great. The ends are soft and pick up images perfectly. I had a little trouble with the scraper but it was user error. Once I got used to it, it works fine. Great product.</li>
            <li> My granddaughters and I are enjoying the nail stamper.  Ensure you purchase nail art or stamp-specific polish.  Did not work with cheap polishes</li>
            <li> I like the double sided design. The large one is perfect for my thumb, and the smaller side is great for my other fingers, especially my pinky. My one problem with this is the scraper. It sometimes doesn&#x27;t scrape evenly across the plates and when that happens it creates a smeared design. I like that it is made out of metal for durability but I think a plastic scraper might work better. I&#x27;ve seen people use a credit card or something similar and am willing to try that. I think it is definitely worth it even just for the stamper and to use something else for the scraper. The double ended stamper is definitely one of the better ones out there.</li>
            <li> Well made, picked up and transferred the designs easily</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t want to splurge on the Konad plates, the stamper is worth it!  I don&#x27;t use the scraper...I use a plastic card, but the stamper is unbeatable!</li>
            <li> Not the best stamper but the plus is it has double sided the bigger side I have found to work better then the smaller and the scraper will leave scrapes and scratches on your nail image plates so be careful if you don&#x27;t use easy you could ruin them</li>
            <li> Necessary tool to work with nail stamps, but watch out when you but, it auto populates 2 in your cart and now I have no idea what to do with an extra one.</li>
            <li> Works great I have mine for over 3 years now, and is still working great!</li>
            <li> Garbage, didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Okay, first off: I am guilty of loving my stamping plates a whole lot.  The scraper is fine to work with, although, the small grooves and holes in it collect nailpolish and need to be cleaned off every few swipes.  IMO, an expired giftcard works just as well and is easier to clean off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, there are no cheap substitutes for the stamper.  I suggest you guard it with your life.  It is flexible and can mold itself onto the nail to ensure a proper image stamp.  The double ended one is perfect for making small adjustment to the nail (eg: the plate image is too small to cover the entire nail) and you have to make a second &#x27;swipe&#x27;.  The stamp end is about 1\\&quot; round.  It cleans up beautifully  with Acetone  and after hundreds of cleanings, still looks new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an FYI, as I&#x27;ve been Konad&#x27;ing for a bit now, instead of the black \\&quot;Konad Special Polish\\&quot;, I have found (after trying 11 different products) that WET &#x27;N WILD black velvet nailpolish is the best.  It costs less than $2 at CVS or WalMart and it is by far the best black out there. I&#x27;ve tried Orly, Chanel, and others, and none of them are this thick and black.  Others are too sheer when you try to stamp them, or they simply don&#x27;t show up on a darker background. I like to do dark blue with a black argyle pattern on them.  Looks great, just don&#x27;t forget your topcoat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the regular stamping polishes... what I have found is that any basecoat color is fine.  Its when you need one to stamp with that you have to be careful.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by others who say that &#x27;any nailpolish will stamp&#x27;.  Well, yes it will, but it may be so faint that it will be a waste of your time.  The best nailpolishes for stamping are ones that have some metallic in them.  Sally Hansen Chrome nailpens are good, but expensive.  I have found that the best stamping polishes are at WalMart.  Yes, PURE ICE nailpolishs in &#x27;Outrageous&#x27; and others stamp up beautifully.  They are thick, quick drying and accurate.  I only use the ones with a bit of &#x27;chrome-iness\\&quot; to them. If you&#x27;re going to put a design on your nail, make it pop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the White polish, Sally Hansen French Tip White is a good one.  White is tricky.  It almost has to be like &#x27;liquid paper&#x27; to get it to work and look right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck, fellow nail afficiandos!.  I only use the ones with a bit of &#x27;chrome-iness\\&quot; to them. If you&#x27;re going to put a design on your nail, make it pop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the White polish, Sally Hansen French Tip White is a good one.  White is tricky.

            <li> One thing I want to say about this product, which as far as I know wasn&#x27;t in any of the reviews, if this is your first time buying a stamper, make sure you look at the tutorial on YouTube and also make sure that you FILE YOUR STAMPER before the first use!! I learned the hard way, I usually like to jump in feet first when doing things so after hours of trial and error, I finally watched a very informational video and got my stamper to work. I first assumed it was defective..lol, Im still learning how to stamp, but of course like all great things, it will get better with time.</li>
            <li> works wonderfully! I never had it before, yet I mastered it in less than 15 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;more easy impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;genius. saves time, saves nailpolish and saves annoying visits to beauty salons for fancy manicure and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this allows you to be creative on your own ways and with your own materials, because no, Konad special nailpolish is not absolutely nesesary, i have tried it all, and it works perfectly with ANY nailpolish if you know how to use it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there is not excuse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;doing at home results more fun, quick and easy now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;excelent quality! cute package, i couldn&#x27;t love it more!</li>
            <li> I am new to this nail art stamping and I needed a nail stamper and scraper so I decided to get this one since its double sided, one tip smaller for small designs and the other for larger designs. So I thought that one would be best to start. It is a good price as well. Received it earlier than expected as well!</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews, they are great products. The only negative thing I could say is that the scraper is difficult to clean. Otherwise they work great.</li>
            <li> The Konad Nail Art double ended Stamper and Scraper is a good buy for someone that has small nails, I also have the original one that Konad came out with first and I still use it, but if I have to do my pinky finger nails and toe nails this will help me not smear nail polish around the outer area of the nail. I gave it 4 stars because sometimes it doesn&#x27;t pick up the designs, but overall it does a good job.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 13yo daughter for XMAS, she loves it.  Easy to use, her nails look great, and she shows off to her friends her &amp;#34;cool nails&amp;#34;.  Also bought many of the Konad plates and polish colors for her.  Very good.</li>
            <li> I think this stamper will save you a lot of money all need is some  different design nail plates  to go alone with it and some cute polish, and you are set :)</li>
            <li> The applicator works great; it picks up the color well and deposits it evenly on the nail with a smooth rolling motion.  I had no trouble with it the first time.  The scraper is crap; listen to other reviewers and throw it away.  I used an old gift card instead, which worked just as well and didn&#x27;t scratch the image plate.  Overall definitely worth the money; I wish I had more image plates to use with it though!</li>
            <li> Stamper works like magic without the need to file it like so many forums suggest when you first start stamping. I wish the scraper was plastic though, I&#x27;m not interested in scratching my plates at all</li>
            <li> The stamper is awesome, but don&#x27;t use their scraper. It scratches up your plates. Just use any plastic card you have that is junk. (old credit card, old license, etc)</li>
            <li> This is a great stamper. Works well w multiple brand polishes and plates. The double end is handy for full nail patterns or single stamp designs. The length of stamper is easier to handle than other stampers w a small handle. Would buy again and recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is fun you just have to practice so u can get the entire picture on your nail .</li>
            <li> This works well with any stamping plates and is a must-have for any nail art enthusiast!  Keep practicing- it takes a while to get a hang of, but your nails will look nice!</li>
            <li> This little gem is awesome. Every time I do my nails I use this to put cute and unique designs on my nails.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the stamp is a two in one. The smaller size is good for small images you&#x27;re trying to get just right on that certain exact spot on your nail.</li>
            <li> This is another great product from konad have many stampers glad to add this to my nail stamping collection .</li>
            <li> I purchased this when I wanted to get into nail stamping, and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. The stamper is awesome, and worth the price alone. I love that it&#x27;s double sided, it&#x27;s easy to hold, and it&#x27;s just a really good stamper. The scraper, however, isn&#x27;t so great. I used it a few times and it scratched up my nail plates so badly. It also needs a few good scrapings in order to remove all of the nail polish. Even then, I found myself cleaning the scraper after each nail, and the nail polish would seep into the upper plastic part which made it difficult to clean. I find that an old credit/ID card works SO much better. They don&#x27;t scratch your plates, and they work the first time.</li>
            <li> The price is great. I really like the doubled ended stamp. The scraper works fairly well too. It was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described, very happy buyer! (:</li>
            <li> Finally I found the stamper I have been looking for.  If anyone is looking to buy a stamper, just get this one and don&#x27;t bother trying any other ones.  I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the results, picks up image wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Absolute a must have for anyone who spends a lot of time doing nails. I used it for small designs only but the larger end works great as well. The scraper sucks but then again they all do. Just use an old plastic credit card for a scraper if need be.</li>
            <li> This works great at stamping glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> did exactly what i expected it to and smoothly :]</li>
            <li> This nail stamper has worked great. It picks up and applies designs smoothly and easily. It&#x27;s very easy to clean and makes the whole process simple and efficient!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! And this requires a set amount of words to submit, i don&#x27;t know what else to say !!</li>
            <li> This product is great. the stamper works very well but the scraper scratches all my metal plates. i suggest you use an old gift card or piece of plastic for a scraper. This one will ruin your plates.</li>
            <li> i got stamps from Bundle Monster Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit 25pc here on amazon and this stamper works great with almost any stamps. when i dont have much time to decorate my nails myself i just grab this and the stamps and its so fast the product its high quality it ships quick. i would recommend this to anyone that wants to learn how to stamp. just get on youtube for some tutorial videos and with some practice you should be good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for nearly a year and it&#x27;s still going strong. I do not have steady hands at all, when I came across nail stamping I was intrigued. My nails have been looking salon quality ever since without the hefty price tag. Thanks Konad!</li>
            <li> I like this but it takes time to get to handle it well. Scrapper was kind of bent so there are times in which I dont get to slice it well and the enamel still lays on the plate.I ve been using a credit card instead. Stamper is ok but if you were to improve it, it should be bigger and squared instead of round since thumb nails are bigger. some nail paints are not good for stamping . It works better if you have the specials nail paints for this. El cosito estampador deberia ser más grande y cuadrado, a veces las uñas de los pulgares son más grandes que ese circulo. La hojilla vino torcida, asi que no remueve muy bien la pintura del plato de diseños.Yo uso ahora una tarjeta de credito en vez de la hojilla esa. No todas las pinturas son buenas para hacerse estampados. Funciona mejor con la blanca o con las que sean colores muy fuertes y espesas.</li>
            <li> This thing is impossible to use! I watched a million tutorials and bought all the required supplies but still can&#x27;t get this to work! Waste of money!</li>
            <li> If you can master the nail art stamping technique you can have endless nail art design possibilities and save money on your manicures. I found the technique tedious to master but worth the time to learn.</li>
            <li> The stamper works amazing. I gave it 4 stars because it would have been better if it came with a plastic scrapper instead of a metal one.</li>
            <li> Only stamper I&#x27;ve ever tried, so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else, but it does exactly what it&#x27;s meant to do, so no complaints!</li>
            <li> I had to do some extensive YouTube research to get the hang of this, but now I love it. I don&#x27;t use the metal scraper for fear of scratching my discs.</li>
            <li> product is good and the two sides are useful but the scraper is not always easy to clean</li>
            <li> I love that the scraper has a metal edge because it leaves the stamping plate cleaner! Do not press on the plate too hard with the scraper because you will scratch it. I prefer a different brand stamper that I have for most small designs. However, the large side of this stamper is fantastic for doing toe nails or an all over nail print! Very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute still have to work it with the plates but again only problem I had was the packaging it was just in a box</li>
            <li> I use, this product, for stamping designs, on clients nails.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Love the wide end , for my longer, nails, and the coverage.&lt;br /&gt;The smaller , end for my natural nail clients!&lt;br /&gt;They love it, and so do I</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to use at first, but once you get the hang of it, you absolutely love this tool for nail art stamping :)</li>
            <li> I saw this on YouTube nail art videos and decided to get it. It&#x27;s cheaper here then other websites which is a big plus and it&#x27;s fun to be creative without having to be too artistically gifted. I would highly recommend getting the Konad nail polish with it. At first I thought I could use the polish I already had and it just dried way too quickly to be used with this.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine at work showed me some youtube videos on how to use this product.  I was so impressed, I bought two.  One for my 16-year-old daughter and one for my 11-year-old daughter.  They love it.  It is super simple to use and gives great results.</li>
            <li> The scraper did absolutely nothing for me. I heard that using an actual razor blade would help. The stamper works fine though I guess...</li>
            <li> I love this product because of it has a large and small stamper. I can pinpoint where my small art image will appear on my nails.</li>
            <li> This is great for those smaller designs that you want in a particular place.  Not so much guess-work with where you got the design, as on the larger stamp.</li>
            <li> sometimes the top coat smudges the designe and it can be hard to line up the pictures but its fun and is great for the big toe nail where the design doesnt need the top coat and the margin for error is bigger</li>
            <li> I used it last night for the first time, its a bit messy but i think i need some more practice with it. Great invention and saves on me having to figure out how to do my own nail art on my nails. Which I can do but it takes way too long to do. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but the scraper doesn&#x27;t work well at all. It&#x27;s a Konad, so I would expect it to do a great job. I used it on a brand new Konad plate, so I don&#x27;t see the reason it wouldn&#x27;t work as it should.</li>
            <li> this stamper is pretty neat. it has a big end and a little end for different design sizes. good buy.</li>
            <li> Ignored the scraper and used the stamper with a gift card, as some reviews suggested. Works great! It definitely worked best to apply the stamper with some pressure in one smooth motion from left to right. Looks great! It applies it in such a thin layer, that any that got on the skin of my fingers washed off after a shower. Looks great if you&#x27;re quick and practice.</li>
            <li> This is a great nail stamper for the nail are templates. It is sturdy and hard which helps when trying to apply different colors with the picture that you want. Has worked great for me.</li>
            <li> This did not work well for me at all.</li>
            <li> its just great .. using is easy .. so as cleaning .. i don&#x27;t regret buying at all .. totally worth this price and more</li>
            <li> I purchased a set of nail design plates and wanted to get this stamper since it has two different size sides. I like the smaller side to use on my pinky and my 3yr old nails. I have a knock off stamper and scraper. Although, the scraper can be compared to each other as performing the same the quailty of konad is better..  The konad stamper is by far much better then the knock off one. I use all of my regular nail polish, all from different brands for the designs and it picks it up. I use regular polish on my daughter nails and gelish gel polish on my nails and the designs goes on the same with the regular polish and konad stamper.</li>
            <li> Works and looks perfect! Love it! Just dont forget to take a medium file and scruff it up a little before using, it makes the polish stick better. Thanks to this, I am addicted to stamping!</li>
            <li> At first I had a difficult time getting the nail polish onto the stamper. After MANY tries I was able to do it easily. First I thought it was the nail polish because it wasn&#x27;t thick enough, but later I realized it was the stamper...It was too new for the polish to be picked up by the stamper. The scraper does scratch the plates but I use a plastic store card as a substitute.</li>
            <li> its perfect. practice makes perfect. you will need to buff it with a nail file though. works best with konad polishes.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and in condition described. Works perfectly for nail stamping. Note: I read that one should file the stamper gently to help it grip the nail polish better so I did so very gently before using. Not sure if it helped but it&#x27;s my first time stamping and it went well when I used a thick nail polish for the stamping. I&#x27;m very pleased :)</li>
            <li> Fun and easy to apply. This tool makes decorating your nails easy. i use regular nail polish, like wet and wild or revlon, only thing is with that you may have to stick with dark polish for the stamp so it can pop.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased with some of the other Knoad line, my wife loves to get her nails done and it always costs more for those little design things they put on.  She expressed an interest in this and I was skeptical but she really liked it and it was really easy to use with the plates.  I found everything I needed on Amazon and good prices so I took the dive and hoped it paid off.  It did and she started to show her friends when they asked because she would change designs all the time. Everyone thought she was going back to the nail salons.  Her friends even bought sets for themselves and their daughters.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Fast delivery. A+ Seller! Thank you!</li>
            <li> The stamps and scraper are garbage. you cant pick up the polish with the stamper and the scraper leaves polish everywhere but in the stamp design.  The nail polish doesn&#x27;t work at all ....seems to dry too fast and doesn&#x27;t transfer to the stamper so that it can be applied to my nail.  I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Too complicated to use!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to try out some nail stamping.  After doing my research, I learned that Konad was the best brand for stamping products.  I liked that there were two different sized sides, but I&#x27;ve found that the smaller green side does not stamp very well.  The pink side seems to transfer the image much more thoroughly, but it isn&#x27;t ideal when trying to stamp small designs on my young daughters&#x27; nails.  I would strongly recommend that you watch the youtube tutorials on stamping for valuable tips and tricks.  One thing I learned was that you need to file down the stamper before use.  This helps it to pick up the image more completely.  As far as the scraper, I found that it doesn&#x27;t work as well as an old credit card or gift card.  It&#x27;s difficult to clean and doesn&#x27;t always scrape smoothly.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t all that happy with this because I can&#x27;t get it to stamp with any polish I use. But I do how ever like the little stamper.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft. This stamper is great quality.</li>
            <li> We are brand new to stamping our nails and this little stamper works very good. I especially like how there is different colors on each end so depending on the color of your polish you can pick the side that makes it easier to see. :-)</li>
            <li> The Konad Double Ended Stamper works great! I was told by people that use the Stamper to use a old credit card instead of the Scraper, because the Scraper would scratch your stamping plates.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would recommend is that you use a plastic ė grift card instead of the metal b/c the metal can scratch the image plates</li>
            <li> the stamp part need to be ruffed up with each use with an emory board.  other wise it is great</li>
            <li> Way better than the plastic scraper you usually get when buying these products.Also the small side helps with smaller designs.</li>
            <li> these are fun and it works great - gives a salon look without the price and trouble</li>
            <li> Bought it to compliment the konad stamping image plate and its ok but the design does not always come out clean looking on the nail so I have not really used it.</li>
            <li> Stamper - AWESOME, scraper -TERRIBLE. I followed the recommendation on chickettes.com and using an old credit card really is best.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to use. I just need more practice.</li>
            <li> cant beat the price, arrived on time and was packaged nicely, thank you!</li>
            <li> Great item. Both ends are easy to use and great quality.</li>
            <li> so easy to use. A lot of fun. Definitely get the name brand product.</li>
            <li> I prefer the super squishy black and white stampers, but this one is my next favorite.</li>
            <li> I love the small end for individual designs and the large one for full nail designs.  It has a metal scraper but I do not see it scratching my plates at all! worth the 5 dollars no problem!</li>
            <li> Not really worth it so far becasue my girls ages 10 &amp; 11 couldn&#x27;t get it to work well and look right.</li>
            <li> The stamper works well, it does take some practice to used to working with it and to get the designs in the position you want.</li>
            <li> The Konad scraper and stamper are awesome and work wonderfully for stamping images onto nails.  I highly recommend this product for doing nail art.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and when I finally got it in the mail, the stamper wasn&#x27;t in the package.. just the receipt!! I was so upset :( when I tried contacting customer service they&#x27;re taking forever to get back to me. What a rip off.</li>
            <li> Must have for every girl who loves to style her own nails. It&#x27;s simple to use. My seven year old even tried it.</li>
            <li> Stamp Works well, just use an old credit card or gift card, instead of the metal scraper</li>
            <li> I purchased this Konad stamper. I have only used it once and find that it makes a difference when you file the stamper bottom with a nail file to ensure you are able to get the most defined design patterns. I am a licensed professional, but found that I needed to read Konad&#x27;s instructions (or watch a YouTube video) to ensure I was using this tool properly. Once you get it down, you can make some awesome nail designs. It definitely takes practice though  so be patient when you begin working with this nail art tool.</li>
            <li> Love this stamper and scraper ....</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean. The stamp picks up the designs well. The rubber doesn&#x27;t fall apart like other ones.</li>
            <li> Works with no issues. The pink side works for larger designs and green side for smaller images.</li>
            <li> The scraper isn&#x27;t that great, but the stamper is excellent. I use an old credit card in lieu of the scraper provided in this package.</li>
            <li> Great product. Quickly sent.</li>
            <li> Best stamper Ever! Works with all my nail art plates. MoYou, Cheeky and CICI&amp;SISI.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my friend but ended up giving it to kids. They played with the kit.</li>
            <li> Quick ship. New in package. Did a quick try - can&#x27;t wait till the weekend - looks like a winner to me.</li>
            <li> eh, it pretty good. do not use the scrapper</li>
            <li> First, if you have trouble stamping, buy this stamper!  Then practice!  Go on YouTube and there are so many great tutorials.  I purchased that cheap stamping kit which you can find at most Sally&#x27;s and drugstores, and I had no luck with that kit.  However, with this stamper I am able to use those plates which were included in the cheap stamper kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased four stampers, this one is by far my favorite.  Warning - if you have super long nails, this could be difficult to use and I would recommend a larger stamper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for almost everyone else, I highly recommend this stamper.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product. It picks up patterns well especially if you use a good polish. The rubber ends are nice and pliable not hard or tough.</li>
            <li> this one is really good, works perfectly with most of my polishes, super easy to clean, cheap and just really good overall. Buy this:)</li>
            <li> Doesnt transfer print</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly&lt;br /&gt;Good price&lt;br /&gt;Works great&lt;br /&gt;Happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> it is not what i really expected. it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> The stamper is great, but the scraper scratches up the plates so I use a plastic gift card instead. I would recommend saving your money and buying a stamper only.</li>
            <li> did not transfer polish well.</li>
            <li> works great. I love that it has two sides! The scraper is not the best but this is totally worth buying.</li>
            <li> Great stamper- just remember to use a nail file or nail buffer to rub across both ends of the stamper so you can pick up the image from your nail plates. The nail scraper scratches up my nail image plates so now I am using an old grocery store savings card that I cut in half as my scraper.</li>
            <li> konad has the best products, other people have complained about other stampers not working, this worked great for me I love it</li>
            <li> this product came in quickly. the scraper doesn&#x27;t work too well though, I like using a credit card-like card. stamper does what ours supposed too. my only other complaint is that&#x27;s its pink, but that&#x27;s just aesthetic.all in all, a good product.</li>
            <li> This is a great stamper, and if you want to create your own starter kit the price can&#x27;t be beat when bought alongside one of the many stamp plate kits available. The scraper itself has not been used as I don&#x27;t want to damage my plates due to the metal edge, but an old gift card or credit card works perfectly. The stamper itself works great with the MASH plates and regular nail polish, and having both the large and small end makes it easy for even a beginner to stamp perfectly in no time at all.</li>
            <li> I rated this 5 stars because it works perfectly to pick up each design plate I have and it&#x27;s easy to clean the scraper and stamp. I have seen many different sets but I am happy with this one!</li>
            <li> great, very good, I love it</li>
            <li> my mother gave me this for Christmas and the funny thing is between her and my daughter i do they&#x27;re nails more than i do my own but still a great product</li>
            <li> It picked up soo much more than my other winstonia stamper did, I would recommend this stamper other other&#x27;s for being able too pick up tiny images others cant.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I use both sides of the stamper, but I find that it is better to use an old gift card or credit card rather than the scraper, since they are sharp and they are hard to clean.</li>
            <li> This picks up the design nicely(except the green side) and I don&#x27;t use the scraper because it scratches the plate.</li>
            <li> Ok the first time i knew about konad was on YouTube so i said let me order this and see how it comes out. I read all the review. so i just ordered. i love it, it works very good i took a picture of the design i did. what i do wrong is i don&#x27;t clean the stamper with nail remover.To tell you the truth it is fine and you will love it. The order comes fast.</li>
            <li> Best one on the market! Love this thing!</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  Even more awesome price!  Very pleased and easy to use!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the Konad Stamping Nail Art Image Plate Holder, and the SHANY 2012 Nail Art Polish Stamp Manicure Image Plates set of 25pcs.  It&#x27;s been a huge hit! The stamper picks up pretty much any nail polish - saturated colors of course work best. But I wasn&#x27;t about to buy a bunch of *custom* nail polishes for way too much money.  I&#x27;ll just pick from the plethora of polishes in underbed storage.  It would be nice if the scraping blade were wider; and it&#x27;s nearly impossible to clean ALL the polish from the crevices, but not really a functional problem. Just hard (impossible!) to keep it looking nice.&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, I&#x27;d buy again!</li>
            <li> Works great. My teen loved them. Came pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I love this stamper!! It is worth every penny I paid for it. It is very sturdy and goes well with the konad plates I got.</li>
            <li> Had to buy different kinds other than this doesn&#x27;t work with different plates</li>
            <li> Love it, just wish the larger side was a bit bigger for longer nails. Works great.</li>
            <li> Does what is it supposed to do ....</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied with this stamper.  I&#x27;m so happy with the quality and the price.</li>
            <li> Very nice came quickly</li>
            <li> I got my Konad Double Ended Stamper and Scraper in two days for about $6 and I used it with my Cheeky image plate and Sinful Colors nail polish. All the details from the images transferred perfectly. I got a double ended stamper and a separate scraper in the set. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> very useful stamps bundle, this was a gift to my cousin, and she love it when she use it on her nails.</li>
            <li> It shipped really fast and there weren&#x27;t any defects. I love the two sizes of the stamper. You can even use the image plates and the small green stamp side to do full nail designs on kids nails :) Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love having my nails done, and being a single mom who&#x27;s a full time student means very little spending money. So I ordered this along with the bundle monster plates and love it! I can have cute professional looking designs on my nails and change them every day if I want! Super easy to use.</li>
            <li> One word: love. I loooove this stamper. When I started doing my nails I would always see these women with perfectly done nails, no smudges and completely exact and uniform. I wondered how they did it. Now I know. These are so easy to use and they make my manicures look amazing. Shipped quickly. Wonderful seller.</li>
            <li> Despite the name of this product, it does not work well when applied to the testicles. Beware of the thing I just said.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the stamper and It is a very good stamper, but I don&#x27;t use the scraper because it is metal and will scratch my plates. I am glad I ordered it!</li>
            <li> I got this item for my sister for Christmas. She loves to do peoples nails and paints her own nearly every day. I know that on Christmas morning she is going to be so excited to see this.   This item comes exactly as advertized, (a cute pink stamper and scraper). I received this item extremely fast and I&#x27;m very please with it so far.</li>
            <li> Loce this item,it is amazing.it came quickly and works perfectly,love the designs i can put on my nails.would deff buy this product for my friends and family</li>
            <li> works great. i had to go on youtube for easy instructions, i just searched nail stamp instructions. the product itself though is amazing, used many times already it still is like brand new. i keep it in the original box, perfect. couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I was a little iffy when I bought this stamper, most of the tutorials I have seen on nail art stamping use the basic Konad stamper, in pink, and I didn&#x27;t know if there was a difference. I love it! It stamps perfectly, leaving clean and perfectly printed images. The only thing is that I didn&#x27;t buy the Konad nail polish because I didn&#x27;t think it made a difference. It definitely does! Be sure to buy that or Wet &#x27;N Wild nail polish, because their consistencies are formulated to be think enough to print a dark enough image, while other nail polish comes out VERY light. Buying some tomorrow!</li>
            <li> Based on the ammount of people giving 5 starts to this product, it looks I was the one with bad luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping time was good, but you can imagine how surprised I got when instead of getting the Konad Nail Art Double Ended Stamper And Scraper, I got a Klean Color Neon Lacquer Mini Collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got the wrong product, I proceeded to contact the seller ( Herbal Beauty Supply (USA SELLER)), and talked to Amazon cust support, they told me that the seller had two business days to get back to me, that never happened, the seller just did not respond to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then proceeded to fill a claim, that´s where I am right now, I have to wait up to two weeks for the guarantee team at Amazon to investigate my case and see if they will be able to refund my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont know about the product, but the seller just did not care about having an unsatisfied customer, unsatisfied because of their stupidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it one start because the system would not allow me to give nothing.</li>
            <li> I love this kit. Stamping is a great way to add a  little bit of flair to your nails. This was cheap, but has been holding up very well!</li>
            <li> Bout this for the wheels I got. It&#x27;s fine, not bad, but really, the scraper doesn&#x27;t work any better than a credit card. The stamper is useful-ish, but I thing, the problem is actually with the nail art wheels I bight separately.</li>
            <li> This stamper is awesome!  It is well made and picks up design nicely.  It is also easy to clean!  Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> Love this stamper it works well, the 2 sides are useful. Usually always use the larger end for the big patterns.</li>
            <li> If i had known this stamper was so great i would have bought it a long time ago, i have a stamper from another brand and even though it stamps well, sometime it takes many tries, however it broke and i decided to try this brand and my, my, my am i happy i did, clean and crisp images as well as the rubber is soft which makes it much easier to get the design on your nails, I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> If you are into nail stamping, these are two very good tools to have in you kit. Extra stampers, especially one with two different sized ends and and extra scrapers will always be handy.</li>
            <li> Product as described. Durable and pretty in pink! Fast shipping. Perfect size for your hand! Will buy again when needing one or as a gift.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t see much the design on the sta[[ASIN:B002MZ8BK2 Konad Nail Art Double Ended Stamper And Scraper]]mper, and the nail polish is kind of thick when i got it. :(</li>
            <li> i have no complaints does what it sets about to do. i would recommend it. however the metal scraper scratches your plates. Well don&#x27;t buy if this will be a problem for you.</li>
            <li> So I got my product and was afraid to use the scraper from reading reviews, so I skipped right to a gift card! Some of the images don&#x27;t work so well, but it&#x27;s alot of fun to use with my step daughter! Also, the plate holder didn&#x27;t work &amp; my plates were slipping. Threw it out! Maybe next time I&#x27;ll just find a stamper!</li>
            <li> It came sooner than expected and works perfectly! Just be sure to clean off with tape instead of acetone. :) ugh, love it so much!</li>
            <li> The holder works fine but the scraper scratches the plates.  I will not recommend this scraper unless you wnat to damage your plates. The holder and stamper work fine.</li>
            <li> I just got this today. It&#x27;s my first experience with nail stamping and it was a major success!! I used both ends of the stamper because I have tiny fingers so the small one worked best for my pinky. Both ends had the same amount of squish as far as I could tell. The polish transferred like a dream, both onto and off of the stamper! The excess polish left on the stamper peels right off, it&#x27;s freaking amazing! I used a credit card instead of the scraper for fear I would scratch my plates, so I can&#x27;t comment on the scraper. 100% recommend! This is going to become a new obsession!! :) FYI, I used it with the Konad white polish in combination with a cheap polish I had on hand. I got my image plates from bundle monster.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, even for a first time stamper. :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the small end too often- it seems like the designs I pick are too big for it.&lt;br /&gt;It works really well. The only issue I really have is the scraper scratches the surface area of the stamp plate. I worry about it affecting the clarity. I&#x27;ve started to look at possibly using plastic or silicone instead of the metal.</li>
            <li> Love this nail art tool.  Is so easy to decorate nail with and looks so professional with easy clean up....</li>
            <li> Compared to other stamper/scraper sets, this one really delivers. Transfer is always easy and beautiful! Very easy to clean also.</li>
            <li> This works great.  I am like most users and choose not to use the little metal scraper.  An old business card or credit card works well and won&#x27;t scratch up your surface.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.  Awesome product!!!</li>
            <li> Great price! I had some trouble getting the naipolish to &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34;, but that may have just been because the nailpolish I used.</li>
            <li> I guess it does what it should I have no problems with the stamper but the scraper don&#x27;t really slide even and not very easy to clean you end up with alot on build up on the plastic/pink.</li>
            <li> I suppose it does what it supposed to it was a gift for my 14yr old daughter she said she had a hard time using it and I tried to play with it some and it took me a couple tries before I got a good image to come off the stamp. I suppose it just takes some practice if you never used one before</li>
            <li> does just what it says it does. its nice that it has both a small end for details and the large end for full nail prints. i have had no issues using this with generic brand polish either</li>
            <li> I am new to the &amp;#34;konading&amp;#34; world but this stamper and scraper has been awesome! I haven&#x27;t had any trouble picking up images or placing them on my nail. Easy to clean, easy to use. I read on other reviews that the scraper scratched the images plates, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with that (hold it at a 45degree angle) Would defiantly recommend this, Happy stamping!</li>
            <li> I use this all the time.  I love the way that there are many different plates I can get.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> because of this product, I got 4 stitches.  the disks are highly dangerous. it slipped while i was holding it and cut my thumb. DONT BUY THIS for teens or kids. highly dangerous. caution!!!!! I HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL. IGNOR ALL THE GOOD STUFF STITCHES HURT!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> A little tricky to use at first, but I get it now. Im a happy camper .</li>
            <li> I really love using this!! It is fun, easy, and really convenient because now both the designs left and right hand look the same! The stamper works really well, though I did have some doubts at first when it wouldn&#x27;t stamp. It was only when I filed the stamper that it begin picking up the designs very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I have with this is that the scraper left some ugly scratch marks on my plate! It&#x27;s not really a big deal, but something to be aware of when buying.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap ones, this works perfect.  I don&#x27;t use the scraper, I use a gift card.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with Ted Angel Nail Art Plates and it does not transfer well for me. I&#x27;ve heard good things about it so maybe mine is faulty, however I can&#x27;t recommend this based on my experience.</li>
            <li> The stamper is great, but the scraper is TERRIBLE! The scraper scratches my image plates pretty badly so I tossed it out and tried what one of the other reviewers suggested, an old credit card or bonus card. That works sooo much better and doesn&#x27;t damage my plates.</li>
            <li> I was able to use this on my cheap plates and konad plates and it picked up polish so much better than my old generic stamper. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys stamping, also the scraper is perfect, It does not scratch the plates if held at a 45 degree angle towards yourself plastic cards are over rated and remove too much polish I think.  :) I have yet to try it with anything other than konad polish.</li>
            <li> Honestly I have not been able to use this item yet but I must say that I was very very pleased with the sender. Items were recieved very quickly and in a very nice manner I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I use this with MASH nail plates - it does a great job picking up the design and transferring it to the nail.</li>
            <li> The stamper works great but the scraper thing is metal and I hate it. A credit card works just as good though, if not better.</li>
            <li> this item is way to cool I use the stamper right away it&#x27;s easy to use on small hands for my daughters they love it..........</li>
            <li> Konad Nail Art Double Ended Stamper And Scraper&lt;br /&gt;Al igual que con los discos no he podido obtener los resultados deseados</li>
            <li> This stamp is great. I like the long handle, it makes it very easy to work with. I watched a lot Youtube videos about nail stamping before I made my first purchase and many of the women said the metal scraper would scratch the stamp plates so I just tossed it and use an old gift card instead. I&#x27;ve also heard that some folks scratch up the stamping pads to get the image to transfer better, I did not do this and do not recommend this. It works just fine right out of the box(well I wiped it off with acetone first, of course).</li>
            <li> I had a different brand of stamper that I had been using.  I started having problems with the images not transferring correctly. So, I ordered this Konad stamper.  I immediately tossed out the scraper.  I use old club cards instead.  This picked up and transferred my images beautifully.  I was able to use it with regular nail polish as well without having to file the ends.  I am very happy with my new stamper.</li>
            <li> I like the fact you have two sizes to choose from when stamping. Small side works perfect for small finger nails or designs.</li>
            <li> i had seen reviews on youtube about other brands of stamper and scraper and the overall consensus is that to get a good clean stamp, it is best to use a scrape with a metal blade as opposed to one with a plastic end. even thought it will scratch your plates, it DOES NOT affect the design whatsoever. the scratches will end up there regardless- even after some time the plastic will begin to scratch your plates (given enough force to scrape excess nail polish off). the stamper is grea, i try not to use colors similar to the red/pink end b/c you lose sight of the design and can mess up, but other than that- it is great use for all brands of stamping plates.</li>
            <li> I bought the stamper and scraper to go with plates I had bought. It did not work. The scraper is not made of great material and a lot of the time the nail polish would get caked onto the scraper. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and just as described. It works just like it should buy I&#x27;ll probably have to buy some stamping polish to get the full utility out of it. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I received this product 4 days after I placed the order. This is my first stamper so I tried it the same night I received it and it&#x27;s ok. I know some people who have been able to transfer images successful using a regular thick nail polish. So far, I&#x27;ve had a hard time stamping images with really thick lines or shapes. I&#x27;ve already tried massaging, gently kneading it, gently running it across a nail file and buffer and still doesn&#x27;t pick it up. I will try working with it again and update my review if anything changes.</li>
            <li> i love stamping my nails with this product it is easy to use and the stamps come out very good. i have another stamper from sallys but it isn&#x27;t as smooth as this one</li>
            <li> It cam early and works great i Recommend this product to anyone looking to get into nail stamping, it came just as advertised a konad brand stamper and scraper double sided.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to nail stamping and I done some research about the easiest stamper to purchase and after doing some reading and talking to fellow stampers a number of them told me I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with the Konad Double Ended Stamper.  They were so right!  From the first try everything stamped so easily without using Konad special polish because they haven&#x27;t arrived as of today.  But just using the polishes I was told would work using this stamper stamped beautifully from my very first try.  This stamper really does make stamping easy.</li>
            <li> This stamper works great, and I have not had problems with the scraper damaging my plates, as I have read other people mention. If the dog ate this, I would buy another one just like it. (If it just fell apart, I would have a harder time deciding whether or not to try another brand, I suppose.)</li>
            <li> I love love love this stamper! It&#x27;s soft enough to provide flexibility when stamping but still firm enough to pick up a clear image. I didn&#x27;t have to file mine down but if your image isn&#x27;t picking up then filing supposedly works well to help the image pick up. If you&#x27;re just starting stamping, I definitely recommend this product. The scraper works well but at the same time it scratches my plates, so I use an old credit card instead.</li>
            <li> Very First Stamper...I really like it, i just don&#x27;t like the metal scraper because it has a tendancy to scratch your plates but this stamper is good.</li>
            <li> I love this Konad product.  I would recommend this product.  When used correctly ... great!  You must place your polish, hold at a 90 scrape the plate then with the stamper push left to right ... not to hard then on your nails place the stamper on the nail from left to right lightly.  The image will transfer if done correctly.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I like it, I will recommend this item to other. Great and easy to use. But without plate holder, I hope the price are a little bit cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no nail artist, but I bought this stamper and after playing around with it, got pretty good at it! Makes my boring nails fun!</li>
            <li> Great product, I’m glad I bought it will keep forever,  the product arrived in a timely fashion, I was thrilled and will be using it next weekend.</li>
            <li> It works great but I was sad that you have to buy special nail polish for it to even work but other than that perfect</li>
            <li> Great stamper. It took me awhile to get to use it because I had to purchase plates again did not get the first set bought from another seller.</li>
            <li> I purchased this stamper due to the good reviews Konad received from nail design blogs. I had also been given the recommendation to use an old credit card or gift card to scrape the excess polish from the stamp plate. I tried this method first, and it was a huge fail. So, I grabbed the scraper that came with this stamper and I actually liked it MUCH better. It took the appropriate amount of polish off without taking away from the design on the plate. I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars due to the fact that it was really hard to see pink polish on the pink stamp end (which obviously is to be expected due to the fact the stamp end is pink). It was be nice if the stamp was in a less popular color though. Overall, I was very happy with this purchase. I look forward to creating more beautiful nail designs with it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to mention that the seller of this product package and shipped it out pronto. I received it 3 days before the earliest estimated delivery date!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start with why I only gave it 4 stars-- the metal scraper scratches up the metal nail plates I have, so I don&#x27;t use it anymore. I just use a plastic credit card. It&#x27;s a little unwieldy to use a credit card, so it&#x27;s a pain, and I wish the scraper included with this set was made of plastic. The size is handy and it&#x27;s easy to grip, but I&#x27;d rather not scratch up my plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I LOVE the double-ended stamper. The size is great to hold and manipulate. I didn&#x27;t think I would use the smaller end at all, but I use it just as much as the larger end. I mainly do full-nail stamps, so I use the bigger end for those, but for full-nail toenail stamps it&#x27;s perfect (besides the big toe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fairly new to nail stamping, and this was dead easy to figure out. It has instructions on the back, and is easily learned. I had heard the metal scraper was no good in this kit, but for the price I paid, the stamper itself was worth the purchase. I am going to try and find a way to cover the metal on the scraper and make it less damaging to my nail plates.</li>
            <li> I like it, it is beautiful.</li>
            <li> The stamper does just what it&#x27;s supposed to. It has a large side for full nail designs and a small side for small icons. It&#x27;s very durable, and easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;The scraper, however, just needs to be tossed out- it&#x27;s useless. It&#x27;s made of medal and has terribly sharp corners, so it does nothing but scratch up your plates, so do not use it. Instead use and old credit card, or gift card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again if i needed another stamper.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT the best thing I have bought to do my nails with, I use it every other day I  love it</li>
            <li> I had a Salon Express stamper before this one &amp; this enabled me to get a full transfer.  I wouldn&#x27;t have bothered with the Salon Express kit if I found this first.</li>
            <li> Love this product nice to be able to switch ends and not have to pull out another stamper. Price was reasonable. Good buy</li>
            <li> I use this stamper along with my cheeky plate and it does the job</li>
            <li> good quantity, easy to use</li>
            <li> Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. maybe it&#x27;s just the plates i&#x27;m using. not happy with the scraper, doesn&#x27;t really work. but the stamper is gud, works.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with the Bundle Monster Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates. The Bundle set does not work as they do not transfer to the stamp &#x3D; (</li>
            <li> by the time you get the stamper onto the image plate, the polish has already dried and you end up with nothing on your nail</li>
            <li> FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!!!!  should have read reviews they do not send you Konad products I assume since it is pictured and that is what I ordered that is what I would get. I paid $6 for a pos from china. Very cheap!!!!!</li>
            <li> I went through 3 different stamper brands before coming upon this one! I never had any luck with the others and about gave up on nail stamping I figured it just wasn&#x27;t for me. Then I decided to give this one a shot and it stamps like a charm! It&#x27;s wonderful I should of gotten it first and saved myself some money!</li>
            <li> It broke too quick horrible</li>
            <li> The larger end of the stamper is great, the smaller end didnt work that great for me. I use an old gift card to scrape instead of the razor edge scraper.</li>
            <li> This stamper is perfect. Love the double ends, the small end is great for tiny designs or kids nails as they are small. Stamper worked perfect with Konad polish every time. I do not use the metal scraper tho as it scratches image plates. Doesn&#x27;t seem to affect design but it may after repeated use. I use an old gift card</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would really work, but I have an 8 year old who loves mani/pedis, and that can easily get expensive so I decided to give this a try.  It works great!  My daughter is loving getting her nails polished and stamped by mom!  Her 9 year old friend tried it and she was able to do it on her own after a quick demo. More than satisfied!</li>
            <li> Excellent choice for stamping. The Konad stamper is the best. I love the double sides - really glad I got this one. The scraper does scratch my pates, but I&#x27;m just not that great w/ the &amp;#34;credit card&amp;#34;. When I use the CC, the polish is left behind. Perhaps I need to work on that. As long as the scraper doesn&#x27;t ruin a design, I can live with the scraping.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Makes doing nails much simpler! I am very pleased!! The designs are also very cute and doesn&#x27;t look over done.</li>
            <li> I bough this expecting to have the same quality as my other stamper from konad, I was wrong. This isn&#x27;t a bad thing its that my expectation was lowered by this product. I got this as a seconded stamper in case someone in my family or friends want to use it as I am using my other stamping kit. And for the smaller side so I can have more control over single designs and my pinky finger witch dose not need that much stamping area. However the stamper is to smooth. and more times this makes the nail polish blur. I heard that people sand there stamper a bit to get a better results. I like something to work as is, I shouldn&#x27;t have to mod a product to make it work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Its haves two different sized ends for stamping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The stamper is to smooth. You might have to sand it down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the genuine konad stamper I like the green side better than the pink one. Some nail polishes don&#x27;t work so just because it won&#x27;t stamp the first time it could be the nail polish over all great product.</li>
            <li> I tried to use a cheaper version of a stamper, but was not getting the results I wanted.  If you are getting into nail air using mail plates, I highly recommend getting the Konad stamper and Konad polish.  It will save you a LOT of frustration in the long run.</li>
            <li> The the picture offered by seller is not the one I got. One customer has offered a right picture but it concludes a plate which is not concluded in the package.&lt;br /&gt;I have used several time. For the simple picture, it is easy to pick up; For the complex design...It seems not easy to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it takes me two week to get my package.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product! I prefer to use an old gift card instead of the scraper provided, it scratches the plates and I don&#x27;t like the sound of metal on metal. The stamps are perfect sizes the big one gets the whole design and the small side is perfect for pinky toes and nails</li>
            <li> Bought this last year. The blade/scrapper does not work well. Turns out, it was an off brand. Kinda sad. The stamper is good though.</li>
            <li> Good product! easy to use and very light weight! work perfectly and beautifuly!  so glad i bought it because it stamps my nail amazingly and it had came earlier then expected! i definitley recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li> what can i say... it works and i am glad i got it..&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend it to whomever is looking for a nail stamper.</li>
            <li> if u like konad and want to get it this is really good cuz u hav a small side that prints and washes really well and also a big side that does the exact same. the scraper is really awesome cuz it doesnt cut u but it gets the job done. i love this if i didnt own i wood get it again, lolz so y r u still reading this, get it NOW!!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered a MASH stamper when I first started stamping, but was having nothing but problems with it. I had problems transferring full sized images and couldn&#x27;t get some images to pick up period. I almost gave up stamping completely when I decided to order this stamper as a last result and I&#x27;m so happy I did!&lt;br /&gt;It picks up every image and transfers flawlessly! It even works great with regular polishes. I can&#x27;t comment on the scrapper because I threw it in a draw immediately, instead using an old gift card. But the stamper is the best I&#x27;ve come across and would recommend it to any nail frantic like myself!</li>
            <li> The double ended stamper works great.  I am so glad I got the double stamper for the smaller nails.  Would have been nice to have more instruction tips but I guess that is what UTube is for.</li>
            <li> This product works so awesomely.  I was amazed.  THIS WORKS EXACTLY LIKE IT IS SUPPOSED TO.&lt;br /&gt; Got here on time too.  This is such a great thing to buy some one into nails.  Don&#x27;t forget to get the metal stamp templates too, and that is all you need.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly how the item is described. Couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product. The stamp concerts the nail perfectly.</li>
            <li> El producto es bueno, aunque personalmente no me gusta el raspador, es metálico y me da la impresión de que raya las placas, prefiero el plastico</li>
            <li> The stamp in this kit works just fine, but I would have never found that out if it weren&#x27;t for me already owning a stamp and scraper that I got from a mall vendor. Not worth the cheap price because you won&#x27;t be able to get the excess polish off of the stamp plates.</li>
            <li> This item came very quickly. I have had no problems with it. Nothing was damaged and it still works. I am happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Worked as expected. I dont have a lot of experience with nail art but had no difficulty using it the very first time.</li>
            <li> Overall this stamper works well. I didn&#x27;t need to prime the pink side. It picked up images clearly right away. The green side I&#x27;m still struggling with even after priming. I may go over it again with a slightly rougher grit file to see if I can get it to pick up images better. Since most people would use the pink side anyway I think this is still a great choice.</li>
            <li> I had another Stamper and scraper but the pads keep falling off and this one works great. The scraper is better too, with a metal blade that doesn&#x27;t leave remains. I guess you need to go wtih the brand name of Konad to get the best results. Two years later and this stamper is still going strong. Love love love it - reading the reviews I now see that perhaps the scraper isn&#x27;t the best as it has scratched some of my plates. So maybe I will switch to gift cards.</li>
            <li> I had watched ONE youtube video about stamping before trying it, and chose this one because it was the one she had used as well. It was so easy! Definitely will recommend.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and works very well.</li>
            <li> works perfectly and enjoy putting the designs on my nails; the stamper is easy to clean as well as the scraper would  give my Recommendation to anyone looking to buy this item I&#x27;m very happy with the set</li>
            <li> Works well, wish it came with nail polish for stamping!</li>
            <li> love this stuff seller was great</li>
            <li> works great the first time, needs no buffing to get it to work. LOVE THIS!!!!</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d get the one you can buy at Wal-mart while I waited for this one to ship but I am SOOOOO glad I tried the Konad also because it is SO much easier to use! The other is rounded and harder to use the konad is flat and SO easy. I almost gave up using the other so I love love love love love this stamper. Softer rubber,wider rubber, and flatter. ++++++ Wish I could find the plates near me tho I am addicted !</li>
            <li> Used very briefly with quality metal plates.  We opted to use gems, crystals and decals instead.  The quality is not that great.</li>
            <li> This was the first time i tried stamping and i absolutely was thankful for how easy this was to use, they also clean up very easily, definitely recommend this for anyone interested in stamping</li>
            <li> I got this, the 25 plate kit and the Konad black and white polishes. They work great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOME THINGS I LEARNED:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-You really need to buy the special Konad polish, it is different than regular nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;-Always shake the bottle of Konad Polish VERY well before you use it, otherwise it will not stick to the pad like it should.&lt;br /&gt;-You can use the plate on no more than 2 or 3 nails before you need to clean it and the scraper off with nail polish remover, then continue.&lt;br /&gt;-Some plates are not quite big enough to cover your nail, just add polish to a portion of the plate and use that to add more of the pattern.&lt;br /&gt;-It takes a bit of practice, but by my second hand it was a lot easier!&lt;br /&gt;-It helps a lot to have one of the manicure clean-up pens for your cuticles (full of nail polish remover) because some of the pattern will stick to your skin. It does come off really easily though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun with this!  I know I am!</li>
            <li> it does take a while to learn how to work. it can get difficult and frustrating. But once you get it to work it is absolutly beautiful. My advise to you is watch the video tutorial on youtube, DON&#x27;T GO TO SLOW, and clean off everything after each nail. Also be paitent.</li>
            <li> It took me several trials &amp; mistakes to figure out how this thing works. Once figured, like others said, it was fast and easy. I got this thing with french manicure image plate and I&#x27;m very pleased with how my nails look!! I wish I knew about this product earlier. I really like that I don&#x27;t have to wait for it to dry forever like I would when painting the tip. After stamping the image, I wait for a couple of minutes so to avoid smearing, then put top coat on gently without letting the brush touching the design. Whoever came up with this idea of stamping a nail polish is just brilliant!!!    If you are new to Konading, here are the two sites that really helped me get started on Konadicure :)    -Regular polishes that work for Konadicure: [...] My absolute favorite konading polishes are Sally Hansen Insta-Dri :)    -No, you really DON&#x27;T need to cover the whole image and waste your nail polish(es)!!: [...]  My only complain is that the scraper could have been better designed, not that it doesn&#x27;t work, but the metal scratch up the image plates and it is not very easy to clean; the polish gets inside the holes and between the thin ridges of the blade. So I listened to others and used my expired bank card. I cut it in half for better grip and it worked!!! It is way easier to clean up; I just smear what&#x27;s scraped on to paper towel or old T-shirt. The only thing you have to make sure is that your card isn&#x27;t chipped, make sure its smooth and straight.    Another thing I found out is: you can use plastic tapes to clean up most of the image that got onto your finger instead of using nail polish remover as long as you are using regular nail polishes. I heard acetone gets absorbed into your skin very quickly and that is just no good for your finger nor cuticle, so it&#x27;s best to avoid if you don&#x27;t have to. Just be careful not to put tape onto the image you just stamped. For this, I make a ring of tape and have it available before I stamping. This cleaning method also works for cleaning up the stamper with leftover image; I just stamp the stamper on a larger ring of tape stuck on my work area and I don&#x27;t have to worry about lint getting on the rubber part from using cotton balls or Q tips.    Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product and I will definitely buy again if mine breaks though I can&#x27;t see how such a simple thing can break. The rubber tip might come off, but all you need is a crazy glue...</li>
            <li> I bought the Konad double sided stamper to use with the bundle monster plates.  Both arrived today and I opened immediately to try my first-ever attempt at nail stamping.  I lightly filed the stamper as I has seen suggested in other reviews.  I used Wet &#x27;n Wild, Wild Shine nail polish in silver metalic, black creme, and french white creme over my existing Shellac manicure.  I am sold!  The designs picked up and transfered perfectly, looks like a professional did my nails, the plate and scraper were very easy to clean up.  I had read in some reviews that the Konad scraper scratched these plates, but I didn&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> This stamper is great for beginners. It makes stamping easy once you get the hang of it. One problem is the color. If you are stamping with pink, red etc you can&#x27;t see the design very well. Also the metal blade on the scraper will scratch your plates. Stampers everywhere will tell you to use an old gift card or credit card instead.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get into konad and I had found a image plate online but it didn&#x27;t come with a stamper and scraper. I ordered this one and boy am I glad I did. I didn&#x27;t notice (don&#x27;t know how) that it was a double stamper and that works out great for my pinky nails. I used it fresh out the pack without filing the stamper and it works perfectly. So glad I decided on this one.</li>
            <li> I like this stamp better than the one that came with my first kit.  For the small items you can see darker colors on the green better than on the red.  You just have to make sure you don&#x27;t press to hard and move quickly.</li>
            <li> In love with this product. Best thing ever! Would recommend everyone to purchase this stamper. Happy camper let the stamping begin!</li>
            <li> This has been fun for me to use and I have received a lot of comments from others that they like it.</li>
            <li> I love this Konad stamper. I can do multiple designs and t is so easy! It makes it simpler to do my nails at home.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this product, I read a lot of bad reviews on the scraper. But after trying this stamper set out, I thought the scraper worked just fine! Love how easy it is to use this product:D It took me a only a couple of tries to get the hang of this...</li>
            <li> For some reason, the stamp won&#x27;t pick up any nail color on either end.  I&#x27;ve watched countless tutorials, but no dice.</li>
            <li> I like to stamper set! it does its job and isn&#x27;t anything to extravagant, but again it does its job!</li>
            <li> I love this this stamper and scraper, it&#x27;s the best out of all the brands out there!&lt;br /&gt;It works great and its easy to use! I had a cheaper stamper before this one&lt;br /&gt;but this one takes the cake!</li>
            <li> I bought it thinking that was big enough for my nails that are not long. It&#x27;s small I&#x27;m actually looking for something bigger in order to cover better my nails but in the complex I&#x27;m satisfy..</li>
            <li> Exactly as the product is described. Works perfectly and it&#x27;s easy to apply. I used it once and I love it!</li>
            <li> Love Love Loved this stamper!  After looking around, I decided to get the double sided stamper for the Konad nail stamping.  It works perfectly and I had no problem from the start.  Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my last one I had. Ive used a couple of different stampers and this by FAR is my favorite! GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Much better than the stamper that comes in the starter kit, I would recommend getting this stamper and buys a cheaper brand of plates to go with them.</li>
            <li> since is the only stamper i own i can tell you it picks up the image nicely. also the rubber parts are detachable for cleaning they pop right back in no problem.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time. its so easy to use and easy to clean. im gonna buy another for my sister.</li>
            <li> I got this when I went to Canada and my host&#x27;s sister would do my nails with one of these every night. It&#x27;s cool! It takes some practice to get used to applying it so that it&#x27;s actually visible, but it isn&#x27;t hard.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for and expected. I didn&#x27;t have to file the stamper part down worked just fine. The scraper does scratch up the plates but metal on metal it&#x27;s going to happen. I very much recommend this stamper.</li>
            <li> Works good. Seems to be good quality material. Nothing bad to say about it. takes practice to use! So be patient! :)</li>
            <li> I have 2 stamping plate kits. One is MASH and one Is PUEEN. Love them both and this stamper is awesome!</li>
            <li> The rubber stamper works great but the scraper is a piece of junk. An edge piece of a cereal box works better.</li>
            <li> Works well. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as stated...When I figure out what kind of polish to use with the stamps I&#x27;m sure it will work great</li>
            <li> Same results as others have stated.  Scraper works, but scratches plates.  Will likely find a plastic card to use instead.  Stamper is great.  MUST file stamper from time to time to get it to work.  Glad that others shared this tip.  I am using gel (LED cured) polishes.  Some are too thin to work, such as Nailluv.  Red Carpet Manicure colors seem to be thick enough.  Because they don&#x27;t dry until cured, the working time is unlimited (nearly) before you have to clean your plates and stampers for the next finger.  Gellish colors also seem to work.  So far, I&#x27;m finding that glitter polishes in gel brands don&#x27;t stamp well.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time, no damages, would definitely recommend to a friend. No need to buff the stamp, the scraper worked fine, if you are worried about scratching your plate try using a credit card instead.</li>
            <li> I am in love with my stamper :) This is very easy to use and the price is amazing! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> as a recent obsessor over nails, I was so happy to stumble upon this lovely invention. It truly does work great and makes my nails look detailed and pretty. You do not necessarily need to use Konad special polish. Any thick type nail polish will do!</li>
            <li> The stamper and scraper are great to use with the stamping plates. But you must act quickly so the polish doesn&#x27;t dry. It can also get a bit messy with the scraper. But after a couple of tries you will be a pro! These are great for the nail art novice.</li>
            <li> The stamper does not work all that well so my daughter does not use it very often.  Hopefully they come out with something more new and improved.</li>
            <li> I use this set with the Shany plates. it works well. I can&#x27;t complain. well actually I can because it scratchs my plates because the scraper is metal. but I wont use any other brand of stamper or scraper</li>
            <li> I have a cheaper stamper and this slightly more expensive one. I feel that the difference in quality when applying the stamps makes this set worth the price difference. After a while, though, the scraping tool gets nail polish caught and built up where the metal meets the plastic. Still worth it (you can switch to using an old credit card for the scraper.)</li>
            <li> surface of stamper small and hard</li>
            <li> Works great. Takes  a little getting used to picking up the polish and properly aligning to the nail.</li>
            <li> Love it! After reading reviews for all possible nail stamper I settled on this one. I love that it&#x27;s double sided to accommodate for larger designs. First time using it was a little difficult (pictures got smudged) but it takes patience and focus to get it right. Both the sides the rubber stamp part actually comes all the way off which is great for cleaning. The scraper isn&#x27;t the best but gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Ordered Sunday night, got it by Saturday evening.</li>
            <li> Picks up nail polish perfectly! I use Sinful Colors nail polish because it is thick enough (and cheap but great) that the nail stamper picks up the color easily.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing stamper. It picks very crisp images like no other stamper will do. The only bad thing is that the rubber part is too hard and sometimes stamping with it is a little bit painful, especially if I have long nails at that time. I use a squishy-firm stamper nowadays, but this is the one I use when a polish/plate is being troublesome and no other stamper works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s about the big pink side. The small green side is the reason I use it the most because it&#x27;s really good for placing small designs where you want them.</li>
            <li> the best stamper.works like its suppose to.others are just imitators and don&#x27;t stamp the way there are suppose to.</li>
            <li> The scraper works better than the M.A.S.H. one.</li>
            <li> A credit card is probably a cleaner way to go since nail polish will be harder to clean in the corners of the metal/plastic, but this still works great. I am buying more for some friends, so that should tell you that I thought this product was good.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stamper and scraper. They work amazingly and transfer the image from the stamping plates to my nail wonderfully!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work so well for me. I tried multiple times and it just never really was that great. Maybe if you practiced a lot more with it, you&#x27;d be good, but it never really cut it for me.</li>
            <li> works as I expected it to, just need to figure out which polishes work best; love the different sizes available on double-ended stamper</li>
            <li> i am very happy with the purchase because this is what i have ordered and i am will order again.</li>
            <li> This stamper is easy to use and helps produce even designs. I love that it has two sized ends to use.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to get used to holding this.  The end &amp;#34;tapers&amp;#34; because of the size difference, but after a few times, I got used to it just fine.  The only reason this doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because the scraper pretty much failed on me.  Because it&#x27;s metal, it got nicked, so it left a funky line in all my designs.  I realized that an old gift card works perfect--better than the scraper ever did.  So, if your scraper lets you down, too, don&#x27;t despair!  Just grab an old gift card :)</li>
            <li> I have never tried a different stamping tool but I would say this one is pretty good for what its supposed to do. Stamping is alot more complicated than I thought it would be. You have to file down the rubber before your first use, because when I first started stamping I had a hard time trying to pick up the designs and transferring them to my nails. They would always go on blotchy. That also had to do with how fast you work when stamping and what type of nail polish you use. In time I got the hang of it, though its takes a few tries to get it perfect...when it does, its beautiful and therefore worth the price vs going to a nail salon.</li>
            <li> I have used this stamper, both sides, with great success. The two ends of the stamper are perfect for either stamping the whole nail (wide end) or stamping a small design on (green end). The scraper doesn&#x27;t scratch my metal art plates and wicks away the polish easily.&lt;br /&gt;I initially was interested in stampers when a vendor in the street showed it to me. These act very similarly to what was shown to me - they were selling Konad brand items. So I bought some plates from another company (Konad is a bit pricey on plates) but stuck to this brand for the stamper.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning up is as simple as wetting a cotton ball with polish remover and wiping.</li>
            <li> I got this right away. I really liked it. I though it was going to be bigger but it was actually just the right size not to big and not to small. It also stamps very well.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.  It did not work at all.  It just looked like polish run together. Waste!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this stamper/scraper for 5 months and it&#x27;s still going strong. I use it about twice a month and I love it!</li>
            <li> THE PREVIOUS STAMP I PURCHASED AT ULTA DID NOT WORK AT ALL.  I READ THAT KONAD WORKS BEST. I TRIED IT AND IT WORKS GREAT.  THE SCRAPER IS METAL AND SCRATCHED THE STAMP PLATES,  SO IT SHOULD BE MADE OF PLASTIC.  I USED AN OLD CREDIT CARD.</li>
            <li> I followed other people&#x27;s advice and gently filed the ends before using. It worked wonderfully after that. The scraper is not very useful, an old gift card works just fine in it&#x27;s place.</li>
            <li> This stamper works great!  Made a perfect image on my first attempt - having no stamping experience!  It only takes a few tests to find out how long it takes the polish to dry in the tray.</li>
            <li> Must use a fast, light hand to transfer designs from stamper to nail. Easy to clean and easy to take with you.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product when me and my mom got into nail art and stamping. This stamp in this set is very awesome! It&#x27;s a great quality and the fact that it has a larger and smaller size makes it even more awesome. That was the positive, the negative to this is that the scraper although it works well I don&#x27;t use it...I use a normal razor blade because it&#x27;s neater and seems to do the job better.</li>
            <li> it is very easy and I love decorating my nails with it - I did buy the less expensive plates not from Konad</li>
            <li> I tried this stamping product at a friends and it worked so well and looked so cool I wanted it too. But this stamp seems to not work as well, for some reason although it is the same brand. I guess it just takes a lot of practice. I think the stamper is ok, its the templates I am trying to use that do not make a good clear shape.</li>
            <li> Works very well, easy to use and clean. Designs are transferred exactly as plates are etched and come out flawlessly.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product! I&#x27;m new to stamping and nail art in general and with just a little practice, my nails look like a work of art! I love the fact that it&#x27;s 2 sided so it&#x27;s easier to do my toenails with the larger side for my big toe :-) would definitely recommend! With that being said make sure you use a nail polish that doesn&#x27;t stain. It&#x27;s almost impossible to remove from the scraper and stamper with certain nail polishes.</li>
            <li> The scraper scratches my plate! But the stamper is awesome. I use a generic plastic scraper instead so it doesn&#x27;t scratch my plates!</li>
            <li> This double ended stamper works really well for large images and small images. The two different sizes allow better precision when stamping. It also picks up the image very well because of the soft and squishy tips. So far I really love how it performs because the stamper is very easy to use. The reason I gave 4 stars is because the scraper is made of metal rather than plastic in which I was a somewhat disappointed. The metal scraper scratched into my stamp plate and ruined part of another pattern/image next to it when I was trying to scrape off the polish. Pretty sad, but all in all the double ended stamper is well worth the price and quality. I just used an old plastic membership card of credit card to scrape off polish from the plates instead of the metal scraper.</li>
            <li> I have gotten a few of my family members into nail stamping because I love nail stamping so much. So I ordered this for my cousin and I wanted to make sure to get the one I have because it is great quality. I have read other reviews of crappy stampers and I didn&#x27;t want to risk getting cheaper ones not knowing how well they worked. This stamper is wonderful and the price is awesome!</li>
            <li> The stamp works wonderful and the quality is there. Love that it is slimmer than other so you are able to stamp exactly where you want. The bigger ones for me are a little bit harder because it is seems harder to determine if you are stamping on point where you want.  Nothing else out there like this. THIS IS THE BEST DEAL and PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased &amp;#34;knock offs&amp;#34; from amazon before and none compare to this one! The scraper is PERFECT for the plates and the stamper picks up the design perfectly!</li>
            <li> Its a wonderful product. The stamper head is big enough to cover my nails and the small one is very useful for stamping the small images precisely. I generally use an old credit card to scrape the excess polish from the plate, so I havent used the scraper yet but the stamper is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to prime the stamper. It was picking up images but not very well. After priming it works like a charm. I just filed both the stamper heads lightly with a filer and then used a piece of scotch tape to clean the stamper. This one is not squishy but the head is softer than the little pink konad stamper that I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for polishes, I tried this stamper with both konad stamping polishes as well as normal polishes and it worked well with both. I am also attaching a photo of my very first manicure with this stamper and I used normal polishes for stamping.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these several weeks ago, I also have 3 different stampers from different brands.  This stamper is my fav.  It&#x27;s AWSOME , I have not had any bad transfers.  Well packaged, only thing takes 2-3 weeks shipping if you can wait this is a must have for all your stamping needs.</li>
            <li> I feel like I need to use it more and more to get the hang of it. It hasn&#x27;t come easy to me when I stamp on the nail but it could be the polish i&#x27;m using. I guess I need the real konad polish. But i love the idea</li>
            <li> I really love the stamper i even bought one for my daughter. It work very well. This would be a in item i would tell friends and family to get.</li>
            <li> Stamper is awesome! Scraper is awful. I just use an old hotel key card as my scraper and it works great.</li>
            <li> I love that I can do my fingers and toes with this stamper.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift. She loved it. Arrived when promised</li>
            <li> I picked up a $5 stamping kit at a local grocery store and I was having a really hard time with it. I watched endless videos on Youtube on stamping. When I received this one yesterday I was really surprised how easy it was. I used it with the white Konad nail polish - but also tried it on some paper with other brand nail polishes and it seemed to work great as well. I did not use the scraper cause of the reviews and instead used an old gift card. Some tips: Don&#x27;t press to hard - I noticed if I press the stamp to hard onto the plate the image transfers crooked from the pressure. - Always check the stamp before stamping it onto your nail to make sure the whole image has transferred. And always clean the stamp, image plate, and scraper after each use with Acetone nail polish remover (I use a Q-tip dipped in acetone. I did butterfly&#x27;s (uploaded an image) and I used the small side of the stamp! It worked perfectly. I am recommending this to all my friends! PLEASE: If you have problems watch videos on Youtube. There are some great ones out there that will help you to master the technique with a little practice. I am not a nail tech. I could not find anyone to do nice designs after we moved at the nail places in my area. I never did nails before like this. This was my FIRST time with Konard and if I can do it.... YOU can do it too!!! :D</li>
            <li> The stamper works fantastically, but the scraper was a crooked mess that made me think I suck as a professional Nail Tech.  I switched to a simple hotel key card and magically my stamping skillzzz have improved exponentially.  My fancy Nail Tech friends have good luck with it though; mine must have been a dud.  I like that this stamper doesn&#x27;t need to be &amp;#34;primed&amp;#34;; it works perfectly right out of the package.  It&#x27;s lasted me well over a year so far.  My first and only! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Works like a charm! I am 100% sold on this product.</li>
            <li> This works great, the scraper scratches the plate but I honestly don&#x27;t care because it doesn&#x27;t mess up the image one bit.</li>
            <li> Buy this! Don&#x27;t put up with with any other scraper that scratches your plates or stamper that is too stiff to pick up the image. Rolls the image on nicely.</li>
            <li> The stamper works perfect but I would recommend a plastic scraper or an old credit card. The metal one scratches the plates so bad.</li>
            <li> thanks first stamper bought and it seems to work</li>
            <li> Purchased this and another set.  The other set worked much better.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. IT is great. IT is one of the best Stamper I have ever used. I have constantly used this for my nails. It is great.</li>
            <li> Cam on time. no instructions needed. I just wish the scraper wasn&#x27;t metal, it tends to scratch up my Gals stamping plates :(</li>
            <li> Excellent two-headed stamp, works like a charm.  The metal of the scraper scratches my plates a bit, though. I&#x27;m probably going to use an old gift card to do the job instead.</li>
            <li> Recommend this product.  Works very well and I love the fact that it is two-sided.  Also very east to clean.</li>
            <li> Best stamper I own. Very ready to use picks up images well. Just don&#x27;t use with red it pink stamping Polish lol</li>
            <li> I like that I get two sides and the price is just great. I really don&#x27;t like the scraper because it leaves marks on my plates so I just use an old credit card instead.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to replace the MASH stamper and it is working out well.  I do wish the larger end was white because it is hard to see some polishes on pink.  Overall it is was a good purchase and I am able to practice my stamper alittle more now that I am happy with the Mash plates and Konad stamper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a cheaper stamper and scraper and this is definitely better. The surface of the stamper is sufficiently sized and the scraper doesn&#x27;t scratch the stamp plate like the cheap one does. Good product.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing, the stamper is great but the scraper not to much ...try not to put to much nail polish in the image plate.</li>
            <li> This is a great set.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like my plates to get scratched, so I made up my mind to avoid the scraper... Until I used my pliers and removed the blade.&lt;br /&gt;I sanded the edge and now I use the scraper only with the plastic part and works perfectly. I have other two stampers and nothing works like this! It is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Very, very, very happy!</li>
            <li> Me and my daughter have so much fun with this stamper and scraper.  After reading the reviews i knew i wanted to go with Konad and i am so glad i did.  So well worth the money.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> i spent 30 min trying to do my nails. didnt work. just left an awful mess!!! nail polish wouldnt stick to the stamp and when it did, it was blury. couldnt tell what it was supposed to be. lookes very very messy.</li>
            <li> I wish it came with more templates, but for the price a good product. I would recommend to other family and friends.</li>
            <li> This stamper has no problem picking up monad polish from nail plates. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now with no problems. I clean it with alcohol between uses and I&#x27;ve never had a problem getting a perfect stamp so far.</li>
            <li> I like this stamper my only complaint is the large side is pink so if you do pink polish it is hard to see.</li>
            <li> First off: You do NOT have to use stamping polish (Thicker polish does work better, however thin polish works as well it is just really light colored when you stamp) To use regular polish just gently buff the surface of the stamper with a nail file and it works GREAT. I had this stamper and the as seen on TV one. The first one I bought was the as seen on TV stamper to try it out and see if i like it, it was really stiff but still cool so I ordered the Konad one. I LOVE my konad stamper! It is amazing! It picks up and transfers the images perfectly!!! Would definitely recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> This does not work. I am a licensed nail tech. The prints are not clear, the images on the disc to copy are not engraved well to pick up and transfer the images. Wasted money</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted. What you see is what you get, along with this you might want to get stamping plates.</li>
            <li> Great sponge tips...and  loved the scraper it did NOT scratch my metal plates! Second one I &#x27;ve bought from you! when I need a new one I will order from you again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> works excellent i love it!!! i use regular polish and it work really good</li>
            <li> best stamper easy to use and easy to clean and sanitize between each use because it comes apart. Only stamper and scraper I would use!</li>
            <li> The stamper is fantastic quality, transfers images clearly without too much trouble. But the scraper is a little odd, and you have to have it at JUST the right angle to transfer clearly. Great product, could use a little work.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work.Or maybe it was just the nailpolish I was using.I was very disappointed.I don&#x27;t highly recommend it for young adults or older adults.</li>
            <li> I have several stamper/scrapers, but this is my go-to.  It is comfortable and easy to hold, some of the stampers are small and awkward.  I use the smaller side for smaller images and I find that it helps me &#x27;place&#x27; the image more precisely.  The large side, of course, I use for larger or full-nail images, only draw back is if I am stamping red or pink it is difficult to see the image on the red stamp.  I have recently purchased the same stamp set with a white large end to use for this purpose.  All in all a great tool for nail art stamping! I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I wanted to give it a try and I heard good reviews on youtube. Some of the prints were really difficult to make imprints. There are some that&#x27;s really pretty and easier to make imprints of. I definitely recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Konad Nail Art Double Ended Stamper from Seller: VIPTAO, i received my shipment today, just to find out that it&#x27;s a chinese knock off product (XiuYa) It also came with one set of fake eye lashes, really??? ANY way, DO NOT BUY FROM SELLER VIPTAO.  I HAVE requested money back, will see if I actually get my money back.</li>
            <li> works beautifully! the green stopper pops out sometimes but crazy glue can take care of that! mine wasnt the knock-off other people were talking about! its really easy to use, just add your color of polish on your design, scrap off extra with scraper, stamp design with stamper then roll onto your nail...BAM you got some cute nails for that hot date or work or for the heck of it! hahaha this stamper doesnt come with designs so dont forget to get those too!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy the knock off brands, buy a Konad!  Sure, they&#x27;re a little more expensive but they make a perfect stamp every time.  Their plates are expertly engraved so I&#x27;ve never had a problem getting a perfect stamp every time.  I never have voids or scratches or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stamper is great, it gives me a nice transfer every time.  I am learning how to get the best transfer from the stamp to my nail but that&#x27;s not this stampers fault!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use this scraper, I use old gift cards and old credit cards instead.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work! Simple as that. Stamper doesn&#x27;t pick polish up of the image plate. Maybe there is some secret to the process...but we couldn&#x27;t get it to work.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the Konad double sided stamper.  The small green side is great to pick up the smaller images and for more precise stamping.  The larger red size i found not to be as larger as my original konad stamper.  But I still think this is a great stamper to have if it will be your first cause you certainly will get much use out of both sides.</li>
            <li> I ordered this stamper and scraper set and upon my first use, I couldn&#x27;t get an image to appear on the stamper.  I tried the &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; Konad polish, I tried regular polish and NOTHING worked!!!  Then I remembered one of the YouTube videos advice about &amp;#34;roughing up&amp;#34; the stampers with a nail file.  I did that, and BOOM, it worked.  I am now a stamping fanatic!!!!</li>
            <li> This stamper and scraper are durable, cute, and yield very good and clear results for nail stamping.  I am quite pleased with them!</li>
            <li> buena calidad y asi, llego a tiempo, llego lo que esperaba y todo muy bien ahora ya lo estoy usando y creo fue buena compra</li>
            <li> I originally had the stamper and scraper from the salon express kit from Sally&#x27;s, hated it. This one works so much better. 100% recommend.</li>
            <li> I am a beginner and find this product easy to use. Picks up image well.</li>
            <li> This item is the best product to use for nail stamping. If you are thinking about starting to do nail stamping do NOT use Salon Express, it will just make you frustrated. Go straight to Konad Brand, this one takes away all the hasle :)</li>
            <li> So easy to use with either hand.  Picks up images and transfers them well.  The scraper does scratch the plates, but I&#x27;ve not noticed it marring the design at all.  The larger end is great for my first four nails and the smaller end gives me versatility with my pinkie and small designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Troubleshooting advice:  I did run a fine-grit buffing block over the rubber ends prior to the first use and I clean the stamper with acetone between each application.  Not had any problems so far.</li>
            <li> I like this because it has two sides i can the small side and use patterns from the big plates to transfer smaller images to my small nails.  its really cute</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter&#x27;s 8th birthday &amp; it was a huge hit with all the kids!  It&#x27;s a little tricky for kids to use, but they were just as happy picking out the designs and colors and letting me do the stamping.</li>
            <li> I bought the konad set and it came with the single ended stamper which works great. I love it. I decided to buy the double ended stamper because the smaller tip for little nails like my granddaughter and her friends. Also toes it is easier to see. I will get alot of use out of it. It is great. Konad products are great.</li>
            <li> WHAT THEY SENT ME WA NOT EVEN BY \\&quot;KONAD\\&quot; IT WAS BY \\&quot;KAND\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I should have known by the price that something was wrong with it, but i have it a chance and they screwed me over.</li>
            <li> I like the quality of this stamper, and I did receive a Konad brand, I&#x27;m not sure why others did not. As others suggested here I used an old store card instead of the metal scraper, I&#x27;ve never used it as the idea of it did not appeal to me. The store card will still leave marks on your plate, but only very fine marks where you scrap it, and nothing at all that will mess up your image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate that the stamper itself is double sided and have used that to my advantage. Also it&#x27;s worth mentioning that the rubber ends of the stamper can be pulled out, if you need them to for whatever reason. One time I put the rhinestones that I was going to use for a friends manicure in there, that way all I had to do was open up the stamper, it came in handy, so there&#x27;s an idea. You wouldn&#x27;t want to put anything too heavy in there of course as it would push the ends off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s really all I say about this product other then some quick tips about doing stamping itself. I have found that it IS best to clean off the stamper between stamping even if its just collected dust, it will help. Then when you go to pick up an image make sure you do the process quick, paint, scrap, then roll your stamper over it with a firm steady hand. You have a small amount of time to position the image after you have it on the stamp, but don&#x27;t wait too long as the image is so thin it will dry fast and probably mess up when you go to put it on. I&#x27;ve found if you figure out a way that is best for you, stamp that way every time, to reduce the time it takes. I was having trouble with stamping until I got down a system where I could do it quickly, that really helped. Also be careful not to press the hard edges of the stamper into your nail if it&#x27;s still drying, as it will dent your polish. Once the image is on the nail make sure you&#x27;re very careful about putting on a top coat as that can smudge your image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helped. Happy Stamping!</li>
            <li> This stamper kit works well. The blade does scratch the plates some but it is expected. You could use a plastic card instead if it bothered you that much.</li>
            <li> First and foremost... the scraper sucks, so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars. In all of the nail stamping sets I&#x27;ve found, the included scraper is just a piece of crap and doesn&#x27;t do much other than scratch up your plates. Instead, use an old credit card - that&#x27;s what I do, and it&#x27;s much more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, down to the review - it&#x27;ll be short and sweet. If you do any sort of nail stamping, you need this double ended stamper and scraper. It&#x27;s awesome, and it makes it easy to do stamps quickly since it&#x27;s double sided. I do still recommend roughing up the edges with a nail-file before using. When I did this, the rubber stoppers both came out, but they popped right back in and have been relatively secure since. I use it a couple of times a week when I do my nails or my friend&#x27;s nails, and it&#x27;s made it much easier. At the price, it really can&#x27;t be beat, either.</li>
            <li> I took the recommendations from other buyers in purchasing the Konad brand stamper.  I am glad I did!  Both sizes work well depending upon the size of the stencil.  My daughter can use this without any help.</li>
            <li> I sometimes have trouble with the scraper. Sometimes the stamper doesn&#x27;t pick up the pattern completely either, although that may be because of the type of polish. But when it works, it really works well.</li>
            <li> I like this long rubber stamper I want to try the smaller version just to maybe travel with and to see how much more of an impression...</li>
            <li> Overall good product, I got exactly what I was expecting. The seller shipped it to me very quickly. I think it came in three to four days after purchasing it. My friend has this exact stamper so I knew what to expect.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend purchased this to go with a Nail Art Polish Stamp Plates. So far she says that it is working great.</li>
            <li> The double sides help when it comes to nail stamping. Of course the scraper doesn&#x27;t work as effectively as a old gift card but it gets the job done without an issue.</li>
            <li> It was here super fast and works like a charm!! Good price and just what I was looking for. Great brand too!</li>
            <li> I use it all the time.. Truly gets the image on the first time..&lt;br /&gt;Happy customer here.. Works great😊&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picky buyer</li>
            <li> Works well.  We use an old gift card for a scraper though... It just works better.</li>
            <li> Not great quality, but fine for occasional use.</li>
            <li> Konad stamper is the way to go. Don&#x27;t even bother looking at the others.</li>
            <li> its very easy to use the best feature is the two sizes that you get on each sides</li>
            <li> The nail stamper and scraper was a good buy. I like that the stamper has two sides. the scraper can be quite a mess to use and clean though.</li>
            <li> Makes stamping easy.  I have not tried any other stampers so I can not comment on this compared to others but this really makes stamping easy and fun.  I do not use the scraper as I have heard that it scratches your plates so I just use old gift cards.</li>
            <li> I had another Konad  stamper before. What I like about this one is the double edge. What I didn&#x27;t  like is that is comes with a very shiny surface what makes difficult  to get the stamp from the plates. I had to look for videos in YouTube  to figure  out. I solved filing it with a gentle  nail file.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that for my 1st stamper and for me being a beginner to nail stamping i dont regret buying this @all..it works perfect (:</li>
            <li> This scraper wasn&#x27;t working and this wasn&#x27;t the authentic Konad. So I had to purchase another one in store myself.</li>
            <li> I was wanting a stamper and scraper and this was at a good price.  When it came it was just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Since my wife loves to do her own nails I decided to get her a ton of nail art supplies and she was very happy with this item specifically.</li>
            <li> this does the job it is intented to do..... gets really messy if you dont keep the blade clean though</li>
            <li> I definitely don&#x27;t plan on returning it, but I just can&#x27;t figure out how to use the thing properly. I do most of my nail art freehand, but I bought this mostly for whole nail designs and for cute additions on clients. My nails are about 3/4 longer than my nail bed and there is no way I would be able to transfer an image consistently with the two stampings I would need for my entire nail. Also, either the image transfers halfway or not at all! I refuse to buy special polishes at this point, as I have seen loads of tutorials on Youtube using polishes I already own, but I may decide to in the future if I can&#x27;t get the hang of it. I have had the most success with Orly Luxe, China Glaze Champagne Bubbles and Celeb City by Sally Hansen. I practice on false nails that are quite flat and I&#x27;m usually successful, but then I fail on my own nails! So I&#x27;m assuming the problem is nailing down the roll necessary to transfer the image to a natural nail shape, mine are sort of a &amp;#34;c&amp;#34; shape. I should also point out the wells of the image plates are so shallow that the polish dries quite quickly, so you have to be quick! So, I guess, word of advice, plan on spending some time nailing down your technique. Perhaps it will come more naturally to others. :)</li>
            <li> I tried and did not like.  I wanted to, but I do not.  Even with the Konad polish, the stamping does not work for me.</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier to put designs on my nails than when i used to paint them on myself. My only problem with it is that i have to put a lot of polish on the plate i use so then more gets on the scraper and it gets everywhere. i recommend putting down news paper or something you don&#x27;t mind gets ruined. My bed spread is a little red now because the scraper dripped.</li>
            <li> This item Arrived quickly and exactly as shown in the picture. I was hesitant at first because a few reviewers said they received knock off brands, but I received it exactly as described! Going to order so e more for my friends who love doing their nails!</li>
            <li> My tween and teen can use this themselves and love doing their nails. We bought the Shany 2012 Stamp Image plates to go with it. We didn&#x27;t have directions but found a great how-to video on You Tube that showed us how to use the stamper. They&#x27;ve had a great time with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister along with a white konad nail polish and one konad stamping nail art image plate for her birthday and she loved it.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know if its me or the product, as others seem to have no problem with the Konad stamping system. My experience is picks up 1 in every 3 to 4 attempts. i still use it because when you can get the image on the stamper and on your nail its awesome and always looks great.</li>
            <li> Does the job well. I like the fact that it&#x27;s double sided.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the stamp.  I did find using an old credit card to rub off the excess polish works better than the blade in this package.  Good product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really good with these yet, So I don&#x27;t have much to say, It works well though.  Uh Yes.</li>
            <li> Good quality and works really well with my Pueen stamp plate set I purchased. Easy to use</li>
            <li> Love the stamper. Scraper scratches plates</li>
            <li> Great nail stamp for the price, although the scraper doesn&#x27;t get close enough to really smooth out the polish on the design, I ended up having to use an old credit card. Otherwise, it&#x27;s easy to transfer designs and easier to clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> I wish it were larger since my nails are long. It doesn&#x27;t fully cover long nails. Sometimes you have to stamp a nail twice for full coverage which could ruin the look of the design. Like I said, this is only because my nails are long. I still like this product.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for Stamping. Took me a a second, but I figured it out. I Luv it!</li>
            <li> My last one broke after little use. This is a replacement. It worked while it lasted, which wasn&#x27;t long at all. The scraper bent in places leaving polish streaks and scratching plates. The rubber stamper knobs popped off both ends repeatedly and I glued them back on. The little holes and channels on the scraper catch polish which is messy. I think these are flimsy tools, but I like having a large and small side stamper for image transfer. The rubber stamps do a good job when they don&#x27;t pop off though. I almost bought the all in one unit, but went with this wanting less polish mess by keeping them separated for easier cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, polishes dry really fast after scraping, so you&#x27;ve gotta move fast between the two tool moves and there&#x27;s not much time to gauge nail image placement. All systems do that however - except maybe UV/LED gel polishes which don&#x27;t show up well and run a bit so detail is lost. To sandwich conventional stamp polish onto a gel mani, I have to remove the sticky layer first and let it dry really well, before the topcoat cure, or the image is smudgy.</li>
            <li> The stamper is simply the best. I love that you can choose from a really wide or smaller stamp face. The scraper I can do without however. I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and although it dose what it should it also has damaged on of my plates :(</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical of this entire concept, but I was too impressed and envious of all the cool nail-art I was seeing online (mostly on Pinterest and some blogs). I bought MASH plates and this Konad stamper. It works amazingly well; I love it. My first few attempts were failures but after some practice (and some YouTube tutorials) I&#x27;m starting to get the hang of it. Stamping LIGHTLY on the plate and (rolling it) lightly on the nail works much better than pressing the crap out of it like you sort of instinctively want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YouTube videos suggested to use an old credit card instead of the scraper that comes with the stamper, and I agree--it&#x27;s much kinder to the design on the plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad this thing is two-sided....I have very small fingers (I wear a size 3 wedding ring) and the smaller, green side works perfectly for applying full-nail designs to my pinky nail and index finger nail, for instance, while the larger, pink side works well for my thumb, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really killer product. Every girl should have it! (Make sure you get nail polish that is thick--thin polish you usually have to apply several coats of when regularly painting your nails will create a very light, hard-to-see stamp).</li>
            <li> These are very easy to use and they make your nails look great.  These are very easy to use and they work great.</li>
            <li> Does everything it says it does, comes with the nail stamper and scraper.  I&#x27;ve read reviews on the cheaper ones that say that they don&#x27;t work at all, so if you&#x27;re looking for a cheaper alternative, spend the extra dollar and go with Konad.</li>
            <li> its good product for beginners as well as experts.. loved the quality.. I replaced the scraper with an old gift card though.. the stamper has 2 sides which can be used for fingers and toes.. no problem ordering or receiving it! yes I do recommend the product.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice set.  I like that it has two stamping ends.  The little scraper thing works, but it could be a lot better.  Some people use an old credit card or gift card instead.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent quality product, and so much fun to use. Before discovering this I used nail decals, which although nice, were expensive and one time use. With Konad stamper and some nail stamping plates, I can create whatever design in whatever color I desire, and if I find a design I love I can use it as much as I want :)</li>
            <li> The stamper works as intended and it is nice to have two stamps in one.  The scraper that my set came with had a blade that was tilted at a bit of an angle, so the construction looked kind of shoddy.  It is still usable, but people have mentioned alternative scrapers that may work better.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and arrived exactly as pictured, I use this constantly and haven&#x27;t had any problems with the blade scraping my plates or the stamps not transfering correctly. I would reccomend this to ANYONE who wants to start stamping :)</li>
            <li> Why waste money on decals when you can recreate your own images with this stamper and a few imaging plates.  This is the best purchase I&#x27;ve made.. I can do so many nails and its so simple.  Everyone can do this, no experience required!</li>
            <li> I bought this kit for my niece along with the white polish and a 21 piece stamping plate kit and she loves them. It takes a little practice rolling the images on, but once mastered your nails will look very professional.</li>
            <li> I love doing nail art, but sometimes I just don&#x27;t feel like doing it, so an easy fast fun way to spice up my fingertips is to use the stamping art! I love this, and the price! I recommend buying it! You must buy art plates, and the Konad polishes! Love, Love ♥</li>
            <li> This stamper works well and would be even better if the stamps I purchased worked better. As others have reviewed this they say to not use the scraper for it scratches up your plates and I must agree. Using an old gift card works the best.</li>
            <li> I really love this! I bought this for about $5 and it was the most reasonable price I found throughout the websites. It works wonderfully if used properly. I am in love with this. Makes designs faster than by hand.</li>
            <li> Perfect for nail stamping! The tip stays soft and transfers the stamp images perfectly. I have one and bought one as a gift!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m obsessed with nail stuff, this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had! It picks up very good and prints well! Happy with the result! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just getting into nail stamping after seeing so many cute manicures online.  I read multiple times that Konad is the best of the best and even if you fail with other stampers, try again with the Konad.  I like it a lot and it&#x27;s smaller than I was expecting which is good because it&#x27;s easier to hold.  I don&#x27;t want to scratch my metal plates though so I use an old gift card instead of the metal scraper.  I&#x27;ve also read that gently filing the stamp heads with a nail file helps your polish grab onto the stamper better, if you&#x27;re having transferring problems.</li>
            <li> This nail stamper is pretty cool and works fairly well. The reason I gave it 3 stars out of 5 was because it doesn&#x27;t work with every nail polish. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because of the stamp or because of the polish but some colors don&#x27;t pick up at all and other colors it picks up perfectly. I found the red side much more useful and practically never use the green one. I feel like the red side picks up colors and the green one doesn&#x27;t. When the color does pick up it works wonders and the designs look really awesome. The scraper works really well; just make sure you clean it after each use.</li>
            <li> . Tried multiple time and even had my friends try it and it just does not work at all. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> THis system takes some practice to get used to. My sister had one and did my nails. I liked it so much I got my own. It takes some mistakes before you can really get the hang of it, but I like it and I get compliments all the time on my nails when I use it. I think the animal prints plate is a good starting point for beginers because you don&#x27;t have to worry about placement looking off with those designs.</li>
            <li> I really like the Konad brand. The rubber stamp is really nice and cleans up well. It was fast to ship and packaged well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used and loved Konad&#x27;s regular stamper, and wondered if purchasing this one would be redundant, but I&#x27;ve enjoyed using the smaller, more precise stamping end more than I expected. I have tragically short nail beds, and the smaller stamper really helps me align designs more accurately on my last two fingernails. The scraper, of course, also works very well. I usually keep a cotton pad soaked in nail polish remover sandwiched in a layer of paper towel, and it lets me wipe off the stamp and scraper quickly as I go without getting cotton fluff all over both of them. Easy peasy.</li>
            <li> Did not get this to work, tried and tried.  Followed tips from other reviewers but still couldn&#x27;t get it to work.</li>
            <li> I hi bjb kh bib khb khb khbk hbjh bkj bi bib kh bib khb khb khb kh bi b</li>
            <li> nice.  like the two different sizes, easy to hold and use.  worked great right out of the package.</li>
            <li> ok you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Works exactly as expected. I use it with the Wistonia stamping plates and its perfect. Cleanly applies the image and easy to use. Affordable price and a great stamper.</li>
            <li> It picks up the stamps easily. I&#x27;m still learning how to use it</li>
            <li> It may be my lack of experience using this type of product, but I could not get it to print the entire design. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Product was great &amp; fast delivery! Will order again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> The stamper is so so great, but the metallic scraper, with time, scratch the plates</li>
            <li> Works great!  I took one star away only because the scraper is hard to clean and sometimes not the best, depending on what plate I&#x27;m using.  I often use an old gift card instead.</li>
            <li> The stamper is great. It is long enough to be comfortable to hold, and the dual ends make stamping your whole nail possible and centering a small stamp easier. The scraper scratches plates, so use an old ID or credit card for the scraping. It will extend the life of your plates.</li>
            <li> This works like a carm for your stamping needs !</li>
            <li> Worked great for picking up images froom any plate, no matter the brand. The scraper does scratch my plates though, it doesn&#x27;t bother me, if this bothers you try investing in a plastic scraper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best one but it is very worth it for that price!</li>
            <li> I just tried my Konad stamper again last night, for only the second time, and I&#x27;m already getting better at it! My biggest problem is centering the stamp onto my fingernail so I can get the entire design.</li>
            <li> I just received this today, and was very excited to try it.  This was my first time using ANY nail stamper.  I was NOT disappointed!  Both the stamper and the scraper worked fine.  I used this with CHEEKY nail plates, and did not have a problem with the stamper picking up or transferring the image, and did not have a problem with the scraper causing scratches on my plates, even though the scraper is metal.  The stamper required very little cleaning because 98% of the image transferred to my fingernail.  It is a rubbery material, so anything that did need to be cleaned off came off in a snap with nail polish remover.  The scraper worked fine, leaving the perfect image to be stamped.  I would recommend trying this set!</li>
            <li> it does the job... but took a little work to get it down..</li>
            <li> This helps scrape off the polish off the metal plates.  Try it a few times to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to use for easy designs.  Great for teens!</li>
            <li> Worked great even as a first time stamper. So much better than the Pueen one that I also ordered.</li>
            <li> Order arrived much sooner than the estimated date. This stamper works great just like all the reviews said. It is KONAD- the real deal. Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but it arrived exactly as pictured. i&#x27;m still exited about using it, but my plates haven&#x27;t arrived yet. however, it looks like it&#x27;ll be very useful! Can&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li> This does not work. No matter how many times i read the instructions and even look up tutorials on youtube, this does not work. Save your money. I wish i would of.</li>
            <li> I love this....my pack was black insted of pink but really good</li>
            <li> Super great love that&#x27;s it&#x27;s dubble sided, nice and soft, picks up design easily.</li>
            <li> what more can i say...its a konad stamper. the best in the world!! me and my girls have a blast stamping with it!!</li>
            <li> This tool works great but the plates and polish I bought to use this with are useless.  Not sure what else I can use such a good scraper with but will hang on it.</li>
            <li> This one is a keeper. If you have an instagram account and if you love posting new nail design on your bio then you need this. Very fun and easy to use &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It takes practice to get using this product down but when you do, it&#x27;s so much fun! I didn&#x27;t like the scraper though, I opted for an old membership card. Worked better!</li>
            <li> This is what you need if you are going to stamp.  This stamp is great for full nail and partial nail designs.  Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Last year, I began stamping and decided at the start that I did not want to go the Konad branded route. I&#x27;ve not used the Konad plates, or the Konad stamping polish, I just didn&#x27;t want to bother with Konad when there&#x27;s plenty of other interchangeable brands that -don&#x27;t- claim to be The Only One. I&#x27;ve been very happy with polishes and plates of tons of different brand, and I&#x27;ve never felt like I was missing anything because of that... but when it comes to the stamper, oh my. I bought myself a Konad stamper and thought of it as just standard, until I bought three stampers of various brands as gifts and realized that stampers are NOT all equal. The Konad stamper is FAR superior to all three other brands and if I had started with another brand stamper, I&#x27;d probably have given up after a day. The difference is in the rubber. The Konad stamper&#x27;s rubber is soft and kind of &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;, yet firm and strong. It lifts images from any brand plates, any brand of thick polish, and it just... works. The other brands had awful hard plasticy rubber that wouldn&#x27;t hold an image, and two of them had very rounded ends so it was impossible to pick up an image and then put it on your nail without rolling it around - so even if it picked up the image at all, which was rare, it just wasn&#x27;t a smooth process and didn&#x27;t have good results. The Konad stamper is the only stamper that has QUALITY rubber ends, and that makes all the difference. (As for the other piece in this package, I find old credit/gift cards easier to scrape image plates with- maybe it&#x27;s the size and shape that makes it easier- but as long as it&#x27;s firm, flat, and can scrape cleanly, you can&#x27;t go wrong with a scraper tool)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to play with, and it makes beautiful nail arts. I have many compliments every time I put on new nail arts. A great buy!</li>
            <li> super happy with my buy...the stamp is just fantastic and it works with any stamping plates not only konad....totally recommended ..</li>
            <li> Although I did not receive my entire order 1st time thru, they were quick to remedy problem.  These are great because you have a small stamp for tiny nails (my granddaughters) and larger nails like my toenails.  Got 4 so I could give some to the girls as well with their own kits.  We have so much fun with these!</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time and was exactly as described online. Stamper works great, scraper does not. Scraper is a metal material that scratches my image plates! I use an old plastic card in place of the scraper. Would not recommend this product.  Try looking for the stamper only.</li>
            <li> Works well with stamp plates I have!</li>
            <li> I like the stamper itself because of the smaller end.  It makes it easier to place stamp in correct position on nail.  However, I have only gotten the stamp to transfer from the template to the stamper a few times.  I am going to continue to practice, but at this point I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Great value for a quality product that works perfectly with any nail stamping plates. It smoothly picks up the polish and transfers it to your nail. No complaints!</li>
            <li> I just got my Konad stamper, and I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve gone this long without it. Being impatient and a \\&quot;learn by doing\\&quot; type, although I did watch a YouTube video while I was waiting for this to arrive, I tore it open and got right to stamping. Even with no practice and cheap polish, my nails look amazing and professionally done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what another reviewer meant about \\&quot;filing\\&quot; your stamper before you use it; I didn&#x27;t do anything to prep the stamper or scraper except for taking them out of the package, and they worked just fine. I used a gold chrome from Wet n&#x27; Wild as my base color, and a black polish from Color Cosmetic that I picked up super cheap - six polishes for $5. That combo worked great; the Color Cosmetic black goes on opaque and is super for stamping (the WnW gold chrome is a little too faint as a stamping color but great as a base).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stamper cleaned up beautifully. The scraper was a little harder to clean up and still has some staining on the plastic handle, but I&#x27;m probably going to try using an old gift card instead, as the metal blade put some very light scratches on my stamping plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stamper is a must for anyone who&#x27;s addicted to doing their nails. Shipping was very fast and even though the stamper comes in protective plastic, the seller also put it in a nice thick padded envelope, so it arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many times to stamp on my nails with this product with no results whatsoever.  Tried expensive nail polish, cheap ones and everything in between and images never transfers complete. Not even with Konad polish. The scrapper scratched all my plates as well.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I became interested in nail stamping I did some research &amp; found that the Konad stamper/scraper set was all the buzz &amp; after trying it out for myself I know why! It makes nail stamping easy for beginners with the dual sided stamper for smaller &amp; larger images. The stamper is firm yet squishy enough to transfer entire designs to the nail. (Squishy is something to look for so when you&#x27;re doing full nail designs the stamper can reach every curve/groove/edge of the nail for a clean, complete look.) The scraper works fantastically when used properly (at a 45 degree angle). All positive things to say about this set! I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> I liked the actual stamper piece.  However, the scraper did a horrible job of actually scrapping off the excessive polish from the groves.  The stamper actually did some of the work that the scraper should have done.  I will be looking to buy a new scraper.</li>
            <li> product was of poor quality and hard to keep frpm smearing, took lots of practice to get it right, I only used it a few times and decied I didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little investment. I do have a little trouble with the small green stamp, but the pink works great. With a little practice, it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I really like this stamper, you and use the small end for the small images and stamp them anywhere you like and the larger side works perfect for the whole finger nail stamp works great. I would buy from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> I ordered this to go along with the monster bundle (purchased separately) and it works Ok. At first, it wasn&#x27;t picking up anything on the plates, and then I did some research and you have to file the tops of the stamps to make it a little more rough. After I did that, it worked great! The scraper that comes with it is useless, (which is why I only gave it four stars) it scratches the heck out of the plates, and so I had to use and old credit card. Overall, for the price, I am happy with it. The scraper should be plastic though, not metal.</li>
            <li> The stamp and scraper work well, it is my first time using stamping tools. I would recommend them to prospective buyers.</li>
            <li> First the stamper. Its nice to have the double side with the big and the small side and it pics up and transfers images nicely but the pink color makes it hard to see the images that you have picked up. Also the rubber is a bit hard so sometimes when I&#x27;m trying to press the image on it slides and smudges the images. Its also a bit small for my nails but apparently my nails are bigger than average. I am going to buy one of the bigger softer ones just as soon as I find out where they are sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scraper I did not like, the metal DOES scratch your plates. I dont really care if it scratches the empty spots I am concerned that it will scratch and distort an adjacent image. The first use it scratched my plate and I immediately traded it for an old membership card that works just as well. Also because there is a little ledge where the scraper blade is inserted into the scraper polish tends to collect on the scraper blade and makes it difficult to scrape with (it leaves a film of polish around the image). I&#x27;m using it because its what I have but I am looking for something else.</li>
            <li> Love this...doesn&#x27;t what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Just make sure you wipe the end you&#x27;re using off with remover between each print.</li>
            <li> I like that it is easy and comfortable to use and that the stamper has 2 different sizes.  I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the scraper since it seemed a little too narrow for some of the stamps I was using but honestly I only bought it to get the stamper and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  I have used it with both the Shany &amp; Cheeky brand stamps and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Does not work like shown on you tube videos. You can&#x27;t get a clear stamp on nail.!!! Not Recommended for those seeking an easy way to get art on your nails!!!</li>
            <li> I love the metal scrapper I prefer it to the plastic one and I totally love the double sided stamper for different sizes and the different color I use to stamp the images one my nails.</li>
            <li> fast shipment and great product :)</li>
            <li> The stamper works perfectly with the right nail polish from the beginning...no need to file or rough-up.  I do however us an expired gift card instead of the scraper because the scraper was scratching my stamp plates.</li>
            <li> It is better than I expected. The designs go on sooo easy. I rarely do my nails until now.  For someone who polishes her nails about once a year, I&#x27;ve done them 5 times in just this month. If your not sure, GO FOR IT!! Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this has been using for sometime now and does what it advertises for a minimal investment. Given the amount of use it gets I would say it is good purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product, arrived on time. The smaller end of the stamper is a firmer rubber, and the larger pink end is a squishy rubber that picks up the polish well.</li>
            <li> I had bought a small stamper for nail art with the original kit. I like this one much better because the stamping surface is much larger, so it gets the entire nail with a pattern.</li>
            <li> perfect for my daughter</li>
            <li> The stamper itself is fine, but it seems a bit small for my use. I bought it specifically to do my toenails as I can&#x27;t have my nails painted for work.  Even the larger side gives me no extra room for user error when doing my big toe, and I don&#x27;t have larger than average toenails.  You can&#x27;t even pull up a whole stamp from a plate because it doesn&#x27;t fit on it.  I knew when ordering it that it might not work for my toes, so that&#x27;s not a big deal. The larger stamp measures one inch exactly, so if you have long nails it may not work for you as well. If you are using it strictly for your hands and you have short nails, it should work fine.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the scraper.  Stamper worked ok after buffing the surface.</li>
            <li> This Konad Stamper is perfect for making images on your nails.  You may have to &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; it up a little with a fine nail file to allow it to &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; at first, or it might be too slick to &amp;#34;take&amp;#34; the image, but it&#x27;s not hard to do.  Great for smaller images on the narrower of the two ends.</li>
            <li> A good addition to my nail kit</li>
            <li> Fun to do , fast service</li>
            <li> I waited over 3 weeks for this product. I was extremely anxious to use it with the konad plates  i purchased at the same time (they showed up in 3 days...) I was disappointed when I applied the image and the rubber end pushed down into the tube. I was using the large pad. After I re-engineered the stamper it worked great. It gets the job done after some tweaking. It was inexpensive - you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to have the item to put the designs on the nail and it came with nothing.</li>
            <li> When she say this item she said that she had to have it. It was just what she was looking for.</li>
            <li> I only really use the smaller side of stamper, its easier to control.  I do not use the scrapper!!  I use a old credit card it seems to work just as good!</li>
            <li> I got the konad stamping set because I heard it was the best to use with the konad stamping plates. Although I bought a set of 100 nail stamping plates, not all of them are konad brand (but there are a lot that look exactly like the konad plates) this stamping set works so much better! The double sided stamper is perfect because it has a small green stamper on one end which works for all the small designs, and the large red stamper on the other end is perfect for the larger designs and designs for the tips and entire nail. And the scraper included is one of the best. It doesn&#x27;t scratch the plate like other scrapers. But when using the scraper, it works best when you wipe it after every scrape. (Which is 10 times at least) all in all, it was the best purchase and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly and I am able to create beautiful nail art with this product. I would recommend it to everyone! :)</li>
            <li> I love nail art and trying new ways of getting great designs. This works well enough with a bit of practice. I have even used it with other polish besides Konads.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m a first time stamper, I still have to practice centering the images in my nails.&lt;br /&gt;But Konad works well.</li>
            <li> i would have given it a 5 star if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that for me like some of the other reviewers have stated that you have to file the stamper (both sides) because it didn&#x27;t transfer the image at all until i filed the rubber part (gotta confess i thought it would damage the stamper to do this but it doesn&#x27;t damage it at all) after doing so it has worked amazingly. So my thoughts is if some of the reviewers have the same problem they should add it to the product description, besides that  this was a great buy!</li>
            <li> I owned a stamper that wasn&#x27;t Konad and it wouldn&#x27;t work so I ordered these and it is great! It works and i&#x27;m happy. Also the shipping was quick and price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> This stamper and scraper are very easy to work with, and it is double ended with different size for different designs.</li>
            <li> This was a great price for this product.  I have ordered separately the discs for the stamper.  I am very excited to start using it!</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying my konad double side stamping kit. I like the fact of it being double sided my nails are short so the smaller is great for them.</li>
            <li> HAVE YET TO TRY IT, BUT LOOKS PRETTY EASY. LOOKING FORWARD TO TRYING IT OUT. HOPE I GET THE HANG OF IT.</li>
            <li> I ordered a KONAD stamper and scraper and received a made in China knockoff! Not at all what is pictured! It came in a clear plastic bag, not a hard plastic one like in the picture. The package is clearly labeled Stamping Nail Art as the brand,and says it is made in China. I have this item and was ordering another as a gift.and when compares it is clearly different. Disappointed and now it seems I can&#x27;t get a replacement, as it was not fulfilled by Amazon. Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;**Update**  The company very kindly issued a refund without me having to deal with shipping it back.  Quick response, as well.  They could not, however, ship me the product pictured.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work good with any mail polish, I wish I can use it, I just give up with konad products</li>
            <li> Need to buy a nail polish the same brand, it has to be thick for this to work. Have to work fast.</li>
            <li> Use this with the Konad Stamping Nail Art Image Plate and it is so easy. One tip is to clean the stampers, scraper and plate with rubbing alcohol instead of acetone nail polish remover, so you won&#x27;t damage the plate and melt away the rubber stamp tips.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d read the reviews before I started using the product. The first 10 or so times I tried to use this, I failed so utterly that I was sure the product was a waste. Suggestions to view YouTube tutorials were spot-on. This system took me a lot of getting used to, but it&#x27;s so worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that using a nail buffer (not the more abrasive file, but y&#x27;know, a softer buff) on the new stamper did help take some of the waxy sheen off that made initial stamp transfers extra challenging, while also not destroying the equipment. Also found that an old credit card as a scraper worked consistently much better than the metal or plastic versions I got in these kits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also experimented with non-Konad polishes, and found good luck getting a solid stamp out of really any thick opaque polishes out there. Expensive polishes versus cheap-o versions really didn&#x27;t make a difference, it was the thickness/opaqueness that won out. Deep matte polishes make especially great stamps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the patience to potentially fail a lot and go through a lot of cleaning &amp; re-work, you really will get the hang of it. I&#x27;m majorly cosmetically/beauty product challenged, but now get compliments from random folks &amp; even the ladies at the nail salons for the fancy crap I&#x27;ve been able to pull off with this nifty little system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dazzling possibilities become super exciting, and the fact that once you get this down, you can make pretty sweet insta-amaze-o designs on your nails in less than 10 minutes is handy and feels like winning/cheating at being fabulous.</li>
            <li> They sent me the smaller stamper that isn&#x27;t double sided and is a dollar cheaper instead of this. Not a huge deal because the seller gave me a dollar refund and I decided to keep the smaller stamper. 4 stars out of 5 for the prompt and good customer service.</li>
            <li> Received item quickly.  It was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> This is the second set I&#x27;ve ordered. (Only reason I needed to replace previous one is because if a mischievous puppy, if it weren&#x27;t for her I wouldn&#x27;t needed the replacement )</li>
            <li> Complicated and hard to use.</li>
            <li> Nice and use it all the time.</li>
            <li> this makes using my stamping plates much better</li>
            <li> I have a stamper from another brand and this one is SO much better!  I get nice clean stamps with this stamper.  I use an old gift card instead of the metal scraper to save me plates from being scratched.</li>
            <li> I love this little stamp. Quick, easy, no prepping needed. Also really easy to clean, great brand for nail art.</li>
            <li> Had to see many YouTube videos to use it right way but still not perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I would say just gets your nails done from a professional....useless trying yourself</li>
            <li> If you are using it correctly, you shouldn&#x27;t have any problems. It is exactly as described, easy to use and easy to clean! Love it.</li>
            <li> The rubber stamper works well. As for the scraper, not so well. The blade scratches my plates and doesn&#x27;t remove the nail polish like it should with one slide. I found out that an old credit card works a lot better.</li>
            <li> Ya&#x27;ll. You need this in your life. SO easy to use. Make sure you file both ends before using it the first time or the images won&#x27;t really stick. I can&#x27;t wait to show them off!</li>
            <li> Works great!!! Such cute &amp; fun things I can do with my nails!!!!</li>
            <li> This set works very well.</li>
            <li> Great product, love it love it love it!!</li>
            <li> The product work just as it was stated. I love it. It picks up the imaged perfectly and remove any unneeded nail polish.</li>
            <li> The Konad stamper &amp; scraper works great.  We had a tiny bit of a learning curve, but my 13 yo DD had it down pat in no time.  We did not need to wipe it off w/ polish remover each time &amp; the images came out fine.  It&#x27;s fun &amp; really easy to have cute images without going to a nail salon.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that you need to clean the scrapper blade after every few scraps because the polish gets clogged in the blade. The Stamper is awesome.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t try it out yet....only b/c I don&#x27;t have the plate stamps but from what I seen so far on Youtube and other reviews seem so cute can&#x27;t wait to try it out once my plate stamps arrive in the mail :)</li>
            <li> Pretty ok, but you cant get the exactdesigns as they show on TV</li>
            <li> I really like the double ended stamper...it definitely picks up the images off of the stamping plates really well. It&#x27;s also very easy to clean, use, &amp; store. The scraper is just so-so...it scratches the stamping plates easily. I&#x27;d actually recommend using an old plastic shoppers card such as...a CVS or Kroger Plus card. It would save your plates from the damaging effects of the metal scraper &amp; it&#x27;s free. I&#x27;ve got a plastic Konad scraper, but actually prefer to use my old Kroger Plus card. The shipping was fast on the Konad kit &amp; the price was fair, so I&#x27;d still recommend it.</li>
            <li> Worked great had no problem with them. And received on time. I love that it had two different sizes to stamp with.</li>
            <li> Im so glad I opted to pay a little exra and get the double-ended Konad stamper. The green side really makes applying the smaller images so much easier. Filing it a liitle helps, but it takes practice, so dont give up too soon. Good quality, fast shipping, nice packaging. After much research, I decided not to use the scraper as so many people warned it would scratch the plates. I kept it for possible future uses for something else, but am using a gift card to smear excess polish from the plates.</li>
            <li> I love the Konad stamper. The larger end of the stamper can be used on full nail designs where as the smaller can be used on smaller designs. It picks up the design very well.&lt;br /&gt;Nail art is become very simple for me :)&lt;br /&gt;I like the scraper too but I dont use the metal one a lot just to avoid the plate from scratching too much.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was before time.&lt;br /&gt;Good value for money.</li>
            <li> Product arrived timely and in great shape. Now I need to practice as usually I&#x27;m all thumbs, so far it&#x27;s been fairly easy to use.</li>
            <li> The stamp is great and I like the double end since I do my daughter&#x27;s nails as well and need the smaller end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scrapper is useless.  I have found that using an old credit card or store loyalty card works WAY better than the scrapper.  The scrapper here left too much polish and actually scratched one of my plates.</li>
            <li> Great product. Just as described. Quickly shipped. Highly recommend. Just what my niece needed to go with the stamp manicure image plates I bought her for Christmas. Made a great gift!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I have created so many nail designs with this. Stamper works great and so does the scraper!</li>
            <li> This was shipped to me without the actual stamper. All that I received was a scraper and it was not a konad product. I ended up purchasing a stamping kit from Sally&#x27;s beauty instead.</li>
            <li> I have used every polish on the face of this planet and NOTHING works right. I have tried stamping my nails a million times and have not ONCE successfully gotten this thing to work. I&#x27;m not an idiot and I do nail design regularly with paints and acrylics so I&#x27;m no stranger to how things work but this thing is just frustrating. I&#x27;ve watched dozens of tutorials and have done what they said to do and it still doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s KONAD brand. They invented the nail stamp. It is what it is and it&#x27;s a very simple function. It could only work but so bad. They work great and this is my second one. My first one was a single ended one but I needed the smaller one to be able to pinpoint landing for smaller stamps. Love this thing. So much tireless fun.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re going to start nail stamping the Konad stamper is a MUST! The stampers that come with many of the stamping plates just don&#x27;t work. The Konad stamper give a flawless application every time.</li>
            <li> Works well except for one little thing. The stamping surface of the larger end moves up and down within the holder. I have to keep pulling it back out in order to roll the design over the surface of my nail. I DO like the design of the holder however. The finger grips make it easy to hold.</li>
            <li> This product meets my expectations for the most part. The scrapper scratches the plates a little, which based on other reviews I already knew would happen. Also the scrapper tends to stain rather easy, even when using polish remover, the plastic parts will stain. The stamper is nice, well made and has pliable ends. Overall I like this product and would recommend it to others. The whole concept of nail stamping takes practice and patience.</li>
            <li> With practice it works just great💜 it.</li>
            <li> We brought and different brand stamper and it didn&#x27;t work well at all. Someone told us about this brand and my daughter and I love it. Works very well.</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of youtube videos and tutorials of people doing it, I guess I just need more practice. This is a good brand though and not generic. They sell this same exact thing in the mall for $25. Great deal</li>
            <li> good for some design. but its not for sensitive design. it wont work well. gotta clean each time after use....ummm</li>
            <li> I used this product with my cheeky stamping design kit. All the images came out great. The polish wipes right off when done. Work with any nail polish.</li>
            <li> When I first received this item, I thought they were both great. Within just a few uses, though, the scraper got some nicks in it that rendered it totally useless in some places. Now, it lets a lot of paint get through the cracks that have appeared. The stamper was great at first as well, but now the rubber pieces often fall out which is less than great when you&#x27;re trying to be careful while doing your nails.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use and clean (I use a Q-tip to clean the scrapper)!!! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I got this to go along with some plates i bought. They work okay not the GREATEST but just okay.</li>
            <li> The product is great enough.. it stamps perfectly well and does what it is supposed to. The only problems I&#x27;ve had with it is when I opened it, the pink side of the stamper fell right out. I had to put the rubber piece back in. The green side was slanted and I thought maybe it was supposed to be like that, maybe it made it easier to stamp?... until I realized that it too was partially falling out. So other than pushing them back into place every once in awhile (until I can get some crazy glue) it&#x27;s great. The scraper is a bit hard to clean because of the holes and designs, but hey - it scrapes. So as long as I can get that metal scraper part clean, I really don&#x27;t care what other nail colors are painted all over the thing. I don&#x27;t regret buying it. :)</li>
            <li> Easy to use, great price, good shipping! Nails come out looking awesome, and I consistently get compliments on how cute they look!</li>
            <li> Could not get it to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been watching a lot of nail art videos/reviews and this seemed to be the best nail art stamper. Used it and LOVE IT! I bought the Shany plate set since they were cheaper and it works great together.</li>
            <li> This stamper works awesome and the double ended feature is nice as the size of the stamps and people&#x27;s nails vary.</li>
