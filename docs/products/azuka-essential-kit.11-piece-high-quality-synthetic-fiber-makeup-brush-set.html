            <li>Received this in the mail yesterday and so far so good</li>

            <li>I am in love with my purchase and use them daily.</li>
            <li>so pretty...</li>
            <li>Then fell in love with the design, texture and multiple uses of the brushes.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have lots of fun creating &amp;#34;your new look&amp;#34; !</li>
            <li>This brush set is just as good if not better than those other brands and are so much more affordable.</li>
            <li>The accuracy crease and accuracy round brushes are great for applying and blending eyeshadow, respectively.</li>
            <li>pouch is very eye catchy.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>my box was crushed some but the brushes seem to be ok.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that all the brushes have a purpose and there are no &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>They are very plush feeling and</li>
            <li>These really do feel like clouds on my face.</li>
            <li>I left it open for four or five days and the smell, most of it, went away.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the purchase of these quality brushes.  </li>
            <li>When I purchased these, I was a little overwhelmed by all of the choices and not quite sure how to use all of them.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit, I am fairly new to using a lot of makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li>and she informed me about a new collection they were working on.</li>
            <li>The case the brushes are in is ok, curious to see how it will hold up in future use</li>
            <li>I decided to visit a makeup consultant for a major cosmetics company so she could give me some much needed advice.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and evenly apply product to your face.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft.  </li>
            <li>They are super soft and very high quality which was such a surprise because of the low price.</li>
            <li>They are plush and soft.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li>and I can say so far they ave meet my expectation.</li>
            <li>so I shared with my 3 yr old for our dress up time.</li>
            <li>They are extremely soft and can be used for any and every purpose- highlight nose, contour cheeks, apply powder, blend foundation, apply eye shadow.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and could never find brushes that wouldn&#x27;t scratch or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>My experience with makeup is not on a professional level</li>
            <li>So, now, between both brush sets I have a complete make brush set just for me.</li>
            <li>I have even had several comments on &amp;#34;my new look&amp;#34; !  </li>
            <li>Compares to my Mac, Sigma, and bare minerals brushes these not only compare but surpass in the way they hold the product and then blend it onto your skin.</li>

            <li> My only complaint is that when they first arrived there was a paint smell to them, but after washing them with baby shampoo I didn&#x27;t have that issue anymore.</li>
            <li> Flat kabuki k94:</li>
            <li> Angled Flat kabuki K96:</li>
            <li> Accuracy Angled Flat</li>
            <li> The flat kabuki brush applies foundation flawlessly; no streaks and it gives me better coverage than the pink sponge I used before.</li>
            <li> but I know my skin and have been looking for brushes like these for a really long time (~20yrs).</li>
            <li> I will never go back to the other ones I used to buy</li>
            <li> used every single one yet</li>
            <li> When this company says their brushes are high quality, they mean it.</li>
            <li> Blends foundation on to the remote areas of the face.&lt;br /&gt;- Tapered kabuki k98: For cream and liquid foundation to contoured areas of the face</li>
            <li> I like pink which why I bought them.</li>
            <li> For hiding all blemishes, dark spots with concealer</li>
            <li> I absolutely a make up brush crazy.</li>
            <li> Round kabuki k92:</li>
            <li> My only suggestion, which isn&#x27;t anything the sellers did wrong</li>
            <li> I like the way it looks and the brushes but the smell was not good.  </li>
            <li> For newbies like me, I am really confused which brush is for what makeup item/purpose.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong !</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> For eye shadow base and eye lid primer&lt;br</li>

            <li> I absolutely a make up brush crazy. I have so many of them now that i have lost count. And these ones are truely of great quality. The bristles are so soft and feel great on the skin. They do not cause any discomfort while applying.

            <li> I am just learning how to use makeup as a grownup. This is a beautiful set. I am very excited to use all of them!! They come in a very nice storage bag. Very happy with my purchase. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> These brushes work great with my loose mineral makeup, they are soft and durable. I would recommend them to anyone for any type of makeup.</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes. The case is nice and keeps the brushes organized. The brushes are definitely on the softer side. I actually prefer that though. My only suggestion, which isn&#x27;t anything the sellers did wrong, it&#x27;s that it would be nice to receive a diagram of the intended purpose of each brush. For newbies like me, I am really confused which brush is for what makeup item/purpose. Thumbs up though on the product though. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes that I have ever owned.  They are plush and soft.  They do not fall apart and do not leave hairs on your face from the brushes.  I am in love with my purchase and use them daily.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is very happy, it was a christmas gift, so far she is enyoing this set, the quality of the brushes is top notch.</li>
            <li> I love the brush set. I recommended it to my friends and they all got them! Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd set of brushes that I buy from Azuka. The quality is amazing, and the brushes work super well!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft. I&#x27;ve used most of them and they work great. The flat kabuki brush applies foundation flawlessly; no streaks and it gives me better coverage than the pink sponge I used before. The accuracy crease and accuracy round brushes are great for applying and blending eyeshadow, respectively. And the case is high quality and beautifully made. I have two sets of Azuka brushes and I use and love them both. I think you will be very pleased with this set.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and the product itself is very good, soft to the skin and good for ur face. This is the second product am getting from Azuka makeup cosmetics and I can say so far they ave meet my expectation. Will recommend this product. Which and already doing. Thanks.... am loving it.</li>
            <li> Really nice brushes I love them</li>
            <li> This is a quality product. The brushes are very soft and evenly apply product to your face.  I would absolutely recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> The package came damaged and it had a strong chemical or plastic smell to it.  Don&#x27;t know if it was the case or not.  I left it open for four or five days and the smell, most of it, went away.  I like the way it looks and the brushes but the smell was not good.  I&#x27;m going to wash the brushes before I use them.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Great brushes especially for the price</li>
            <li> These brushes are wonderful. I bought these after my last set started to fall apart on me. These are the best I&#x27;ve ever owned and  great quality, the hairs don&#x27;t fall out at the touch and they are super soft. The case is also supple and a nice size. I like that the biggest brushes have a protective cover for them. I will never go back to the other ones I used to buy they were cheap and it showed. These are awesome. Will definitely buy these again</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I am fairly new to using a lot of makeup brushes.  When I purchased these, I was a little overwhelmed by all of the choices and not quite sure how to use all of them.  I decided to visit a makeup consultant for a major cosmetics company so she could give me some much needed advice.  She was very impressed with the quality of the brushes, especially with the softness and beauty of them.  After she advised me on how to use them, I am really enjoying having them and experimenting with them.  I have even had several comments on &amp;#34;my new look&amp;#34; !  I would highly recommend the purchase of these quality brushes.  You&#x27;ll have lots of fun creating &amp;#34;your new look&amp;#34; !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my new set. They are super soft, great quality. Super fast delivery. Completely happy with my order and my new brushes!!! They are Awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, they are so soft! I would definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> I gave these as a Christmas gift and she loved them. They are super soft and very high quality which was such a surprise because of the low price.</li>
            <li> Received this in the mail yesterday and so far so good it survived the post office the inside box/ packaging could use some stabilization my box was crushed some but the brushes seem to be ok. I like that the handles are just the right length and thickness and the brush hairs themselves seem to be exceptional very strong yet gentle and work great with any make-up. The case the brushes are in is ok, curious to see how it will hold up in future use but I really like it and for the price with that coupon code you had made it an even more fantastic deal.  I recommend this makeup brush set to anyone looking for a good sturdy lasting set. Can&#x27;t go wrong !</li>
            <li> Very nice high quality brushes, easy to clean, don&#x27;t lose there shape afterward like most brushes I have used in the past.  I would highly recommend them if you are in the market for a excellent set of quality brushes.  Come packaged in a nice carrying case!</li>
            <li> Nice brushes. Didn&#x27;t have use for all the sizes so I shared with my 3 yr old for our dress up time. Great set!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, wide variety brush set.  The brushes are very soft.  There is a noticeable smell, which my daughter and I ascertained comes from the plastic brush pouch.  This set includes every type of brush one would need and more!</li>
            <li> Absolutely gorgeous set of makeup brushes, and I do believe the quality is as good as can be obtained.  Hopefully, they&#x27;ll clean easily as well.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used every single one yet but the three I&#x27;ve used have applied the makeup (blush, foundation powder, and spot concealer) - excellently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints here.  Recommended.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful brush set!  I really like the fact that all the brushes have a purpose and there are no &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; brushes that you never actually use.  I haven&#x27;t had these brushes very long, but so far the quality appears to be excellent and there has been no loss of fibers.  They are very plush feeling and so pretty...they are colored like leopard print and coordinate with the bag.  If you want your make-up to look flawless, ladies, you need the right tools.  I think you&#x27;ll be happy with this set.</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for two months now and I have come to the conclusion that these brushes are GOLDEN!!! When this company says their brushes are high quality, they mean it. Sigma who??? Mac what??? This brush set is just as good if not better than those other brands and are so much more affordable. These are really the best brush set that I own and I have three. I have been in contact with the seller since January about another brush set and she informed me about a new collection they were working on. Well, they were definitely worth the wait. They are extremely soft and can be used for any and every purpose- highlight nose, contour cheeks, apply powder, blend foundation, apply eye shadow. These brushes are lovely. My only complaint is that when they first arrived there was a paint smell to them, but after washing them with baby shampoo I didn&#x27;t have that issue anymore. The pieces are nice and sturdy so I did not have to worry about anything falling apart. What are you waiting for?? Purchase this brush set ASAP... you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the second set of azuka brushes I have purchased. The first set was awesome too and pink. I like pink which why I bought them. Then fell in love with the design, texture and multiple uses of the brushes. So, when I see azuka came out with a Kabuki set (and I&#x27;ve been wanting one) I purchased these. Was extremely impressed on the softness of the brushes. I have sensitive skin and could never find brushes that wouldn&#x27;t scratch or irritate my skin. These really do feel like clouds on my face. Compares to my Mac, Sigma, and bare minerals brushes these not only compare but surpass in the way they hold the product and then blend it onto your skin. My experience with makeup is not on a professional level but I know my skin and have been looking for brushes like these for a really long time (~20yrs). So, now, between both brush sets I have a complete make brush set just for me. It&#x27;s awesome!  It&#x27;s so worth the cost to get them both imho. 👍</li>
            <li> Great price for a good make up brushes</li>
