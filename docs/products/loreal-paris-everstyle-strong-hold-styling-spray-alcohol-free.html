            <li>It&#x27;s very light and not sticky...love it!</li>
            <li>Leaves nice touchable curls that hold fairly well.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll not be able to wear your own perfume fragrance as the hairspray will compete and win out.</li>
            <li>Rryinjust love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>We love it!  </li>
            <li>Most hairspray contain alcohol, which is drying to your hair, but this one DOES NOT!  </li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much to achieve the style that works best for me.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, like coconuts.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice.  </li>
            <li>Bought for use with my own hair plus synthetic extensions, since alcohol-free products are recommended for use with synthetic hair.</li>
            <li>Dulled my own hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s great is that it works as both a root lifter spray and all over styling spray so that after I use a hot iron to curl my ends up or under, they hold, and often even after sleeping on my styled hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and not too strong.  </li>
            <li>It washes out easily, but holds your hair nice.  </li>
            <li>I use it the most when I wear my hair up.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I think the hold is great and the fragrance is soft and nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll e ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>Okay, bought this on a whim before a trip and stuffed it in my bag.</li>
            <li>and I love L&#x27;OreaL, but this makes my hair look like a rat&#x27;s nest.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Alcohol free!</li>
            <li>It is so much better for one&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>Okay, here&#x27;s the deal.</li>
            <li>I love my hair most days.</li>
            <li>I love that.</li>
            <li>the more I used the product</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this hair spray.  </li>
            <li>What more do I need in a hairspray?</li>
            <li>I switched to sulfate free and it saved my hair!</li>
            <li>Good service too, thanks!</li>
            <li>sample bottle is the perfect size for my travel kit, never leaks and has lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use anything else, and it goes great wiith the new L&#x27;Oreal Shampoos.</li>
            <li>It holds very well and has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>Love Loreal Alcohol free products except this.</li>
            <li>Not as strong of a hold as I anticipated</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>My hair is also fine and sprays will end up moving my hair away from where I wanted it...if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li>hair is fine</li>
            <li>Light and easily styles or gives hair body.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong and reminds me of cheap air freshener that my grandmother used to spray in her bathroom.</li>
            <li>but I expect that in an alcohol free product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alcohol free</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it&#x27;s alcohol free.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alcohol free and 100% Vegan.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing and holds really well.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this hairspray since it&#x27;s alcohol free.</li>
            <li>This has a great hold &amp; with it being alcohol free it doesn&#x27;t dry your your hair out.  </li>
            <li>It is non-aerosol and environment friendly, yet still sprays evenly.</li>
            <li>None of them, not a single one, is as good as this formula is for my hair.</li>
            <li>either you do a full spritz, or you get dribbles and drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is interesting to hear some people think the sent is too much.</li>
            <li>so I ended up tossing it out a nearly full bottle after just two weeks.</li>
            <li>It holds my hair pretty well, but it has a really strong scent that overpowers everything.</li>
            <li>Not only is this alcohol free but it is also silicone free (works for CG Method!!).</li>
            <li>Just one or two quick squirts it all I need to hold my &#x27;do in place.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it in any stores around Tampa, so thank you very much Amazon for carrying it!</li>
            <li>I love how affordable it is, how it doesn&#x27;t flake, even after getting wet, how it is able to be combed through and reapplied quickly to add body and shine and how it still allows some movement and retains my curls well.</li>
            <li>However, it is worth it to keep alcohol from drying out your hair.</li>
            <li>Has great hold without leaving it stiff.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product if you have fine bodiless hair.</li>
            <li>Holds just right.  </li>
            <li>I use it mainly because it is alcohol free</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand fly-aways and while I actually don&#x27;t get much frizz except on REALLY humid days, the one fix I have found is a good hairspray.</li>
            <li>This product holds the set VERY well, can be brushed out and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>If you have an aversion to strongly scented products, stay far away from this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>But, when I don&#x27;t have a good hairspray, it ruins my day, really.</li>
            <li>I now buy it online b/c it is almost always sold out around here, so I most not be the only one to have found it to work so well.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m willing to put up with it.</li>
            <li>but this one is my new firm hold spray for sure!!</li>
            <li>I have very thick, difficult to hold hair and this product does a great job locking your style and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Love this product,  doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s frankly astonishing how strongly and offensively this smells, I mean this is like being bathed in Debbie Gibson&#x27;s Electric Youth - not even that, but a Designers Imposter&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li>I love this alcohol free spray but had a hard time finding it.l</li>
            <li>and I found it very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you spray too much it will look like lacquer on your hair so be mindful of that.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Getting my hair straight is a painstaking process.</li>
            <li>Gone in seconds when this stuff touched it and matted my hair up into crunchy (but very polished) curls.</li>
            <li>I really like this hair spray.  </li>
            <li>If you squirt too much, it does give that sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li>This really works for me.  </li>
            <li>Was hesitant, but it works really well - better than expected!</li>
            <li>but it holds well and has a nice fragrance but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I seen on a hair tutorial to use alcohol free hair spray product so it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair</li>
            <li>Decent scent too.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It doesnt leave my hair dry like most products I have used in the past and it washes out easy.</li>
            <li>I threw away this and the other EverStyle products I purchased because of the strong odor.  </li>
            <li>Really like this hairspray, holds, but not heavy.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray because I curl my hair every few days with a curling iron, and I use this to hold the curls.  </li>
            <li>but the scent is a little strong.</li>
            <li>Also works as a hairspray on dry hair and leaves a fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I really like trying new hair products and started using Aquanet when I was in the fourth grade, so we are talking years of experience here.</li>
            <li>A few spritzes and all I could smell all day was cheap drug store perfume</li>
            <li>Alcohol dries out your hair, &amp; I can&#x27;t believe that there are so few alcohol free styling sprays.</li>
            <li>I like soft.</li>
            <li>I have several and they are very stubborn.</li>
            <li>Delayed me 20 mins while they checked every item I had and a full pat down.</li>
            <li>I was having issues with the hot, dry climate and these products all did wonders!</li>
            <li>The mist isn&#x27;t really fine enough; there&#x27;s no way to spritz just a little, because it&#x27;s a non-aerosol -</li>
            <li>For hold I usually use a paste to sculpt it, then a light alcohol-free spray to keep it in place.</li>
            <li>I wear it short and in a sort of spiky wave; I have mixed-race hair that requires a Brazilian blowout for straightening, but after washing I still have to go through the entire process of blow-drying/brushing it straight, then flat-ironing it.</li>
            <li>Little on the pricey side, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price and not too sticky if you spray it lightly and don&#x27;t go crazy.  </li>
            <li>I am 40+ years old and have really long naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I just spent to get my hair straight and styled?</li>
            <li>It also did not keep my hair from curling back up after being straightened while I was near the beach.</li>
            <li>The hold is good, but very heavy feeling, leaves my hair sticky and too hard.</li>
            <li>Worth a shot if iou want less chemicals!</li>
            <li>Product does not dry out hair or get sticky.</li>
            <li>I live in a remote location so</li>
            <li>This product has lasted so long and holds nearly as well as a regular spray without sucking the life from my curly hair.</li>
            <li>I had to launder the clothes I was wearing and go home and shower, and I am not particularly chemically sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>I thought not having can pressure to pump the spray will make the hold heavy and hard to manage but everything is OK.  </li>

            <li> It has a strong smell that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> My hair is also fine and sprays will end up moving my hair away from where I wanted it...if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li> hair is fine</li>
            <li> Light and easily styles or gives hair body.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong and reminds me of cheap air freshener that my grandmother used to spray in her bathroom.</li>
            <li> but I expect that in an alcohol free product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alcohol free</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it&#x27;s alcohol free.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alcohol free and 100% Vegan.  </li>
            <li> Smells amazing and holds really well.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this hairspray since it&#x27;s alcohol free.</li>
            <li> This has a great hold &amp; with it being alcohol free it doesn&#x27;t dry your your hair out.  </li>
            <li> It is non-aerosol and environment friendly, yet still sprays evenly.</li>
            <li> None of them, not a single one, is as good as this formula is for my hair.</li>
            <li> either you do a full spritz, or you get dribbles and drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is interesting to hear some people think the sent is too much.</li>
            <li> so I ended up tossing it out a nearly full bottle after just two weeks.</li>
            <li> It holds my hair pretty well, but it has a really strong scent that overpowers everything.</li>
            <li> Not only is this alcohol free but it is also silicone free (works for CG Method!!).</li>
            <li> Just one or two quick squirts it all I need to hold my &#x27;do in place.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find it in any stores around Tampa, so thank you very much Amazon for carrying it!</li>
            <li> I love how affordable it is, how it doesn&#x27;t flake, even after getting wet, how it is able to be combed through and reapplied quickly to add body and shine and how it still allows some movement and retains my curls well.</li>
            <li> However, it is worth it to keep alcohol from drying out your hair.</li>
            <li> Has great hold without leaving it stiff.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product if you have fine bodiless hair.</li>
            <li> Holds just right.  </li>
            <li> I use it mainly because it is alcohol free</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand fly-aways and while I actually don&#x27;t get much frizz except on REALLY humid days, the one fix I have found is a good hairspray.</li>
            <li> This product holds the set VERY well, can be brushed out and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> If you have an aversion to strongly scented products, stay far away from this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> But, when I don&#x27;t have a good hairspray, it ruins my day, really.</li>
            <li> I now buy it online b/c it is almost always sold out around here, so I most not be the only one to have found it to work so well.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m willing to put up with it.</li>
            <li> but this one is my new firm hold spray for sure!!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, difficult to hold hair and this product does a great job locking your style and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love this product,  doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s frankly astonishing how strongly and offensively this smells, I mean this is like being bathed in Debbie Gibson&#x27;s Electric Youth - not even that, but a Designers Imposter&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> I love this alcohol free spray but had a hard time finding it.l</li>
            <li> and I found it very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you spray too much it will look like lacquer on your hair so be mindful of that.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Getting my hair straight is a painstaking process.</li>
            <li> Gone in seconds when this stuff touched it and matted my hair up into crunchy (but very polished) curls.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair spray.  </li>
            <li> If you squirt too much, it does give that sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li> This really works for me.  </li>
            <li> Was hesitant, but it works really well - better than expected!</li>
            <li> but it holds well and has a nice fragrance but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I seen on a hair tutorial to use alcohol free hair spray product so it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair</li>
            <li> Decent scent too.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It doesnt leave my hair dry like most products I have used in the past and it washes out easy.</li>
            <li> I threw away this and the other EverStyle products I purchased because of the strong odor.  </li>
            <li> Really like this hairspray, holds, but not heavy.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray because I curl my hair every few days with a curling iron, and I use this to hold the curls.  </li>
            <li> but the scent is a little strong.</li>
            <li> Also works as a hairspray on dry hair and leaves a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I really like trying new hair products and started using Aquanet when I was in the fourth grade, so we are talking years of experience here.</li>
            <li> A few spritzes and all I could smell all day was cheap drug store perfume</li>
            <li> Alcohol dries out your hair, &amp; I can&#x27;t believe that there are so few alcohol free styling sprays.</li>
            <li> I like soft.</li>
            <li> I have several and they are very stubborn.</li>
            <li> Delayed me 20 mins while they checked every item I had and a full pat down.</li>
            <li> I was having issues with the hot, dry climate and these products all did wonders!</li>
            <li> The mist isn&#x27;t really fine enough; there&#x27;s no way to spritz just a little, because it&#x27;s a non-aerosol -</li>
            <li> For hold I usually use a paste to sculpt it, then a light alcohol-free spray to keep it in place.</li>
            <li> I wear it short and in a sort of spiky wave; I have mixed-race hair that requires a Brazilian blowout for straightening, but after washing I still have to go through the entire process of blow-drying/brushing it straight, then flat-ironing it.</li>
            <li> Little on the pricey side, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price and not too sticky if you spray it lightly and don&#x27;t go crazy.  </li>
            <li> I am 40+ years old and have really long naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I just spent to get my hair straight and styled?</li>
            <li> It also did not keep my hair from curling back up after being straightened while I was near the beach.</li>
            <li> The hold is good, but very heavy feeling, leaves my hair sticky and too hard.</li>
            <li> Worth a shot if iou want less chemicals!</li>
            <li> Product does not dry out hair or get sticky.</li>
            <li> I live in a remote location so</li>
            <li> This product has lasted so long and holds nearly as well as a regular spray without sucking the life from my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I had to launder the clothes I was wearing and go home and shower, and I am not particularly chemically sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> I thought not having can pressure to pump the spray will make the hold heavy and hard to manage but everything is OK.  </li>
            <li> Gums the synthetic hairs together and makes them flat and obvious.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the rather strong scent which is not much of  a problem for me since I use so little of the product each day.</li>
            <li> I have short soft gray hair and this spray helps to firm it up and holds the wave.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is very stiff and I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a lighter hold version available.</li>
            <li> It provides volume to my thin, fine hair without leaving a stiff or sticky residue and the hold lasts between my every-other-day shampooing.</li>
            <li> I find it leaves my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and my goal is to achieve shine before setting my hair with spray.  </li>
            <li> I have really long hair and live in Oregon, so it can be hard to keep my curls in during our 9 months of rain.</li>
            <li> and this is the only hairspray I have ever used that actually holds my hair without making it stiff.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate and the product was still very wet and slow to dry.</li>
            <li> but I have to fluff a lot.  </li>
            <li> It is alcohol-free - don&#x27;t know why that is a plus or minus in hair spray.  </li>
            <li> The next day my hair was so stiff it wouldn&#x27;t even brush out.</li>
            <li> This product instantly &amp;#34;de-glosses&amp;#34; my hair and leaves is stiff and beyond matte.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown out my hair and this gives just enough hold without feeling stiff.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this works for other hair types, not mine.</li>
            <li> Even after two shampoos the smell remains and your hair will have an ever so slightly tacky feel when still wet.</li>
            <li> My hair has no body and this helps me keep my cow licks under control.</li>
            <li> Spraying just a small amount of this on my hair resulted in a headache and congestion all day long.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down the strongest scented beauty product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My hair is not as dried out as when I used other products.  </li>
            <li> I like that it isn&#x27;t drying like typical hairsprays</li>
            <li> /&gt;Performance-wise, it was a little \\&quot;wet\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Not too heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> Firm but flexible hold and no alcohol.  </li>
            <li> This hairspray goes on heavy and is sticky.  </li>
            <li> It holds it without the harsh alcohol.</li>
            <li> The curls can last a few days if I&#x27;m careful sleeping, and this spray doesn&#x27;t dry it out too badly.  </li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t so stiff that I can&#x27;t run a brush through it.</li>
            <li> It does make my hair stiff, but it isn&#x27;t flaky</li>
            <li> Made my hair too gummy, then stiff.  </li>
            <li> No strong order.</li>
            <li> I have thin, dry hair and a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> Not my usual styling spray,</li>
            <li> I have even tried some weird Asian kinds found at Vietnamese markets.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they quit making it or what??</li>
            <li> I started using the L&#x27;Oreal EverStyle hair spray after receiving a small sample with my L&#x27;Oreal hair color.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with this product at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find at places like CVS and Rite-Aid</li>
            <li> Hard to find in my area.</li>
            <li> It goes away, but becomes noticeable by the end of a hard gym session.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> Poor construction.</li>
            <li> This effect seemed to be getting worse</li>
            <li> I was desperate to replace the pump spray bottle I am finishing.  </li>
            <li> It flakes like crazy and the scent is overbearing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, think its being discountinued!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is nearly impossible to wash out.</li>
            <li> I was completely shocked.</li>
            <li> It overpowers my perfume. :(</li>
            <li> but I hate the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible, sticky hairspray.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great hairspray!  I use it mainly because it is alcohol free but it holds well and has a nice fragrance but not overwhelming. I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hairspray for a couple years. I have really long hair and live in Oregon, so it can be hard to keep my curls in during our 9 months of rain. This hairspray keeps hold until it&#x27;s rinsed out, and it doesn&#x27;t have the gross hairspray smell.</li>
            <li> This hairspray works well. However, the scent lasts all day.  You&#x27;ll not be able to wear your own perfume fragrance as the hairspray will compete and win out. Where ever you go, you&#x27;ll be fragranting your environment ( car, shop or restaurant).  You better like the scent because it will be with you until you wash it out !!  I would not recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Love this product,  doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Not too heavy or sticky. Holds just right.  Good service too, thanks!</li>
            <li> It holds my hair pretty well, but it has a really strong scent that overpowers everything. The mist isn&#x27;t really fine enough; there&#x27;s no way to spritz just a little, because it&#x27;s a non-aerosol - either you do a full spritz, or you get dribbles and drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m probably going to donate this to the office bathroom beauty product basket.</li>
            <li> I use it the most when I wear my hair up.  It does a great job of preventing fly aways.  My hair is also fine and sprays will end up moving my hair away from where I wanted it...if that makes sense.  The pump does not do this.  I put my hair where I want, spray, and it stays.  It doesn&#x27;t leave noticeable residue in your hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this is the only hairspray I have ever used that actually holds my hair without making it stiff. I don&#x27;t have to use much to achieve the style that works best for me. I would highly recommend this product if you have fine bodiless hair.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the strongest scented beauty product I have ever used. A few spritzes and all I could smell all day was cheap drug store perfume circa 1989. It was horrible. I had to launder the clothes I was wearing and go home and shower, and I am not particularly chemically sensitive. It&#x27;s frankly astonishing how strongly and offensively this smells, I mean this is like being bathed in Debbie Gibson&#x27;s Electric Youth - not even that, but a Designers Imposter&#x27;s version. The search for an alcohol-free hairspray continues; I returned this one to the store immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance-wise, it was a little \\&quot;wet\\&quot; but I expect that in an alcohol free product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this syling spray as an alternative to the root lifter spray (a different brand) that I had been using. I love this stuff. The scent is wonderful. It is alcohol-free. It provides volume to my thin, fine hair without leaving a stiff or sticky residue and the hold lasts between my every-other-day shampooing. What&#x27;s great is that it works as both a root lifter spray and all over styling spray so that after I use a hot iron to curl my ends up or under, they hold, and often even after sleeping on my styled hair. Also works as a hairspray on dry hair and leaves a fresh scent. It&#x27;s like having 3 or 4 products all in one. I hope Loreal will not discontinue this item.</li>
            <li> It is interesting to hear some people think the sent is too much. I think the hold is great and the fragrance is soft and nice. When people hug me they say oh you smell so good. I am upset that I can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores. Seems like Target and CVS are no longer carrying it.</li>
            <li> I have just begun to use this spray and I like it very much. I have short soft gray hair and this spray helps to firm it up and holds the wave.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> Happy to get opportunity to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine and I found it very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this again</li>
            <li> Not only is this alcohol free but it is also silicone free (works for CG Method!!). The smell has a nice musky scent and the hold is amazing! This is not a flexible hold hair spray by any means so don&#x27;t expect that. This is perfect for a hair style that you don&#x27;t intend to touch once it is done. This will hold every strand in place perfectly. If you spray too much it will look like lacquer on your hair so be mindful of that. I have found that I can still feel its presence in my hair on the second day but it isn&#x27;t so stiff that I can&#x27;t run a brush through it. I am still searching for an awesome flexible hold but this one is my new firm hold spray for sure!!</li>
            <li> Rryinjust love this stuff! Excellent hold, no stickiness, and its alcohol free! Alcohol dries out your hair, &amp; I can&#x27;t believe that there are so few alcohol free styling sprays. I used to buy this at Walmart, but I  can&#x27;t find it there anymore. I can&#x27;t find it in any stores around Tampa, so thank you very much Amazon for carrying it!</li>
            <li> Great product that I love. Can no longer find it in stores, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon! Very happy subscriber!</li>
            <li> Almost nothing comes out of the spray. Poor construction.</li>
            <li> I have thin, dry hair and a lot of it.  My hair is also over-processed, so finding a hair spray without alcohol is a must for me.  I love this hairspray because I curl my hair every few days with a curling iron, and I use this to hold the curls.  The curls can last a few days if I&#x27;m careful sleeping, and this spray doesn&#x27;t dry it out too badly.  Leaves nice touchable curls that hold fairly well.  Decent scent too.  The only con is that on humid days it doesn&#x27;t hold at all.  To me, this is the best alcohol free spray out there I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Firm but flexible hold and no alcohol.  Walmart stopped carrying it and neither does Target.  I&#x27;ll e ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> This has a great hold &amp; with it being alcohol free it doesn&#x27;t dry your your hair out.  For the price and amount you get, this is the best value alcohol-free hair spray on the market.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have used this hairspray for years.  It is alcohol free and holds great!  It also has a pleasant smell.  I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> Getting my hair straight is a painstaking process. I wear it short and in a sort of spiky wave; I have mixed-race hair that requires a Brazilian blowout for straightening, but after washing I still have to go through the entire process of blow-drying/brushing it straight, then flat-ironing it. For hold I usually use a paste to sculpt it, then a light alcohol-free spray to keep it in place. When I tried this for the finishing touch of spray, not only did it leave a sticky residue, but that half-hour of work I just spent to get my hair straight and styled? Gone in seconds when this stuff touched it and matted my hair up into crunchy (but very polished) curls.</li>
            <li> Good for your hair. Contain NO Alcohol.</li>
            <li> Not as strong of a hold as I anticipated but it works for a regular hold.  I have curly hair and like to stack the back of my hair and this holds but I have to fluff a lot.  It smells nice, like coconuts.</li>
            <li> Not my usual styling spray, but I thought I&#x27;d try one that was designed for our humid temperature.  It is alcohol-free - don&#x27;t know why that is a plus or minus in hair spray.  I find it leaves my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> This hairspray goes on heavy and is sticky.  I wish it was an aerosol spray.  The fragrance is nice.  It does hold your hair well.  I just didn&#x27;t like the application.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price and not too sticky if you spray it lightly and don&#x27;t go crazy.  Light and easily styles or gives hair body.</li>
            <li> I live in a remote location so when I saw this on here I was so happy. This product is great. It doesnt leave my hair dry like most products I have used in the past and it washes out easy.</li>
            <li> I recieved one of these as a free-be when I bought a L&#x27;Oreal brand hair dye,  and it isthe best hair spray I have ever used. I braided my hair and took a nap after with this hairspray in my hair and I woke up 2 hours later with my hair looking still like I had just done it. I was completely shocked. So happy with this product. I will be recommending this to all of friends.</li>
            <li> Okay, bought this on a whim before a trip and stuffed it in my bag. I have thick curly hair. It has a strong smell that lasts all day. The hold is good, but very heavy feeling, leaves my hair sticky and too hard. I like soft. It also did not keep my hair from curling back up after being straightened while I was near the beach. The next day my hair was so stiff it wouldn&#x27;t even brush out. WARNING the formula is different and when I went through security at the airport they wioed my hands to check for whatever they check for and the residue from the spray made it go off. I know this because I travel twice a month and that is the only product I have changed. Delayed me 20 mins while they checked every item I had and a full pat down.</li>
            <li> Smells great and I love L&#x27;OreaL, but this makes my hair look like a rat&#x27;s nest.  My hair is dry and my goal is to achieve shine before setting my hair with spray.  This product instantly &amp;#34;de-glosses&amp;#34; my hair and leaves is stiff and beyond matte.  Did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair spray.  I&#x27;ve grown out my hair and this gives just enough hold without feeling stiff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alcohol free so it won&#x27;t harm your hair. Has great hold without leaving it stiff. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love it. I have fine hair. It holds it without the harsh alcohol.</li>
            <li> does not hold that well</li>
            <li> Excellent hair spray! Alcohol free!</li>
            <li> No alcohol!  How great is that!  It is so much better for one&#x27;s hair.  If you squirt too much, it does give that sticky feeling.  I don&#x27;t know any hairspray that doesn&#x27;t, especially the pump kinds.  The smell is nice and not too strong.  I won&#x27;t use anything else, and it goes great wiith the new L&#x27;Oreal Shampoos.</li>
            <li> Okay, here&#x27;s the deal. I am 40+ years old and have really long naturally curly hair. I love my hair most days. I really like trying new hair products and started using Aquanet when I was in the fourth grade, so we are talking years of experience here. But, when I don&#x27;t have a good hairspray, it ruins my day, really. I can&#x27;t stand fly-aways and while I actually don&#x27;t get much frizz except on REALLY humid days, the one fix I have found is a good hairspray. I have used probably every hairspray known to man. I have even tried some weird Asian kinds found at Vietnamese markets. None of them, not a single one, is as good as this formula is for my hair. I now buy it online b/c it is almost always sold out around here, so I most not be the only one to have found it to work so well. I love how affordable it is, how it doesn&#x27;t flake, even after getting wet, how it is able to be combed through and reapplied quickly to add body and shine and how it still allows some movement and retains my curls well. I even like the size and shape of the bottle. Nothing fancy, but it just works. I love that. The only caveat I have is the smell. But, hey it&#x27;s hairspray, not perfume. I just mist my hair with my scent after it&#x27;s styled. No big deal. Great product and I hope the big L&#x27; never stops making it!</li>
            <li> Best hair spray i have ever had! I break out whenever i used regular hairspray and with this i don&#x27;t because there&#x27;s no alcohol. It also has a good hold to it and doesn&#x27;t turn flaky or sticky.</li>
            <li> This product holds the set VERY well, can be brushed out and smells nice.  The price is good and best of all -- it is alcohol free.  We love it!  It&#x27;s hard to find at places like CVS and Rite-Aid so I buy it online and the service if excellent.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Helped my dandruff because of the lack of alchohol.</li>
            <li> I love this alcohol free spray but had a hard time finding it.l</li>
            <li> Bought for use with my own hair plus synthetic extensions, since alcohol-free products are recommended for use with synthetic hair. Result: Terrible. Gums the synthetic hairs together and makes them flat and obvious. Dulled my own hair. Used once and threw away.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it&#x27;s alcohol free. Was hesitant, but it works really well - better than expected! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good hold but the scent is a little strong. However, it is worth it to keep alcohol from drying out your hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, difficult to hold hair and this product does a great job locking your style and smells wonderful. Unfortunately it is nearly impossible to wash out. Even after two shampoos the smell remains and your hair will have an ever so slightly tacky feel when still wet. This effect seemed to be getting worse the more I used the product so I ended up tossing it out a nearly full bottle after just two weeks.</li>
            <li> If you have fragile hair, this is the only spray i would use.  It has eliminated breakage of the ends  of hair.</li>
            <li> I use it every day. Keep my hair neat. No strong order.I like it .</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray. The smell is fantastic. I cannot get it in my local stores anymore so I have to order it online. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I prefer Aerosol this works well i f you loke a product that is a spray - not my style</li>
            <li> Have been trying to find an alcohol-free hairspray, and after trying this one, still looking. I live in a very dry climate and the product was still very wet and slow to dry. Immediately flattened my hair. I have fine, thin hair. Perhaps this works for other hair types, not mine.</li>
            <li> My hair is not as dried out as when I used other products.  It holds very well and has a pleasant smell.  Little on the pricey side, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to replace the pump spray bottle I am finishing.  This is excellent hair spray and not stick.</li>
            <li> I had this shipped to be to Aghanistan for use on my deployment. Did wonders for my hair, in combination with L&#x27;Oreal everstrong shampoos and conditioners. I was having issues with the hot, dry climate and these products all did wonders!</li>
            <li> It holds well and isn&#x27;t sticky. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Really like this hairspray, holds, but not heavy. Unfortunately, think its being discountinued!</li>
            <li> I thought not having can pressure to pump the spray will make the hold heavy and hard to manage but everything is OK.  Bought it again for the 2nd time.</li>
            <li> Spraying just a small amount of this on my hair resulted in a headache and congestion all day long.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and wash it off.  I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be wearing it again, but didn&#x27;t want to throw out a bottle that was practically unused.  So I gave it to my mom, and the same thing happened to her.  We&#x27;re tossing it.  If you have an aversion to strongly scented products, stay far away from this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love Loreal Alcohol free products except this. The scent burns my nose and makes my eyes water. I put it away for awhile and tried it again today and I just can&#x27;t get passed it. Very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I like that it isn&#x27;t drying like typical hairsprays but I hate the way it smells. It&#x27;s strong and reminds me of cheap air freshener that my grandmother used to spray in her bathroom.</li>
            <li> The perfume odor is overbearing and does not dissipate as the day goes on.  I threw away this and the other EverStyle products I purchased because of the strong odor.  I would rather use products with alcohol than stink all day.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair spray.  No alcohol.  It washes out easily, but holds your hair nice.  I can&#x27;t find it in the stores any longer.  Not sure if they quit making it or what??</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this hairspray since it&#x27;s alcohol free. Unfortunately, it is very stiff and I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a lighter hold version available. It flakes like crazy and the scent is overbearing. It overpowers my perfume. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alcohol free and 100% Vegan.  It holds my hair like SHELLAC.  What more do I need in a hairspray?</li>
            <li> Product does not dry out hair or get sticky.</li>
            <li> I started using the L&#x27;Oreal EverStyle hair spray after receiving a small sample with my L&#x27;Oreal hair color. The 1 oz. sample bottle is the perfect size for my travel kit, never leaks and has lasted a long time. It is non-aerosol and environment friendly, yet still sprays evenly. Just one or two quick squirts it all I need to hold my &#x27;do in place. The only negative is the rather strong scent which is not much of  a problem for me since I use so little of the product each day.</li>
            <li> The best and healthiest hair spray , with no alcohol</li>
            <li> Horrible, sticky hairspray. I used it once and never used it again.</li>
            <li> Most hairspray contain alcohol, which is drying to your hair, but this one DOES NOT!  It&#x27;s very light and not sticky...love it!</li>
            <li> I switched to sulfate free and it saved my hair! After having a baby my hair was damaged, breaking and crispy. I made the change to all Burt&#x27;s Bees products but wasn&#x27;t happy with the styling product or prices. This product has lasted so long and holds nearly as well as a regular spray without sucking the life from my curly hair. Love this! Worth a shot if iou want less chemicals!</li>
            <li> Hard to find in my area. Scent is good</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with this product at all. It is like spraying sticky water on your hair. Those of us with curly hair that has been straightened it just makes hair frizzy</li>
            <li> I seen on a hair tutorial to use alcohol free hair spray product so it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair and I loved this one. It smells so good.</li>
            <li> This really works for me.  My hair has no body and this helps me keep my cow licks under control. I have several and they are very stubborn. There is a smell, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me (or my husband). It goes away, but becomes noticeable by the end of a hard gym session. It does make my hair stiff, but it isn&#x27;t flaky so I&#x27;m willing to put up with it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells amazing and holds really well. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Made my hair too gummy, then stiff.  Does not hold up in humidity.</li>
