            <li>I used to LOVE Goldwell&#x27;s Color and Highlights Shampoo and Conditioner, but they stopped making it years ago.</li>
            <li>I love it, I&#x27;m going to buy two more bottles soon.</li>
            <li>Works well at getting tangles out of curly hair, easy comb thru after conditioning.  </li>
            <li>Its such a great shampoo.</li>
            <li>But this shampoo and conditioner is the only one that makes my hair feel soft, shine and smooth, its the best.</li>

            <li>but I don&#x27;t use any chemical method to straight it</li>
            <li>I use this formula or the extra rich.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida</li>
            <li>Even though it tends to be more expensive than your basic products, I have used Goldwell Kerasilk for a really long time and my hair and scalp has never been better!</li>
            <li>, instead I use my flat iron all the time, so my hair ends pretty damage.</li>
            <li>Helps my hair stay soft and conditioned without the greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I miss the old products.</li>

            <li> I only use Goldwell. I use this formula or the extra rich. My hair is heavily processed and looks great thanks to these product. They also have a color line but I tried those and while they smelled wonderful it washed my color out faster than this formula.</li>
            <li> Takes about a week to feel and see a difference in my hair but it is worth the wait. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different. I live in Florida so I have a frizz problem. This knocks out 90% of it. Will continue to buy!</li>
