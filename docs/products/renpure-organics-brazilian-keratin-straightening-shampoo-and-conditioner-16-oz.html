    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have used on my hair.</li>
            <li>This product works excellent on Brazilian blowouts just as advertised.</li>
            <li>This did the trick perfectly!</li>
            <li>was very happy to find this set.</li>
            <li>I had never heard of it before but am completely impressed with the effects.</li>
            <li>This works great!</li>
            <li>I had been using Loreal up to now and was happy with the effects</li>
            <li>It smells very nice and lathers generously.</li>
            <li>In between I use the Renpure products and my hair is in the best condition its every been in and growing better as I don&#x27;t have breakage.  </li>
            <li>so let&#x27;s see how good it is</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be a repeat buyer for sure!</li>
            <li>Saturates and nourishes hair in a way that is amazing.  </li>
            <li>all 16oz renpure products are $5.99 -- great price for organic product that is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>Smells good, doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair at all, and it seems like I have to use a lot more shampoo</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells delicious (like JoJoBa - coconunty) - but does not seem to do the straightening job I was hoping for - not even close really -</li>
            <li>Nice after a flattening iron.</li>
            <li>But so far after one wash it works great!!</li>
            <li>and so far it is the best shampoo I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Looks shiny and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>maybe I&#x27;ll have better results with hers.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>Makes hair look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to change and also, find something with a better price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Shampoo does not lather like I am use to but do love haw</li>
            <li>Love, love, love their products, hope they continue to produce them.  </li>
            <li>Firstly the smell is good, and as I was washing my hair</li>
            <li>The conditioner is fine, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li>as far as the smell, but it still works great.</li>
            <li>It cuts my straightening efforts in half, not to mention it smells delicious.</li>
            <li>Ingredients seem to be nice and gentle.</li>
            <li>so I needed a shampoo/conditioner that was sulfate free and this seems to do the job</li>
            <li>I do have to use a product to smooth out the frizz</li>
            <li>After looking for solutions I decided to switch to shampoos that were sulfate free.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and smelling good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>The comb went through super easy, no tangles or knots whatsoever.</li>
            <li>eh it doesn&#x27;t help my long, frizzy, wavy fly away</li>
            <li>While this shampoo didn&#x27;t straighten out my hair, its clean and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special about this, have to use a treatment after this because the shampoo dries the hair</li>
            <li>So far loving the results</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and highly hydrated, the products leave an amazing smell, and they even ended up being super organic!</li>
            <li>I have a JEWFRO - pretty course hair - have had luck with products like SEXY STRAIGHT HAIR products a the moment -</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>this stuff is nice - but for me personally - had no straightening effect.</li>
            <li>That being said my hair felt soft and tangle free while washing it out.</li>
            <li>Smells really nice, though I don&#x27;t see a significantâ€‹ straightening effect that other describe.</li>
            <li>and it was pretty darn straight.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave that waxy feeling that certain conditioners do.</li>
            <li>When I used my straightener, it became pin straight.</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time however,I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference with my hair</li>
            <li>It suppose to keep your hair straight almost finished the bottle in 3 weeks but didn&#x27;t see the results as desired...</li>
            <li>This really did not work on my hair.  </li>
            <li>will probably be ordering more of this shampoo and conditioner, but not very soon since the size is a generous one, I have plenty to use for now.</li>
            <li>it really did not do anything.</li>
            <li>Also hair feels much fuller than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>Not as straight as I would like it to be after drying</li>
            <li>but it did not help make my hair straight at all.</li>
            <li>Once straightened my hair is really straight.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say too much considering</li>
            <li>I like to alternate shampoos to not use the same kind every day</li>
            <li>far the only thing that works to get my hair frizz free and looking</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>Made my hair really soft like most other products</li>
            <li>If you want your hair straight go for it, but if you want some nice waves or curls use this sparingly maybe twice a month because this stuff is serious.</li>
            <li>My hair feels much lighter and soft.</li>
            <li>I got my 6 month Keratine treatment at my hair salon and as usual, they asked me to use sulfate free shampoo so that the frizz free effect of the treatment would last longer.</li>
            <li>and she live in Florida , the humidity makes her hair so frizzy , I started getting this for her</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling to find a product that will make my naturally curly hair look sleek and shiny!</li>
            <li>Now feels soft.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my daughter who is 13 and has naturally curley hair .</li>
            <li>I like this product so far it meets my expectations.</li>
            <li>but the product did seem to make my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I have to use a bit more of the shampoo than I&#x27;m used to for my thick hair, but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m liking this product so far</li>
            <li>then I usually have which was good, also the conditioner didn&#x27;t seem overlly thick.</li>
            <li>I still need to straighten my hair but after blow drying my hair is much smoother than it is with other shampoos.</li>
            <li>then I normally would with other products.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I noticed that the effects of this shampoo seem to last a few days, even when washing with a different shampoo the next day my hair was still softer than normal.</li>
            <li> Used with the flat iron product by the same company and my search has ended.</li>
            <li> bought these to use with the 14 day straight- that was a waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> I am a mixed African American with a tight curl and wanted to loosen my curl up a bit.</li>
            <li> My daughter is biracial with very curly and thick brown hair.  </li>
            <li> Less frizzy and i live in an extremely moist climate area.</li>
            <li> but I have extremely kinky frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to try other products from this brand.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and have a Brazilian Smoothing done every 6 months.  </li>
            <li> no way...bottles half way empty</li>
            <li> For thick curly hair that felt coarse.  </li>
            <li> I also had a LOT less hair falling out when I used this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I heard that keratin helps to strengthen the hair and prevents less breakage.</li>
            <li> I noticed less hair fall</li>
            <li> I have bought a few things from this company</li>
            <li> It did not do anything except waste an hour+ of my time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I came across this product and thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it doesnt have any of the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Will update after a few weeks</li>
            <li> Which is another down point because these bottles are very small.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I really  wanted to try it out.</li>
            <li> I have horribly thick wavy hair and all I did was use these products and brush my hair after</li>
            <li> I have really thick and wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Ended up with a weird perm looking texture.</li>

            <li> I am a mixed African American with a tight curl and wanted to loosen my curl up a bit. I made the mistake of using this stuff every time I washed and lost all my curl! Ended up with a weird perm looking texture. If you want your hair straight go for it, but if you want some nice waves or curls use this sparingly maybe twice a month because this stuff is serious. Looove the smell! Ingredients seem to be nice and gentle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because I just used it ... But so far after one wash it works great!! I started doing the Brazilian Keratin Treatment so I needed a shampoo/conditioner that was sulfate free and this seems to do the job so let&#x27;s see how good it is once I keep washing my hair ... So far loving the results</li>
            <li> It has sulfates and silicones, I suggest to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> For thick curly hair that felt coarse.  Now feels soft.  Looks shiny and more manageable.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and smelling good. I have to use a bit more of the shampoo than I&#x27;m used to for my thick hair, but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. It was definitely worth it. I have horribly thick wavy hair and all I did was use these products and brush my hair after and it was pretty darn straight. When I used my straightener, it became pin straight.</li>
            <li> no way...bottles half way empty</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time however,I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference with my hair I&#x27;ll try it on my daughter&#x27;s hair maybe I&#x27;ll have better results with hers.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter who is 13 and has naturally curley hair . and she live in Florida , the humidity makes her hair so frizzy , I started getting this for her and now i&#x27;m not hearing complaints about how she hates her hair</li>
            <li> Smells good, doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair at all, and it seems like I have to use a lot more shampoo then I normally would with other products. Which is another down point because these bottles are very small.</li>
            <li> I like this product so far it meets my expectations. It smells very nice and lathers generously. I will continue to use this product for desired results of straitening my hair, I noticed a difference after one use, I would definately recommend this product</li>
            <li> It suppose to keep your hair straight almost finished the bottle in 3 weeks but didn&#x27;t see the results as desired...I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again...</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have used on my hair. It cuts my straightening efforts in half, not to mention it smells delicious. My hair is shiny and healthy. I&#x27;ve recommended this to several friends already. I&#x27;ll be a repeat buyer for sure!</li>
            <li> I am going with two stars only because I truly don&#x27;t like the shampoo.  The conditioner is fine, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells delicious (like JoJoBa - coconunty) - but does not seem to do the straightening job I was hoping for - not even close really - I have a JEWFRO - pretty course hair - have had luck with products like SEXY STRAIGHT HAIR products a the moment - this stuff is nice - but for me personally - had no straightening effect.</li>
            <li> This product works excellent on Brazilian blowouts just as advertised. Makes hair look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling to find a product that will make my naturally curly hair look sleek and shiny! I FOUND IT! Used with the flat iron product by the same company and my search has ended. This did the trick perfectly! Yay!</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this, have to use a treatment after this because the shampoo dries the hair</li>
            <li> This really did not work on my hair.  Didn&#x27;t notice any type of change.  I would not recommend it for relaxing the cur.</li>
            <li> I received the package today and there were 2 conditioners and no shampoo in the package. I was disappointed because I really  wanted to try it out.</li>
            <li> I got my 6 month Keratine treatment at my hair salon and as usual, they asked me to use sulfate free shampoo so that the frizz free effect of the treatment would last longer. I had been using Loreal up to now and was happy with the effects but I wanted to change and also, find something with a better price.&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy to find this set. I had never heard of it before but am completely impressed with the effects. My hair feels soft and highly hydrated, the products leave an amazing smell, and they even ended up being super organic! It doesn&#x27;t even have gluten! I didn&#x27;t even know gluten was in hair products!&lt;br /&gt;I will probably be ordering more of this shampoo and conditioner, but not very soon since the size is a generous one, I have plenty to use for now.</li>
            <li> 5.99 a piece at Walgreens, don&#x27;t spend extra in case you have a Walgreens nearby</li>
            <li> I have really thick and wavy hair.  While this shampoo didn&#x27;t straighten out my hair, its clean and shiny.  I do have to use a product to smooth out the frizz though with this.</li>
            <li> Shampoo does not lather like I am use to but do love haw it leaves my hair</li>
            <li> it really did not do anything. I have bought a few things from this company/brand and I have not noticed any improvement in my hair, but it did not damage my hair either.&lt;br /&gt;I bought these to use with the 14 day straight- that was a waste of time and money! It did not do anything except waste an hour+ of my time.&lt;br /&gt;I also have the cleaning conditioner- eh it doesn&#x27;t help my long, frizzy, wavy fly away hair.&lt;br /&gt;So far the only thing that works to get my hair frizz free and looking goos is the $700 Japanese hair straightening at the Avada salon.</li>
            <li> Saturates and nourishes hair in a way that is amazing.  Also hair feels much fuller than I thought it would.  Not as straight as I would like it to be after drying but I have extremely kinky frizzy hair.  Nice after a flattening iron.</li>
            <li> if you go to rite aid or bartels etc.... all 16oz renpure products are $5.99 -- great price for organic product that is sulfate free.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my curly hair. Made my hair really soft like most other products but it did not help make my hair straight at all.</li>
            <li> I have dyed blonde hair which is frizzy and wavy after blow drying. Recently I have been noticing a ton of my hair has been falling out when blow drying and straightening it. After looking for solutions I decided to switch to shampoos that were sulfate free. I went to target and found this for $4.99 per bottle. I have been using it for a week and so far it is the best shampoo I have ever used! It makes my hair very soft and shiny! I still need to straighten my hair but after blow drying my hair is much smoother than it is with other shampoos. Once straightened my hair is really straight. I also had a LOT less hair falling out when I used this shampoo and conditioner. I like to alternate shampoos to not use the same kind every day and I noticed that the effects of this shampoo seem to last a few days, even when washing with a different shampoo the next day my hair was still softer than normal. I will continue to use this shampoo and conditioner and I can&#x27;t wait to try other products from this brand.</li>
            <li> Smells really nice, though I don&#x27;t see a significantâ€‹ straightening effect that other describe.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product but not through Amazon. I figured I&#x27;d leave a review for those thinking of buying this product. I really can&#x27;t say too much considering I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but the product did seem to make my hair soft. I was looking for a shampoo product that contained keratin seeing how I&#x27;m trying to grow out my hair and I heard that keratin helps to strengthen the hair and prevents less breakage. I came across this product and thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it doesnt have any of the harsh chemicals. Firstly the smell is good, and as I was washing my hair I noticed less hair fall then I usually have which was good, also the conditioner didn&#x27;t seem overlly thick. It didn&#x27;t leave that waxy feeling that certain conditioners do. That being said my hair felt soft and tangle free while washing it out. The comb went through super easy, no tangles or knots whatsoever. Overall, I&#x27;m liking this product so far</li>
            <li> So far so good. My hair feels much lighter and soft. Less frizzy and i live in an extremely moist climate area. Will update after a few weeks</li>
            <li> My daughter is biracial with very curly and thick brown hair.  This works great!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love their products, hope they continue to produce them.  I have extremely curly hair and have a Brazilian Smoothing done every 6 months.  In between I use the Renpure products and my hair is in the best condition its every been in and growing better as I don&#x27;t have breakage.  They have changed the formula. as far as the smell, but it still works great.</li>
