            <li> Thank goodness Amazon sells these travel sizes, so you&#x27;re not obligated to cancel shipments if ordering from their website.  Seemed to make my hair dryer.  After using one entire tube, as directed, I could actually see frizz while my hair was wet!  That&#x27;s a new one!  I wasn&#x27;t at all happy with the results after letting my hair dry.  I need to stop believing these infomercials!</li>

            <li> There is not enough shampoo in the combined tubes to wash my scalp.  Better to spend the money on the 32 oz of shampoo/conditioner.  It is marvelous.</li>
