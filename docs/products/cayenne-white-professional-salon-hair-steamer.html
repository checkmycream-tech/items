            <li>My steamer came within 2 days and was easy to put together.</li>
            <li>It is easy to assemble and use.</li>
            <li>then that, it&#x27;s easy to put together and easy to use.</li>
            <li>which is the position most desired for full head steaming.</li>
            <li>it worked fine.</li>
            <li>I received this product a few days ago and assembled it to the best of my ability.  </li>
            <li>When I plugged it in to my bathroom outlets there was a spark and a snapping sound then all of the outlets in my bathroom did not work.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I am finding new curls all the time as all of the moisture is resulting in more and more curl hydration and definition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also puts your mind body soul in a peaceful relax place really!!!!</li>
            <li>have to get used to how to make the steam how I want it by using the top vents and the high and low buttons, but it did a great job on my hair.</li>
            <li>how cool is that?</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Not only was it reasonably priced, it&#x27;s great, salon quality and can be moved anywhere in the house for use.</li>
            <li>Luckily my outlets were GFI protected.</li>
            <li>Maybe I filled it too much</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even get my monies worth at all.</li>
            <li>Pays for  itself by giving you saloon style deep conditioning treatment in the comfort of you own home.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough to put together, but not so easy to lower the hood to your forehead.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>Is is easy to put together and is light enough to be moved with ease.</li>
            <li>It does drip if the good is all the way down</li>
            <li>Hopefully next time I will be able to get the water levels right</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay,  don&#x27;t produce enough steam.</li>
            <li>First time steamer buyer.</li>
            <li>Clients love how the steam penetrates into their hair and I use this along with my deep conditioning treatments for my clients.  </li>
            <li>I can only steam the top of my head.</li>
            <li>At the first use of the steamer it stopped and  I could not used it.</li>
            <li>I reduced the stars because it drips hot water.</li>
            <li>w/the first steamer sent; contacted seller immediately; seller replaced it w/</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t put enough water once I put more water</li>
            <li>I just hear a loud buzzing sound.</li>
            <li>The first steamer I purchased didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Leaked hot water - returned</li>
            <li>it does not work, although the flyer that I first saw &amp;#34; FACTORY TESTED  gave me confidence.</li>
            <li>The product does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>Leaks hot water on clients from resivour</li>
            <li>My first thought was that I had received the incorrect item, but on closer inspection it was what was advertised on the web.</li>
            <li>The water in the reservoir did not get hot.</li>
            <li>If you have clients who wear weaves, this steamer will keep their natural hair hydrated and their scalp clean.</li>
            <li>Normally these steamers are rare in salons</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time last night and it works fine</li>
            <li>It has a high and a low setting which allows for adjusting the amount of steam you desire and to top it off it has a timer that automatically cuts off.</li>
            <li>It is easy to operate and quiet when running.  </li>
            <li>Its like so supper easy to put togather, and its quiet.</li>
            <li>Actually when they work they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s Pretty decent for the price.</li>
            <li>My hair came out very moisturized after using this steamer.</li>
            <li>so I ordered this again since the price was reasonable and reviews were still good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does its job and very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like this steamer.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Very please with my purchase</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable but, the steamer leaks and is flimsy.</li>
            <li>thanks for all your help and concerns.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>This steamer works very well for the price.</li>
            <li>Works really really well.</li>
            <li>I have only had this item for a short period of time but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>I really had high hopes for it.</li>
            <li>The tube drips hot steam water, so have a towle for it as well, again not messy.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this item.</li>
            <li>but other than that, this steamer works well and does not get super hot.</li>
            <li>My 4b hair absolutely had a different feel after the first use.</li>
            <li>If it last 6 months it&#x27;ll be worth the money.</li>
            <li>Other than that product works fine.</li>
            <li>I recommend using the low setting first before experimenting with the high setting.</li>
            <li>So a new purchase</li>
            <li>Looking for a new steamer.</li>
            <li>I called the company and they sent me a new one immediately without any problems.</li>
            <li>The steamer appears to be a quality product but the assembly and use instructions aren&#x27;t very clear.  </li>
            <li>She says it is exactly what they use when she pays a hefty price for the same steam treatment in the salon&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It heats up hot enough.</li>
            <li>You have to be very lucky to be one of the few people that this product will work for.</li>
            <li>I used it bi-weekly and my natural hair is very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Once the water level boiled down it was okay and stopped leaking; this could be a potential hazard since you are dealing with boiling water, not to mention electricity.</li>
            <li>The distribution of steam within the hood doesn&#x27;t seem even-more steam in top and front areas, less in back.</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>but mine beeps really loud sometimes.</li>
            <li>I was very as amazed because In Suriname we have the same voltage of USA.  </li>
            <li>I have gone natural since July of 2014.</li>
            <li>the hood and my hair are unbelievably soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend for a professional licensed stylist.</li>
            <li>So far I give it five stars.</li>
            <li>My hair gets so soft after I&#x27;ve used it and stays that way for almost a week without me doing anything to it.</li>
            <li>Ok so it took me weeks of web surfing, reading various product reviews and comparing specs and reviews of other steamers before actually settling on this.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a high button and a low button.</li>
            <li>but there are no clear markings on how much to fill.</li>
            <li>The cayenne white professional salon hair steamer is fine as a backup hair steamer but, not for multiple everyday use in a busy salon.</li>
            <li>Even though the timer was set to 30 minutes it did cut off earlier and took some time to &amp;#34;reboot&amp;#34; or cool down.</li>
            <li>I originally brought this product to replace on that I&#x27;ve had for a few months, which had also suddenly stopped working.</li>
            <li>Only steams if on high and it makes a loud noise like it&#x27;s going to shunt down or something.</li>
            <li>it gives you a loud long squeal.</li>
            <li>Wrap your self with a towle because the hot steam drips some, but nothing messy.</li>

            <li> it does not work, although the flyer that I first saw &amp;#34; FACTORY TESTED  gave me confidence.</li>
            <li> The product does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> Leaks hot water on clients from resivour</li>
            <li> My first thought was that I had received the incorrect item, but on closer inspection it was what was advertised on the web.</li>
            <li> The water in the reservoir did not get hot.</li>
            <li> If you have clients who wear weaves, this steamer will keep their natural hair hydrated and their scalp clean.</li>
            <li> Normally these steamers are rare in salons</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time last night and it works fine</li>
            <li> It has a high and a low setting which allows for adjusting the amount of steam you desire and to top it off it has a timer that automatically cuts off.</li>
            <li> It is easy to operate and quiet when running.  </li>
            <li> Its like so supper easy to put togather, and its quiet.</li>
            <li> Actually when they work they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s Pretty decent for the price.</li>
            <li> My hair came out very moisturized after using this steamer.</li>
            <li> so I ordered this again since the price was reasonable and reviews were still good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does its job and very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like this steamer.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Very please with my purchase</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable but, the steamer leaks and is flimsy.</li>
            <li> thanks for all your help and concerns.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> This steamer works very well for the price.</li>
            <li> Works really really well.</li>
            <li> I have only had this item for a short period of time but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for it.</li>
            <li> The tube drips hot steam water, so have a towle for it as well, again not messy.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this item.</li>
            <li> but other than that, this steamer works well and does not get super hot.</li>
            <li> My 4b hair absolutely had a different feel after the first use.</li>
            <li> If it last 6 months it&#x27;ll be worth the money.</li>
            <li> Other than that product works fine.</li>
            <li> I recommend using the low setting first before experimenting with the high setting.</li>
            <li> So a new purchase</li>
            <li> Looking for a new steamer.</li>
            <li> I called the company and they sent me a new one immediately without any problems.</li>
            <li> The steamer appears to be a quality product but the assembly and use instructions aren&#x27;t very clear.  </li>
            <li> She says it is exactly what they use when she pays a hefty price for the same steam treatment in the salon&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It heats up hot enough.</li>
            <li> You have to be very lucky to be one of the few people that this product will work for.</li>
            <li> I used it bi-weekly and my natural hair is very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Once the water level boiled down it was okay and stopped leaking; this could be a potential hazard since you are dealing with boiling water, not to mention electricity.</li>
            <li> The distribution of steam within the hood doesn&#x27;t seem even-more steam in top and front areas, less in back.</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> but mine beeps really loud sometimes.</li>
            <li> I was very as amazed because In Suriname we have the same voltage of USA.  </li>
            <li> I have gone natural since July of 2014.</li>
            <li> the hood and my hair are unbelievably soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend for a professional licensed stylist.</li>
            <li> So far I give it five stars.</li>
            <li> My hair gets so soft after I&#x27;ve used it and stays that way for almost a week without me doing anything to it.</li>
            <li> Ok so it took me weeks of web surfing, reading various product reviews and comparing specs and reviews of other steamers before actually settling on this.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a high button and a low button.</li>
            <li> but there are no clear markings on how much to fill.</li>
            <li> The cayenne white professional salon hair steamer is fine as a backup hair steamer but, not for multiple everyday use in a busy salon.</li>
            <li> Even though the timer was set to 30 minutes it did cut off earlier and took some time to &amp;#34;reboot&amp;#34; or cool down.</li>
            <li> I originally brought this product to replace on that I&#x27;ve had for a few months, which had also suddenly stopped working.</li>
            <li> Only steams if on high and it makes a loud noise like it&#x27;s going to shunt down or something.</li>
            <li> it gives you a loud long squeal.</li>
            <li> Wrap your self with a towle because the hot steam drips some, but nothing messy.</li>
            <li> I like this dryer but the thing i did not like was no information on how much to fill of water, and I saw by accident I can take the water cover off where the water boils but there was nothing about that either  just not very good information at all with the product</li>
            <li> It is big for my one bedroom with limited closet space</li>
            <li> Not sure it will run for 60 mins on one &#x27;tank&#x27; while on the high setting, though.</li>
            <li> All I heard was a faint buzzing sound.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it drips hot water so you will have to bit something down to catch it.</li>
            <li> so when the water started to boil it overflowed and started leaking and boiled over into the other smaller container that collects the condensation from the hood.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s way more expensive!</li>
            <li> Received black instead of the white steamer.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it will break in a few months or instantly upon receiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> You must also be careful with the part that heats up.</li>
            <li> But it is not very durable.</li>
            <li> Not very sturdy nor does it come with directions.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed as it looked cheap, and not only were the assembly instructions incomplete (it only showed how to assemble the base), it was also filled with spelling mistakes (manual was spelled &amp;#34;manal&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> My hair were damaged due to coloring and&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is extremely ease to put together and</li>
            <li> but other</li>
            <li> There is a white tube leading from it that I&#x27;m not sure what needs to be done with it.  </li>
            <li> If not this product could&#x27;ve burned my house down.</li>
            <li> The power source is a little faulty-once on</li>
            <li> That was disappointing because I had to take it apart and pack it back up and send it back!!!</li>
            <li> I received it and the bolt was missing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It has made a difference in my natural hair and sabes me from needing to go to the salon for expensive treatments.</li>
            <li> I do make sire to dump my water after use because I don&#x27;t want the water to destroy my iron coils.</li>
            <li> Also, I wish that the hood was easier to adjust once you were seated: mine was a little hard to adjust</li>
            <li> It does not leak or drip on you like others have said in past reviews.</li>
            <li> The package was delivered to the wrong house, and was lost for several days.</li>
            <li> She loves the steamer and has no out of the ordinary drips.</li>
            <li> For the price, this compares to the expensive salon version while giving the same results.  </li>
            <li> Also if youmist have common sense to put it together because there are NO assembly instructions.</li>
            <li> I just have one complaint...</li>
            <li> I thought it was not good</li>
            <li> It was my first purchase at amazone and very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it is not working.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my unit did not work.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product! My hair came out very moisturized after using this steamer. The difference was immediate. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay,  don&#x27;t produce enough steam.</li>
            <li> Great product! 5 stars!</li>
            <li> First time steamer buyer. I like the effects of the steamer on my hair, scalp and skin. Assembly was tricky and customer support was not great/helpful.  The power source is a little faulty-once on it would shut off within 5 min.  I resolved this by adding more water.  The distribution of steam within the hood doesn&#x27;t seem even-more steam in top and front areas, less in back.</li>
            <li> Purchased for daughter, she is very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> I put the item together and it didn&#x27;t work.  That was disappointing because I had to take it apart and pack it back up and send it back!!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great steamer</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money on this product. I received it and the bolt was missing. I finally received the bolt and put the steamer together. I plugged it into the wall and sparks came out of the outlet. Needless to say, it is not working.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item March 17,2015. I used it three times and is no longer working as of May 6. This was a total rip off. I didn&#x27;t even get my monies worth at all. The 100$ I spent would have been better served at hair salon paying for 15$ steams!!!! Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> This is a nice steamer...but mine beeps really loud sometimes. I think if you let the water get too low it gives you a loud long squeal. That could e my doing. but other than that, this steamer works well and does not get super hot. It does not leak or drip on you like others have said in past reviews. Its actually a very nice one. However when you store it, i recommend emptying whatever unused whatever you have in the reservoir.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! Does everything it is supposed to do!</li>
            <li> The package was delivered to the wrong house, and was lost for several days. Although that isn&#x27;t amazon&#x27;s fault, the fact that the product sparked and died as soon as it was plugged in is. I originally brought this product to replace on that I&#x27;ve had for a few months, which had also suddenly stopped working. I thought it was a one-off thing so I ordered this again since the price was reasonable and reviews were still good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this product. You have to be very lucky to be one of the few people that this product will work for. Otherwise, it will break in a few months or instantly upon receiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself the headache, find another product!</li>
            <li> I use this steamer in my hair salon and haven&#x27;t had any issues.  Clients love how the steam penetrates into their hair and I use this along with my deep conditioning treatments for my clients.  If you have clients who wear weaves, this steamer will keep their natural hair hydrated and their scalp clean.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s made in China.  I really had high hopes for it. I wanted it to be awesome.  Problem 1: the instructions are incomplete.  It&#x27;s easy enough to put together, but not so easy to lower the hood to your forehead.  I can only steam the top of my head. #2 It feels flimsy and cheep. #3 there is no max fill line to reference. The instructions read to use the max fill line.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift and they loved it. They use it alot and there were no problems with it. I would buy from them again. Thanks for the good merchandise.</li>
            <li> Dear Amazone. It was my first purchase at amazone and very disappointed. At the first use of the steamer it stopped and  I could not used it. It appeared that the print plate was burned. I was very as amazed because In Suriname we have the same voltage of USA.  Currently I was looking if it was possible to replace the print plate. So a new purchase and I could not use it .  Regards Dominique</li>
            <li> Great price, easy to put together and I can move it around if need be!  I love it! Best investment!</li>
            <li> For the most part I like the steamer and it does what it claims to, but there are some things that I would change about the steamer. For one, I would put a minimum and maximum fill line on the water container so that it can&#x27;t be overfilled. I overfilled the water container so when the water started to boil it overflowed and started leaking and boiled over into the other smaller container that collects the condensation from the hood. Once the water level boiled down it was okay and stopped leaking; this could be a potential hazard since you are dealing with boiling water, not to mention electricity. Secondly, the one that I purchased did not come with instructions so I had to guess how to put it together and operate it. Also, I wish that the hood was easier to adjust once you were seated: mine was a little hard to adjust so I had to scoot from under it and re-adjust the hood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, did it deliver the results it claims to? Yes, it does. I did notice a difference in my hair after only sitting under it for about 15 minutes. I would have sat under it longer, but the issues I had with it boiling over used up a bit of water and I didn&#x27;t want to refill it only to have the same issue so i just used the remaining water which was enough for about a 15 minute steam. Hopefully next time I will be able to get the water levels right so I will be able to steam for about 30 minutes (my hair needs all the help it can get).</li>
            <li> Received a defective and wobbly product</li>
            <li> it doing the job for my hair and after steaming , my goodness ...............it is perfect and beauty !</li>
            <li> Only steams if on high and it makes a loud noise like it&#x27;s going to shunt down or something.</li>
            <li> I received the steamer several days before the estimated delivery date. It was easy for me to put together, I put it together in 20 minutes. The steamer works great. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase. My 4b hair absolutely had a different feel after the first use.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I reduced the stars because it drips hot water. If you wrap a towel around you it will prevent harm. You must also be careful with the part that heats up. I was sitting in the chair reverse and burned my forehead.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this steamer. I have had it for 5 months now no problems as of yet.</li>
            <li> It,s a perfect steamer for my hair. Love it..</li>
            <li> First, customer service is excellent.  I experienced an issue w/the first steamer sent; contacted seller immediately; seller replaced it w/in a few days (wish the initial shipping was that fast).  It does its job and very well.  It is easy to operate and quiet when running.  It works great.  Not sure it will run for 60 mins on one &#x27;tank&#x27; while on the high setting, though. I use it several times a week when conditioning my low porosity hair.  I am finding new curls all the time as all of the moisture is resulting in more and more curl hydration and definition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied customer.  I HIGHLY recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving my steamer, this steamers has helped many of my salon clients. Clients are rebooking because it&#x27;s helped them with eczema, eye allergies, respiratory issues, headaches etc........ I&#x27;m loving this steamer but most of all it&#x27;s helping my clients to feel better Thanks!!!!!!! üôèüôèüôè:)</li>
            <li> My steamer came a day early then I expected it. It was easy to put together and when I tested it after 10 minutes it stopped I thought it was not good but I didn&#x27;t put enough water once I put more water it worked fine. I love it glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this hair steamer...I can see the different in my hair every since I started using this Salon Hair Steamer. I have gone natural since July of 2014.</li>
            <li> My steamer came within 2 days and was easy to put together. Unfortunately my unit did not work. Seems I received a defective product. I emailed Amazon and UPS picked up the package for return the following morning. Great customer service Amazon! Looking for a new steamer.</li>
            <li> It does the job, and I can sit under it while I&#x27;m working at my computer...how cool is that? :-)&lt;br /&gt;Two issues I have with it are:&lt;br /&gt;1. There&#x27;s a high button and a low button. They seem to run at the same time if u leave them on? Weird.&lt;br /&gt;2. the use of the cup at the front-- I read the directions as &amp;#34;fill everything up with water...but you shouldn&#x27;t bc the front cup catches water.&lt;br /&gt;I have to get used to how to make the steam how I want it by using the top vents and the high and low buttons, but it did a great job on my hair. Since receiving it I steamed my hair with it maybe three times and conditioned my hair with it once.</li>
            <li> I really like this steamer. It was easy to assemble - as compared to more popular models advertised on hair blogs. I am also pleased with the temperature and distribution of steam.</li>
            <li> Im overjoyed I picked&lt;br /&gt;this Hair Steamer&lt;br /&gt;over all the rest&lt;br /&gt;on the market‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, Probably the best investment I ever made for my hair. My hair were damaged due to coloring and&lt;br /&gt;nothing I used helped until this baby came along. I have only given my self 4 treatments of conditioner+20 min&lt;br /&gt;under the hood and my hair are unbelievably soft and manageable.  This product is extremely ease to put together and&lt;br /&gt;use.  Pays for  itself by giving you saloon style deep conditioning treatment in the comfort of you own home.I definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> so far so good. I really do love it.  If it last 6 months it&#x27;ll be worth the money. fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> Works amazing...easy set up..</li>
            <li> I have only had this item for a short period of time but so far so good.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> Very please with my purchase and I will buy from the seller again. This product met all of my expectation.</li>
            <li> Actually when they work they&#x27;re fine. I say &amp;#34;they&amp;#34; because there are a bunch of these for sale under different names but they all come from the same manufacturer in China. That&#x27;s right every steamer that you see here that looks like this - they are all the same regardless of price.  I use this to process hair color and it is great for that. But it is not very durable. I have one that has lasted over a year and I had one that worked for only 35 minutes.</li>
            <li> This steamer is great and light weight easy to move around in the salon</li>
            <li> The cayenne white professional salon hair steamer is fine as a backup hair steamer but, not for multiple everyday use in a busy salon. The price was reasonable but, the steamer leaks and is flimsy.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter&#x27;s birthday. She says it is exactly what they use when she pays a hefty price for the same steam treatment in the salon&#x27;s.  She loves the steamer and has no out of the ordinary drips. Gold star for mom!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. I just hear a loud buzzing sound. I don&#x27;t know how to request a replacement.</li>
            <li> Great.....thanks for all your help and concerns.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Had it about a month now. Only tip: dump the water when not in use or it was damage the heating coil.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my purchase. I would recommend this steamer to anyone who is interesting in purchasing a steamer. The price is great for anyone on a budget. The first steamer I purchased didn&#x27;t work. I called the company and they sent me a new one immediately without any problems. You could also call the company and they will talk you through any problems you might be facing. The representative I spoke to was very pleasant, easy to talk to. He answered all my questions. Itruly love my steamer.</li>
            <li> For the price, this compares to the expensive salon version while giving the same results.  Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Leaked hot water - returned</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s happy so is her soft hair</li>
            <li> Received black instead of the white steamer. Once I got it to work it&#x27;s not bad. Supposed to be great for resistant hair and to keep the color on reds. I recommend using the low setting first before experimenting with the high setting. Fast shipping and definitely a good price! Normally these steamers are rare in salons so it&#x27;s way more expensive!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Mine does not steam, the water heats up in the reservoir then the machine shuts off. No steam. it does not work, although the flyer that I first saw &amp;#34; FACTORY TESTED  gave me confidence. Such Bull. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend for a professional licensed stylist. Not very sturdy nor does it come with directions. Nothing about the equipment....you have too GUESS what&#x27;s next.</li>
            <li> Ok so it took me weeks of web surfing, reading various product reviews and comparing specs and reviews of other steamers before actually settling on this. Well I&#x27;m definitely glad I chose this one. Not only was it reasonably priced, it&#x27;s great, salon quality and can be moved anywhere in the house for use. It has a high and a low setting which allows for adjusting the amount of steam you desire and to top it off it has a timer that automatically cuts off. It was also simple to put together.</li>
            <li> This steamer is a great value.  Is is easy to put together and is light enough to be moved with ease. My only complaint is that it drips hot water so you will have to bit something down to catch it. It has made a difference in my natural hair and sabes me from needing to go to the salon for expensive treatments.</li>
            <li> So far I give it five stars. The product does exactly what it claims to do. It heats up hot enough. I haven&#x27;t not one issue. It is easy to assemble and use. I do make sire to dump my water after use because I don&#x27;t want the water to destroy my iron coils.</li>
            <li> fell apart  company was not cooperative in return</li>
            <li> Bought this for my salon and it&#x27;s Pretty decent for the price. The wheels don&#x27;t move that well but other then that, it&#x27;s easy to put together and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I received this product a few days ago and assembled it to the best of my ability.  The steamer appears to be a quality product but the assembly and use instructions aren&#x27;t very clear.  I used it for the first time last night and it works fine but leaks.  There is a white tube leading from it that I&#x27;m not sure what needs to be done with it.  Water leaks from the tube and the unit.  Maybe I filled it too much but there are no clear markings on how much to fill.</li>
            <li> Great steamer.  Leaks hot water on clients from resivour, so you have to use a towel to cover to catch the drip. Other than that product works fine.</li>
            <li> This steamer works very well for the price. Its like so supper easy to put togather, and its quiet. It also puts your mind body soul in a peaceful relax place really!!!! Five stars for this steamer. Wrap your self with a towle because the hot steam drips some, but nothing messy. The tube drips hot steam water, so have a towle for it as well, again not messy. Its a good get for us natural Girls !!!</li>
            <li> Bought this week and received a couple of days later. I was very disappointed as it looked cheap, and not only were the assembly instructions incomplete (it only showed how to assemble the base), it was also filled with spelling mistakes (manual was spelled &amp;#34;manal&amp;#34;). My first thought was that I had received the incorrect item, but on closer inspection it was what was advertised on the web. I figured it out and put it together, plugged it in, and nothing. All I heard was a faint buzzing sound. The water in the reservoir did not get hot. I left it on for about 20 minutes and finally turned it off since nothing happened. I called the next day and returned it. I reread some of the reviews just to be sure, and they all seemed to be good for the most part, so I&#x27;m going to give it another try. I&#x27;m ordering another one today and hopefully it was just a fluke that the one I received prior was defective. I will update my review after I receive and hopefully used the next one.</li>
            <li> Works really really well. I used it bi-weekly and my natural hair is very soft and manageable. Great price too. I was paying $40 bi-weekly at the salon.</li>
            <li> Amazing! After 3 weeks of continuous use once a week my results can&#x27;t be quantified. The moisture retention is amazing. My wash-n-go lasts and entire 7 days! It is big for my one bedroom with limited closet space but I don&#x27;t mind a salon in my living room!</li>
            <li> This steamer caused a fire hazard! When I plugged it in to my bathroom outlets there was a spark and a snapping sound then all of the outlets in my bathroom did not work. Luckily my outlets were GFI protected. If not this product could&#x27;ve burned my house down.</li>
            <li> Water drips on client while under the steamer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this steamer over a month now. It does drip if the good is all the way down which is the position most desired for full head steaming. Even though the timer was set to 30 minutes it did cut off earlier and took some time to &amp;#34;reboot&amp;#34; or cool down. I don&#x27;t know which. All in all its ok. Also if youmist have common sense to put it together because there are NO assembly instructions.</li>
            <li> I like this dryer but the thing i did not like was no information on how much to fill of water, and I saw by accident I can take the water cover off where the water boils but there was nothing about that either  just not very good information at all with the product</li>
            <li> This works great and is a great investment. I just have one complaint...&lt;br /&gt;Why wasn&#x27;t a cup sent with the hair steamer?&lt;br /&gt;The cup should go where the plastic tube is. It does not even look like it was designed for one but still...</li>
            <li> Item as described, will recommend to all of my friends. Cheers!</li>
            <li> So far so good. I have used it on myself and my two children. We all love it. My hair gets so soft after I&#x27;ve used it and stays that way for almost a week without me doing anything to it. I definitely recommend this product to anyone and everyone.</li>
