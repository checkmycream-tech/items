    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;Not very good.  </li>
            <li>and it did not do a very good job at all.  </li>
            <li>This product does not &amp;#34;tweeze&amp;#34; hair as good as the epi-stick/roller that I have.</li>
            <li>Now to the good stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the spring-type much more successful.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty good; since there are no instructions you have to just figure it out!  </li>
            <li>I have very very fine hair on my face.  </li>
            <li>Immediately I started using it and &amp;#34;I LOVE THIS INVENTION!!!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Had to go over the area many times to notice a difference.</li>
            <li>IS MORE</li>
            <li>IF YOU ROLL IT LIGHTLY!</li>
            <li>Bought an electronic epilator which works much better.</li>
            <li>It was just okay</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even cute.</li>
            <li>and I have a nice, smooth face.  </li>
            <li>Also, it is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Keeping it up is easy.  </li>
            <li>The item was easily pulled out of the bottom of the package.  </li>
            <li>This design is easy to use with one hand and allows you to easily roll in all directions.  </li>
            <li>the price is good for trying something new.</li>
            <li>THE BEST WAY TO USE THIS IS TO REMEMBER LESS</li>
            <li>YOU&#x27;LL HAVE A SMOOTH SURFACE</li>
            <li>This epilator is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Since your hair grows in all directions, this is important.  </li>
            <li>With the straight kind that you hold in a &#x27;U&#x27;, I would tire of the twisting motion, and often have difficulty on the right side (I am a lefty).  </li>
            <li>but when i opened the packaged and tried to use it, it wasn&#x27;t as great as i expected, i pinched and roll no hair was removed.</li>
            <li>Missed most of the hair on the first and second pass and took five or more passes to get most of the hair form and one place.  </li>
            <li>this is so much easier than the long spring hair removers, works great on fine hairs all you have to do is roll the tool over your face, you don&#x27;t have to do any twisting, would recommend this to anyone.  </li>
            <li>Because this spring epilates, it can sting a bit as hair is pulled from the root, but I quickly became accustomed to it</li>
            <li>it was worth the wait</li>
            <li>From the get-go, it has easily removed my fine hairs even when they are fairly short.  </li>
            <li>I think this tool is probably as effective of any of the similar manual spring models offered and the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>As many other reviewers have noted electric-type epilators do not work well in removing fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The combination of these two products gets rid of all types of my facial hair and leaves my face very smooth.</li>
            <li>but otherwise it removes facial hair like a gem :-).  </li>
            <li>It is simple, quick, free (ah, once you buy it that is), AND IT WORKS.</li>
            <li>So, what to do about the fine hair on my upper lip and cheeks?  </li>
            <li>; Much easier to use than the straight ones that I have.</li>
            <li>MUCH EASIER</li>
            <li>TAKE YOUR TIME, ROLL GENTLY, DO IT WEEKLY.</li>
            <li>Was cheap enough to throw away and not worry about returning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and then it is much easier to maintain.  </li>
            <li>I can feel it working when I run it over my forearm to try it out, but don&#x27;t seem to get much when using it on my face.  </li>
            <li>I decided to invest in an epilator and it is so much faster.</li>
            <li>Initially i was excited, hey no need to go get threaded anymore as i got this tool</li>
            <li>If this is your first time epilating facial hair, it will take several passes over an area to remove most of the hair.  </li>
            <li>Just a couple quick passes over my cheek area and upper lip</li>
            <li>I think it still doesn&#x27;t always get the entire hair from the root, but cleaning up the hairs is quick and thorough.  </li>
            <li>THERE IS NOTHING WORSE THAN TRYING TO CREATE BEAUTIFUL MAKEUP ON A BRIDE WITH FACIAL HAIR.</li>
            <li>Very small spring it is too small to be effective, flimsy and bends out of shape easily.</li>
            <li>Seems to work well on the tiny hairs but large coarse hairs seem too much for this to handle, Easy to use, fits well in the hand, rolls well on the skin, but picks up little.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;VE BEEN A PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP ARTIST OVER 20 YEARS.</li>
            <li>Surprised</li>
            <li>The tool is small and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>But with the straight springs that you hold in a &#x27;U&#x27; shape I found that other than the first time, it became more difficult to remove the hairs completely.  </li>
            <li>It literally rips the hair right off of your face and makes an unsettling &#x27;popping&#x27; sound as it goes.  </li>
            <li>I tried using it directly out of the shower (while the pours should still be open) and no change.  </li>
            <li>USE IT LIGHTLY AND SLOWLY.</li>
            <li>It works OK, but not great.  </li>
            <li>Because the spring is attached to a handle, it is much easier to use than other devices of this type that I have tried.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> but I felt it was less than the long spring you have to manipulate</li>
            <li> on removing some hairs, the really fine ones that were not at all long,  But courser or longer hair was really painful</li>
            <li> The spring is so small that it will only remove the smallest of hairs.</li>
            <li> Also, I dropped one side or the other often.  </li>
            <li> other times I feel I like I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing and getting no results at all.  </li>
            <li> so basically it was not worth it for me.</li>
            <li> Which is again what the other reviewer might have been referring to when saying &#x27;something was missing&#x27; from the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only place it was particularly uncomfortable was the upper lip.  </li>
            <li> Use this little gadget, of course.  </li>
            <li> It appeared as if something else had also been missing from the package.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses, I can say that this product isn&#x27;t working for me the way it should.  </li>
            <li> Each time I used it, I checked my face with a 10x mirror and saw the same thing;  the hair were not pulled out by the root but instead broken off.  </li>
            <li> Not very effective.</li>
            <li> so it was difficult to determine how to use it properly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it would take for this item to work correctly.  </li>
            <li> There are tiny, little pictures on the back that &#x27;attempt&#x27; to show you how to use the product but fail miserably at that.  </li>
            <li> A little difficult to use and took awhile to receive.  </li>
            <li> Over time, though, hair growth begins to thin out</li>
            <li> I am assuming, as with tweezing, after doing it for some time it will become less painful to use.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was tampered with or if it&#x27;s just bad packaging ??  </li>
            <li> But if you are expecting to not have to tweeze anymore, you will be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Around the mouth was especially painful.  </li>
            <li> And there it was VERY painful!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This thing is so tiny! The spring is so small that it will only remove the smallest of hairs. If you are looking for something to deal with semi course to course growth, this will not be the tool for you.</li>
            <li> Just received my purchase today. Immediately I started using it and &amp;#34;I LOVE THIS INVENTION!!!&amp;#34; Much easier to use than the straight ones that I have. After ending this review, I&#x27;m ordering 2 more!&lt;br /&gt;Only &amp;#34;Con&amp;#34; is that it takes 3 to 4 weeks for delivery. Unfortunately!</li>
            <li> Not very effective. Had to go over the area many times to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> A little difficult to use and took awhile to receive.  This product does not &amp;#34;tweeze&amp;#34; hair as good as the epi-stick/roller that I have.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;VE BEEN A PROFESSIONAL MAKEUP ARTIST OVER 20 YEARS. THIS TOOL IS A GOD-SEND! THERE IS NOTHING WORSE THAN TRYING TO CREATE BEAUTIFUL MAKEUP ON A BRIDE WITH FACIAL HAIR. THE BEST WAY TO USE THIS IS TO REMEMBER LESS IS MORE--DO NOT FORCE THE TOOL. USE IT LIGHTLY AND SLOWLY. THE HAIR WILL COME OFF MUCH EASIER IF YOU ROLL IT LIGHTLY! PEOPLE WO SAY IT DOES NOT WORK DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. TAKE YOUR TIME, ROLL GENTLY, DO IT WEEKLY. YOU&#x27;LL HAVE A SMOOTH SURFACE ON WHICH TO APPLY YOUR MAKEUP.</li>
            <li> Very small spring it is too small to be effective, flimsy and bends out of shape easily. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well on the tiny hairs but large coarse hairs seem too much for this to handle, Easy to use, fits well in the hand, rolls well on the skin, but picks up little. Bought an electronic epilator which works much better.</li>
            <li> Instructions are in Asian so it was difficult to determine how to use it properly. It did not work at all for my facial hair.</li>
            <li> Initially i was excited, hey no need to go get threaded anymore as i got this tool but when i opened the packaged and tried to use it, it wasn&#x27;t as great as i expected, i pinched and roll no hair was removed. so basically it was not worth it for me.</li>
            <li> When the item came in the mail, the package had been already opened. It appeared as if something else had also been missing from the package.  Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my mother and she says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not very good.  It was just okay on removing some hairs, the really fine ones that were not at all long,  But courser or longer hair was really painful and it did not do a very good job at all.  Missed most of the hair on the first and second pass and took five or more passes to get most of the hair form and one place.  almost never got all.  Did not like the way it worked at all,.  Was cheap enough to throw away and not worry about returning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on her experience, I would not recommend this.  The only reason it got 2 stars is that it did remove hair.</li>
            <li> I cannot wax or use chemical exfoliants on my face because I use a prescription strength retinoic acid cream.  So, what to do about the fine hair on my upper lip and cheeks?  Use this little gadget, of course.  Because the spring is attached to a handle, it is much easier to use than other devices of this type that I have tried.  If this is your first time epilating facial hair, it will take several passes over an area to remove most of the hair.  Over time, though, hair growth begins to thin out and then it is much easier to maintain.  I use it once weekly to keep facial hair to a minimum.  Just a couple quick passes over my cheek area and upper lip and I&#x27;m done in a couple minutes.  Because this spring epilates, it can sting a bit as hair is pulled from the root, but I quickly became accustomed to it so it doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore.</li>
            <li> this is so much easier than the long spring hair removers, works great on fine hairs all you have to do is roll the tool over your face, you don&#x27;t have to do any twisting, would recommend this to anyone.  There is some sting but I felt it was less than the long spring you have to manipulate</li>
            <li> , I have tried most kinds of epilators, both electric and nonelectric, expensive and cheap, and simple and complicated.  In &#x27;spring&#x27;-type epilators alone, I have tried 5.  Number 5 was the Rosallini.  I have very very fine hair on my face.  As many other reviewers have noted electric-type epilators do not work well in removing fine hair.  From the start I&#x27;ve found the spring-type much more successful.  But with the straight springs that you hold in a &#x27;U&#x27; shape I found that other than the first time, it became more difficult to remove the hairs completely.  Now to the good stuff.  This epilator is fantastic.  From the get-go, it has easily removed my fine hairs even when they are fairly short.  I think it still doesn&#x27;t always get the entire hair from the root, but cleaning up the hairs is quick and thorough.  Also, it is so easy to use.  With the straight kind that you hold in a &#x27;U&#x27;, I would tire of the twisting motion, and often have difficulty on the right side (I am a lefty).  Also, I dropped one side or the other often.  With this epilator, there&#x27;s none of that.  It is simple, quick, free (ah, once you buy it that is), AND IT WORKS. It&#x27;s even cute.</li>
            <li> Never have I used such a device but it does work.  It literally rips the hair right off of your face and makes an unsettling &#x27;popping&#x27; sound as it goes.  I had to give myself a break in-between swipes so I could brace myself to endure the pain (I didn&#x27;t use any ice cubes prior).  Around the mouth was especially painful.  However, it did do the trick and I have a nice, smooth face.  Keeping it up is easy.  I keep it where I sit to watch TV and swoosh it around when I think of it.  Surprised I never knew of this before.  However, I did have hubby try it and it didn&#x27;t work at all.  I think you have to have &#x27;peach fuzz&#x27; type of facial hair for it to work.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good; since there are no instructions you have to just figure it out!  I would recommend this- the price is good for trying something new.</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t overdo it!  can bruise skin if used too vigorously but otherwise it removes facial hair like a gem :-).  it was worth the wait</li>
            <li> The instructions for this product are not in English.  So, unless you are multi-lingual, you are out of luck.  Thankfully, it is a fairly simple concept and some trial and error will probably suffice.  The tool is small and easy to use.  It works OK, but not great.  I went over and over the same spots going different directions and still there were hairs it did not remove.  The only place it was particularly uncomfortable was the upper lip.  And there it was VERY painful!  I am assuming, as with tweezing, after doing it for some time it will become less painful to use.  I still had to go back over the areas with a pair of tweezers to remove the remaining hairs.  I think this tool is probably as effective of any of the similar manual spring models offered and the price was reasonable.  But if you are expecting to not have to tweeze anymore, you will be disappointed.  In that case I would suggest trying an epilator.</li>
            <li> I just received this product a couple days ago.  Just like another reviewer said, my package appeared to also be &#x27;open&#x27;.  The item was easily pulled out of the bottom of the package.  I don&#x27;t know if it was tampered with or if it&#x27;s just bad packaging ??  There was also a bubble in the plastic that made me think something else &#x27;might&#x27; have been inside the package but was not there.  Which is again what the other reviewer might have been referring to when saying &#x27;something was missing&#x27; from the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as others have said, the entire packaging is in Japanese (except the word &#x27;make up&#x27; on the front.)  There are tiny, little pictures on the back that &#x27;attempt&#x27; to show you how to use the product but fail miserably at that.  I can feel it working when I run it over my forearm to try it out, but don&#x27;t seem to get much when using it on my face.  I am now using it as I &#x27;think&#x27; it was intended and sometimes it works well and other times I feel I like I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing and getting no results at all.  The jury is still out for now how well it actually works.  I will update my review in the future but for now, I don&#x27;t recommend this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/25/13... I have now changed my review to one-star.  After a few uses, I can say that this product isn&#x27;t working for me the way it should.  Each time I used it, I checked my face with a 10x mirror and saw the same thing;  the hair were not pulled out by the root but instead broken off.  I tried using it directly out of the shower (while the pours should still be open) and no change.  I&#x27;m not sure what it would take for this item to work correctly.  Maybe if all the packaging was not in Japanese I would know?</li>
            <li> This design is easy to use with one hand and allows you to easily roll in all directions.  Since your hair grows in all directions, this is important.  I like to use this product along with the REM Spring, which is a spring design as well.  The combination of these two products gets rid of all types of my facial hair and leaves my face very smooth.</li>
            <li> This product works but there is an adjustment period when you want to throw it away.  I decided to invest in an epilator and it is so much faster.</li>
