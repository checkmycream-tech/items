            <li>This is a great palette that works for any skin tone.</li>
            <li>I troll the beauty/makeup blogs for tips on good products, and I&#x27;m always amazed at the performance of some drugstore products I&#x27;ve overlooked.  </li>
            <li>They are absolutely gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>Always loved this palette.</li>

            <li>Love the colors in this palette!</li>
            <li>These colors are super and look great on just about everyone.</li>
            <li>Somewhere along the line I got the message that they were very cheap (cost and quality)</li>
            <li>this palette has fair pigmentation, color that fades fairly quickly, chalky texture and inconsistent quality.</li>
            <li>I love the colors in this set, and it stays on.</li>
            <li>as for the product itself, I love it.....</li>
            <li>Would reorder this product from this seller again :)</li>
            <li>Not my favorite palette</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I have decided to order this palette.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing these shadows (3 of the colors) for the better part of a work day</li>
            <li>absolutely love this palette and will order again.</li>
            <li>I am partial to neutral tones and this has some great shades in it!</li>
            <li>Love the rich colors of this palette.</li>
            <li>I liked this palette so much</li>
            <li>The product was delivered super quick.....</li>
            <li>WOW!is the only word I can think of at this moment, they so rich and pigmentined that it is WILD (lol).</li>
            <li>Wet N Wild shadows are amazing as always!!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something not expensive, you must give this product a try!</li>
            <li>EXACT!  </li>
            <li>This color palette was better than my expensive brands and the pigments are very comparable to MAC and the better brands, highly pigmented and &#x27;lasts all day&#x27; color.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived well packaged, great seller!</li>
            <li>There is great color intensity and little powder fall off.</li>
            <li>I surprised considering the price of this palette going to buy more.</li>
            <li>it was worth every dime...</li>
            <li>Nice neutral palette, colors are much more pigmented than the majority of Wet and Wild palettes.</li>
            <li>I first bought it at rite aid</li>
            <li>it looked exactly like what I needed and not a dupe.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth tossing it in my purse for touchups and not worrying too much that I&#x27;ll lose it or that it&#x27;ll break.</li>
            <li>Boy, I wish I&#x27;d tried this Wet-n-Wild palette that was recommended on a beauty blog before I spent that kind of money.  </li>
            <li>One of the lighter \\&quot;lid colors\\&quot; is an exact duplicate of my favorite shade of one of the Urban Decay palette&#x27;s shadows.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Wet-n-Wild!</li>
            <li>These colors are really good to use for everyday eye makeup.</li>
            <li>The photo of the eyeshadow here on Amazon doesn&#x27;t really do them justice; they are so much richer in person (in terms of color).  </li>
            <li>in my 40s and the thing that really sold me on this palette was that it was 1/2 matte colors and</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this particular palette!</li>
            <li>You can wear them sheer or build them to opaque, so they are super versatile for work and going out.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I agree with other reviews on how rich the pigments are for a drugstore brand.</li>
            <li>It looks so natural</li>
            <li>This palette is very pigmented which is a total</li>
            <li>Wild discontinued it.</li>
            <li>, I just noticed it&#x27;s not the exact same experience as I expected.</li>
            <li>but no shadows were broken or anything :)</li>
            <li>I am dark skin black woman and can use every color in this palette except the lightest shade other than that I am extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li>Wet N Wild eyeshadow ROCKS!</li>

            <li> i loveee this eyeshadow palette. I first bought it at rite aid but they stopped carrying these eyeshadow palettes so I couldn&#x27;t find them at any drugstores but as soon as I saw it on amazon I had to buy it!! The eyeshadows are not chalky and veryy pigmented. These colors are really good to use for everyday eye makeup.</li>
            <li> WOW!is the only word I can think of at this moment, they so rich and pigmentined that it is WILD (lol). I surprised considering the price of this palette going to buy more.</li>
            <li> Love the colors in this palette! I am partial to neutral tones and this has some great shades in it!</li>
            <li> I love the colors in this set, and it stays on. I bought a couple to have for the future!</li>
            <li> I bought this at the suggestion of a youtube guru. I can&#x27;t believe this was so expensive compared to other amazon stores. I bought this one b/c it looked exactly like what I needed and not a dupe. However, I won&#x27;t be paying $17 for it again.</li>
            <li> Wet N Wild shadows are amazing as always!! Little bit of fallout when I got it in the mail but no shadows were broken or anything :)</li>
            <li> I was so upset when Wet and Wild discontinued this but now I got stocked up and it makes me so happy:)</li>
            <li> it is the best thing that has happened to me in makeup. I learnt of this eye shadow pallete on youtube and i tried it.... it was worth every dime... highly recommend this</li>
            <li> Wet N Wild eyeshadow ROCKS! These colors are super and look great on just about everyone. I highly recommend. There is great color intensity and little powder fall off.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered super quick.....as for the product itself, I love it..... I am dark skin black woman and can use every color in this palette except the lightest shade other than that I am extremely pleased.  The dark brown is very intense and little goes a long way. Would reorder this product from this seller again :)</li>
            <li> Nice neutral palette, colors are much more pigmented than the majority of Wet and Wild palettes. Price is LOW....only $2.50 at the store YAY!! You definitely do get what you pay for though bc this palette has fair pigmentation, color that fades fairly quickly, chalky texture and inconsistent quality. Not my favorite palette but for TWO BUCKS it&#x27;s worth tossing it in my purse for touchups and not worrying too much that I&#x27;ll lose it or that it&#x27;ll break.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my sister has it and I love it. I noticed that the gold in the one i received, doesnt pop the way the gold does in the one my sister gave me. This is a discontinued item and I am wondering if the ones that are left are just losing their luster or if they are being made by a copy cat and therefore just not the same.  I use it everyday, and it does the job, I just noticed it&#x27;s not the exact same experience as I expected.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something not expensive, you must give this product a try! Stays on great!  Hard to find!</li>
            <li> Love the rich colors of this palette. I agree with other reviews on how rich the pigments are for a drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> I have been looking around for a neutral palette for work &amp; made this purchase based on the tutorials that I saw on Youtube. I am so glad that I have decided to order this palette. It looks so natural &amp; I get compliments all of the time. A great buy!</li>
            <li> I troll the beauty/makeup blogs for tips on good products, and I&#x27;m always amazed at the performance of some drugstore products I&#x27;ve overlooked.  I never even bother to look at the Wet-n-Wild stuff at the drugstore.  Somewhere along the line I got the message that they were very cheap (cost and quality), so I never gave them a second look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I JUST bought Urban Decay&#x27;s nude palette (their newest one--with matte, earthtone colors) for around $30.  Boy, I wish I&#x27;d tried this Wet-n-Wild palette that was recommended on a beauty blog before I spent that kind of money.  This palette was a fraction of the cost, and it is, in fact, comparable (I know, it&#x27;s hard to believe you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money for quality stuff).  One of the lighter \\&quot;lid colors\\&quot; is an exact duplicate of my favorite shade of one of the Urban Decay palette&#x27;s shadows.  EXACT!  These shadows are creamy and not prone to fall-out, which I know annoys the divas out there.  I&#x27;ve been wearing these shadows (3 of the colors) for the better part of a work day and I see no creasing yet (I use an eyeshadow primer)--impressive.  The photo of the eyeshadow here on Amazon doesn&#x27;t really do them justice; they are so much richer in person (in terms of color).  They sort of look washed out on my monitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my 40s and the thing that really sold me on this palette was that it was 1/2 matte colors and 1/2 shimmery colors--.  Though I&#x27;m well past my girly-glitter days, even I can pull of these shimmer colors in small amounts near the outer corners of my lower lid.  They are absolutely gorgeous.  You can wear them sheer or build them to opaque, so they are super versatile for work and going out.  I liked this palette so much (it arrived last night) that I immediately came back and bought another palette in browns/greens today.  I&#x27;m soooo done buying $20 single pots of fancy-schmancy eyeshadow.  Thanks, Wet-n-Wild!</li>
            <li> This palette is very pigmented which is a total plus! I usually only buy MAC shadows but this palette is up there with MAC when it comes to pigmentation! I use this palette for my work look and i&#x27;m always getting compliments! I would highly recommend this particular palette!</li>
            <li> This is a great palette that works for any skin tone. It&#x27;s a shame that Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild discontinued it.</li>
            <li> Always loved this palette. Unfortunately I cannot find them in my local cvs and walgreens anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this palette and will order again.</li>
