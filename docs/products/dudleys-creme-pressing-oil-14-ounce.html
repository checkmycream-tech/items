            <li>Smells great light and does wonders for my hair.  </li>
            <li>this by far is the best</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light oil that keeps your press for weeks.</li>
            <li>Although it costs a lot online, it costs even more at the beauty salon.</li>

            <li>People will think you relax your hair after a press with Dudley&#x27;s because it&#x27;s just that light and nongreasy!</li>

            <li>I gave this item a 5 star rating before I used the product, I&#x27;ve used this creme press for 19 years and I absolutely love it for my daughter and</li>
            <li>This pressing cream didn&#x27;t really do my hair much good.</li>
            <li>but Dudley&#x27;s works just fine.</li>
            <li>Great for straightening coarse hair.</li>
            <li>Light not chemically in smell or weight</li>
            <li>I bought the larger size and I am happy I did.</li>
            <li>, it makes my hair feel silky and well moisturised; after the press it looks like I had a relaxer; I have never had such great results.</li>
            <li>I actually purchased this item by mistake, but it was a great find.</li>
            <li>It absolutely transforms the condition of your hair and leaves it healthy and fabulous!</li>
            <li>okay product over priced though it&#x27;s better products out there that don&#x27;t cost as much</li>
            <li>I was so excited about finding and ordering this product.</li>
            <li>So if you want your do lookin right, GET IT!</li>
            <li>The product is great, the price is ridiculous, it would be nice</li>
            <li>It is so good that I had to search the net to find some!</li>
            <li>More oil than wax, but I love it for the overall ingredients and how it softens the hair when applied immediately after shampoing the hair.</li>
            <li>This oils leaves my hair light and smooth not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it makes my hair so soft.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who knows anything about African American hair care knows how great Dudley products are.</li>
            <li>will buy more something  I&#x27;ve been using for a few years now looking forward into buying more soon thank you</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s no problem putting on more for later touch ups.  </li>
            <li>It will last a long time and makes your hair look great.</li>
            <li>I am definitely going to stock up on more.</li>
            <li>Naturals if you want to go straight once in a while!</li>
            <li>After using Dudleys Creme Press for the very first time my hair is super straight from roots to ends, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li>This jar has lasted me a very long time and while it works well, I will see if there is a better product</li>
            <li>If you want a press that is light and non-greasy, then you definitely need to buy this product.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>This was The very thing I needed.</li>
            <li>This product is very liight  not oily or greasy.</li>
            <li>Thanks Dudley&#x27;s an Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and the scent is great.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I have a brand new healthy  head of hair; thanks to this pressing creme I won&#x27;t have to use harsh chemicals anymore.</li>
            <li>It kept my hair straight for close to a week(which is a major feat).</li>
            <li>My hairdresser uses Dudley&#x27;s and I like the way my hair feels afterwards - not heavy.  </li>
            <li>Our daughter is natural.  </li>
            <li>give a natural yet &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; press.  </li>
            <li>And my hair soft and non greasy for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives the hair a silky and soft feel.</li>
            <li>But this product really does protect your hair from heat damage and keeps it moist from daily abuse.  </li>
            <li>Also, the oil is not heavy and my hair has body.  </li>
            <li>I live in the area where this product is made, and there is never any around because it is in such high demand.</li>
            <li>It is also light enough for my flat iron and doesn&#x27;t wear my hair down.</li>
            <li>Hair and scalp is never dry.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like products that weight down my hair; now, although this product isn&#x27;t as heavy as grease, it certainly is a weight on my typically feathery and light hair.</li>

            <li> I press her hair or flat iron her hair on occasion.  </li>
            <li> Product does not last long on your hair and it gives your flakes.</li>
            <li> After wearing my hair with a relaxer for so long I decided it was time to give it a break from the chemicals.</li>
            <li> Would purchase again and again as long as the ingredients don&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> My stylist ran out of the oil and a representative had not been by in a long time.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets extremely dry and it helps to add moisture and keeps it from tangling.</li>
            <li> All of my new growth is no longer thick and wavy.</li>
            <li> Given the price plus the fact that a little goes a long way, I know I will have this container for a LONG time.    </li>
            <li> and I see I will have a long time because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Try to find this product in my local area was not able to find it.  </li>
            <li> I. It only takes a very small amount for shine, body and it helps to lock in curls.</li>
            <li> I also have been relaxing my hair less</li>
            <li> No doubt this though claimed to no longer be sold is the number one product being used for black hair care for hair pressing.  </li>
            <li> It is a little oily  </li>
            <li> A little too heavy for finer hair though.  </li>
            <li> I have very Very VERY thick hair and still a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It did seem a bit pricey but the result is just unbelievable</li>
            <li> it was at least $10.00 cheaper so that everyone can afford it.</li>
            <li> They also know how hard they are to find!</li>
            <li> I hate the smell and wish they would do something about that.  </li>

            <li> This product was just as I remembered in in the sixties. After wearing my hair with a relaxer for so long I decided it was time to give it a break from the chemicals. This oils leaves my hair light and smooth not heavy at all. I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought the larger size and I am happy I did. I have bought a lot of pressing oils and this by far is the best and I see I will have a long time because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> More oil than wax, but I love it for the overall ingredients and how it softens the hair when applied immediately after shampoing the hair. Would purchase again and again as long as the ingredients don&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and decided to give this product a try. It did seem a bit pricey but the result is just unbelievable, it makes my hair feel silky and well moisturised; after the press it looks like I had a relaxer; I have never had such great results. A little does go a long way. I am definitely going to stock up on more.</li>
            <li> This pressing cream didn&#x27;t really do my hair much good. But everyone&#x27;s hair is different.</li>
            <li> does what it suppose to do</li>
            <li> Anyone who knows anything about African American hair care knows how great Dudley products are. They also know how hard they are to find! I was so excited about finding and ordering this product. This is an awsome find, it&#x27;s a lightweight pressing creme that can be used to press as well as heat protection for relaxed hair. People will think you relax your hair after a press with Dudley&#x27;s because it&#x27;s just that light and nongreasy! A little goes a long way and the scent is great.</li>
            <li> I will be buying it again</li>
            <li> I love this product for pressing my hair.  It makes it look fantaboulous and it feels great, really great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
            <li> Product does not last long on your hair and it gives your flakes.</li>
            <li> This product is very liight  not oily or greasy. It gives the hair a silky and soft feel.</li>
            <li> Good product for curling hair. A little too heavy for finer hair though.  My mom swears by it. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t applied a hair relaxer on my hair in ten weeks. All of my new growth is no longer thick and wavy. After using Dudleys Creme Press for the very first time my hair is super straight from roots to ends, soft, and shiny. I have a brand new healthy  head of hair; thanks to this pressing creme I won&#x27;t have to use harsh chemicals anymore.</li>
            <li> No doubt this though claimed to no longer be sold is the number one product being used for black hair care for hair pressing.

            <li> will buy more something  I&#x27;ve been using for a few years now looking forward into buying more soon thank you</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a timely fashion, packaging was appropriate and the quality was great! I do recommend buying from this company.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist pressed my hair with this pressing oil.  My hair was silky and beautiful as if I had a Perm.  Also, the oil is not heavy and my hair has body.  My stylist ran out of the oil and a representative had not been by in a long time.  I like the way the oil makes my hair look and feel that I ordered the oil and gave it to my stylist so she could continue pressing my hair with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Dudley&#x27;s since 2005. It is amazing! Naturals if you want to go straight once in a while! Dudley&#x27;s creme press,lite non- greasy and a great scent. Thanks Dudley&#x27;s an Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> The product is great, the price is ridiculous, it would be nice it was at least $10.00 cheaper so that everyone can afford it. But yes, I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like products that weight down my hair; now, although this product isn&#x27;t as heavy as grease, it certainly is a weight on my typically feathery and light hair. I used this product once, and I will not be using it again. I will probably sell it.</li>
            <li> I gave this item a 5 star rating before I used the product, I&#x27;ve used this creme press for 19 years and I absolutely love it for my daughter and I. It only takes a very small amount for shine, body and it helps to lock in curls. I have very Very VERY thick hair and still a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s The Best! Once You Use it , You Don&#x27;t Want Anything  Else. There Are NO COMPARISONS. ...BELIEVE IT!!!!!!!.</li>
            <li> okay product over priced though it&#x27;s better products out there that don&#x27;t cost as much</li>
            <li> Anything Dudley is wonderful</li>
            <li> Works well! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!!  I used to buy it in beauty supply shops and Walmart.  But noone sells it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;It is a very good product and I wonder why the vendor is not producing and distributing more!</li>
