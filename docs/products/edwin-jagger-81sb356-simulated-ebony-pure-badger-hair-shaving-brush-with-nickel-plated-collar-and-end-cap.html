            <li>Best shaving brush I&#x27;ve used, bar none</li>
            <li>Still a beautiful brush.</li>
            <li>Quality of manufacture is great.</li>
            <li>Great product to add to my man&#x27;s shaving collection.  </li>
            <li>Love EJ brushes because of their Great Quality!</li>
            <li>The built quality is great and the handle has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li>Nice product, good quality.</li>
            <li>Materials are top notch, the bristles are just right and always smell good, keep up the great work Edwin Jagger !!!</li>
            <li>Good brush for shaving, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Holds the perfect amount of water without completely saturating your lather, and loads soap or cream well for application.</li>
            <li>Well made, easy to maneuver, the Pure Badger bristles make for an excellent lather.  </li>
            <li>Edwin Jagger is a fine brand!</li>
            <li>Quite satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>It has a longer handle than most EJ Brushes.</li>
            <li>I was on the hunt for a replacement of my old Colonel Conk Super badger (UK made!)&lt;br /&gt;Tried an eShave best badger and it ended on the trash can.</li>
            <li>Three months after use, this is hands down the best shave brush I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>Very soft applies shaving cream in as a good quality brush should.  </li>
            <li>This is a well made badger hair brush that simply looks great with the ebony look and chrome accents.</li>
            <li>High quality brush with nice feel and finish.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands, and have an EJ Best Badger as well, and this is definitely the best brush I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Not as full as some brushes but does the job fine as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>A very high quality shaving brush, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Edwin Jagger is my first big name brand for shaving and I am going to stick with them for most, if not all, of my shaving needs.</li>
            <li>I just like my fat brushes better, and this brush has extremely long bristles.</li>
            <li>Paired it with a new stand too!</li>
            <li>If you break in the brush properly (techniques for proper break in found on many shaving forums)</li>
            <li>This brush did not have any strong animal hair odor when wet as some inferior brushes do.</li>
            <li>Dries off easily to keep the bristle head lasting for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Really soft brush!</li>
            <li>So far I like this brush!</li>
            <li>This is definitely the nicest Pure Badger brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, and keeps getting softer with use.</li>
            <li>I do admit, the first two uses it had a very strange odor to it.  </li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s a little pricier than some, this brush is worth it for the quality and durability.</li>

            <li> I have been using this for about a month now and no hair has fallen out yet.  I do admit, the first two uses it had a very strange odor to it.  After using it and softening it up, it now has the smell of my shaving cream.  Very soft applies shaving cream in as a good quality brush should.  Edwin Jagger is my first big name brand for shaving and I am going to stick with them for most, if not all, of my shaving needs.</li>
            <li> Not enough backbone for my taste. Still a beautiful brush.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the nicest Pure Badger brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. Virtually no shedding after soaking it to break it in. It&#x27;s soft, and keeps getting softer with use. Definitely worth every penny. Holds the perfect amount of water without completely saturating your lather, and loads soap or cream well for application. I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands, and have an EJ Best Badger as well, and this is definitely the best brush I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Three months after use, this is hands down the best shave brush I&#x27;ve ever had.  Noticeable difference in quality and workmanship. Materials are top notch, the bristles are just right and always smell good, keep up the great work Edwin Jagger !!!</li>
            <li> The built quality is great and the handle has a nice weight to it. Quite satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I was on the hunt for a replacement of my old Colonel Conk Super badger (UK made!)&lt;br /&gt;Tried an eShave best badger and it ended on the trash can. Give a try a Vulfix badger and it didn&#x27;t fulfill my expectations as well.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one! Feels and looks like a brush double the price!&lt;br /&gt;J</li>
            <li> This is a well made badger hair brush that simply looks great with the ebony look and chrome accents. If you break in the brush properly (techniques for proper break in found on many shaving forums) you will find very little hair breakage or shedding. Should last you a very long time with proper use and care. This brush did not have any strong animal hair odor when wet as some inferior brushes do.</li>
            <li> Nice product, good quality.</li>
            <li> A very high quality shaving brush, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Really soft brush! This is a  brush that I purchased for my wife. She loves it. It has a longer handle than most EJ Brushes. Love EJ brushes because of their Great Quality!</li>
            <li> Best shaving brush I&#x27;ve used, bar none</li>
            <li> Good brush for shaving, but not my favorite. Quality of manufacture is great. I just like my fat brushes better, and this brush has extremely long bristles.</li>

            <li> Edwin Jagger is a fine brand! Great product to add to my man&#x27;s shaving collection.  Paired it with a new stand too!</li>
            <li> I am a fan of the Edwin Jagger brand and this shaving brush does not disappoint. Well made, easy to maneuver, the Pure Badger bristles make for an excellent lather.  Cannot recommend enough.</li>
            <li> I have had this several months now and have no complaints. My biggest gripe when buying brushes is durability. So far I have seen very little loss of bristles with this. Not as full as some brushes but does the job fine as far as I am concerned.</li>
