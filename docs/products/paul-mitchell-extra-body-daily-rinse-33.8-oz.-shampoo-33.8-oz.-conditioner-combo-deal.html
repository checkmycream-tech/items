            <li> Sold as a bundle, but I was shipped an extra body shampoo and original conditioner. Seller needs to work on their personal skills. I sent an email with multiple questions about the listing and if I just read it wrong, wondering if it was honestly my fault so I knew to look closer in the future. I received an email back that just simply stated &amp;#34;we have issued a full refund&amp;#34;. That was all. No explanation, no apology, ownership, anything.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great prices! Large amount of Paul Mitchell Extra Body Daily Rinse and Conditioner for so much cheaper than I have found in any store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while, I love it. I ran out so I bought something else from the salon that&#x27;s suppose to do the same thing, but it didn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> On time delivery, great price. Just wish the pumps came with them. But all is great, I will transfer to smaller bottles.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this from here and absolutely hates it. It tangles her hair like crazy and makes it fall out. She&#x27;s used *salon-bought* Paul Mitchell in the past and was always happy with it.</li>
            <li> LIds were open and leaking out .</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner that I can use every day that won&#x27;t weigh my hair down. It moisturizes well and makes it feel soft. The price is a bargain! I also use Paul Mitchell Thicken Up to add extra volume while blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  You don&#x27;t need a lot and it rinses out very well.  Also the conditioner is very rich and does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the worst shampoo and conditioner combo I have EVER used. It leaves hair heavy and oily looking. I have blonde fine hair, but a lot of it. It is left lacking shine, looking greasy, and sticking together in a weird way. It it without a doubt awful. I have used Pureology (which is great just expensive and I don&#x27;t like the lack of suds with the shampoo), and also like Bed head Volume (smells good and is what I will be going be to). Save yourself the money. This stuff is horrid.</li>
            <li> horrible made my hair feel like straw and made my hair fall out. had a horrible time getting the knots out of my baby fine hair. would never purchase again</li>
            <li> I have used the shampoo and conditioner for years.  It gives my hair just the right amount of body and the fragrance is mild. The 33.8 oz bottles lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> It says on the back of the bottle that unless sold by a hair professional product may be tampered with. I think it&#x27;s a rip off. Doesn&#x27;t work the same as when I bought from a salon. Wanting my money back.</li>
            <li> A+ and got it on time</li>
            <li> Myself and my girls love these products&lt;br /&gt;they are great and amazon sells at a great price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> Made my hair thick and feel like it had glue in it. Very disappointed. I would not but again ever</li>
            <li> Great for adding volume to your hair. Every 4 days or so I wash with regular shampoo, though because it leave a residue after multiple uses.</li>
            <li> This is the best price for these products and I was absolutely loving them till I noticed my fine, thin, very long hair just wasn&#x27;t as silky soft anymore.  So, I alternate with them now instead of using them every day.</li>
            <li> Works well as shampoo and conditioner.  Not as impressed with its volumizing abilities.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this product gives my hair body and shine.  Besides, I like the the way it smells.  I would recommend it to anyone with babyfine hair.</li>
