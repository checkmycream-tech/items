            <li>I&#x27;m sure she will love it!!!</li>
            <li>I was told once that when someone tells you how good something smells on you, that is your brand.  </li>
            <li>Good Product.</li>
            <li>A good price</li>
            <li>I love this cologne on my wife and the price is great.</li>
            <li>Everyone always remarks how much they like \\&quot;how wonderful</li>
            <li>she liked the smell...</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent; it is fresh and perfect for day and evening.  </li>
            <li>A gift for my wife she liked and love it..</li>
            <li>The price is good, the shipping is quick and the package always arrives intact.</li>
            <li>OK, maybe not-so-original, but the not-so-new formulation by P&amp;G Prestige Beaute.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>this is my all time favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>Moms favorite and better price than department stores.</li>
            <li>Much better than this Giorgio.  </li>
            <li>She used to love Giorgio.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea that this is so affordable.</li>
            <li>And the fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li>I love my wife.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Giorgio for more than 30 years</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume.....</li>
            <li>Love this scent.</li>
            <li>, I am sure you will not regret owning it.</li>
            <li>It is very clean and refreshing</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;the original again.</li>
            <li>However, I do remember the intensity &amp; sillage of the original, &amp; the&lt;br /&gt;P&amp;G version is a whimper in comparison.</li>
            <li>The bottle comes full.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I paid so little for a great Eau De Toilette</li>
            <li>have worn this perfume for 30 plus years, and bought because of a coupon and price was right.  </li>
            <li>It is the one I use most of the time, and have received many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;And, last but not least, Amazon sells it for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I find that it is not lasting more than an hour.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Packaged very well &amp; exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this fragrance for as long as I can remember...:).  </li>
            <li>Long time favorite for my wife.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this for my wife back in the 80s.  </li>
            <li>already own Giorgio Red and Giorgio Blue, and I wear both frequently.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this older brand to anyone.  </li>
            <li>While the purchase process and shipping process went smoothly the quality of the perfume is not what I expected.</li>
            <li>Are they really the real scents or simply knock-offs?</li>
            <li>I get compliments on my perfume nearly every time I wear it!</li>
            <li>This product is only available locally in a 1.7 ounce bottle and that size here costs as much as the larger size that I bought online.  </li>
            <li>This is not the Giorgio of old.  </li>
            <li>She has gone back to others that performs very well.  </li>
            <li>so that when she wears it now, it brings back fond memories of our early years together.</li>
            <li>The last time we purchased it, the scent was rather weak and did not last for more then a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s pretty heavy on the white florals, but she&#x27;s not&lt;br /&gt;girlie-girlie.</li>

            <li> I love this cologne on my wife and the price is great.</li>
            <li> OMG, I can not believe I am about to say this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giorgio is wonderful &amp; so much better than I remember her. She&#x27;s pretty heavy on the white florals, but she&#x27;s not&lt;br /&gt;girlie-girlie. She&#x27;s a spry, yet refined, California woman with a backbone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already own Giorgio Red and Giorgio Blue, and I wear both frequently. I&#x27;m not sure why it took me so long to test&lt;br /&gt;the original again. OK, maybe not-so-original, but the not-so-new formulation by P&amp;G Prestige Beaute. (Now the&lt;br /&gt;GBH brand is owned by Elizabeth Arden.) However, I do remember the intensity &amp; sillage of the original, &amp; the&lt;br /&gt;P&amp;G version is a whimper in comparison.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance.  It develops a scent according to the person.  Everyone always remarks how much they like \\&quot;how wonderful I smell\\&quot;.  I even get hugs so it will rub off.</li>
            <li> Packaged very well &amp; exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> this is my all time favorite fragrance. every time I wear it I get compliments &amp;#62; Men &amp; Women alike!! I dont wear any other scent&amp;#62; why Bother.  Thank you for making it affordable to me!!!</li>
            <li> A gift for my wife she liked and love it.. Allot complements</li>
            <li> One of the perfumes came out broken, I haven&#x27;t even open it, it has the plastic wraping and everything it came with, but there&#x27;s perfume comming out of the plastic, enough that it damaged the wood cabinet where I put it!!!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this brand for years and it is the only one I wear.  I was told once that when someone tells you how good something smells on you, that is your brand.  Over the years, I have had hundreds tell me this is the one.  I have never been disappointed in this product.  I like buying it from Amazon because of the price and the speed in which I receive it.  I will continue using Amazon to purchase it and the product as long as they produce it.</li>
            <li> Moms favorite and better price than department stores.</li>
            <li> Bought this Giorgio for my wife.  She has been using Giorgio for years.  The last time we purchased it, the scent was rather weak and did not last for more then a couple of hours.  We thought that we would try it again.  Same thing.  This is not the Giorgio of old.  My wife asked me to not purchase this perfume again.  She has gone back to others that performs very well.  Much better than this Giorgio.  I would not recommend this &amp;#34;weak scented water&amp;#34; to anyone.  Although we learned a lesson, my wife is disappointed.  She used to love Giorgio.</li>
            <li> The fragrances I purchased smell like the originals , but they do not seem to last when applied to body.  Are they really the real scents or simply knock-offs?</li>
            <li> have worn this perfume for 30 plus years, and bought because of a coupon and price was right.  Will look again for a bargain.</li>
            <li> it was a gift for my mom....she liked the smell...</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  It is the one I use most of the time, and have received many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;And, last but not least, Amazon sells it for a reasonable price.</li>

            <li> Excellent and at a fair price</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised.Good Product.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my wife back in the 80s.  It has been a mainstay fragrance with her so that when she wears it now, it brings back fond memories of our early years together.</li>
            <li> This product is only available locally in a 1.7 ounce bottle and that size here costs as much as the larger size that I bought online.  Happy with the product and didn&#x27;t have to leave the house to make the purchase.</li>

            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for as long as I can remember...:).  I love the idea that this is so affordable.</li>
            <li> This was a great price. The bottle comes full. And the fragrance is lovely. The only fault was that the box was tore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Giorgio.  My wife loves it.  I love my wife.  I buy Giorgio for my wife so she doesn&#x27;t run out of Giorgio.  My wife is happy.  I&#x27;m happy.  And Giorgio has a very nice fragrance.  Did I mention that my wife is happy?!  And Giorgio smells real nice!  It&#x27;s just happy all around!</li>

            <li> The fragrance is not the same as when purchased in a department store.  I&#x27;ve used this before.  I find that it is not lasting more than an hour.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent; it is fresh and perfect for day and evening.  The product was exactly as described.  I would order again.</li>
            <li> this was a gift so ask her if she likes it or not.  she was happy to receive it and I like the very pleasant scents</li>

            <li> Love this scent. Would highly recommend this older brand to anyone.  It is very clean and refreshing, I am sure you will not regret owning it.</li>
