            <li>Thank you so much, Burts Bees!!!!!</li>
            <li>very cheap and good product</li>
            <li>Minty and amazing.</li>
            <li>The peppermint extract smells great and the fact that it&#x27;s wax means you can enjoy any sort of beverage without washing it away.  </li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Reading the lablel, it&#x27;s good to be able to identify every additional ingredient, as well.</li>
            <li>Great value for the money, simply the best quality ever</li>
            <li>This holds its shape well and has never melted into a mass even when I leave in a warm vehicle.</li>
            <li>Feel&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>so good :)</li>
            <li>Four pack nice</li>
            <li>This 4 pk. was a way better deal cost wise.....</li>
            <li>Flavor/scent is nice however.</li>
            <li>Arrived as advertised and nice to have backups</li>
            <li>Nice peppermint flavor.  </li>
            <li>This is nice and minty.  </li>
            <li>The minty tingle is nice.</li>
            <li>This is da kind.</li>
            <li>and I guess I really didn&#x27;t need it because the chapstick made me very happy</li>
            <li>I have a tube in every jacket and every bag I own.</li>
            <li>Bees lip balm is all-natural, and gives a nice tingly sensation from the peppermint oil.  </li>
            <li>lip balm itself has a nice cooling sensation, and doesn&#x27;t feel overly greasy when you put it on.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the best.</li>
            <li>Nice sting to it, which makes me feel like I have plumper lips, which I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>smell good and very cute, easy to take with.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product and better price buying online!!</li>
            <li>The original is great in my book.</li>
            <li>It always feels great going on and leaves my lips moist and fresh feeling!</li>
            <li>This lip balm is great, and I am always looking for deals, so when I saw a 4-pack of Burt&#x27;s Bees Original Lip Balm for $8.99, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.  </li>
            <li>Great price and quick shipping</li>
            <li>I always believed that bees were superior beings but to create such a wonderful product for my luscious lips went beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li>This balm is lightly and pleasantly scented.</li>
            <li>My new favorite!!!</li>
            <li>Best on the market by far</li>
            <li>my favorite of all time and nice to get bulk and discount</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing chapstick ever made.</li>
            <li>So far this lip balm is the best I have tried.</li>
            <li>Moist, listing, suitable for men</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice feel and smell to it without being waxy at all, thus making it OK for men to use too without looking fruity.</li>
            <li>This offers the best results of any lip lube I have every tried.</li>
            <li>It has a nice crisp pepperminty scent and it does a great job of keeping lips moisturized without that &amp;#34;lip gloss&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>cool sensation from the peppermint oil is refreshing and just feels great on your lips.</li>
            <li>I love all their products they feel good and smell fantastic.</li>
            <li>Now you can pick up a tube of heaven at many retailers, but amazon subscribe and save is by far the best price.</li>
            <li>This stuff feels a lot better and is more effective at doing its job.</li>
            <li>good price, good quality, fast speed, i would like to buy it again.</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase on Amazon, which turned out to be a great deal for a 4-pack.</li>
            <li>Burts Bees consistently shells out great products.  </li>
            <li>cheap but moisturizing, not so oily, very satisfied.</li>
            <li>it is used very comfortable</li>
            <li>BB keeps my lips smooth and healthy!</li>
            <li>Very smooth and the peppermint in refreshing.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful for dry chapped lips and it has a nice refreshing and cooling feel on the lips.  </li>
            <li>What can I say, I love Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lip balm-</li>
            <li>Definitely better than petroleum products, but I don&#x27;t like that it has peppermint.    </li>

            <li>Definitely one of the best on the market.</li>
            <li>This is my all-time favorite lip balm/chapstick.</li>
            <li>One tube lasts me for many months, but I had to buy multi pack because my daughters always take mine... :)  </li>

            <li>It works fine, but I since I&#x27;m out in the sun a lot, I wish they&#x27;d give a UV rating for it.  </li>

            <li>I have SUPER sensitive skin, and this balm works great, and without irritation.</li>
            <li>After trying many different brands, Burt&#x27;s Bees is the most effective and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm (original) is, hands down, the best lip balm that I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li>Awesome product, always thought it was a little pricy</li>
            <li>; types are garbage and do little to help lips in need, but THIS is the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees and decided the 4 pack would solve my problems of moving one from my vehicle to purse to wherever.</li>
            <li>I tried this a few years ago and was not that all impressed.</li>
            <li>It goes on SMOOTH, it&#x27;s not shiny (husband doesn&#x27;t want shiny lips. . .</li>
            <li>Bee&#x27;s wax is one of the most highly effective, moisture-locking, ingredients (natural or chemical) available.</li>
            <li>The fact that bee&#x27;s wax is the primary protectant in Burt&#x27;s is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The peppermint creates a light tingling feeling.</li>
            <li>They also work to keep my lips smooth.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic and minty.</li>
            <li>The texture is smooth and light but it stays on your lips for an extended amount of time.</li>
            <li>This stuff works and feels so great; it&#x27;s addictive!  </li>
            <li>Comfortable, mint taste.</li>
            <li>Keeps my lips smooth.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that it feels light on my lips; I like to feel it</li>
            <li>Feels great on my lips, would definitely buy it again</li>
            <li>the price for this pack is so cheap compared to the store as well.</li>
            <li>the chaps vanished, they are great use them all the time definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Fix my lips really gentle and nice.</li>
            <li>I use quite a few of Burt&#x27;s Bees products and am very happy with all of them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very dry in suzhou,China,after applying my lips feel so good!</li>
            <li>Very economical multi-pack.</li>
            <li>Seriously, if anyone needs convincing that Burt&#x27;s Bees is the best lip balm ever, just try it for yourself!</li>
            <li>I love it very much.</li>
            <li>i love it very much.</li>
            <li>I love the slight tingle, the minty smell/taste, and it leaves my lips feeling great.</li>
            <li>I love this lip balm so much!</li>
            <li>I have found Burt&#x27;s Bees to be the best working lip balm and have been a fan the past couple of years.</li>
            <li>Mint makes me feel cool and comfortable</li>
            <li>I love it ,and the price is really reasonable!</li>
            <li>Excellent lip balm and will definitely buy more next time.</li>
            <li>It lasts an hour or so once applied, but the four-pack I ordered will last me a year or more!  :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s due to the natural ingredient nature of the product, but it would make for a perfect lip balm if added.</li>
            <li>Honestly cannot live without them.</li>
            <li>However, I gifted this to a young man and it is his favorite.  </li>
            <li>Burt’s bees lip balm is special because its special formula creates a tingling sensation when you apply it to your lips.</li>
            <li>and the price is just right!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very effective at preventing my lips from being dry without having a flavor or smell.</li>
            <li>Just  a quick note to point out that this is NOT the original formula.</li>
            <li>Very pleased &amp; thanks so much for the prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>the peppermint one makes me feel as if I just sprayed my mouth nice cool feeling so far</li>
            <li>This stick  make my lips not only moist,but bright and glossy.&lt;br /&gt;Previously</li>
            <li>Bought to offer so have no idea of quality I believe good as ordered from relative</li>
            <li>Something about beeswax just feels better on my lips, plus the addition of lanolin really helps too.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite lip balm on the face of the earth.</li>
            <li>These are highly recommended! :)</li>
            <li>the price is low and the effect is good.</li>
            <li>This product has a cool, menthol feel when applied.</li>
            <li>or if it does become full grown, it helps it heal faster.</li>
            <li>I really like these but gave it three stars instead of four because I have found that home-made lip balm with shea butter &amp; coconut oil works better for me.</li>
            <li>Really good, looking forward to the next buy</li>
            <li>So having the package of four is nice, as I can leave them throughout the house and still have one near when I need it.  </li>
            <li>Good price, especially when it drops below 2.50/tube</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite lipbalm and it is well priced on this site.</li>
            <li>It has a cool tingly feeling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to know that it is all natural too.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this lip balm - recommended by one of my daughters, I tried it and immediately noticed a difference in how my lips felt.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d think you&#x27;re getting this sweet honey-like lip balm</li>
            <li>I will never buy any other lip balm it is one of the best things I have discovered in my life highly recommend .</li>
            <li>At first i thought it was too strong</li>
            <li>A little cool and refreshing, the effect is good,</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I was a loyal customer of Burts Bees products....</li>
            <li>but that goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>quickly</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm and you can&#x27;t beat this price of buying 4 at a time instead of individual ones at more than $3 a pop.</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm and you can&#x27;t beat this price of buying 4 at a time instead of individual ones at more than $3 a pop.</li>
            <li>Love the simple, pure and effective ingredients that go into this balm.</li>
            <li>Love the simple, pure and effective ingredients that go into this balm.  </li>
            <li>I was sold on this lip balm the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Good balance between how it feels and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>it goes on smoothly, feels great and seems to stay for much longer than other brands.</li>
            <li>I love my Burt&#x27;s Bee lip balm; handy to have extras; as I am always searching for where I might have laid one of these down around the house.</li>
            <li>Same as always just more!</li>
            <li>This product never fails to please me!</li>
            <li>I have the whole family hooked on these gems!!</li>
            <li>Also if you apply to a newly formed fever blister it will keep it from becoming full blown(at</li>
            <li>more I use it, the more dry my lips get.  </li>
            <li>Great product, I never knew how much better Lip Balm could be as I usually order products when I see them go on sale (specifically the Nivea line) and these just feel so much better and last quite a while too.</li>
            <li>Alsmost ready to reorder these fine Lip balms - the price is also right.</li>
            <li>Overall, this lip balm is amazing</li>
            <li>But the results on your lips with regular use are amazing.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and really makes your lips moist.</li>
            <li>The only kind of lip balm I will use.  </li>
            <li>They are incredible lip balm - a layer of protection that wears well and doesn&#x27;t need reapplying after 15 minutes or feel addictive as some do with the need to constantly reapply.  </li>
            <li>I love this natural lip balm--I keep them in my car, wallet, bathrooms, and nightstand</li>
            <li>The beeswax gives your lips a protective coating for outdoor winter fun and moisturizes in the drier air.</li>
            <li>By the way, I love these lip balms, keeps my lips really soft all throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a refreshing minty flavor and keeps lips soft.</li>
            <li>So take that for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>As far as lip balm goes, this is just okay.</li>
            <li>Smells great, feels good on your lips, not overly slick or overly sticky, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>So worth it.  </li>
            <li>More like I can&#x27;t because my lips won&#x27;t become as soft as with these Burt bees.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it keeps my lips from getting chapped and is all natural.</li>
            <li>This 4 pack is really great and offers savings over buying individual sticks.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite chap stick, always keeps my lips soft and moist.</li>
            <li>has a fresh minty feel.</li>
            <li>This Lip Balm is the most natural one I have been used than ever before,and it tastes nice,above</li>
            <li>This lip balm is great for keeping my lips moist, and (unlike most other similar products) doesn&#x27;t create dependency.</li>
            <li>I only use burts bees, original, all year round, it is the best lip balm for me</li>
            <li>I tried many of the brands out there as I need to keep something on my lips most of the time due to allergies.</li>
            <li>the other chap lips stuff, plus this has many more uses, so I like they came in a four pack, so I can keep them a couple in my bug out bag, and keep one in my EDC,</li>
            <li>I am sure I will like this flavor just fine (albeit for a long time).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, such a good deal on amazon.</li>
            <li>that I found the deal right before Christmas to use as stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li>AND IN THE RIGHT HAND POCKET OF THOSE JEANS IS ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS</li>
            <li>The kind I bought is flavored with wintergreen, which is okay, but not a favorite of mine.  </li>
            <li>first it felt odd, it was too light, too dry, please, don&#x27;t be deceived, it is the best moisturizing lip balm I&#x27;ve EVER used.  </li>
            <li>Great that it is a little cheaper in a multipack!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s before and Nivea and Carmex, ALL of thsese are better by far than the most recent Burt&#x27;s Bees I received.</li>
            <li>this is my first time that I buy something in Amazon.com, the lip balm is useful</li>
            <li>I recently learned that most chap sticks use salicylic acid to make the lips peel, causing you to use chap stick more frequently.</li>
            <li>These are usually sold for $3-$4 a tube in stores, so this 4 pack for $9 is a great deal.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes well and has a nice peppermint scent that stays long after application.  </li>
            <li>Lipstick is very cool, not moisturizing effect a general, the first purchase understand S &amp; S. Will not buy again!</li>
            <li>I like a lip balm that is a little more greasy and creamy, that feels more substantial on my lips.  </li>
            <li>Bought assorted flavors as previous usage experience was good.</li>
            <li>Much better than Chap Stick and Carmax as it is not overly waxy and does not dry out your lips.</li>
            <li>This lip balm typically retails for $2.99/tube, so this was a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The company uses quality, natural ingredients and has a good corporate philosophy (yes, I know they are now owned by Clorox</li>
            <li>This may be the one thing I honestly could not live without.</li>
            <li>I actually did not associate the problem with Burt&#x27;s Bees right away and applied more.</li>
            <li>Essential for anyone who hikes or walks more than an hour a day -- a pack of four lasts me about eight months -- and this set is a great bargain compared to the onesies next to the impulse register at my local hardware</li>
            <li>This is very gentle and soothes my lips immediately.</li>
            <li>ever!&lt;br /&gt;It is not excessively greasy when applying and stays on your lips.&lt;br /&gt;Works to sooth with a light tingling sensation when first applied.</li>
            <li>Shavitz had a honey business which provided the excess beeswax needed for the candles and Quimby&#x27;s focus on maintaining high quality helped to grow their business from an initial $200 at the Dover-Foxcroft Junior High School craft fair to $20,000 by the end of their first year.</li>
            <li>Not only does beeswax provide a home for larvae, but it goes on smooth right out of the tube!</li>
            <li>A necessary staple for many years.</li>
            <li>Their first headquarters was an abandoned one-room schoolhouse rented from a friend for $150 a year.[13]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this was the first product that solved the issue once and for all.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm, so we buy it occasionally to make sure she doesn&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>I was using the traditional lip balm from the supermarket, which contains alcohol and from what I read it just dries the lips out more and requires application after application with no end in sight.  </li>
            <li>I am very dissapointed and will never buy it again!</li>
            <li>I used to buy them in singles for $3 or more each in any regular store.</li>
            <li>I finally thought to look them up on Amazon and there they are! : )</li>
            <li>This was a shock at first.  </li>
            <li>product does exactly what you&#x27;d expect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>IN THE SUMMER WHEN IT IS SO HOT</li>
            <li>A FUNNY PAIR</li>
            <li>Has that nice minty tingle, I also like the minimal ingredients.</li>
            <li>I like the scent and the feeling of knowing that I&#x27;m putting something natural and not chemical filled on my lips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this chapstick for a decade now, since a college classmate from North Carolina told me he swore by this stuff and literally would have his mom send him more in the mail when he ran out as it wasn&#x27;t sold locally at that time.  </li>
            <li>Will likely always be my favorite.</li>
            <li>Not only for lips, but also on cuts and scrapes, and nothing better for split lip.  </li>
            <li>And the price was better than I can buy them for locally</li>
            <li>It actually makes my lips feel better without drying them out when I stop using it.</li>
            <li>I love the flavor but that doesn&#x27;t make up for me constantly putting the stuff on my lips.</li>
            <li>I think it works about ten mins until I need more.</li>
            <li>I am an avid chapstick consumer...</li>
            <li>I was interested in Burt&#x27;s Bees after seeing a show on how I made my millions</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is way much cheaper than in stores!</li>
            <li>But once I first tried Burt&#x27;s Bees, I knew I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li>The slightly tacky wax with peppermint oil feels refreshing, clean, and does not shine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;****update****&lt;br /&gt;To be clear there was no ingredient list at the time of purchase in 2013 and the product received had a much longer ingredient list than the original beeswax formulation.</li>
            <li>Runs out pretty fast though.</li>
            <li>Good lip balm but not much better than chapstick.</li>
            <li>it soothes small burns, insect bites and inhaling the peppermint aroma is good for headaches.</li>
            <li>HOT HOT HOT, SUPER SUPER DRY, ARIZONA.</li>
            <li>great stuff - wish it would last longer than it does, but that is probably due to how much I use them...</li>
            <li>This four pack had four flavors which was a nice change from the typical mint</li>
            <li>Smart....very smart.</li>
            <li>I cannot say that this product does not have another ingredient that makes your lips peel, but I can say that I use this a good bit less frequently than I used the Carmex.</li>
            <li>Like many, I don&#x27;t drink as much water as I need to and sometimes my lip can become dry and chapped.</li>
            <li>I use it all the time hence the 4-pack Classic Lip Balm!</li>
            <li>This does not add any shine to your lips and is very waxy not to my liking.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, the only lip balm I do not develop a sensitivity or allergy to.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t save much buying the multi-packs.</li>
            <li>very good,i like them</li>
            <li>Do I really have to say anything about this?</li>
            <li>He really likes the peppermint scent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what to say about this.</li>
            <li>but then you don&#x27;t have it apply it as much.</li>
            <li>It does not have a flavor/taste which I really appreciate too.</li>
            <li>Really works and keeps your lips from peeling.  </li>
            <li>Much softer within days.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat the online price.</li>
            <li>Very helpful with chapped lips.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I find that it is not as effective at treating lips that are very chapped from wind and cold, but as an everyday lip moisturizer, this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>We really like this lipbalm.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Bert&#x27;s Bees really works.  </li>
            <li>And I recommended it to my whole family and now every uses it.</li>
            <li>Really.  </li>
            <li>Really needed this.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The whole family uses it, and we have a tube stashed in every room of the house.  </li>
            <li>It is much creamier and goes on like butter.</li>
            <li>This worked for me very well in winter to protect lips from wind.  </li>
            <li>4 together to buy a very cost-effective,</li>
            <li>I ordered these for my sister and she absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the minty taste is a bit too much for me though.</li>
            <li>Real deal.</li>
            <li>Really helped my lips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very overpowering.</li>
            <li>It does not run out too fast like cocoa butter and chemicals products.</li>
            <li>I keep several tubes handy as back up just in</li>
            <li>The only thing is that the peppermint can irritate some people, so it would be nice to have a completely scent-free version, or a natural ingredient that provides scent and whatnot</li>
            <li>Glad to get them shipped right to my door and save a few dollars with subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>An individual stick has tremendous value, as I&#x27;m still on my first stick of lip balm and have another three to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Burt’s Bees original Beeswax lip balm is the best out there, I always have a tube of it on me especially during these cold winter months.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get the stick back to its original position after using it.</li>
            <li>The original is the only one I&#x27;ve found that works for fever blisters.</li>
            <li>i love the minty after feel of the lip balm keeps my lips moisturized longer than any other i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>many other lip balms contain beeswax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wear off like most other brands.</li>
            <li>Works better than all other brands of lip balm I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wear off like most other brands.</li>
            <li>Love this product, purchase went exactly as expected!</li>
            <li>Easy to dry out.</li>
            <li>There is a reason that this product has been around and popular for so long; simply put, it works.  </li>
            <li>The beeswax in the yellow sticks are a bit heavy but might be good for really chapped lips.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use anything other than Burt&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>The peppermint is cooling and soothing, making it feel so much better than some other lip balms!</li>
            <li>I find that other petroleum-based lip balms  rub off too easily and feel very slippery.  </li>
            <li>I am able to keep my lips more moist by NOT using it for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the other types are moisturizing; this is not.</li>
            <li>my lips&#x27; color is very dark,now it becomes the light pink.</li>
            <li>ok, maybe an addict but not like the kind that needs to be on My Crazy Obsession.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The balm is harder on all the tubes I received, and therefore does not spread easily on my lips.</li>
            <li>I am able use this stuff way less often throughout the day compared to chapstick.</li>
            <li>They were out of the standard formula, so I bought a set of these super fruit, and I can&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li>Classic peppermint.</li>
            <li>She has several types, but this is her favorite and she can never have enough for her purse, her school bag, her room, etc.</li>
            <li>for all you vaseline based users: &amp;#34;Petroleum jelly, the main ingredient in Vaseline, is a derivative of oil refining.</li>
            <li>A classic; feels like it stays for a while.</li>
            <li>Nothing beats this classic lip balm.</li>
            <li>My main reason for buying their products though is because they work and this lip balm is no exception.  </li>
            <li>It is long lasting and extremely effective but also is all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain any irritants.</li>
            <li>Very useful in a dry weather.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended,</li>
            <li>She highly reccomends this to others.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to all.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lip balm.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Unlike other lip balms, there are natural ingredients that allow for a better texture and smoother application.</li>
            <li>We live in a dry climate, so lip balm is important to us.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been much of a lip balm kind of guy, but the wife purchased Burt&#x27;s Bees 4 pack and gave one to me to use during the very dry winter months, or anytime as we live in a very dry climate.  </li>
            <li>so far very go</li>
            <li>The lip balm is very soothing and makes your lips feel so soft.</li>
            <li>Like it better than Chapstick, it soothes dried out  lips and lasts a lot longer.</li>
            <li>you used the more you had to use all day long, now I may only need the lip balm from Burt&#x27;s Bees once a day or every couple of days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve applied this before bedtime when my lips felt chapped and in the morning, my lips are soothed and feel normal again.  </li>
            <li>I love the 4 packs because I use it all year round.</li>
            <li>I love it, and use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I got the normal unflavored variety.</li>
            <li>It definitely moisturizes my lips without being too strong or addictive like carmex.</li>
            <li>We really like this chapstick; it feels more beneficial to overall health than chapsticks based in other ingredients.</li>
            <li>The smell and the feeling it gives my lips is incomparable to any other that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Bees increased production in 1989 after a New York boutique, Zona, ordered hundreds of their beeswax candles.</li>
            <li>Forty additional employees were hired and an abandoned bowling alley became their new manufacturing location.</li>
            <li>Did I get a new formula?</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado and my lips would fall off without my Burt&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Cannot live without this stuff.  </li>
            <li>these cost $5.50 each in new york city</li>
            <li>LIVE IN ARIZONA,</li>
            <li>We live in New Mexico&#x27;s desert climate.</li>
            <li>But ya live and learn.</li>
            <li>I then threw out the tube I was using and opened a new one.</li>
            <li>It does protect your lips and helps tremendously with dry lips.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive about my lip balm--</li>
            <li>Very natural.  </li>
            <li>Here in dry Colorado, chapstick is a MUST pretty much all year and this stuff does the trick</li>
            <li>for about the past 10 years or more.  </li>
            <li>works better than any other lip balm I&#x27;ve tried, would recommend it to anyone who uses similar product, would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>Natural products association certified!</li>
            <li>All who want a natural healing to there lips should buy this product!</li>
            <li>Even when Burt&#x27;s Bees was taken over it seemed to me that the quality of the balm stayed the same, unlike many other BB products.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s has several different flavors, but this is my personal favorite.</li>
            <li>Goes over my regular lipstick color, moisturize my lips extremely well, and leave a matt finish rather than glossy (which is not in any more).</li>
            <li>only down-side to these is that they are often a bit more expensive that similar products ... but only a little more and the zing to me is worth it. :)</li>
            <li>(at least i&#x27;m satisfied with it), the product doesn&#x27;t give much shine and doesn&#x27;t have a waxy feel, or make you feel like you just put jelly on your lips, it actually absorbs very well and keeps your lips very soft.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees is a good chapstick for those who are addicted to chapstick but don&#x27;t want to keep using the brands that actively dry out their lips and got them hooked in the first place.</li>
            <li>I previously owned a medicated Blistex chapstick and the difference is astonishing; this product wins hands down.</li>
            <li>or we start using the heater, Chap Stick moisturizer hardly works for me, Burts Bees lip balm was the first balm that stayed on for more than 2-3 hours and actually gave me some relief from the chapped lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is a slight minty feel that is very refreshing and the balm stays on much longer than other similar brands.</li>
            <li>Living in the desert, coupled with the fact that as I&#x27;ve aged my dry lips have gotten even drier and I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees for many years.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes okay, but it&#x27;s hard to feel it on my lips.  </li>
            <li>Other lip balms tend to dry out my lips even more over time or irritate my lips.</li>
            <li>I used this product religiously for a couple months while on the drug and found it to be very ineffective at penetrating compared to the Eucerin/Aquaphor Lip Balm, which is a shame because this lip balm is natural beeswax.</li>
            <li>but I got back to Burt&#x27;s because this 100% Natural Lip Balm moisturizes, heals and protects my lips very well.</li>
            <li>In summer the balm keeps your lips soft and protected.</li>
            <li>all natural product</li>
            <li>My family and some articles I read online stated that anything, that does not have natural ingrediants would not work.  </li>
            <li>so I appreciated the low price of the four pack.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses this because it actually works to heal and prevent chapped lips.</li>
            <li>I keep one in the office, one near my bed, one in my camera bag and one in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>It gets soft but nothing gushy.</li>
            <li>All natural for something you put on your lips all the time--gee . . .</li>
            <li>The featured ingredient is Beeswax, which Burt says is \\&quot;another treat from our friends the bees, Beeswax is a natural skin conditioner when used in moisturizing formulas.\\</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen or felt my lips so clear and soft in two decades.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>It burns after put is on for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I prefer the mintier flavor to the commonly found and more girly fruit flavored lip balms.</li>
            <li>4 OF BURT&#x27;S BEE&#x27;S LIP HYDRATING TUBES PLUS OFFERS OF ASSORTED FLAVORS.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give instant results but after using for awhile it really does help.</li>
            <li>Hydrating, no heavy scent</li>
            <li>My husband uses it, I use it, even my 3 year old uses it.</li>
            <li>It is a natural product that works.</li>
            <li>I have developed either an allergy or sensitivity to this lip balm.  </li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin either.  </li>
            <li>So, I have listed ingredients below since frequently</li>
            <li>, it has a wax-like feel (hence the name), but the balm goes on smoothly &amp; doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all.  </li>
            <li>It keeps like lips from drying out and makes them feel so soft and moist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far.</li>
            <li>We really like Burt&#x27;s Bees products, especially their lip balm!</li>
            <li>and I have bought (and used up) dozens of tubes so far.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money spent</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees makes quality products that are effective and leave out unhealthy ingredients.</li>
            <li>I like the actual lip gloss very much, but you will want to read the seller&#x27;s note and make sure you understand that they are shipping these glosses loose, not packaged in a little box all together.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many other kinds of natural, cruelty-free lip balm (even other kinds of Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27;), and tossed them all in the trash except for this one.  </li>
            <li>The product seemed to be exactly the same as you can get from the local store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth enough that you can apply it under lipstick or lip gloss without creating a mess on your lips.  </li>
            <li>My lips were almost back to normal within just 2 or 3 days of using it often.</li>
            <li>The first time I use the balm is not very sticky</li>
            <li>Be careful though, not all &amp;#34;burts bees&amp;#34; are beeswax - there are some that have petroleum jelly as its first ingredient.</li>
            <li>Nothing worse than tasting straight old wax like the original chap stick.  </li>
            <li>The best quality about this product is that there are no offensive chemical byproducts and preservatives.&lt;br /&gt;There is no after taste when this product is needed on a windy bike ride or frigid energizing cross country skiing runs.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>The only lip balm I&#x27;ll use anymore- keeps my lips soft, heals already chapped lips!</li>
            <li>Since then, Burt&#x27;s Bees has become a major retailer nationwide.  </li>
            <li>Excellent protection year round for the lips but especially beneficial in the winter time&#x27;s cold and windy weather.</li>
            <li>Last a long time and is very soothing.</li>
            <li>Only natural products in this item.</li>
            <li>Well this one, besides having the added bonus of being all natural, actually works!  </li>
            <li>Apparently my lips are just to luscious</li>
            <li>and I needed something I then started searching online and found another truly natural lip balm made by the &#x27;Red Headed Honey&amp;#34; company.</li>
            <li>I especially like the fact that it is made of beeswax and 100% natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my lips soft, even in the middle of winter.  </li>
            <li>it is good for lip,but feel cold.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel waxy like Chapstick and it isn&#x27;t too thin like some of the more Vaseline-type lip products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice faint peppermint taste to it.  </li>
            <li>Seems a little harder and not as easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Since my first baby was born a few months ago, I&#x27;ve noticed both my skin and lips get dried out quickly.</li>
            <li>GREAT and less expensive in this quad pack.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s for over 15 years, and that&#x27;s less than the cost when I bought my first tube.  </li>
            <li>as I would any other fast forward</li>
            <li>Felt so soft and pain free (try smiling really hard with dry winter lips).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought eight of these balms, and when I get to the near end of one (about an eighth left), when you open the cap, it will fall out onto the floor.</li>
            <li>a little think when you first put it on</li>
            <li>For YEARS I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a product that would deal with my &#x27;painfully&#x27; dry lips, my search is now over.  </li>
            <li>100% natural and keep lip moist for long</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry are, where no matter how stubborn you are, you can&#x27;t avoid having to use chapstick.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like so much about burts chapstick is its a little too waxy.</li>
            <li>These little gifts are appreciated especially in the winter when they are walking around campus.</li>
            <li>I always make sure I have at least one of these little babies at home, by my bed, in my pocket, in my bag...</li>

            <li> Feel&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> so good :)</li>
            <li> Four pack nice</li>
            <li> This 4 pk. was a way better deal cost wise.....</li>
            <li> Flavor/scent is nice however.</li>
            <li> Arrived as advertised and nice to have backups</li>
            <li> Nice peppermint flavor.  </li>
            <li> This is nice and minty.  </li>
            <li> The minty tingle is nice.</li>
            <li> This is da kind.</li>
            <li> and I guess I really didn&#x27;t need it because the chapstick made me very happy</li>
            <li> I have a tube in every jacket and every bag I own.</li>
            <li> Bees lip balm is all-natural, and gives a nice tingly sensation from the peppermint oil.  </li>
            <li> lip balm itself has a nice cooling sensation, and doesn&#x27;t feel overly greasy when you put it on.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the best.</li>
            <li> Nice sting to it, which makes me feel like I have plumper lips, which I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> smell good and very cute, easy to take with.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and better price buying online!!</li>
            <li> The original is great in my book.</li>
            <li> It always feels great going on and leaves my lips moist and fresh feeling!</li>
            <li> This lip balm is great, and I am always looking for deals, so when I saw a 4-pack of Burt&#x27;s Bees Original Lip Balm for $8.99, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.  </li>
            <li> Great price and quick shipping</li>
            <li> I always believed that bees were superior beings but to create such a wonderful product for my luscious lips went beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> This balm is lightly and pleasantly scented.</li>
            <li> My new favorite!!!</li>
            <li> Best on the market by far</li>
            <li> my favorite of all time and nice to get bulk and discount</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing chapstick ever made.</li>
            <li> So far this lip balm is the best I have tried.</li>
            <li> Moist, listing, suitable for men</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice feel and smell to it without being waxy at all, thus making it OK for men to use too without looking fruity.</li>
            <li> This offers the best results of any lip lube I have every tried.</li>
            <li> It has a nice crisp pepperminty scent and it does a great job of keeping lips moisturized without that &amp;#34;lip gloss&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> cool sensation from the peppermint oil is refreshing and just feels great on your lips.</li>
            <li> I love all their products they feel good and smell fantastic.</li>
            <li> Now you can pick up a tube of heaven at many retailers, but amazon subscribe and save is by far the best price.</li>

            <li> Very comfortable with them, kind of mint, very practical in winter</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product because of the brand&#x27;s reputation and I was most certainly not disappointed.</li>

            <li> Glad to find them at such a great price.</li>

            <li> The mint scent is really strong</li>
            <li> No plumping action, but it sure feels good.</li>
            <li> I make a lot of my own care products, but Burt&#x27;s does such a good job with this product at an affordable cost, I purchase Burt&#x27;s instead.</li>

            <li> After trying many different brands, Burt&#x27;s Bees is the most effective and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm (original) is, hands down, the best lip balm that I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li> Awesome product, always thought it was a little pricy</li>
            <li> ; types are garbage and do little to help lips in need, but THIS is the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees and decided the 4 pack would solve my problems of moving one from my vehicle to purse to wherever.</li>
            <li> I tried this a few years ago and was not that all impressed.</li>
            <li> It goes on SMOOTH, it&#x27;s not shiny (husband doesn&#x27;t want shiny lips. . .</li>
            <li> Bee&#x27;s wax is one of the most highly effective, moisture-locking, ingredients (natural or chemical) available.</li>
            <li> The fact that bee&#x27;s wax is the primary protectant in Burt&#x27;s is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The peppermint creates a light tingling feeling.</li>
            <li> They also work to keep my lips smooth.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic and minty.</li>
            <li> The texture is smooth and light but it stays on your lips for an extended amount of time.</li>
            <li> This stuff works and feels so great; it&#x27;s addictive!  </li>
            <li> Comfortable, mint taste.</li>
            <li> Keeps my lips smooth.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that it feels light on my lips; I like to feel it</li>
            <li> Feels great on my lips, would definitely buy it again</li>
            <li> the price for this pack is so cheap compared to the store as well.</li>
            <li> the chaps vanished, they are great use them all the time definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Fix my lips really gentle and nice.</li>
            <li> I use quite a few of Burt&#x27;s Bees products and am very happy with all of them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very dry in suzhou,China,after applying my lips feel so good!</li>
            <li> Very economical multi-pack.</li>
            <li> Seriously, if anyone needs convincing that Burt&#x27;s Bees is the best lip balm ever, just try it for yourself!</li>
            <li> I love it very much.</li>
            <li> i love it very much.</li>
            <li> I love the slight tingle, the minty smell/taste, and it leaves my lips feeling great.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm so much!</li>
            <li> I have found Burt&#x27;s Bees to be the best working lip balm and have been a fan the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> Mint makes me feel cool and comfortable</li>
            <li> I love it ,and the price is really reasonable!</li>
            <li> Excellent lip balm and will definitely buy more next time.</li>
            <li> It lasts an hour or so once applied, but the four-pack I ordered will last me a year or more!  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s due to the natural ingredient nature of the product, but it would make for a perfect lip balm if added.</li>
            <li> Honestly cannot live without them.</li>
            <li> However, I gifted this to a young man and it is his favorite.  </li>
            <li> Burt’s bees lip balm is special because its special formula creates a tingling sensation when you apply it to your lips.</li>
            <li> and the price is just right!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very effective at preventing my lips from being dry without having a flavor or smell.</li>
            <li> Just  a quick note to point out that this is NOT the original formula.</li>
            <li> Very pleased &amp; thanks so much for the prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> the peppermint one makes me feel as if I just sprayed my mouth nice cool feeling so far</li>
            <li> This stick  make my lips not only moist,but bright and glossy.&lt;br /&gt;Previously</li>
            <li> Bought to offer so have no idea of quality I believe good as ordered from relative</li>
            <li> Something about beeswax just feels better on my lips, plus the addition of lanolin really helps too.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite lip balm on the face of the earth.</li>
            <li> These are highly recommended! :)</li>
            <li> the price is low and the effect is good.</li>
            <li> This product has a cool, menthol feel when applied.</li>
            <li> or if it does become full grown, it helps it heal faster.</li>
            <li> I really like these but gave it three stars instead of four because I have found that home-made lip balm with shea butter &amp; coconut oil works better for me.</li>
            <li> Really good, looking forward to the next buy</li>
            <li> So having the package of four is nice, as I can leave them throughout the house and still have one near when I need it.  </li>
            <li> Good price, especially when it drops below 2.50/tube</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite lipbalm and it is well priced on this site.</li>
            <li> It has a cool tingly feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know that it is all natural too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this lip balm - recommended by one of my daughters, I tried it and immediately noticed a difference in how my lips felt.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think you&#x27;re getting this sweet honey-like lip balm</li>
            <li> I will never buy any other lip balm it is one of the best things I have discovered in my life highly recommend .</li>
            <li> At first i thought it was too strong</li>
            <li> A little cool and refreshing, the effect is good,</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I was a loyal customer of Burts Bees products....</li>
            <li> but that goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li> quickly</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm and you can&#x27;t beat this price of buying 4 at a time instead of individual ones at more than $3 a pop.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm and you can&#x27;t beat this price of buying 4 at a time instead of individual ones at more than $3 a pop.</li>
            <li> Love the simple, pure and effective ingredients that go into this balm.</li>
            <li> Love the simple, pure and effective ingredients that go into this balm.  </li>
            <li> I was sold on this lip balm the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Good balance between how it feels and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> it goes on smoothly, feels great and seems to stay for much longer than other brands.</li>
            <li> I love my Burt&#x27;s Bee lip balm; handy to have extras; as I am always searching for where I might have laid one of these down around the house.</li>
            <li> Same as always just more!</li>
            <li> This product never fails to please me!</li>
            <li> I have the whole family hooked on these gems!!</li>
            <li> Also if you apply to a newly formed fever blister it will keep it from becoming full blown(at</li>
            <li> more I use it, the more dry my lips get.  </li>
            <li> Great product, I never knew how much better Lip Balm could be as I usually order products when I see them go on sale (specifically the Nivea line) and these just feel so much better and last quite a while too.</li>
            <li> Alsmost ready to reorder these fine Lip balms - the price is also right.</li>
            <li> Overall, this lip balm is amazing</li>
            <li> But the results on your lips with regular use are amazing.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and really makes your lips moist.</li>
            <li> The only kind of lip balm I will use.  </li>
            <li> They are incredible lip balm - a layer of protection that wears well and doesn&#x27;t need reapplying after 15 minutes or feel addictive as some do with the need to constantly reapply.  </li>
            <li> I love this natural lip balm--I keep them in my car, wallet, bathrooms, and nightstand</li>
            <li> The beeswax gives your lips a protective coating for outdoor winter fun and moisturizes in the drier air.</li>
            <li> By the way, I love these lip balms, keeps my lips really soft all throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a refreshing minty flavor and keeps lips soft.</li>
            <li> So take that for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> As far as lip balm goes, this is just okay.</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels good on your lips, not overly slick or overly sticky, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> So worth it.  </li>
            <li> More like I can&#x27;t because my lips won&#x27;t become as soft as with these Burt bees.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it keeps my lips from getting chapped and is all natural.</li>
            <li> This 4 pack is really great and offers savings over buying individual sticks.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite chap stick, always keeps my lips soft and moist.</li>
            <li> has a fresh minty feel.</li>
            <li> This Lip Balm is the most natural one I have been used than ever before,and it tastes nice,above</li>
            <li> This lip balm is great for keeping my lips moist, and (unlike most other similar products) doesn&#x27;t create dependency.</li>
            <li> I only use burts bees, original, all year round, it is the best lip balm for me</li>
            <li> I tried many of the brands out there as I need to keep something on my lips most of the time due to allergies.</li>
            <li> the other chap lips stuff, plus this has many more uses, so I like they came in a four pack, so I can keep them a couple in my bug out bag, and keep one in my EDC,</li>
            <li> I am sure I will like this flavor just fine (albeit for a long time).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, such a good deal on amazon.</li>
            <li> that I found the deal right before Christmas to use as stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> AND IN THE RIGHT HAND POCKET OF THOSE JEANS IS ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS</li>
            <li> The kind I bought is flavored with wintergreen, which is okay, but not a favorite of mine.  </li>
            <li> first it felt odd, it was too light, too dry, please, don&#x27;t be deceived, it is the best moisturizing lip balm I&#x27;ve EVER used.  </li>
            <li> Great that it is a little cheaper in a multipack!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s before and Nivea and Carmex, ALL of thsese are better by far than the most recent Burt&#x27;s Bees I received.</li>
            <li> this is my first time that I buy something in Amazon.com, the lip balm is useful</li>
            <li> I recently learned that most chap sticks use salicylic acid to make the lips peel, causing you to use chap stick more frequently.</li>
            <li> These are usually sold for $3-$4 a tube in stores, so this 4 pack for $9 is a great deal.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes well and has a nice peppermint scent that stays long after application.  </li>
            <li> Lipstick is very cool, not moisturizing effect a general, the first purchase understand S &amp; S. Will not buy again!</li>
            <li> I like a lip balm that is a little more greasy and creamy, that feels more substantial on my lips.  </li>
            <li> Bought assorted flavors as previous usage experience was good.</li>
            <li> Much better than Chap Stick and Carmax as it is not overly waxy and does not dry out your lips.</li>
            <li> This lip balm typically retails for $2.99/tube, so this was a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The company uses quality, natural ingredients and has a good corporate philosophy (yes, I know they are now owned by Clorox</li>
            <li> This may be the one thing I honestly could not live without.</li>
            <li> I actually did not associate the problem with Burt&#x27;s Bees right away and applied more.</li>
            <li> Essential for anyone who hikes or walks more than an hour a day -- a pack of four lasts me about eight months -- and this set is a great bargain compared to the onesies next to the impulse register at my local hardware</li>
            <li> This is very gentle and soothes my lips immediately.</li>
            <li> ever!&lt;br /&gt;It is not excessively greasy when applying and stays on your lips.&lt;br /&gt;Works to sooth with a light tingling sensation when first applied.</li>
            <li> Shavitz had a honey business which provided the excess beeswax needed for the candles and Quimby&#x27;s focus on maintaining high quality helped to grow their business from an initial $200 at the Dover-Foxcroft Junior High School craft fair to $20,000 by the end of their first year.</li>
            <li> Not only does beeswax provide a home for larvae, but it goes on smooth right out of the tube!</li>
            <li> A necessary staple for many years.</li>
            <li> Their first headquarters was an abandoned one-room schoolhouse rented from a friend for $150 a year.[13]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this was the first product that solved the issue once and for all.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm, so we buy it occasionally to make sure she doesn&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I was using the traditional lip balm from the supermarket, which contains alcohol and from what I read it just dries the lips out more and requires application after application with no end in sight.  </li>
            <li> I am very dissapointed and will never buy it again!</li>
            <li> I used to buy them in singles for $3 or more each in any regular store.</li>
            <li> I finally thought to look them up on Amazon and there they are! : )</li>
            <li> This was a shock at first.  </li>
            <li> product does exactly what you&#x27;d expect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> IN THE SUMMER WHEN IT IS SO HOT</li>
            <li> A FUNNY PAIR</li>
            <li> Has that nice minty tingle, I also like the minimal ingredients.</li>
            <li> I like the scent and the feeling of knowing that I&#x27;m putting something natural and not chemical filled on my lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this chapstick for a decade now, since a college classmate from North Carolina told me he swore by this stuff and literally would have his mom send him more in the mail when he ran out as it wasn&#x27;t sold locally at that time.  </li>
            <li> Will likely always be my favorite.</li>
            <li> Not only for lips, but also on cuts and scrapes, and nothing better for split lip.  </li>
            <li> And the price was better than I can buy them for locally</li>
            <li> It actually makes my lips feel better without drying them out when I stop using it.</li>
            <li> I love the flavor but that doesn&#x27;t make up for me constantly putting the stuff on my lips.</li>
            <li> I think it works about ten mins until I need more.</li>
            <li> I am an avid chapstick consumer...</li>
            <li> I was interested in Burt&#x27;s Bees after seeing a show on how I made my millions</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is way much cheaper than in stores!</li>
            <li> But once I first tried Burt&#x27;s Bees, I knew I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> The slightly tacky wax with peppermint oil feels refreshing, clean, and does not shine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;****update****&lt;br /&gt;To be clear there was no ingredient list at the time of purchase in 2013 and the product received had a much longer ingredient list than the original beeswax formulation.</li>
            <li> Runs out pretty fast though.</li>
            <li> Good lip balm but not much better than chapstick.</li>
            <li> it soothes small burns, insect bites and inhaling the peppermint aroma is good for headaches.</li>
            <li> HOT HOT HOT, SUPER SUPER DRY, ARIZONA.</li>
            <li> great stuff - wish it would last longer than it does, but that is probably due to how much I use them...</li>
            <li> This four pack had four flavors which was a nice change from the typical mint</li>
            <li> Smart....very smart.</li>
            <li> I cannot say that this product does not have another ingredient that makes your lips peel, but I can say that I use this a good bit less frequently than I used the Carmex.</li>
            <li> Like many, I don&#x27;t drink as much water as I need to and sometimes my lip can become dry and chapped.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time hence the 4-pack Classic Lip Balm!</li>
            <li> This does not add any shine to your lips and is very waxy not to my liking.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, the only lip balm I do not develop a sensitivity or allergy to.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t save much buying the multi-packs.</li>
            <li> very good,i like them</li>
            <li> Do I really have to say anything about this?</li>
            <li> He really likes the peppermint scent.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what to say about this.</li>
            <li> but then you don&#x27;t have it apply it as much.</li>
            <li> It does not have a flavor/taste which I really appreciate too.</li>
            <li> Really works and keeps your lips from peeling.  </li>
            <li> Much softer within days.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the online price.</li>
            <li> Very helpful with chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I find that it is not as effective at treating lips that are very chapped from wind and cold, but as an everyday lip moisturizer, this is perfect.  </li>
            <li> We really like this lipbalm.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Bert&#x27;s Bees really works.  </li>
            <li> And I recommended it to my whole family and now every uses it.</li>
            <li> Really.  </li>
            <li> Really needed this.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The whole family uses it, and we have a tube stashed in every room of the house.  </li>
            <li> It is much creamier and goes on like butter.</li>
            <li> This worked for me very well in winter to protect lips from wind.  </li>
            <li> 4 together to buy a very cost-effective,</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my sister and she absolutely loves them.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the minty taste is a bit too much for me though.</li>
            <li> Real deal.</li>
            <li> Really helped my lips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very overpowering.</li>
            <li> It does not run out too fast like cocoa butter and chemicals products.</li>
            <li> I keep several tubes handy as back up just in</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the peppermint can irritate some people, so it would be nice to have a completely scent-free version, or a natural ingredient that provides scent and whatnot</li>
            <li> Glad to get them shipped right to my door and save a few dollars with subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> An individual stick has tremendous value, as I&#x27;m still on my first stick of lip balm and have another three to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Burt’s Bees original Beeswax lip balm is the best out there, I always have a tube of it on me especially during these cold winter months.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get the stick back to its original position after using it.</li>
            <li> The original is the only one I&#x27;ve found that works for fever blisters.</li>
            <li> i love the minty after feel of the lip balm keeps my lips moisturized longer than any other i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> many other lip balms contain beeswax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t wear off like most other brands.</li>
            <li> Works better than all other brands of lip balm I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t wear off like most other brands.</li>
            <li> Love this product, purchase went exactly as expected!</li>
            <li> Easy to dry out.</li>
            <li> There is a reason that this product has been around and popular for so long; simply put, it works.  </li>
            <li> The beeswax in the yellow sticks are a bit heavy but might be good for really chapped lips.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use anything other than Burt&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> The peppermint is cooling and soothing, making it feel so much better than some other lip balms!</li>
            <li> I find that other petroleum-based lip balms  rub off too easily and feel very slippery.  </li>
            <li> I am able to keep my lips more moist by NOT using it for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the other types are moisturizing; this is not.</li>
            <li> my lips&#x27; color is very dark,now it becomes the light pink.</li>
            <li> ok, maybe an addict but not like the kind that needs to be on My Crazy Obsession.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The balm is harder on all the tubes I received, and therefore does not spread easily on my lips.</li>
            <li> I am able use this stuff way less often throughout the day compared to chapstick.</li>
            <li> They were out of the standard formula, so I bought a set of these super fruit, and I can&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> Classic peppermint.</li>
            <li> She has several types, but this is her favorite and she can never have enough for her purse, her school bag, her room, etc.</li>
            <li> for all you vaseline based users: &amp;#34;Petroleum jelly, the main ingredient in Vaseline, is a derivative of oil refining.</li>
            <li> A classic; feels like it stays for a while.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats this classic lip balm.</li>
            <li> My main reason for buying their products though is because they work and this lip balm is no exception.  </li>
            <li> It is long lasting and extremely effective but also is all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain any irritants.</li>
            <li> Very useful in a dry weather.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended,</li>
            <li> She highly reccomends this to others.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to all.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lip balm.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Unlike other lip balms, there are natural ingredients that allow for a better texture and smoother application.</li>
            <li> We live in a dry climate, so lip balm is important to us.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been much of a lip balm kind of guy, but the wife purchased Burt&#x27;s Bees 4 pack and gave one to me to use during the very dry winter months, or anytime as we live in a very dry climate.  </li>
            <li> so far very go</li>
            <li> The lip balm is very soothing and makes your lips feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Like it better than Chapstick, it soothes dried out  lips and lasts a lot longer.</li>
            <li> you used the more you had to use all day long, now I may only need the lip balm from Burt&#x27;s Bees once a day or every couple of days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied this before bedtime when my lips felt chapped and in the morning, my lips are soothed and feel normal again.  </li>
            <li> I love the 4 packs because I use it all year round.</li>
            <li> I love it, and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I got the normal unflavored variety.</li>
            <li> It definitely moisturizes my lips without being too strong or addictive like carmex.</li>
            <li> We really like this chapstick; it feels more beneficial to overall health than chapsticks based in other ingredients.</li>
            <li> The smell and the feeling it gives my lips is incomparable to any other that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Bees increased production in 1989 after a New York boutique, Zona, ordered hundreds of their beeswax candles.</li>
            <li> Forty additional employees were hired and an abandoned bowling alley became their new manufacturing location.</li>
            <li> Did I get a new formula?</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado and my lips would fall off without my Burt&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without this stuff.  </li>
            <li> these cost $5.50 each in new york city</li>
            <li> LIVE IN ARIZONA,</li>
            <li> We live in New Mexico&#x27;s desert climate.</li>
            <li> But ya live and learn.</li>
            <li> I then threw out the tube I was using and opened a new one.</li>
            <li> It does protect your lips and helps tremendously with dry lips.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive about my lip balm--</li>
            <li> Very natural.  </li>
            <li> Here in dry Colorado, chapstick is a MUST pretty much all year and this stuff does the trick</li>
            <li> for about the past 10 years or more.  </li>
            <li> works better than any other lip balm I&#x27;ve tried, would recommend it to anyone who uses similar product, would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Natural products association certified!</li>
            <li> All who want a natural healing to there lips should buy this product!</li>
            <li> Even when Burt&#x27;s Bees was taken over it seemed to me that the quality of the balm stayed the same, unlike many other BB products.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s has several different flavors, but this is my personal favorite.</li>
            <li> Goes over my regular lipstick color, moisturize my lips extremely well, and leave a matt finish rather than glossy (which is not in any more).</li>
            <li> only down-side to these is that they are often a bit more expensive that similar products ... but only a little more and the zing to me is worth it. :)</li>
            <li> (at least i&#x27;m satisfied with it), the product doesn&#x27;t give much shine and doesn&#x27;t have a waxy feel, or make you feel like you just put jelly on your lips, it actually absorbs very well and keeps your lips very soft.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is a good chapstick for those who are addicted to chapstick but don&#x27;t want to keep using the brands that actively dry out their lips and got them hooked in the first place.</li>
            <li> I previously owned a medicated Blistex chapstick and the difference is astonishing; this product wins hands down.</li>
            <li> or we start using the heater, Chap Stick moisturizer hardly works for me, Burts Bees lip balm was the first balm that stayed on for more than 2-3 hours and actually gave me some relief from the chapped lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a slight minty feel that is very refreshing and the balm stays on much longer than other similar brands.</li>
            <li> Living in the desert, coupled with the fact that as I&#x27;ve aged my dry lips have gotten even drier and I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees for many years.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes okay, but it&#x27;s hard to feel it on my lips.  </li>
            <li> Other lip balms tend to dry out my lips even more over time or irritate my lips.</li>
            <li> I used this product religiously for a couple months while on the drug and found it to be very ineffective at penetrating compared to the Eucerin/Aquaphor Lip Balm, which is a shame because this lip balm is natural beeswax.</li>
            <li> but I got back to Burt&#x27;s because this 100% Natural Lip Balm moisturizes, heals and protects my lips very well.</li>
            <li> In summer the balm keeps your lips soft and protected.</li>
            <li> all natural product</li>
            <li> My family and some articles I read online stated that anything, that does not have natural ingrediants would not work.  </li>
            <li> so I appreciated the low price of the four pack.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses this because it actually works to heal and prevent chapped lips.</li>
            <li> I keep one in the office, one near my bed, one in my camera bag and one in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> It gets soft but nothing gushy.</li>
            <li> All natural for something you put on your lips all the time--gee . . .</li>
            <li> The featured ingredient is Beeswax, which Burt says is \\&quot;another treat from our friends the bees, Beeswax is a natural skin conditioner when used in moisturizing formulas.\\</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen or felt my lips so clear and soft in two decades.  </li>
            <li> Not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> It burns after put is on for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I prefer the mintier flavor to the commonly found and more girly fruit flavored lip balms.</li>
            <li> 4 OF BURT&#x27;S BEE&#x27;S LIP HYDRATING TUBES PLUS OFFERS OF ASSORTED FLAVORS.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give instant results but after using for awhile it really does help.</li>
            <li> Hydrating, no heavy scent</li>
            <li> My husband uses it, I use it, even my 3 year old uses it.</li>
            <li> It is a natural product that works.</li>
            <li> I have developed either an allergy or sensitivity to this lip balm.  </li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin either.  </li>
            <li> So, I have listed ingredients below since frequently</li>
            <li> , it has a wax-like feel (hence the name), but the balm goes on smoothly &amp; doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all.  </li>
            <li> It keeps like lips from drying out and makes them feel so soft and moist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far.</li>
            <li> We really like Burt&#x27;s Bees products, especially their lip balm!</li>
            <li> and I have bought (and used up) dozens of tubes so far.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money spent</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees makes quality products that are effective and leave out unhealthy ingredients.</li>
            <li> I like the actual lip gloss very much, but you will want to read the seller&#x27;s note and make sure you understand that they are shipping these glosses loose, not packaged in a little box all together.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many other kinds of natural, cruelty-free lip balm (even other kinds of Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27;), and tossed them all in the trash except for this one.  </li>
            <li> The product seemed to be exactly the same as you can get from the local store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth enough that you can apply it under lipstick or lip gloss without creating a mess on your lips.  </li>
            <li> My lips were almost back to normal within just 2 or 3 days of using it often.</li>
            <li> The first time I use the balm is not very sticky</li>
            <li> Be careful though, not all &amp;#34;burts bees&amp;#34; are beeswax - there are some that have petroleum jelly as its first ingredient.</li>
            <li> Nothing worse than tasting straight old wax like the original chap stick.  </li>
            <li> The best quality about this product is that there are no offensive chemical byproducts and preservatives.&lt;br /&gt;There is no after taste when this product is needed on a windy bike ride or frigid energizing cross country skiing runs.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> The only lip balm I&#x27;ll use anymore- keeps my lips soft, heals already chapped lips!</li>
            <li> Since then, Burt&#x27;s Bees has become a major retailer nationwide.  </li>
            <li> Excellent protection year round for the lips but especially beneficial in the winter time&#x27;s cold and windy weather.</li>
            <li> Last a long time and is very soothing.</li>
            <li> Only natural products in this item.</li>
            <li> Well this one, besides having the added bonus of being all natural, actually works!  </li>
            <li> Apparently my lips are just to luscious</li>
            <li> and I needed something I then started searching online and found another truly natural lip balm made by the &#x27;Red Headed Honey&amp;#34; company.</li>
            <li> I especially like the fact that it is made of beeswax and 100% natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my lips soft, even in the middle of winter.  </li>
            <li> it is good for lip,but feel cold.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel waxy like Chapstick and it isn&#x27;t too thin like some of the more Vaseline-type lip products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a nice faint peppermint taste to it.  </li>
            <li> Seems a little harder and not as easy to put on.</li>
            <li> Since my first baby was born a few months ago, I&#x27;ve noticed both my skin and lips get dried out quickly.</li>
            <li> GREAT and less expensive in this quad pack.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s for over 15 years, and that&#x27;s less than the cost when I bought my first tube.  </li>
            <li> as I would any other fast forward</li>
            <li> Felt so soft and pain free (try smiling really hard with dry winter lips).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought eight of these balms, and when I get to the near end of one (about an eighth left), when you open the cap, it will fall out onto the floor.</li>
            <li> a little think when you first put it on</li>
            <li> For YEARS I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a product that would deal with my &#x27;painfully&#x27; dry lips, my search is now over.  </li>
            <li> 100% natural and keep lip moist for long</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry are, where no matter how stubborn you are, you can&#x27;t avoid having to use chapstick.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like so much about burts chapstick is its a little too waxy.</li>
            <li> These little gifts are appreciated especially in the winter when they are walking around campus.</li>
            <li> I always make sure I have at least one of these little babies at home, by my bed, in my pocket, in my bag...</li>
            <li> Feels cool on my lip, but a little dyier than the typical ones, such as l&#x27;oreal&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Other than the Natural Ice brand lip balm, this is the only lip balm that I have no allergy reaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not found a brand of lip balm that offers the initial zing of mint like found in these Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm sticks (and I&#x27;ve looked and experimented with other brands).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why peppermint would be added, especially at such a large quantity.</li>
            <li> Use Bert&#x27;s Bees exclusively, due to their all natural products.</li>
            <li> It completely spoiled me for other lip balms.</li>
            <li> I am completely addicted to lip balm, and Burt&#x27;s Bees original is one of my all time favorites.</li>
            <li> Even after accidentally licking my lips is there no disgusting taste, which was common among past lip balms.</li>
            <li> It works fine its just a little too hard of a consistency.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona and the weather is harsh (low humidity and blazing sun).  </li>
            <li> She mostly uses the balm before going to bed, as her lips are dry and uncomfortable then.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting without being too greasy, and it smells &amp; feels heavenly because of the peppermint oil.</li>
            <li> and they last for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife, she loves the minty tingle and the long lasting effects, Since she is always using it, I got her the 4-pack and saved her some trips to town.</li>
            <li> I thought I was the #1 fan of this stuff, but apparently I&#x27;m not alone.  </li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t last very long. .</li>
            <li> Those ingredients dry out your lips and actually hurt.  </li>
            <li> I am currently on Accutane which causes dry lips from the inside.</li>
            <li> As a flute, piccolo, and saxophone player I constantly have dry cracked lips.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it until the slight blister/cold sore was completely gone.</li>
            <li> As someone who has never really used lap balm (on a daily basis) and has suffered chapped lips during the winter, I can say that I am now a daily user of Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm.</li>
            <li> I love the regular formula but these fruity flavored lip balms stink and taste bad, and they don&#x27;t stay on my lips like the the basic formula.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure that the Burt&#x27;s Bees caused this, or that it in fact was a cold sore and not something else.</li>
            <li> Everyone who tries it switches and never looks back!</li>
            <li> Have LONG been a fan of BURT&#x27;S BEE&#x27;S products!!&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time Burt&#x27;s Bees user.</li>
            <li> Lasts long and does not transfer to anything else.</li>
            <li> The peppermint oil soothes immediately and it doesn&#x27;t take long for the dryness to go away.</li>
            <li> long story...</li>
            <li> its not sticky at all, stays on a long time, no funky taste or smell.</li>
            <li> but it gonna take long long time to finish all of them...</li>
            <li> After recieving this and using it for, a, week straight, NO MORE SPLIT LIP!  </li>
            <li> Usually while using a new lip treatment I give it weeks to effect change, with Burt&#x27;s my lips were hydrated in 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seem to go back to any other chapstick after using Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Unlike other lip products, it does not force you to reapply it constantly.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past too and noticed it was effective in the winter months at keeping the moisture in, on those biting cold windy days, though I didn&#x27;t feel it actually moisturized.</li>
            <li> Burt’s bees is different than any other type of lip balm I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Moisture holds for long periods of time!</li>
            <li> SO WHEN MY DAUGHTER CAME UP FOR A VISIT, I TOOK HER FOR A LITTLE OUTSIDE SHOPPING AT THE LOCAL PHARMACY, KNOWING THAT THEY HAD A BURTS BEES 4 PACK</li>
            <li> It keeps your lips moisturized with out drying them out later like other brands do.</li>
            <li> I never went back to any other chapsticks again.</li>
            <li> I started using this chapstick 10 years ago when i was at the bookstore and lost my other cherry regular.</li>
            <li> But this is not the flavor I like, I will try other flavors next time.</li>
            <li> It can be hard to find for a decent price online</li>
            <li> Peppermint oil contains menthol, and menthol has a tendency to dry lips, which is not the point of a lip balm.</li>
            <li> After the burn, comes the indefinite dry lips feeling..</li>
            <li> Dry formula, burns a bit.</li>
            <li> The effectiveness of this lip balm depends on the source of the dry lips.  </li>
            <li> I like to keep some of this lip balm on hand and it helps soothe my itchy dry lips.</li>
            <li> It is way too dry.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone that gets dry lips.</li>
            <li> Since my lips were getting really dry for the winter</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definately recommend this product to anyone looking to soothe dry, cracked lips</li>
            <li> I have notoriously dry lips, whether in summer or winter.</li>
            <li> It works effectively on dry, cracked lips.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are subscribed through Amazon to receive the 4 count box, as the price is a little less than what we&#x27;d normally spend in a store.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t say whether the balm lasts as long as other brands at this price as it seems to last as long as I&#x27;d expect, especially in dry climates or in the colder Winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not been as crazy about some of their other products, but I love this lip balm.  </li>
            <li> Hands down the only lip balm I use.</li>
            <li> One winter when I still working in a hospital, I had to run down to the gift shop and this was the only brand they had at the time.</li>
            <li> I am forever misplacing where I last laid it down though.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any others to beat it with my dry lips!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, in case you have any allergies and since it was reformulated from the previous basic ingredient list I thought this was pertinent.</li>
            <li> I find there lip balm as very dry, which is not my preference.  </li>
            <li> I keep one of these in every single living space that I occupy at a given moment!</li>
            <li> The tube is a little bigger</li>
            <li> When my eyes get dry, I rub a very very small amount near my tear duct and it fixes that too.</li>
            <li> Still on stick 1, but it is exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Not much else I can say.</li>
            <li> The balm is heavy, but not sticky on your lips and stays on for longer than a regular chapstick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really very moisturized...</li>
            <li> Then it became clear I was having a slow building allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> This will cure and prevent you chapped lips with minimal usage required.</li>
            <li> I just received my &amp;#34;multipack&amp;#34; of lipbalm which I had incorrectly expected to be assorted.</li>
            <li> Fairly expensive, but theyre well worth the price</li>
            <li> it can keep my mouth wet in winter.</li>
            <li> so I know I actually have product on my lips, so I tend to run it over my lips a few times.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and stays put for a decent amount of time and has a yummy slightly tingly sensation to it.  </li>
            <li> I do get cold sores but very rarely.</li>
            <li> I Find myself applying it less and less because it actually does what its meant to do.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because, I constantly get split lip on my lower lip, every year, whether, it is to hot or to cold.</li>
            <li> The Peppermint leaves our lips feeling extra cool and cold - something I especially don&#x27;t welcome on cold, frigid days.</li>
            <li> : Tried again because I ran out of my other brands.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the beeswax flavour, it&#x27;s drier than other flavors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike past lip balms that I have used, Burt&#x27;s Bees does not have a greasy, gross effect.</li>
            <li> I am a convert from chapstick and other lip products (including coconut oil).</li>
            <li> I like how this leaves my lips feeling, I don&#x27;t like the other brands of lip balm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now instead of my girlfriend complaining about my cracked lips she now complains about other things about me.</li>
            <li> I have tried other options here and there</li>
            <li> Before using this my lips burned from extreme dryness and were discolored from it, just like that, overnight they were renewed again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you cant get the last of it out unless you scoop&lt;br /&gt;it out with a small tool.</li>
            <li> other lip balm works just as well</li>
            <li> There are few chapsticks, excuse me,</li>
            <li> And it works extremely well.</li>
            <li> and then I give the other one to my 14 y.o. daughter.</li>
            <li> And I do not need to try other options.</li>
            <li> Read the ingredients in other brands.</li>
            <li> Using all the other chapsticks and lip balms provide temporary relief but nothing compares to Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if this is a good or bad lip balm for the general public, but I do know it was BAD for me.</li>
            <li> This one is very minimal.  </li>
            <li> Finally threw it in the trash after it actually made it worse.</li>
            <li> After using this at least three times a day for the last two months or so, I haven&#x27;t been close to encountering chapped lips - something that usually happened every other week in the winter (prior to using Burt&#x27;s Bees).</li>
            <li> We keep these on stock in our house during the hot summers and cold dry winters.</li>
            <li> Even if you know it is going to come off, it is sill hard to stop it from going in potentially any direction -- on the ground.</li>
            <li> /stays hard for a longer time than the generic ones.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing is wrong with this product or brand.</li>
            <li> it actually tries to heal and moisturize your dried, chapped lips.</li>
            <li> I stopped use entirely and the swelling went away within 1 day, the redness faded (slowly) over one week and is now gone.</li>
            <li> So it comes all down to your preferences.  </li>
            <li> SHE STARTED DOWN THE HAIR AISLE</li>
            <li> AND I WENT DOWN THE COSMETICS AISLE, WHERE I GOT TWO OF THESE...</li>
            <li> I believe I bought this for just over $7, which is a steal given that the individual sticks sell for around $2.47 at the store, if not more!</li>
            <li> All four came in as expected!!</li>
            <li> my lips were slightly swelling.  </li>
            <li> I switched from Carmex after years of use to Burt&#x27;s Bees and found that I have to use lip balm much less</li>
            <li> With Subscribe &amp; Save, these are less than $2 a tube.  </li>
            <li> I have previously used this product for years and now it causes a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Smells nice without that weird artificial taste or odor.</li>
            <li> Some how when i had chapped lips this thing cleared them in less then 2 hours</li>
            <li> It doesn’t just coat your lips with a sticky mess</li>
            <li> when I first used it, I felt like I was cold all over</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and waxy, so it seals in moisture for dry lips.  </li>
            <li> I usually only get a cold sore once every couple years and usually only after I&#x27;ve been sick, which is also very rare.</li>
            <li> A little greasy for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize they have a peppermint flavor that causes a little tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> Just one of those little miracles of nature I guess.</li>
            <li> AND CERTAINLY NOT ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OTHER FLAVORETTS THAT ARE SHOWN HERE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SHE IS A NOSEY LITTLE THING</li>
            <li> This scent of Burt&#x27;s Bees is a little heavier than I like for a chapstick.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be OK but after using for a few days I started getting something like a cold sore, not sure if was an actual cold sore or a reaction to the Burt&#x27;s Bees formula.</li>
            <li> Seems a little thick on the lips for me, but it works as expected.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Even after a few days of reapplying 5-10x a day, my lips still are chapped.  </li>
            <li> I use these year round</li>
            <li> As for the using it in the summer, it worked alright to prevent your lips getting dried out, but it does not have SPF.</li>
            <li> So we go through about 1 every few weeks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on the fruit-flavoured stuff.  </li>
            <li> AGAIN after a few days I starting getting another cold sore on a different area of my lip.</li>
            <li> so I ordered a few tubes online.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t feel like a thick layer of gunk or come off like some other brands (e.g. Chapstick).</li>
            <li> Not only is it less expensive</li>
            <li> In my humble opinion there is no better lip balm than Burt&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> you live in a cold country with severe winter</li>
            <li> When I am starting to get over being sick with a cold or flu is usually the only time I normally get one.</li>
            <li> The description clearly says &amp;#34;multipack&amp;#34; and my silly brain interpreted that to mean a variety of flavors.</li>
            <li> but there is very little in the tube.</li>
            <li> I shall bow before every bee till the day my bowing skills are no more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve usually been happier with Burt&#x27;s Bees products in the past.</li>
            <li> I had to make (15) gift packets and put one of these and a small soap in an organza bag.  </li>
            <li> Bought him a few packs instead of one for his stocking this year!</li>
            <li> theyre usually $3.5 in the store for 1, so</li>
            <li> He steals my Bees Balm all the time, but then I usually have a stockpile</li>
            <li> Not sure why.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re having an extremely cold and snowy winter so far (2014).  </li>
            <li> The most terrible lip balm I ever had.</li>
            <li> then it needs to be since a bee&#x27;s lips are so small but</li>
            <li> WELL, USUALLY THEY ARE</li>
            <li> They leave a weird smell in my nose, and I cannot share a drink with anyone that&#x27;s used them, for I can taste every molecule left from their lips on the straw.</li>
            <li> Has been saving me for the past week through this weather</li>
            <li> 4 Lip Balm in a small box just like the picture.</li>
            <li> There is no better lip balm in the world.  </li>
            <li> Of course I&#x27;ll give it the usual time frame of 4-6 weeks, but I hardly think I&#x27;ll be purchasing another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> AT LEAST THEY USUALLY HAVE AN OCEAN BREEZE</li>
            <li> It is hard to apply as the texture is too hard.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product at least 3 times.</li>
            <li> wife loses like 3 lip balms a month, which is why we have these on subscription.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> least in my case)</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it, I can&#x27;t use anything but Carmex, it&#x27;s the only thing that doesn&#x27;t make me break out in cold sores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lip balm fanatic.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re buying as an add-in its the cheapest on the internet as a package of 4, and I&#x27;m a chapstick fanatic</li>
            <li> A bit slow on delivery.  </li>
            <li> get this stuff if you live somewhere cold like myself, and your lips will thank you!</li>
            <li> one in my pocket, at the bed side, in my car, and usually one shoved in the couch cushion!</li>
            <li> I MEAN,</li>
            <li> , DID YOU MEAN TO GET TWO OF THOSE BURT&#x27;S BEES?</li>
            <li> I purchased the lip balm in the hopes of finding relief for my winter dry lips, instead they now burn like crazy.  </li>
            <li> This brand of lip balm is actually less expensive than the name brand Chapstick.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t taste bad like Carmex and rescues my lips daily.</li>
            <li> I had chapped lips really bad before starting to use this.  </li>
            <li> No good at all.</li>
            <li> (YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT I AM IN THE OLD AND STUPID PHASE)....</li>
            <li> I have notice when using this product it either stops the cold sore completely or dramatically reduces the lifetime of the cold sore.</li>
            <li> you tried it in the past and it did not make an impression, give it another shot, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> My lips burn immediately after applying and it lasts for approximately 20 mins before subsiding.</li>
            <li> Now I am addicted.</li>
            <li> Even my husband is addicted now.</li>
            <li> I might be addicted.</li>
            <li> I was almost instantly addicted and had not been without one or 5 tubes since.</li>
            <li> My husband is addicted to this.</li>
            <li> I find I&#x27;m addicted to lip balms and have been for years.  </li>
            <li> Addicted to this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed it was not clearly advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other brands and they always leave a nasty film on my mouth after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong with Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li> How can you not love Burt&#x27;s Bees?!!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to lip balm!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the company has been purchased by Clorox I believe so who knows what might happen to the products now.</li>
            <li> However I found that I was wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;doesn&#x27;t have a weird fragrance which is a plus for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used to be addicted to Carmex, had it with me every where!</li>
            <li> but boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend is obsessed with these, I like them too.</li>
            <li> The cooling effect of the peppermint is soothing, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with keeping the moisture in with the beeswax.</li>
            <li> Expensive but still cheaper than in stores.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m afraid it may not keep my lips moist.</li>
            <li> Disappointing experience.</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong!  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Burt&#x27;s Bee!</li>
            <li> also very expensive .</li>
            <li> My son is a pilot and the air dries his lips really bad.</li>
            <li> It saved me a trip to the store in bad weather.</li>
            <li> so sometimes my lips get sunburned quite badly and crack and peel.</li>
            <li> Bad stuff for the lips.  </li>
            <li> switched to Kiehls  lip balm #1....no bad reaction</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> I really hate peppermint in my lip balm.</li>
            <li> lips had VERY BAD reaction...painful/red/puffy/white bumps....</li>
            <li> It smells terrible and</li>
            <li> People try to convert me to their disgusting pittfiul attempts at chapstick</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great price and quick shipping</li>
            <li> Strong pepermint smell~</li>
            <li> This is a really good product - keeps lips moisturized and it doesn&#x27;t have to be reapplied&lt;br /&gt;every five minutes! This was a great deal on the price, too.</li>
            <li> Neither the picture nor the description betray it, but this is the version of Burt&#x27;s Bees containing peppermint oil.  Peppermint oil contains menthol, and menthol has a tendency to dry lips, which is not the point of a lip balm.</li>
            <li> very cheap and good product</li>
            <li> Very pleasant dealing,</li>
            <li> I find there lip balm as very dry, which is not my preference.  However, I gifted this to a young man and it is his favorite.  So it comes all down to your preferences.  This does not add any shine to your lips and is very waxy not to my liking.</li>
            <li> A necessary staple for many years.</li>
            <li> Great way to keep your lips healthy. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Great product, good value and price!</li>
            <li> What can I say, I love Burt&#x27;s Bees. This is my go-to for lip balm. This seemed to be a good deal for 4 sticks, so I went for it. Still on stick 1, but it is exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> The only kind of lip balm I will use.  Great deal on Amazon compared to the in-store pricing.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, the only lip balm I do not develop a sensitivity or allergy to.</li>
            <li> Grandson loves this product. Said it. Is. Great.</li>
            <li> Essential for anyone who hikes or walks more than an hour a day -- a pack of four lasts me about eight months -- and this set is a great bargain compared to the onesies next to the impulse register at my local hardware store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wikipedia&#x27;s story of its growth always cheers me up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;1984–89: Founding&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Burt&#x27;s Bees originated in Maine in 1984 as a candle making partnership between Roxanne Quimby and Burt Shavitz. Shavitz had a honey business which provided the excess beeswax needed for the candles and Quimby&#x27;s focus on maintaining high quality helped to grow their business from an initial $200 at the Dover-Foxcroft Junior High School craft fair to $20,000 by the end of their first year. Their first headquarters was an abandoned one-room schoolhouse rented from a friend for $150 a year.[13]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Burt&#x27;s Bees increased production in 1989 after a New York boutique, Zona, ordered hundreds of their beeswax candles. Forty additional employees were hired and an abandoned bowling alley became their new manufacturing location. During this time, Quimby read one of Burt Shavitz&#x27;s 19th-century books about bee-keeping which included home-made personal care recipes and Burt&#x27;s Bees entered into the personal care products industry.[13]&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert C. Ross&lt;br /&gt;April 2015</li>
            <li> I always believed that bees were superior beings but to create such a wonderful product for my luscious lips went beyond my expectations. I shall bow before every bee till the day my bowing skills are no more. Yes, indeed.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it for moisturing your lips.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is great for keeping my lips moist, and (unlike most other similar products) doesn&#x27;t create dependency.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm- we go through a ton every month!</li>
            <li> iam from China. ship to China very nice.</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong with Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lost w/o my burts bees chapstick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the ONLY chapstick I will use on my lips....for about the past 10 years or more.  Everyone who tries it switches and never looks back!</li>
            <li> From the scent to how it makes your lips feel - perfect</li>
            <li> Did not see clearly, with mint, but still happy</li>
            <li> Smells and feels great!</li>
            <li> Big disappointment.  I have stopped believing reviews.  Try Blistex instead.</li>
            <li> These are always good!</li>
            <li> quite cheap,and it is moist</li>
            <li> Definitely better than petroleum products, but I don&#x27;t like that it has peppermint.    The Peppermint leaves our lips feeling extra cool and cold - something I especially don&#x27;t welcome on cold, frigid days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good to meet my expectation. Thank you.</li>
            <li> A bit slow on delivery.  I love Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm!</li>
            <li> Did I get a new formula? I don&#x27;t see how this has 4.5 stars overall. I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s before and Nivea and Carmex, ALL of thsese are better by far than the most recent Burt&#x27;s Bees I received. I don&#x27;t know what changed, but I know it wears off the lips within 30 minutes and the lips are as chap as before you put it on. Even after a few days of reapplying 5-10x a day, my lips still are chapped.  Update : Tried again because I ran out of my other brands. Finally threw it in the trash after it actually made it worse.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Just wish it was cheaper</li>
            <li> Good lip balm but not much better than chapstick. I&#x27;ve usually been happier with Burt&#x27;s Bees products in the past.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the beeswax flavour, it&#x27;s drier than other flavors. Pomegranate oil flavor is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Value for money was good.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable with them, kind of mint, very practical in winter</li>
            <li> great item for the winter months</li>
            <li> Best lip balm EVER! This is all I use! I will never buy blistex or carmex again! Also, I am prone to getting fever blisters when stressed out. I have notice when using this product it either stops the cold sore completely or dramatically reduces the lifetime of the cold sore. Can NOT recommend enough! You will LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> PERFECT STOCKING STUFFER&#x27;S!  Have LONG been a fan of BURT&#x27;S BEE&#x27;S products!!&lt;br /&gt;They work so well!</li>
            <li> Excellent value - best price ever!! Got these on Prime and it was a 4 pack for $7 and change - which is the best price I&#x27;ve ever seen for Burt&#x27;s Bees. Even at Walmart these are $2.99 each and you don&#x27;t save much buying the multi-packs. These are the only lip balm my kids will use and so this was a steal and even better that I found the deal right before Christmas to use as stocking stuffers. They are incredible lip balm - a layer of protection that wears well and doesn&#x27;t need reapplying after 15 minutes or feel addictive as some do with the need to constantly reapply.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite lip balm EVA.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is the best.  Not much else I can say.</li>
            <li> I often use this brand of things is very nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had chapped lips and this was the first product that solved the issue once and for all.  The best way to use it is to apply before sleeping and after meals.</li>
            <li> Love these... I am changing to these over blistex with zero regret.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even remember what brand I used to use.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend will be happy to get this for christmas!</li>
            <li> Great value!  If you buy these individually at the drug store they are almost $3.00 each.  I had to make (15) gift packets and put one of these and a small soap in an organza bag.  Who doesn&#x27;t need a good lip balm for the winter??</li>
            <li> No good at all. Easy to dry out.</li>
            <li> My son always has a tube in his pocket. He swears by this. He came home from college asking if I could pick him up some.  Bought him a few packs instead of one for his stocking this year!</li>
            <li> Our daughter-in-law is a lip balm addict.  She loves these Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm.  For Christmas, we purchased some for her last year, this year, and probably will purchase some in the future.  Come to think of it, I like and use these myself.</li>
            <li> How can you not love Burt&#x27;s Bees?!!!!</li>
            <li> Constantly losing my chapstick so I&#x27;m happy this came in a 4 pack. If you&#x27;ve never used Burt&#x27;s Bees you&#x27;ve been living under a rock. Minty and amazing. Perfect for winter.</li>
            <li> Always great. We&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm for maybe 30 years? Anyway.... YES.</li>
            <li> These Lip balms are the best and got&#x27;em cheap on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Bert&#x27;s  Bees wax rocks !!  I ALWAYS have a tube with me. THE best lip balm for your lips</li>
            <li> I use these year round and i like that i now have an inexpensive option to stock up. I&#x27;ve purchased this product at least 3 times.</li>
            <li> Excellent lip balm, especially a good one for the fellows.  It has a nice crisp pepperminty scent and it does a great job of keeping lips moisturized without that &amp;#34;lip gloss&amp;#34; look that men do not want.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> 1. It is expensive.&lt;br /&gt;2. It does not heal chapped lips, in fact it makes it even drier.&lt;br /&gt;3. The mint scent is really strong&lt;br /&gt;If you live in a cold country with severe winter, Burt&#x27;s bees will not help at all. Try different product.</li>
            <li> Best chap stick i have ever bought.</li>
            <li> The only balm we use in this house. My son is a pilot and the air dries his lips really bad. Bert&#x27; s Bee works.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm.&lt;br /&gt;My wife loses like 3 lip balms a month, which is why we have these on subscription.&lt;br /&gt;They work great on the lips and don&#x27;t feel overly oily, nor leave our lips more chapped than when we began.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is the only one I use. It definitely moisturizes my lips without being too strong or addictive like carmex. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> good !very good !ilove it</li>
            <li> it is good for lip,but feel cold.</li>
            <li> Great and speedy delivery</li>
            <li> good for the lips, tastes yummy.  even the dog likes it.</li>
            <li> Great lip balm!  Helps keep my lips moist and unchapped during the winter months.</li>
            <li> My favorite lip balm of all time! Recieved it on time. Thank you</li>
            <li> I tried this a few years ago and was not that all impressed. Gave it another shot recently and its doing wonders for me. I keep this and my caramex around and go back and forth. The original is great in my book. I have bought several and keep one in the car, in the office, one in my messenger bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you tried it in the past and it did not make an impression, give it another shot, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Please do not buy. My lips burn immediately after applying and it lasts for approximately 20 mins before subsiding. After the burn, comes the indefinite dry lips feeling..&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and invest in a better product.</li>
            <li> Have become a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products for skin and facial care.  Good price, the products work, and not spending a fortune on &amp;#34;prestidge&amp;#34; products.  These all work just as well or better.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff although I often wonder if I am overpaying.</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery. The production is awesome.</li>
            <li> This is the only type of lip balm to use.</li>
            <li> Bees are amazing creatures!  I feel great using this natural product to keep my lips healthy.  I have even used it on my hands, in a pinch, when I don&#x27;t have access to lotion (like on the ski slopes)!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I previously owned a medicated Blistex chapstick and the difference is astonishing; this product wins hands down. The ingredients in this product are healthy for your lips and don&#x27;t have anything harmful, the peppermint tastes and smells great (at least i&#x27;m satisfied with it), the product doesn&#x27;t give much shine and doesn&#x27;t have a waxy feel, or make you feel like you just put jelly on your lips, it actually absorbs very well and keeps your lips very soft.</li>
            <li> My favorite of the varieties I&#x27;ve tried. I use it under lipstick--it works quite well to restrain bleeding. I keep one in 5 locations so that I always have one at hand.</li>
            <li> Feels cool on my lip, but a little dyier than the typical ones, such as l&#x27;oreal&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Seems a little thick on the lips for me, but it works as expected.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> A little greasy for me.</li>
            <li> As someone who has never really used lap balm (on a daily basis) and has suffered chapped lips during the winter, I can say that I am now a daily user of Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm. I bought the peppermint pack from a CVS two or three months ago and do plan on buying more when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cool sensation from the peppermint oil is refreshing and just feels great on your lips. After using this at least three times a day for the last two months or so, I haven&#x27;t been close to encountering chapped lips - something that usually happened every other week in the winter (prior to using Burt&#x27;s Bees). An individual stick has tremendous value, as I&#x27;m still on my first stick of lip balm and have another three to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike past lip balms that I have used, Burt&#x27;s Bees does not have a greasy, gross effect. Even after accidentally licking my lips is there no disgusting taste, which was common among past lip balms. This balm has a neutral taste to it and still smells great. Overall, this lip balm is amazing and I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very pleased &amp; thanks so much for the prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t beat Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm.  The peppermint extract smells great and the fact that it&#x27;s wax means you can enjoy any sort of beverage without washing it away.  I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> very good,i like them</li>
            <li> Winter prevent chapped lips</li>
            <li> i never get anything but burts bees</li>
            <li> my fav lip balm.  it is the only one I use now.</li>
            <li> Hands down the only lip balm I use. I am a convert from chapstick and other lip products (including coconut oil). These keep my lips moisturized, there is no irritation for me, my husband or my kids. We keep these on stock in our house during the hot summers and cold dry winters. This pack is also a great deal at the price.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seem to go back to any other chapstick after using Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s. Definitely one of the best on the market.</li>
            <li> Do I really have to say anything about this? Anyone who uses Burt&#x27;s Bees knows how great it is</li>
            <li> I love this natural lip balm--I keep them in my car, wallet, bathrooms, and nightstand so it&#x27;s always easy to find.</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite lip balm/chapstick. No one will ever convince me otherwise. A perfect blend of smoothness and freshness. If you&#x27;re buying as an add-in its the cheapest on the internet as a package of 4. If you love it--buy it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if Burt&#x27;s Bees reformulated their product, but this lip balm now causes a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> This is the only lip balm I use. Great preventative and restorative.</li>
            <li> Use Bert&#x27;s Bees exclusively, due to their all natural products. I carry lip balm with me everywhere.</li>
            <li> always lives up to expectations</li>
            <li> One tube lasts me for many months, but I had to buy multi pack because my daughters always take mine... :)  LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I will always use burt&#x27;s bees and extremely happy to find it in a 4 pack. Most places charge $7-8 for a 2 pack of this.</li>
            <li> not oil, seems tender and mild, very good</li>
            <li> This is my first time in USA Amazon shopping, although things are very cheap, but very good, I like it very much</li>
            <li> This is the only lip balm I will EVER use. It is long lasting and extremely effective but also is all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain any irritants. Other lip balms tend to dry out my lips even more over time or irritate my lips. This is very gentle and soothes my lips immediately. I won&#x27;t be anywhere without it so I buy it in bulk. Its very good value here and much more cost effective than buying one at a time at a checkout line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time Burt&#x27;s Bees user. The balm is heavy, but not sticky on your lips and stays on for longer than a regular chapstick. The beeswax gives your lips a protective coating for outdoor winter fun and moisturizes in the drier air. In summer the balm keeps your lips soft and protected.</li>
            <li> For my mother.She loved it</li>
            <li> my fav -- been using for years. all natural product</li>
            <li> This remains the best lip balm around!  I haven&#x27;t found any others to beat it with my dry lips!  I highly recommend this, such a good deal on amazon.</li>
            <li> Kids loved them in their stockings. Only bought 2 sets because of the price.  If the price were lower I would have bought a set for each of the 9 stockings!</li>
            <li> Amazing...world&#x27;s best lip balm soothes lips and love cooling sensation when applied</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love about burts bees? I keep one of these in every single living space that I occupy at a given moment!</li>
            <li> Bought to offer so have no idea of quality I believe good as ordered from relative</li>
            <li> Hydrating and the tingling sensation is addictive!  We get these through Subscribe and Save every 6 months.</li>
            <li> This is a steal! 4 pieces in one set,is cheaper than purchasing these separately. Saved me some amount! By the way, I love these lip balms, keeps my lips really soft all throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Great price and nice to have extras around.</li>
            <li> Good quality lip balm</li>
            <li> My wife loves Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm, so we buy it occasionally to make sure she doesn&#x27;t run out. It&#x27;s got a refreshing minty flavor and keeps lips soft. We live in a dry climate, so lip balm is important to us.</li>
            <li> Will never use another lip balm!</li>
            <li> Burts bees is the best! makes your lips feel great. This mega pack was a steal. theyre usually $3.5 in the store for 1, so I could not resist this offer</li>
            <li> Feels cool when applying, and smells great!</li>
            <li> Best chapstick of all time. Not greasy, doesn&#x27;t have any weird taste, and I love the minty-ness. Most perfect chapstick ever.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this lip balm. We haven&#x27;t ordered it off here, yet, but we will be as he goes through it so quickly! He applies it probably 8-10 times a day and loves how it leaves his lips feeling. He really likes the peppermint scent.</li>
            <li> My fav &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; or type, what have you.  Works great on summer days to protect and heal lips.</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST Chapstick</li>
            <li> Product came as described and in timely manner.</li>
            <li> Best chapstick in the world!</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s products.  Now you can get them on Amazon Pantry! Smart....very smart.</li>
            <li> I bought this because, I constantly get split lip on my lower lip, every year, whether, it is to hot or to cold. I was using the traditional lip balm from the supermarket, which contains alcohol and from what I read it just dries the lips out more and requires application after application with no end in sight.  My family and some articles I read online stated that anything, that does not have natural ingrediants would not work.  After recieving this and using it for, a, week straight, NO MORE SPLIT LIP!  Healed, gone and done.  Highly recommended, if you have split lip or related itssues with your lips or just to keep them hydrated, definte A+ buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many other kinds of natural, cruelty-free lip balm (even other kinds of Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27;), and tossed them all in the trash except for this one.  It goes on SMOOTH, it&#x27;s not shiny (husband doesn&#x27;t want shiny lips. . . go figure) but it&#x27;s so effective!  I do wish it came wthout the peppermint - if I apply this stuff right before drinking a good glass of wine, the peppermint flavor gets in the way.  Very economical multi-pack.</li>
            <li> Much better then chap stick.</li>
            <li> this is my first time that I buy something in Amazon.com, the lip balm is useful</li>
            <li> Great stuff lips are so soft!</li>
            <li> I like how this leaves my lips feeling, I don&#x27;t like the other brands of lip balm. Something about beeswax just feels better on my lips, plus the addition of lanolin really helps too.</li>
            <li> Other than the Natural Ice brand lip balm, this is the only lip balm that I have no allergy reaction. It has a nice feel and smells good, too.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love Burt&#x27;s Bees at a great price? Dr. Oz says to use lip balm with bees wax in it. Don&#x27;t know of a competitor out there.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm. I like the peppermint minty feel and taste of it and I greatly appreciate the all natural ingredients.  It can be hard to find for a decent price online so I appreciated the low price of the four pack.</li>
            <li> Just love it. Undoubtedly good product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go anywhere without one of these in my pocket.</li>
            <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bee products. Put it on when im going to sleep and when i wake up my lips are perfect.</li>
            <li> Purchased for friend, he seems happy with them.</li>
            <li> Necessities! I love it!</li>
            <li> My whole family uses this because it actually works to heal and prevent chapped lips. The scent is great and also works to ease congestion.</li>
            <li> Bee&#x27;s wax is one of the most highly effective, moisture-locking, ingredients (natural or chemical) available. The fact that bee&#x27;s wax is the primary protectant in Burt&#x27;s is fantastic. Reading the lablel, it&#x27;s good to be able to identify every additional ingredient, as well. The peppermint creates a light tingling feeling. No plumping action, but it sure feels good. Vitamin E is another one of the best treatments for lip health and moisture protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that there isn&#x27;t a spf of 15. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s due to the natural ingredient nature of the product, but it would make for a perfect lip balm if added.</li>
            <li> Always have. Always will. Four pack? Yes, please! I keep one in the office, one near my bed, one in my camera bag and one in the bathroom. I&#x27;m never without my BB balm. [PS: it soothes small burns, insect bites and inhaling the peppermint aroma is good for headaches. You&#x27;re welcome!]</li>
            <li> For years, Burt&#x27;s Bees is the only lip balm I will purchase. I buy the 4 packs to save money. Gotta love it!</li>
            <li> I buy these sets of four-packs every couple months. It is cheaper than buying each individually in the store. Burt&#x27;s Bees is a good chapstick for those who are addicted to chapstick but don&#x27;t want to keep using the brands that actively dry out their lips and got them hooked in the first place.</li>
            <li> Huge fan, love this product line</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! So glad I can buy a four pack at this price. It goes everywhere with me.</li>
            <li> Love this lip gloss. Smells good too. Does a great job of keeping my lips soft.</li>
            <li> Just  a quick note to point out that this is NOT the original formula. It also contains aloe &amp; peppermint. It is written on the tube in teeny, tiny print. That may be good for some folks, but I find it to be Drier and the peppermint irritates my lips. I hope this is helpful?</li>
            <li> This is so much better than Chapstick. Swiped some before bed and now my lips don&#x27;t looked like cracked earth. Felt so soft and pain free (try smiling really hard with dry winter lips). Can you believe my lips were like a skin sheding it&#x27;s skin?  Heck, I even used this lip balm on the freeze burn on the back of my palm and that helped heal it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now instead of my girlfriend complaining about my cracked lips she now complains about other things about me. So I stopped seeing her and now get to spend more time with this wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Burt&#x27;s Bees Wax!</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite lip balm on the face of the earth. It&#x27;s long lasting without being too greasy, and it smells &amp; feels heavenly because of the peppermint oil. It completely spoiled me for other lip balms. This will be the only one I buy from now on.</li>
            <li> Ok, ok, so Frank Burn&#x27;s did&#x27;nt have any lips to use this on anyways.  This is my favorite lip thearopy of choice.  My kids did not care for it when they were younger complaining the mint burned thier lips.  So take that for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to lip balm! This is one of my favorites! Great deal. I love that the company is eco-friendly. I buy a lot from them because they are eco-friendly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why anyone would add peppermint or menthol to any lip balm.  Those ingredients dry out your lips and actually hurt.  I purchased the lip balm in the hopes of finding relief for my winter dry lips, instead they now burn like crazy.  I also purchased the lip shimmer and the same thing happened.  Part of it is my fault because I did not see the peppermint listed on the package.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, my sister loved them. Arrived safe and sound (and early :D)</li>
            <li> This is the only lip balm I use.  Unlike other lip products, it does not force you to reapply it constantly.</li>
            <li> I love this chopsticks my lips are no longer chomps and it feels great on the lips</li>
            <li> works better than any other lip balm I&#x27;ve tried, would recommend it to anyone who uses similar product, would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Great deal and great product.  Specifically the Vita E and Peppermint version seems to work best for my lips compared to others.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found these. I started using these with my chapped lips and it softens and moisturizes my lips. These are highly recommended! :)</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees is THE BEST chapstick in the world! Thank you so much, Burts Bees!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really very moisturized...</li>
            <li> I used to have issues every winter with my lips drying out, cracking, and even bleeding. One winter when I still working in a hospital, I had to run down to the gift shop and this was the only brand they had at the time. My lips were almost back to normal within just 2 or 3 days of using it often. It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve used since then,and haven&#x27;t had that issue anymore. I keep several tubes handy as back up just in case I lose one.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s bees products. This is an instant buy for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get the stick back to its original position after using it.</li>
            <li> Dry formula, burns a bit. I&#x27;m not sure why peppermint would be added, especially at such a large quantity.</li>
            <li> Love the simple, pure and effective ingredients that go into this balm. I make a lot of my own care products, but Burt&#x27;s does such a good job with this product at an affordable cost, I purchase Burt&#x27;s instead. I buy a four pack, give one to my partner, keep one in my purse, one at the office and one in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s bees is a great product and brand I love all their products they feel good and smell fantastic. Absolutely nothing is wrong with this product or brand. Very good Chapstick! I put this on my face when skiing to help with wind burn you don&#x27;t need a lot and it works fantastically. I also use it for chapped lips, works perfectly. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great value for the money, simply the best quality ever and I have tried many. This holds its shape well and has never melted into a mass even when I leave in a warm vehicle. It gets soft but nothing gushy.</li>
            <li> The best quality about this product is that there are no offensive chemical byproducts and preservatives.&lt;br /&gt;There is no after taste when this product is needed on a windy bike ride or frigid energizing cross country skiing runs.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> im always tempted to eat one of these things. They are great for my lips.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well, and it tastes nice.</li>
            <li> Great deal. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I like the actual lip gloss very much, but you will want to read the seller&#x27;s note and make sure you understand that they are shipping these glosses loose, not packaged in a little box all together.  If you are going to use them yourself, that is probably just fine.  If you want to give it as a gift, you might prefer the glosses packaged in a Burt&#x27;s box.  The glosses arrived in good time and good condition.  It saved me a trip to the store in bad weather.</li>
            <li> Started using these in college years ago. Now I am addicted. Honestly cannot live without them. The only comparable product I have found that works a similar level is the Carmex moisturizing lip balm. But now that I can buy a 4-pack of Burt&#x27;s on here doubt I will ever go back.</li>
            <li> The effectiveness of this lip balm depends on the source of the dry lips.  I am currently on Accutane which causes dry lips from the inside. I used this product religiously for a couple months while on the drug and found it to be very ineffective at penetrating compared to the Eucerin/Aquaphor Lip Balm, which is a shame because this lip balm is natural beeswax. I have used this product in the past too and noticed it was effective in the winter months at keeping the moisture in, on those biting cold windy days, though I didn&#x27;t feel it actually moisturized. As for the using it in the summer, it worked alright to prevent your lips getting dried out, but it does not have SPF. Oh, and I wouldn&#x27;t put this on if you plan to go out on a date. My partner does not like it at all compared to some alternatives I have used.</li>
            <li> it is used very comfortable</li>
            <li> Good deal! I love that these do not contain petroleum jelly (a carcinogen). They also work to keep my lips smooth.</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; Chapstick every time.</li>
            <li> This is some of the best chap stick I have ever used in my entire life. I was sold on this lip balm the very first time I used it. This brand of lip balm is actually less expensive than the name brand Chapstick. Not only is it less expensive but I think that Burt’s bees works way better than Chapstick. Burt’s bees lip balm is special because its special formula creates a tingling sensation when you apply it to your lips. This tingling sensation is the Burt’s bees formula trying to repair chapped lips. Burt’s bees is different than any other type of lip balm I have ever used. It doesn’t just coat your lips with a sticky mess it actually tries to heal and moisturize your dried, chapped lips. I have tubes of all different kinds of Burt’s bees in my car, bathroom, bedroom, in my purse, and even in my pencil pouch for school. You can take it anywhere. I love this lip balm so much!</li>
            <li> LOVE BURT&#x27;S BEES!  Great that it is a little cheaper in a multipack!</li>
            <li> Excellent protection year round for the lips but especially beneficial in the winter time&#x27;s cold and windy weather. Try it. You to will love it.</li>
            <li> I cannot get enough of this lip balm. I have been using it for a decade and try to buy it in bulk whenever possible. Even my husband is addicted now. He steals my Bees Balm all the time, but then I usually have a stockpile so I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Very effective lip balm.  Works better then chapstick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought eight of these balms, and when I get to the near end of one (about an eighth left), when you open the cap, it will fall out onto the floor. It did this for every one I bought. Even if you know it is going to come off, it is sill hard to stop it from going in potentially any direction -- on the ground.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product at all. I wish I never bought it. It smells terrible and when I first used it, I felt like I was cold all over but my lips were burning. I will not recommend this product. Only the smell of it enough not to order this product. I am very dissapointed and will never buy it again!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm on the market.  Here in dry Colorado, chapstick is a MUST pretty much all year and this stuff does the trick naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YAY for Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
            <li> Best chapstick, best price.</li>
            <li> All natural for something you put on your lips all the time--gee . . . why would you use anything else?  The only thing is that the peppermint can irritate some people, so it would be nice to have a completely scent-free version, or a natural ingredient that provides scent and whatnot but which is not a mint.</li>
            <li> Burts has been around for a while and has always produced a quality product. Unfortunately the company has been purchased by Clorox I believe so who knows what might happen to the products now. This four pack had four flavors which was a nice change from the typical mint I&#x27;m used too. However, by the end of them all I decided that mint is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;my only gripe is that it has no UV protection so sometimes my lips get sunburned quite badly and crack and peel.</li>
            <li> Love this product, we use no others!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, best lip balm on market.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My lips get dry if I don&#x27;t keep something on them and this stuff is the best. It doesn&#x27;t feel waxy like Chapstick and it isn&#x27;t too thin like some of the more Vaseline-type lip products.</li>
            <li> Feel&#x27;s nice so far very go the peppermint one makes me feel as if I just sprayed my mouth nice cool feeling so far so good :)</li>
            <li> Living in the desert, coupled with the fact that as I&#x27;ve aged my dry lips have gotten even drier and I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees for many years. I have tried other options here and there but I got back to Burt&#x27;s because this 100% Natural Lip Balm moisturizes, heals and protects my lips very well. I like the peppermint oil because it soothes and feels refreshing. The featured ingredient is Beeswax, which Burt says is \\&quot;another treat from our friends the bees, Beeswax is a natural skin conditioner when used in moisturizing formulas.\\&quot; This 4-pack for the Add-On price of $8.94 is a really good deal too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: cera alba (beeswax, cire d&#x27;abeille), cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, mentha piperita (peppermint) oil, lanolin, tocopherolrosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, glycine soja (soybean) oil, canola oil (huile de colza), limonene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read more at [...]</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product because of the brand&#x27;s reputation and I was most certainly not disappointed. Lasts long and does not transfer to anything else. This product is well worth the money spent and I would recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> Great product that keeps my lips moist.</li>
            <li> We really like this chapstick; it feels more beneficial to overall health than chapsticks based in other ingredients. Has a great smell, and taste, too.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s pricey, I haven&#x27;t found any product that relieves my chapped lips as well as this. The peppermint oil soothes immediately and it doesn&#x27;t take long for the dryness to go away.</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado and my lips would fall off without my Burt&#x27;s. This lip balm is the best I have ever used. I like all the flavors, but the original is my favorite for sure.</li>
            <li> Feels strongly pepperminty.&lt;br /&gt;The more I use it, the more dry my lips get.  I am able to keep my lips more moist by NOT using it for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the other types are moisturizing; this is not.</li>
            <li> Perfect service and product.</li>
            <li> No yucky oils in it. Only natural products in this item. No yucky smells either. Four pack nice so when kids steal mine I have extras.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm. Of course i&#x27;m going to give it 5 stars! ...and the price is just right! I used to buy them in singles for $3 or more each in any regular store. I finally thought to look them up on Amazon and there they are! : )</li>
            <li> 10,000,000 X better than chapstick.</li>
            <li> Our family loves this lip balm. It works good, stay on, smells good, and keeps your lips from being chapped.... This 4 pk. was a way better deal cost wise.....</li>
            <li> I bought this to have a chapstick in my purse, car, bedside table. This is a great price for 4 chapsticks. The smell is fantastic and minty. The only thing I don&#x27;t like so much about burts chapstick is its a little too waxy. It works fine its just a little too hard of a consistency.</li>
            <li> I love buying this in bulk</li>
            <li> As a flute, piccolo, and saxophone player I constantly have dry cracked lips. This lip balm works within one hour of putting it on.vit smells great and I never get chapped lips when Im using it.</li>
            <li> Nothing but Burt&#x27;s Bees for me.  Does not contain paraffin.  Bad stuff for the lips.  I carry Burt&#x27;s Bees in my pockets and purses all the time.  If I don&#x27;t have a tube I have to go buy one.  This assures me of NEVER running out.</li>
            <li> As far as lip balm goes, this is just okay. I end up having to apply it more often than I do Blistex or Chapstick. Not sure why. Flavor/scent is nice however.</li>
            <li> There is NOTHING better than Burt&#x27;s Bees. That is all you need to know. Nothing compares! Your lips will thank you.</li>
            <li> Best lip balm I have found, use it all the time!</li>
            <li> Always quality to our care</li>
            <li> I like this lip balm quite a lot. It&#x27;s thick and stays put for a decent amount of time and has a yummy slightly tingly sensation to it.  Since my first baby was born a few months ago, I&#x27;ve noticed both my skin and lips get dried out quickly. I like to keep some of this lip balm on hand and it helps soothe my itchy dry lips.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for this product at all.  It is way too dry. My husband didn&#x27;t care for it either.</li>
            <li> I love the softness that it adds to my lips. I use it all day and only apply it once. I recommend this to anyone that gets dry lips.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize they have a peppermint flavor that causes a little tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> The only lip balm I&#x27;ll use anymore- keeps my lips soft, heals already chapped lips!</li>
            <li> Lovely natural product with great results!&lt;br /&gt;Buy this for all your purses and in the car... Men can use it as well!&lt;br /&gt;Mariette&#x27;s Back to Basics</li>
            <li> THE BEST lip balm no matter what the cost-none better, period. And that my friend, you can take to the bank-</li>
            <li> In my humble opinion there is no better lip balm than Burt&#x27;s.  I buy this every time and can&#x27;t see that changing any time soon.</li>
            <li> Bees sure know what they are doing when it comes to lip protection. Not only does beeswax provide a home for larvae, but it goes on smooth right out of the tube! Just one of those little miracles of nature I guess.</li>
            <li> The best lip balm available, anywhere! Moisture holds for long periods of time! Unlike other lip balms, there are natural ingredients that allow for a better texture and smoother application. Natural products association certified! Don&#x27;t buy anything else! This product is NOT tested on animals!</li>
            <li> For YEARS I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a product that would deal with my &#x27;painfully&#x27; dry lips, my search is now over.  Usually while using a new lip treatment I give it weeks to effect change, with Burt&#x27;s my lips were hydrated in 24 hours.  Of course I&#x27;ll give it the usual time frame of 4-6 weeks, but I hardly think I&#x27;ll be purchasing another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first it felt odd, it was too light, too dry, please, don&#x27;t be deceived, it is the best moisturizing lip balm I&#x27;ve EVER used.  I haven&#x27;t seen or felt my lips so clear and soft in two decades.  Before using this my lips burned from extreme dryness and were discolored from it, just like that, overnight they were renewed again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again will I use Vaseline or petroleum based chapsticks, they are now all in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm, Beeswax, I&#x27;m a fan for life!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what to say about this. I am a man so my lips are not the features i focus on but I do like the sensation when I apply it on and they last for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels good on your lips, not overly slick or overly sticky, and lasts a long time. LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I love the regular formula but these fruity flavored lip balms stink and taste bad, and they don&#x27;t stay on my lips like the the basic formula. They were out of the standard formula, so I bought a set of these super fruit, and I can&#x27;t use them. They don&#x27;t work well and the scent/taste is repugnant.</li>
            <li> been using these for years.  Good value.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if this is a good or bad lip balm for the general public, but I do know it was BAD for me. I used it daily for about two weeks and noticed that the corners of my mouth were getting red and my lips were slightly swelling.  I actually did not associate the problem with Burt&#x27;s Bees right away and applied more. Then it became clear I was having a slow building allergic reaction. I stopped use entirely and the swelling went away within 1 day, the redness faded (slowly) over one week and is now gone.</li>
            <li> Item as described. No problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not found a brand of lip balm that offers the initial zing of mint like found in these Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm sticks (and I&#x27;ve looked and experimented with other brands). I couldn&#x27;t say whether the balm lasts as long as other brands at this price as it seems to last as long as I&#x27;d expect, especially in dry climates or in the colder Winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down-side to these is that they are often a bit more expensive that similar products ... but only a little more and the zing to me is worth it. :)</li>
            <li> Best Lip product. Classic peppermint.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I orderd these for our daughter. She loves the 4 pack. Great price too. Great lip balm. She highly reccomends this to others.</li>
            <li> Last a long time and is very soothing. I have tried just all the lip balms out there and nothing work for me like this.</li>
            <li> I have used this product faithfully for years, but it seems as if it has changed...?  The balm is harder on all the tubes I received, and therefore does not spread easily on my lips.</li>
            <li> Seriously, if anyone needs convincing that Burt&#x27;s Bees is the best lip balm ever, just try it for yourself!</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees are the best lip balms!</li>
            <li> Great product, I never knew how much better Lip Balm could be as I usually order products when I see them go on sale (specifically the Nivea line) and these just feel so much better and last quite a while too. Got a 4 pack for around $5-6 so it was a great deal.</li>
            <li> Best on the market by far</li>
            <li> we switched to burt bee and find it significantly more better than chapstick. its lasts longer on lips,  soothes better than chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;a bit pricier but then you don&#x27;t have it apply it as much.</li>
            <li> Like it better than Chapstick, it soothes dried out  lips and lasts a lot longer. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without this stuff.  Started buying in bulk because I keep one in my pocket, one in my backpack, and one in my car.  Don&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
            <li> I always buy Burt&#x27;s products. They seem to work best for me. I am no expert, but it seems Burt&#x27;s uses nothing but high quality ingredients giving me great results.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s Christmas sock gets one, purse, bedside table, office drawer.  Sent to sons college roommates too.  Works great for everyone.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm.  It&#x27;s thick and waxy, so it seals in moisture for dry lips.  It&#x27;s smooth enough that you can apply it under lipstick or lip gloss without creating a mess on your lips.  It also doesn&#x27;t feel like a thick layer of gunk or come off like some other brands (e.g. Chapstick).</li>
            <li> I think this lib balm is the best.  I have a problem with dryness of my lips.  I&#x27;ve tried many lip balms and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> We love this stuff! I am very sensitive about my lip balm--sometimes the smell/fumes make me cough, the formula is often too thin,it doesn&#x27;t moisturize my lips, etc. This is the only stuff that passes my test! It moisturizes deeply without just sitting on the surface of the skin. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent or flavor and is the perfect basic lip balm.</li>
            <li> Arrived as advertised and nice to have backups</li>
            <li> We have always used this lip balm because we have always had better results.</li>
            <li> Nice peppermint flavor.  Not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm. The texture is smooth and light but it stays on your lips for an extended amount of time. It does a great job of keeping my lips from getting chapped. I had been using a brand of lip balm for years and can no longer find it. I tried many of the brands out there as I need to keep something on my lips most of the time due to allergies. After months of no luck, I tried this and was happy I did as this is the one for me. I hope this will stay on the market! This formula is light but effective. It does not have a flavor/taste which I really appreciate too. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love BB, it&#x27;s the only product that has worked best for me. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other brands and they always leave a nasty film on my mouth after a few hours. BB keeps my lips smooth and healthy!</li>
            <li> only lip balm that works on me</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff!  Gave it to several relatives for Christmas gift add-ons.  Will order this again-also like the one with lip color in it.  Gave it to my Daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> My daughter thinks this is the best chapstick for winter.She has several types, but this is her favorite and she can never have enough for her purse, her school bag, her room, etc.</li>
            <li> I switched from Carmex after years of use to Burt&#x27;s Bees and found that I have to use lip balm much less that I used to...seemed the more Carmex you used the more you had to use all day long, now I may only need the lip balm from Burt&#x27;s Bees once a day or every couple of days. It has a refreshing peppermint feel on your lips and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> These came packaged as I&#x27;ve seen them in the stores, a good price.</li>
            <li> My husband and I could write a poem about this stuff - this is how much we love it!  It feels great and we love the peppermint.  I&#x27;ve applied this before bedtime when my lips felt chapped and in the morning, my lips are soothed and feel normal again.  This stuff works and feels so great; it&#x27;s addictive!  I literally freak out when I&#x27;ve forgotten to throw one in my purse and I always have to have a box of these on standby.</li>
            <li> my favorite of all time and nice to get bulk and discount</li>
            <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bee products.  Way to go Burt!</li>
            <li> Only lip balm I use now.  Really works and keeps your lips from peeling.  I live in Arizona and the weather is harsh (low humidity and blazing sun).  I have used several brands but Bur&#x27;s Bees seems to be the only one that keeps my lips from peeling.  My spouse has just begun to use it and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in his lips too.  Both of us have softer feeling lips.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm is my favorite chapstick. I love the 4 packs because I use it all year round. Peppermint is my go to flavor. I love the tingly feeling it leaves.</li>
            <li> Moisturizers, it is very good. the price is low and the effect is good.</li>
            <li> good product and nice price</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I don&#x27;t like the other chap lips stuff, plus this has many more uses, so I like they came in a four pack, so I can keep them a couple in my bug out bag, and keep one in my EDC,</li>
            <li> I love Burts Bees wax items but the best has to be this lip balm. It always feels great going on and leaves my lips moist and fresh feeling!</li>
            <li> Great - didn&#x27;t come in the cardboard box but I didn&#x27;t mind. Four sealed Burt&#x27;s Bees chapsticks delivered to my apartment.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t taste bad like Carmex and rescues my lips daily. On Subscribe and Save it&#x27;s a better price than I&#x27;ve seen in any drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish their tinted stuff was just like it. And that they had a lavender something or another.</li>
            <li> We give each of our kids and their spouses these for Christmas.  Glad to find them at such a great price.</li>
            <li> With Subscribe &amp; Save, these are less than $2 a tube.  I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s for over 15 years, and that&#x27;s less than the cost when I bought my first tube.  Can&#x27;t beat this.</li>
            <li> I have a tube of this shoved everywhere: one in my pocket, at the bed side, in my car, and usually one shoved in the couch cushion!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. I got the peppermint flavor. Instant change in the texture of my lips. Much softer within days. And it smells great! Great investment.</li>
            <li> Good price for the best lip  balm on the market.</li>
            <li> Love all Burt&#x27;s bees products. They all work so well</li>
            <li> It burns after put is on for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love love this product :)</li>
            <li> Works fine with my lips.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the online price. I believe I bought this for just over $7, which is a steal given that the individual sticks sell for around $2.47 at the store, if not more!</li>
            <li> Part of the gift bags for a honey bee themed bridal shower.  Just perfect.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s bees is my life</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Best lip balm for men ever- nice and minty / cooling.</li>
            <li> This is the only lip balm I use...best ever.  I buy it in bulk...keep it in several places throughout my house, in my purse, in the car.  I can&#x27;t be without it.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is our families favorite Lip Balm.  We are always running out.</li>
            <li> Favorite Chapstick, has a wonderful smell. Very helpful with chapped lips. Glad to get them shipped right to my door and save a few dollars with subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> love the tingly feeling...LOL</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love this stuff.</li>
            <li> burts bees lip balm is the only one that I use.  it goes on smoothly, feels great and seems to stay for much longer than other brands.</li>
            <li> This was a shock at first.  When applied you get a tingling sensation on your lips.  It does protect your lips and helps tremendously with dry lips. We&#x27;re having an extremely cold and snowy winter so far (2014).  Happy I ordered this product.</li>
            <li> So worth it.  These do wonders keeping your lips nice and smooth.  I will continue to buy from here. I saw at a store they were charging 5.00 for one tub.&lt;br /&gt;These are to good to turn away.</li>
            <li> Burt’s Bees original Beeswax lip balm is the best out there, I always have a tube of it on me especially during these cold winter months. The four pack is also a great deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this lip balm becauce it&#x27;s the most famous product of Burt&#x27;s Bees. The first time I use the balm is not very sticky so I&#x27;m afraid it may not keep my lips moist. However I found that I was wrong. This stick  make my lips not only moist,but bright and glossy.&lt;br /&gt;Previously my lips&#x27; color is very dark,now it becomes the light pink. How miraculous!</li>
            <li> The most terrible lip balm I ever had. It makes lips even drier.</li>
            <li> A little cool and refreshing, the effect is good,</li>
            <li> A stocking stuffer that the entire family uses.&lt;br /&gt;We have been using these for years, they work well for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;We will buy more.</li>
            <li> Good! Will replace order later.</li>
            <li> I always end up having chapped lips as soon as the temperature drops or we start using the heater, Chap Stick moisturizer hardly works for me, Burts Bees lip balm was the first balm that stayed on for more than 2-3 hours and actually gave me some relief from the chapped lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend the four pack, saves some $ and for me I leave one in the car and one at my work table, so its helpful</li>
            <li> great deal! these cost $5.50 each in new york city</li>
            <li> product does exactly what you&#x27;d expect.&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t have a weird fragrance which is a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;couldn&#x27;t ask for more from a lip balm.</li>
            <li> This is the best Bee&#x27;s lip balm ever. My bee&#x27;s lips were always chapped until I started using this product on there lips now no chapped bee&#x27;s lips. The tube is a little bigger then it needs to be since a bee&#x27;s lips are so small but the buzz in the bee world is it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s there to say that hasn&#x27;t been said? This is the most amazing chapstick ever made. I am a total addict.</li>
            <li> I love burt&#x27;s bees. Only lip balm I&#x27;ll use, and I prefer the mintier flavor to the commonly found and more girly fruit flavored lip balms.</li>
            <li> I CAN SEE WHY THIS IS AN AMAZON BEST SELLER...4 OF BURT&#x27;S BEE&#x27;S LIP HYDRATING TUBES PLUS OFFERS OF ASSORTED FLAVORS. I GOT MY 4 PACKS AT THE LOCAL PHARMACY, NOT REALIZING THAT AMAZON HAD THESE (WHAT WAS I THINKING?)

SO WHEN MY DAUGHTER CAME UP FOR A VISIT, I TOOK HER FOR A LITTLE OUTSIDE SHOPPING AT THE LOCAL PHARMACY, KNOWING THAT THEY HAD A BURTS BEES 4 PACK AT A GREAT PRICE. WHAT A FUNNY PAIR WE WERE THAT DAY. I WANTED TO SURPRISE HER WITH THE PURCHASE. (I HAD GOTTEN HER A &amp;#34;TON&amp;#34; OF CLOTHES FROM AMAZON), SO THIS WAS AN OUTSIDE SURPRISE PURCHASE. SHE STARTED DOWN THE HAIR AISLE AND I WENT DOWN THE COSMETICS AISLE, WHERE I GOT TWO OF THESE...ONE FOR EACH OF US. WE MET UP AT THE PHARMACY. SHE IS A NOSEY LITTLE THING (YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT I AM IN THE OLD AND STUPID PHASE)....&amp;#34;MOM, DID YOU MEAN TO GET TWO OF THOSE BURT&#x27;S BEES?

            <li> This is the best product out there for chapped lips in the winter.</li>
            <li> The best chapstick ever!&lt;br /&gt;It is not excessively greasy when applying and stays on your lips.&lt;br /&gt;Works to sooth with a light tingling sensation when first applied. This will cure and prevent you chapped lips with minimal usage required.</li>
            <li> arrive on time and everything was alright</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm! It feels so great and you dan&#x27;t even need to use it that often because it stays on. Also, it&#x27;s not shiny or anything so it&#x27;s great to use under lipstick or in its own</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff I use. Sometimes if I get a cut, I put it on there too and it feels way better. When my eyes get dry, I rub a very very small amount near my tear duct and it fixes that too. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My favorite lip balm. It&#x27;s waxy enough that it stays on but not too waxy. Doesn&#x27;t give instant results but after using for awhile it really does help. Has that nice minty tingle, I also like the minimal ingredients.</li>
            <li> Best chap stick ever!</li>
            <li> Great value. I love burt&#x27;s bees.</li>
            <li> Nothing I&#x27;ve used beats this product. Whether I have chapped winter lips, or even just a hint of dryness, I can always count on this product. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I had chapped lips really bad before starting to use this.  I started using this about 10 years ago and I have never had a problem since.  I have one to take with me when I go out, one by each computer, and one by each chair.  I have the same lip balm in the tin on my bedsiide table, and put some on before I go to bed at night.  I don&#x27;t know of any of my friends that don&#x27;t use it and love it too.  I couldn&#x27;t wear even Clinique Lipstick without it drying my lips, although I was able to wear their make-up without any problems.  I also love the beginning story of how Burt&#x27;s Bees was started.  I hope whereever he is, he&#x27;s doing something he loves.  I highly recommend to all.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use anything other than Burt&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I like the smell and it&#x27;s very good after using.&lt;br /&gt;It is very dry in suzhou,China,after applying my lips feel so good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Burt&#x27;s Bees, what can I say. Some people like them, some don&#x27;t. They leave a weird smell in my nose, and I cannot share a drink with anyone that&#x27;s used them, for I can taste every molecule left from their lips on the straw. If in a bind, I&#x27;d use them, but I&#x27;m a much bigger strawberry Chapstick fan.</li>
            <li> Best stuff for chapped lips, period.</li>
            <li> IMO best product out there works great</li>
            <li> Awesome!  It is the only lip balm product I can wear because I am allergic to SPF ones.  Perfect for my pre-schooler too.</li>
            <li> This balm is not creamy. It is hard to apply as the texture is too hard. Also, I did not realize it is mint which makes it sting a bit.</li>
            <li> My lips are in heaven!</li>
            <li> Hydrating, no heavy scent and I love this 4 pack. I keep one tube with me at all times!</li>
            <li> Keeps my lips moisturized...I like the scent and the feeling of knowing that I&#x27;m putting something natural and not chemical filled on my lips.</li>
            <li> Loved the balm since first using it.</li>
            <li> I only use burts bees, original, all year round, it is the best lip balm for me</li>
            <li> Love it!  What else is there to say</li>
            <li> Awesome  yummy to smell and works great on my lips</li>
            <li> Very good brand, my daughter love it.</li>
            <li> Easy, quick, good deal. Thanks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave the house without a stick in my pocket. Lifesaver.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products! This product has a cool, menthol feel when applied. I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing. Doesn&#x27;t last forever, it does feel waxy after 1 hour or so. But the results on your lips with regular use are amazing.</li>
            <li> Great stuuf. Its the best out there</li>
            <li> Way cheaper here than in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely my favorite. Good balance between how it feels and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years and still love it!</li>
            <li> for all you vaseline based users: &amp;#34;Petroleum jelly, the main ingredient in Vaseline, is a derivative of oil refining. &amp;#34;  this product is the best and all who say the peppermint &#x27;burns&#x27;, that&#x27;s because it is working and getting to your lips, unlike the carcinogens of vaseline.  All who want a natural healing to there lips should buy this product!</li>
            <li> Same as always just more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this chapstick for a decade now, since a college classmate from North Carolina told me he swore by this stuff and literally would have his mom send him more in the mail when he ran out as it wasn&#x27;t sold locally at that time.  Since then, Burt&#x27;s Bees has become a major retailer nationwide.  I have not been as crazy about some of their other products, but I love this lip balm.  I keep a tube on my nightstand as well as in my bag and carry it with my everywhere.  I find that it is not as effective at treating lips that are very chapped from wind and cold, but as an everyday lip moisturizer, this is perfect.  Will likely always be my favorite.</li>
            <li> I was a loyal customer of Burts Bees products....horrible...will NEVER buy again.....since Burts Bees was bought by Clorox, formula is now very different.....lips had VERY BAD reaction...painful/red/puffy/white bumps....switched to Kiehls  lip balm #1....no bad reaction</li>
            <li> We really like this lipbalm. I&#x27;ve been using it for approx 15 years and have never had a problem. Nothing works as good as this. My husband uses it, I use it, even my 3 year old uses it. She calls it &amp;#34;bees buzz&amp;#34; cute! I love the slight tingle, the minty smell/taste, and it leaves my lips feeling great. Even when Burt&#x27;s Bees was taken over it seemed to me that the quality of the balm stayed the same, unlike many other BB products. I&#x27;m still happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are subscribed through Amazon to receive the 4 count box, as the price is a little less than what we&#x27;d normally spend in a store. Never had a problem with a shipment, packaging has always been in perfect condition on arrival.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love burt&#x27;s bees. I once used another name brand that I had to constantly reapply but with Burt&#x27;s Bees once or twice a day is plenty. Also if you apply to a newly formed fever blister it will keep it from becoming full blown(at least in my case) or if it does become full grown, it helps it heal faster. The original is the only one I&#x27;ve found that works for fever blisters.</li>
            <li> The best lip balm there is and getting 4 for this price was a great value</li>
            <li> I really like these but gave it three stars instead of four because I have found that home-made lip balm with shea butter &amp; coconut oil works better for me.</li>
            <li> I had used this product for many years.  Kept one in the car, work truck, desk, night stand.  Not only for lips, but also on cuts and scrapes, and nothing better for split lip.  At some point they changed it and added a fragrance I&#x27;m allergic to.  I found a ultra conditioning model that works almost as good, has no fragrance that makes me sneeze, but it much softer so it wears off faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read somewhere that the company got sold and is now run with a corporate mindset.  Formulas have been changed therefore, there goes another great company that made great products who&#x27;s now just in it for the bottom line.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best lip balm I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Good price if ordering a bunch of items together to make the shipping worth it. NOTE: If you don&#x27;t like peppermint - don&#x27;t purchase this.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love Burt&#x27;s Bees?</li>
            <li> Amazing. Has been saving me for the past week through this weather so I had to buy more</li>
            <li> Awesome product, always thought it was a little pricy</li>
            <li> love this lip balm. It goes on smooth and really makes your lips moist.</li>
            <li> Good lip balm, no petrolatum.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product.</li>
            <li> Really good, looking forward to the next buy</li>
            <li> The only lip balm I use! Leaves my lips with a tingly freshness :)</li>
            <li> works great and feels like it belongs on your lips</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of burt&#x27;s bees.  I have a lot of their product line. i love the minty after feel of the lip balm keeps my lips moisturized longer than any other i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees has been my go to lip balm for over 10 years.  I multiple sticks set up everyone.  At the office, by my bed, in the bathroom, in the car, and my gym bag.  Always within arms reach.  It&#x27;s good quality lip balm that works!  Thank you Bee Man for this wonderful product.  You will be missed.</li>
            <li> Love burts bees!! My favorite go-to lip balm. This 4 pack saves me money every time!</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love Burt&#x27;s Bees?  It&#x27;s the perfect chapstick.  Never leave home without it!!!</li>
            <li> Used to be addicted to Carmex, had it with me every where! Once I tried the Burt&#x27;s Bees there was no going back! My whole family uses it, it feels great on your lips and helps heal any sore you might have, quickly!</li>
            <li> Smells good and really keeps your lips comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product, would buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Always have. Always will</li>
            <li> I started using chap stick as a teenager, and have used it ever since. I recently learned that most chap sticks use salicylic acid to make the lips peel, causing you to use chap stick more frequently. I bought this as an alternative to the Carmex I used to use. I cannot say that this product does not have another ingredient that makes your lips peel, but I can say that I use this a good bit less frequently than I used the Carmex.</li>
            <li> I like the product but I got stiffed from Amazon when the package only had 3 items instead of 4.</li>
            <li> the product works ok but there is very little in the tube. about 3/8 of a inch and you cant get the last of it out unless you scoop&lt;br /&gt;it out with a small tool. also very expensive . other lip balm works just as well so this is my last tube of Burt&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I just received my &amp;#34;multipack&amp;#34; of lipbalm which I had incorrectly expected to be assorted. The description clearly says &amp;#34;multipack&amp;#34; and my silly brain interpreted that to mean a variety of flavors. It was my mistake, but I hope this review helps others avoid a similar mistake.  I am sure I will like this flavor just fine (albeit for a long time).</li>
            <li> I love this product a lot, I have been using for many years and Amazon always offer a lowest price.</li>
            <li> This is the best brand of chapstick out there. It keeps your lips moisturized with out drying them out later like other brands do.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I am forever misplacing where I last laid it down though.  So having the package of four is nice, as I can leave them throughout the house and still have one near when I need it.  The lip balm is very soothing and makes your lips feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Bert&#x27;s Bees really works.  Invest in this product.Really !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Everyone in the family likes it.</li>
            <li> Love these things. I used these after my lips were always chapped because of a medication I was on.I never went back to any other chapsticks again. More like I can&#x27;t because my lips won&#x27;t become as soft as with these Burt bees. And I recommended it to my whole family and now every uses it.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product before, and it does the job of moisturizing my lip as always.</li>
            <li> This works ok for me for 2 years. But then my lips start peeling off again.</li>
            <li> This is nice and minty.  It feels a little think when you first put it on but that goes away quickly.  The mint tingle on lasts a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Good product and great as gift. Bought assorted flavors as previous usage experience was good. Product was well sealed too!</li>
            <li> There are few chapsticks, excuse me, Lip balms out there that that actually work.  It seems most lip balms just make my lips more chapped.  Well this one, besides having the added bonus of being all natural, actually works!  I Find myself applying it less and less because it actually does what its meant to do.  It&#x27;s got a nice faint peppermint taste to it.  Nothing worse than tasting straight old wax like the original chap stick.  get this stuff if you live somewhere cold like myself, and your lips will thank you!</li>
            <li> Husband&#x27;s favorite lip balms</li>
            <li> I am completely addicted to lip balm, and Burt&#x27;s Bees original is one of my all time favorites. It is super minty, feels amazing on your lips, and stays on for quite a while. These are usually sold for $3-$4 a tube in stores, so this 4 pack for $9 is a great deal. I have one on my night stand, one in my purse, one at work, and one spare for when I run out! Love it.</li>
            <li> I love these! And the price was better than I can buy them for locally</li>
            <li> Good price, especially when it drops below 2.50/tube</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a borderline addiction.  I have one of these on the nightstand, one on my keys, one on my desk, and one on my treadmill.</li>
            <li> A classic; feels like it stays for a while.</li>
            <li> love burt&#x27;s bee&#x27;s  lip balm</li>
            <li> Love this...so many &amp;#34;chap stick&amp;#34; types are garbage and do little to help lips in need, but THIS is the best. Really.  I sunburned my lips in November...long story...and this stuff was the immediate cure. It&#x27;s since remedied winter chapped lips as well.  Another great product from Burts.</li>
            <li> This product never fails to please me!</li>
            <li> Is it just me or do most lip balms stink? Like many, I don&#x27;t drink as much water as I need to and sometimes my lip can become dry and chapped. I have found Burt&#x27;s Bees to be the best working lip balm and have been a fan the past couple of years. The 4-pack is a great value as they cost as much as $3.29 for one in my nearby grocery store. Overall, if you&#x27;re like me and you care about what goes into the products that you put on your body and face, Burt&#x27;s Bees is the way to go. Stay hydrated this winter, friends.</li>
            <li> GREAT and less expensive in this quad pack.</li>
            <li> 4 Lip Balm in a small box just like the picture.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I thought. Maybe I&#x27;ll wait till the harsh winter comes and see how it really rocks.</li>
            <li> Great value for a 4 pack of Chapstick.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm of its kind for the price. I have used this for years and this is the best price out there!</li>
            <li> Mint makes me feel cool and comfortable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm for years. It is a natural product that works. This was my first purchase on Amazon, which turned out to be a great deal for a 4-pack.</li>
            <li> Very love. In terms of price or use are very good</li>
            <li> I like a lip balm that is a little more greasy and creamy, that feels more substantial on my lips.  This one is very minimal.  It moisturizes okay, but it&#x27;s hard to feel it on my lips.  This would be great for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to feel their lip balm.</li>
            <li> Really needed this. Great price and I love the flavor too</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I might be addicted.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm.  It actually makes my lips feel better without drying them out when I stop using it.</li>
            <li> Has been received, the effect is good! Mint, don&#x27;t feel greasy</li>
            <li> super stuff!  won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> This may be the one thing I honestly could not live without. I started using this chapstick 10 years ago when i was at the bookstore and lost my other cherry regular. At first i thought it was too strong but boy was I wrong. I was almost instantly addicted and had not been without one or 5 tubes since. People try to convert me to their disgusting pittfiul attempts at chapstick but I know who the king is. Now i order 4 at a time so i always have one within arms reach, its that awesome. I used to have to shell out over 3 bucks a tube at borders to get my fix but how the times have changed!! Now you can pick up a tube of heaven at many retailers, but amazon subscribe and save is by far the best price. Well, I better go, time to reapply.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend is obsessed with these, I like them too.</li>
            <li> Very good lip balm! 100% natural and keep lip moist for long, I love it very much!</li>
            <li> This stuff is very effective! Good scent. And it works extremely well.</li>
            <li> Great chap stick at a great price</li>
            <li> good find, great price</li>
            <li> This is good. Very useful in a dry weather.</li>
            <li> good lip balm,but soo much pepermints on lips!</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite lipbalm and it is well priced on this site. I just wish they had an SPF version.</li>
            <li> Great deal. The product seemed to be exactly the same as you can get from the local store. No issues with it at all.</li>
            <li> Great item. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My favorite lip balm. Of course I haven&#x27;t tried everything :)</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, and I am so grateful, Burt&#x27;s Bees is a great product and this was a really awesome deal.</li>
            <li> Best chap stick.  It doesn&#x27;t melt in your pocket/stays hard for a longer time than the generic ones.  Be careful though, not all &amp;#34;burts bees&amp;#34; are beeswax - there are some that have petroleum jelly as its first ingredient.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love the Burt&#x27;s bees lip balm. It has a cool tingly feeling. My lips stay hydrated through the winter. My husband is addicted to this. So we go through about 1 every few weeks. This is the best price I&#x27;ve seen too.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife, she loves the minty tingle and the long lasting effects, Since she is always using it, I got her the 4-pack and saved her some trips to town.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats this classic lip balm. Very smooth and the peppermint in refreshing. Burt&#x27;s has several different flavors, but this is my personal favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and I use this balm exclusively.  The peppermint flavor is great.  I would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Great deal for a pack of four. Great Chapstick but when buying at the store sometimes it&#x27;s close to $5 each. This was a great add-on deal.</li>
            <li> You can never have enough of this!  The whole family uses it, and we have a tube stashed in every room of the house.  It was a great bargain here on amazon too via the multipack.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees makes quality products that are effective and leave out unhealthy ingredients. I purchase these in bulk in the subscribe &amp; save program since most of my family uses this. We like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and it&#x27;s very effective at preventing my lips from being dry without having a flavor or smell. I don&#x27;t use lipstick or gloss, just this. Great product.</li>
            <li> It is satisfactory.  Not like the one I had prior.  Seems a little harder and not as easy to put on.</li>
            <li> Best stuff I have ever put on my lips</li>
            <li> This was an excellent price for my favorite lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about their regular formula is that it isn&#x27;t overly oily. I prefer a wax based lip balm &amp; this is the best one out there.</li>
            <li> I did not like anything</li>
            <li> Very nice --Came quickly and I love Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Products!</li>
            <li> The best ever doesn&#x27;t even melt in the dryer I will never buy any other lip balm it is one of the best things I have discovered in my life highly recommend .</li>
            <li> I love it, and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I placed two in each Christmas stockings for my sons. When they saw it, they were pleased for they know Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm is great for this time of the year.</li>
            <li> No chapped lips ever anymore!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only lip balm I use.  It keep my lips moist because of the beeswax and tingly from the peppermint.</li>
            <li> Alsmost ready to reorder these fine Lip balms - the price is also right.</li>
            <li> Best lip balm I have tried. Much better than Chap Stick and Carmax as it is not overly waxy and does not dry out your lips.</li>
            <li> I love it ,and the price is really reasonable!</li>
            <li> I love the minty sensation that the lip balm gives you, it truly is a great product.</li>
            <li> This is the only lip balm I use now. ChapStick seems like it&#x27;s just a layer of grease on your lips, occasionally in root beer flavor. This stuff feels a lot better and is more effective at doing its job.</li>
            <li> Wish I could give this more than 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been much of a lip balm kind of guy, but the wife purchased Burt&#x27;s Bees 4 pack and gave one to me to use during the very dry winter months, or anytime as we live in a very dry climate.  The lip balm is now being used...I am impressed.  The wife used to use another brand but switched over because of the reputation of the company and the quality of the ingredients.  She mostly uses the balm before going to bed, as her lips are dry and uncomfortable then.  The cooling effect of the peppermint is soothing, and you can&#x27;t go wrong with keeping the moisture in with the beeswax.</li>
            <li> This balm is lightly and pleasantly scented. It is not one of their heaviest lip balms, which I personally like</li>
            <li> I love it very much. It can help my lip keep moist all the day.</li>
            <li> smell good and very cute, easy to take with. love it...each of my family members have one.</li>
            <li> Love this chapsticks. Goes over my regular lipstick color, moisturize my lips extremely well, and leave a matt finish rather than glossy (which is not in any more).</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it, I can&#x27;t use anything but Carmex, it&#x27;s the only thing that doesn&#x27;t make me break out in cold sores.  But Burt&#x27;s works great for my daughter and great price too.  Even sent some to my mom.</li>
            <li> No build-up on my lips anymore!</li>
            <li> PERFECT ONE IN PURSE ONE BY COUCH ONE IN WORK BAG AND ONE WENT TO MY FRIEND. SOME FLAVORS BETTER THAN OTHERS BUT GREAT TO CONDITION LIPS.</li>
            <li> I stock up on Burt&#x27;s Bees products every year for Christmas gifts for my granddaughters. These little gifts are appreciated especially in the winter when they are walking around campus. They make great stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> So far this lip balm is the best I have tried. Love it</li>
            <li> good price, good quality, fast speed, i would like to buy it again.</li>
            <li> This scent of Burt&#x27;s Bees is a little heavier than I like for a chapstick. I prefer the Burt&#x27;s Bees conditioning chap stick in the white tube. It is much creamier and goes on like butter. The beeswax in the yellow sticks are a bit heavy but might be good for really chapped lips.</li>
            <li> great value and burt&#x27;s are a great product</li>
            <li> smells great does what its supposed to ......5/5.</li>
            <li> NICE SMELL AND EXCELLENT EFFECT</li>
            <li> The only balm we use!</li>
            <li> Love this lip balm the best. The minty tingle is nice. Found these on Amazon at the best price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lip balm fanatic. This is da kind.</li>
            <li> I find I&#x27;m addicted to lip balms and have been for years.  A friend suggested using this product, which contains no alcohol.  I do believe it stays on longer.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but I since I&#x27;m out in the sun a lot, I wish they&#x27;d give a UV rating for it.  The kind I bought is flavored with wintergreen, which is okay, but not a favorite of mine.  This brand is also not as greasy as ChapStick.  Some may prefer that, but I prefer greasy.</li>
            <li> great stuff - wish it would last longer than it does, but that is probably due to how much I use them...</li>
            <li> I have developed either an allergy or sensitivity to this lip balm.  I have previously used this product for years and now it causes a burning sensation. I do not have sensitive skin either.  I don&#x27;t happen to be allergic to any of the ingredients listed and many other lip balms contain beeswax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, in case you have any allergies and since it was reformulated from the previous basic ingredient list I thought this was pertinent. So, I have listed ingredients below since frequently amazon do not have the ingredient list or it is not updated with reformulations.  Hope this is helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cera alba (beeswax), cocos nucifera (coconut) oil, helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil, mentha piperita (peppermint) oil, lanolin, tocopherolrosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, glycine soja (soybean) oil, canola oil (huile de colza), limonene.&lt;br /&gt;Read more at the burts bees website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****update****&lt;br /&gt;To be clear there was no ingredient list at the time of purchase in 2013 and the product received had a much longer ingredient list than the original beeswax formulation.</li>
            <li> Good item!fast shiping!I like it!amazing！High quality！</li>
            <li> I love my Burt&#x27;s Bee lip balm; handy to have extras; as I am always searching for where I might have laid one of these down around the house.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years.</li>
            <li> This worked for me very well in winter to protect lips from wind.  It&#x27;s nice to know that it is all natural too.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it keeps my lips from getting chapped and is all natural. Runs out pretty fast though.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this lip balm - recommended by one of my daughters, I tried it and immediately noticed a difference in how my lips felt. There is a slight minty feel that is very refreshing and the balm stays on much longer than other similar brands. My new favorite!!!</li>
            <li> hands down, the best lip balm ever!</li>
            <li> Plan ahead and buy in bulk if you already know you love this chapstick and want one within arm&#x27;s reach at all times.</li>
            <li> Much better than Chapstick. I love that its waxy and not greesy.</li>
            <li> Burts Bees consistently shells out great products.  Love the simple, pure and effective ingredients that go into this balm.  I make a lot of my own care products, but Burt&#x27;s does such a good job with this product at an affordable cost, I purchase Burt&#x27;s instead.  I buy a four pack, give one to my partner, keep one in my purse, one at the office and one in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> GREAT TRANSACTION. LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm is the best product to heal chapped lips</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong!  These are the best!!</li>
            <li> Addicted to this stuff. I used it every night before bed and have for years. My hubby can&#x27;t go to bed without it either.</li>
            <li> Moist, listing, suitable for men</li>
            <li> Perfect!! Very Good!!</li>
            <li> All natural and does a great job keeping those lips from cracking.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, mint taste. Moderate hardness. 4 together to buy a very cost-effective,</li>
            <li> We live in New Mexico&#x27;s desert climate. This product is a must and works better than any of the others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I cant stop the women from coming at me.  Apparently my lips are just to luscious</li>
            <li> Gosh, I don&#x27;t agree with all the five star reviews. I have used chapstick for years and have loved it. I figured I would try this since it&#x27;s so well reviewed. But it doesn&#x27;t last very long. . I love the flavor but that doesn&#x27;t make up for me constantly putting the stuff on my lips. I think it works about ten mins until I need more. Well, now I know what all the fuss is about and I guess I really didn&#x27;t need it because the chapstick made me very happy and I should have stuck with it. But ya live and learn.</li>
            <li> Burts Bees is the only thing that works on my lips. Everything else is too waxy or doesn&#x27;t actually do anything. I have a tube in every jacket and every bag I own.</li>
            <li> It burns my lips when I put it on. I gave it to my son and he said it burns his lips too.</li>
            <li> Beeswax has peppermint in it. I really hate peppermint in my lip balm. I threw the junk out. You cannot read peppermint on the label online.</li>
            <li> This stuff is sooooo good.  Don&#x27;t waste your time on the fruit-flavoured stuff.  This is the one to get.</li>
            <li> Lipstick is very cool, not moisturizing effect a general, the first purchase understand S &amp; S. Will not buy again! Disappointing experience.</li>
            <li> I bought a couple two packs of this at Wal-Mart never suspecting I&#x27;d have a problem with it. It seemed to be OK but after using for a few days I started getting something like a cold sore, not sure if was an actual cold sore or a reaction to the Burt&#x27;s Bees formula. I stopped using it until the slight blister/cold sore was completely gone. I then threw out the tube I was using and opened a new one. AGAIN after a few days I starting getting another cold sore on a different area of my lip. At this point I started suspecting the Burt&#x27;s Bees as the cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me clarify something here. I do get cold sores but very rarely. I usually only get a cold sore once every couple years and usually only after I&#x27;ve been sick, which is also very rare. When I am starting to get over being sick with a cold or flu is usually the only time I normally get one. To be fair I can&#x27;t say for sure that the Burt&#x27;s Bees caused this, or that it in fact was a cold sore and not something else. However I decided not to risk using Burt&#x27;s Bees again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully I am allowed to put this in my review to help others this is just based on my experience. Since my lips were getting really dry for the winter and I needed something I then started searching online and found another truly natural lip balm made by the &#x27;Red Headed Honey&amp;#34; company. the Red Headed Honey company makes a lip balm from their bee farm so I ordered a few tubes online. I got the normal unflavored variety. Although it seems to have a slightly funny smell at first it&#x27;s been excellent. I&#x27;ve been using the Red Headed Honey for a month now with no problems or reactions.</li>
            <li> I am an avid chapstick consumer...ok, maybe an addict but not like the kind that needs to be on My Crazy Obsession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of all of the chapsticks out there, I love Burts Bees the best. The smell and the feeling it gives my lips is incomparable to any other that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> i love Burt&#x27;s Bees brand</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my sister and she absolutely loves them. They ship fast, better priced, and you can get a discount if you subscribe to get them monthly!</li>
            <li> I cant get enough of these. Fairly expensive, but theyre well worth the price IMO becasue they work so well. Sometimes the minty taste is a bit too much for me though.</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice feel and smell to it without being waxy at all, thus making it OK for men to use too without looking fruity.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm (original) is, hands down, the best lip balm that I&#x27;ve ever tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it has a wax-like feel (hence the name), but the balm goes on smoothly &amp; doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all.  The mint scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming &amp; smells great!  Works like a charm (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definately recommend this product to anyone looking to soothe dry, cracked lips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Chloe</li>
            <li> love this brand, can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> Great deal for this many chap sticks.  Burt&#x27;s Bees is the best.</li>
            <li> I was interested in Burt&#x27;s Bees after seeing a show on how I made my millions so I went out and bought me a tube of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm I went home and applied the lip balm as I would any other fast forward 30 minutes later my lips begin to swell atrociously big I I was so scared I tried to rub it off wipe it off or wash it off nothing worked only time my friend trust me do not try your luck with this product.</li>
            <li> I thought I was the #1 fan of this stuff, but apparently I&#x27;m not alone.  I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax Lip Balm.  It goes on smooth, feels fresh, and keeps me happy.  I love that Amazon sells it in the 4 pack for a great price.  I like to have a tube in my make up drawer, my purse, my nightstand and then I give the other one to my 14 y.o. daughter. :)</li>
            <li> I always use this brand of lip balm and the price was awesome--I will be back to reorder</li>
            <li> You will never have chapped lips again with these babies.</li>
            <li> Living in a desert environment, I have to regularly use lip balm.  After trying many different brands, Burt&#x27;s Bees is the most effective and easy to use.  Amazon&#x27;s price for the 4 pack is the best around.</li>
            <li> Good product, very good, I will have been use;Hope to continue to provide good products;Hope to continue;Will recommend to friends</li>
            <li> Pros:  Smells nice without that weird artificial taste or odor. As others have remarked, doesn&#x27;t melt under any circumstances. It also doesn&#x27;t leave your lips feeling goopy or gummy.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Doesn&#x27;t have the best staying power and doesn&#x27;t moisturize to the degree of Carmex jars.</li>
            <li> This is the only lip balm I use. Great price as an add-on. Love non-petroleum products. Keeps my lips smooth.</li>
            <li> And I do not need to try other options. This offers the best results of any lip lube I have every tried.</li>
            <li> Love Burts Bees! And love that this is a pack 👍</li>
            <li> Great price for these.  Bought at $7.99 using prime membership.  Arrived next day I think.</li>
            <li> Longtime return customer...you will never use anything else after using Burt&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> The only lip balm my wife likes.  Expensive but still cheaper than in stores.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff on the market! I recommend it to everyone. It keeps like lips from drying out and makes them feel so soft and moist.</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite lip balm/chapstick. No one will ever convince me otherwise. A perfect blend of smoothness and freshness. If you&#x27;re buying as an add-in its the cheapest on the internet as a package of 4, and I&#x27;m a chapstick fanatic so if you love it -buy it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use another lip balm for the rest of my life.  Simply put- nothing works as good as Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm for preventing and healing chapped lips.  I especially like the fact that it is made of beeswax and 100% natural ingredients.  I find that other petroleum-based lip balms  rub off too easily and feel very slippery.  The slightly tacky wax with peppermint oil feels refreshing, clean, and does not shine.  The smell is wonderful.  For all these reasons, there is nothing else I&#x27;d rather use.</li>
            <li> US to Shanghai only took two weeks, really great!</li>
            <li> This is the only lip balm my husband will use.  Very natural.  Good for you!  Read the ingredients in other brands.</li>
            <li> I have notoriously dry lips, whether in summer or winter. Using all the other chapsticks and lip balms provide temporary relief but nothing compares to Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s. They make stop my lips from chapping and create a seal that lasts for quite a while. The stick form factor is perfect for keeping a spare in my pocket and applying quickly while on-the-go. This 4 pack is really great and offers savings over buying individual sticks.</li>
            <li> love me some burts bees</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It keeps my lips moisturized without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I use this lip balm all the time. It is wonderful for dry chapped lips and it has a nice refreshing and cooling feel on the lips.  I highly recommend this lip balm.</li>
            <li> What I wanted, does what it&#x27;s intended for</li>
            <li> I always buy it before fall is coming</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm and you can&#x27;t beat this price of buying 4 at a time instead of individual ones at more than $3 a pop. The lip balm is the best because you can put it on at night and still feel it on your lips in the morning. It doesn&#x27;t wear off like most other brands.</li>
            <li> i love it very much. it can keep my mouth wet in winter.</li>
            <li> I always make sure I have at least one of these little babies at home, by my bed, in my pocket, in my bag... I wouldn&#x27;t need anything else if only it offered a bit of sunscreen and a hint of color in the same peppermint flavor.</li>
            <li> A++++ item as pictured. Does what it is supposed to do. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Excellent lip balm and will definitely buy more next time.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is great, and I am always looking for deals, so when I saw a 4-pack of Burt&#x27;s Bees Original Lip Balm for $8.99, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.  This lip balm typically retails for $2.99/tube, so this was a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm is all-natural, and gives a nice tingly sensation from the peppermint oil.  There is a reason that this product has been around and popular for so long; simply put, it works.  It keeps my lips soft, even in the middle of winter.  I have noticed that it feels light on my lips; I like to feel it so I know I actually have product on my lips, so I tend to run it over my lips a few times.  It lasts an hour or so once applied, but the four-pack I ordered will last me a year or more!  :)</li>
            <li> They are moisturized and I will recommend it to my friends next time. But this is not the flavor I like, I will try other flavors next time.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite chap stick, always keeps my lips soft and moist.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years. Can&#x27;t buy it in our area.</li>
            <li> its the best I&#x27;ve tried!!! love it.</li>
            <li> favorite chapstick. I always regret trying others.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my lips, would definitely buy it again</li>
            <li> simply the best. its not sticky at all, stays on a long time, no funky taste or smell. has a fresh minty feel. my entire family uses this. wife, in laws, parents, cousins. the price for this pack is so cheap compared to the store as well. we love burts bees products. all our baby care products are from them too. great quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees and decided the 4 pack would solve my problems of moving one from my vehicle to purse to wherever. Now I have one wherever I want it :)</li>
            <li> cheap but moisturizing, not so oily, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees!! There isn&#x27;t really anything more to say than that!</li>
            <li> Love the taste and smell of it. It helped prevent my lips from my cracking! The price on Amazon is way much cheaper than in stores! Overall, great purchase!</li>
            <li> Real deal. As always, Burt&#x27;s Bees moisturizes my lips all day with just twp applications :)</li>
            <li> Works well with my lips. Really love the peppermint.</li>
            <li> the best lip balm! why not buy it cheap in bulk right here!!?</li>
            <li> Better than chapstick, blistex, or carmex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually mosturizes your lips and keeps them from drying. I am able use this stuff way less often throughout the day compared to chapstick. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Its a great product. Love it. I use it all the time hence the 4-pack Classic Lip Balm! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees products are the best!</li>
            <li> Works better than all other brands of lip balm I&#x27;ve used.  Also, the added peppermint oil gives a nice tingling sensation … very refreshing.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff and Amazon has a great price.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! The peppermint is cooling and soothing, making it feel so much better than some other lip balms!</li>
            <li> I like being able to buy a multi pack as I am always misplacing my lip balm.</li>
            <li> My wife goes nuts for this stuff, so I always have to make sure we have it on-hand at home.  While the four-pack isn&#x27;t a terribly great savings here on Amazon vs. the store, it is a bit of savings, and it comes when I need it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lip balm itself has a nice cooling sensation, and doesn&#x27;t feel overly greasy when you put it on.  It works effectively on dry, cracked lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far. Definitely keeps my lips hydrated, and the peppermint has a soothing cooling effect.</li>
            <li> We really like Burt&#x27;s Bees products, especially their lip balm! I loved being able to buy this in a package of 4 for a cheaper price!</li>
            <li> All four came in as expected!! love it</li>
            <li> Nothing feels nicer on your lips then Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li> keep lip moist  i like it</li>
            <li> Really helped my lips. Will recommend</li>
            <li> my wife loves this stuff she wont even use anything else &amp; the price on amazon was the best that i have ssen for it</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees!!!!</li>
            <li> i love hurts bees lip balm it&#x27;s the best feeling stuff. this is a good price for it.</li>
            <li> Some how when i had chapped lips this thing cleared them in less then 2 hours the chaps vanished, they are great use them all the time definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm and you can&#x27;t beat this price of buying 4 at a time instead of individual ones at more than $3 a pop. The lip balm is the best because you can put it on at night and still feel it on your lips in the morning. It doesn&#x27;t wear off like most other brands.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm in all the land and I have bought (and used up) dozens of tubes so far.</li>
            <li> Good lip balm. Bert&#x27;s bees is the best</li>
            <li> Love this product. Best lip balm I have ever used!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. I can never have enough of these around!!!</li>
            <li> mint flavor, feels great, seems that use it before sleep could bring me a good dream~~</li>
            <li> Bought for my boyfriend and I hope he likes it..but it gonna take long long time to finish all of them...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Burt&#x27;s Bee!</li>
            <li> Best chapstick out there. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees and like that it is offered here</li>
            <li> Purchased as a stocking stuffer, it was perfect!</li>
            <li> the best in lip protection!</li>
            <li> Use up very cool and refreshing Useful for alleviating lip weather-shack so i like it</li>
            <li> I used to use burts when the ingredients didnt surpass the count of 4. Now,canola oil?  I buy mine at sprouts now,cheaper too.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and better price buying online!! I have the whole family hooked on these gems!! I have SUPER sensitive skin, and this balm works great, and without irritation.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry are, where no matter how stubborn you are, you can&#x27;t avoid having to use chapstick. I&#x27;ve tried a couple others.. carmex, etc, given all the dryness. But once I first tried Burt&#x27;s Bees, I knew I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. I don&#x27;t use it too often and my lips don&#x27;t chap and crack anymore.</li>
            <li> Of course we love it.  There is no better lip balm in the world.  Absolutely the best.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think you&#x27;re getting this sweet honey-like lip balm but you realize you&#x27;re in for something else as soon as you put it on. It&#x27;s spicy! It&#x27;s peppermint! It&#x27;s very overpowering. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed it was not clearly advertised.</li>
            <li> Great! Fix my lips really gentle and nice.</li>
            <li> Prevents my lips from overnight cracking in the winter. It moisturizes without making me dependent on always having to reapply, which I experienced with Carmex Lip Balm.</li>
            <li> Love this product, purchase went exactly as expected!</li>
            <li> Simply the best lip balm I haver purchased. It does not run out too fast like cocoa butter and chemicals products.</li>
            <li> Nice sting to it, which makes me feel like I have plumper lips, which I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This Lip Balm is the most natural one I have been used than ever before,and it tastes nice,above all the low price is alsome.In one word, Good~~</li>
            <li> I use quite a few of Burt&#x27;s Bees products and am very happy with all of them.  The company uses quality, natural ingredients and has a good corporate philosophy (yes, I know they are now owned by Clorox but their values seem to be intact).  My main reason for buying their products though is because they work and this lip balm is no exception.  It moisturizes well and has a nice peppermint scent that stays long after application.  Great stuff.</li>
