            <li>some reviewers loved it though.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel my kids had good coverage with this spray.</li>
            <li>Good spray, nice smell.  </li>
            <li>Reapplying is nice because the cooling effect is refreshing if you&#x27;ve been in the heat all day!</li>
            <li>It smells nice too.  </li>
            <li>The spray does appear to be effective.</li>
            <li>The spray doesn&#x27;t come out very strong.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the smell, but the product works great.  </li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s service is very thoughtful, have email</li>
            <li>The banana boat ones smell nice and go on easily from the spray canister.</li>
            <li>, I have been sunburned too many times</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re going to get a lot more use out of lotions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made that mistake many times...</li>
            <li>Banana Boat spray is interesting.</li>
            <li>I love spray on sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>This variety has a pleasant scent and the spray is gently and cooling.</li>
            <li>Works great on my 4yr old and no issues on skin.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, fresh smell to it also which was not off-putting.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and this stuff really did the job.  </li>
            <li>Non- sticky, non-greasy, non-shiny) dries quickly, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy application and long-term sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Easy application, and</li>
            <li>The more my right eye watered, the more it stung and burned.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Taste fresh, this summer, that it is safe to close to the sea...</li>
            <li>I have fair and sensitive skin and need to have full-coverage sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and dries quick.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and quickly with the exception that you are warned not to spray it on your face.</li>
            <li>Downside, you use more than you need because you don&#x27;t really feel anything on your skin.</li>
            <li>Feels good especially after you have been exposes to the sun.</li>
            <li>I use it when I go hiking or skiing in the mountains where the UV is more intense than at sea level.</li>
            <li>Flat out didn&#x27;t provide good protection.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll end with a quick note on visibility of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think they will be worthy of buying again and wouldn&#x27;t say against doing so.</li>
            <li>This is a very effective sunscreen, and it is also MUCH cheaper than buying it at your local pharmacy.  </li>
            <li>A more intense and longer lasting cooling effect would be nice though.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it stung while the solvent was fresh, but after rubbing my eyes until it was dry, both eyes did not burn or sting at all.</li>
            <li>This is not something that we&#x27;ve ever had to do, and it is the only spray sunscreen that requires this kind application (we read the instructions on every bottle at Target).  </li>
            <li>Nice spray wish they made a larger one.</li>
            <li>Very effective with initial sting and stiff feel to skin, but effective and tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Refreshing and clean, would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>When I ran a hand over my leg, I could feel the swelling begin right on the line of the burn.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I purchased this sunscreen for our first anniversary trip to Cabo.  </li>
            <li>We have been using spray on sunscreen for years, but this was the first time we used this product.  </li>
            <li>My legs and chest are the most unnatural shade of red (and also purple in some spots) from being so burned.  </li>
            <li>I think that it is quite possible that the spray product would be better without the added fragrance.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised since I had rubbed in the sunscreen to make sure I was completely covered.  </li>
            <li>The cooling effect has been a nice addition plus an incentive to put sunscreen on, which I dread sometimes due to its greasy nature.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m positive the sunburn was.</li>
            <li>It is not all that strong, but does last quite a while.</li>
            <li>The left eye seemed fine.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I travel to sunny places where a 50 SPF is what you really want.  </li>
            <li>The whole family came home looking like lobsters.</li>
            <li>that I was wearing a hoodie so my whole body wasn&#x27;t affected.</li>
            <li>Whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>so much easier.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re bigger, provide more product and just last longer.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I had a different brand of SPF 70 sunscreen for my face, so that didn&#x27;t get burned at all.  </li>
            <li>the only major downside to it is the really strong smell.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easy and not greasy like other sprays.</li>
            <li>However, I did notice that the spray caused the skin around my eyes to very lightly burn continuously, and the skin felt stiff and unnatural whenever I would blink.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought the cooling action was going to be a flop, but it really works.</li>
            <li>I sprayed for a long amount of time, before I had felt confident my skin was entirely covered.</li>
            <li>I normally buy coppertone sport since it works well.</li>
            <li>Product 60 in left eye and 70 in the right eye.</li>
            <li>I stuck with it for a minute to see if 60 would react, but even though my left eye was getting watery out of sympathy for my right eye, I still felt nothing.  </li>
            <li>Within 3 seconds, my right eye was burning like fire, but I didn&#x27;t feel anything from my left eye.  </li>
            <li>After a good rinse with tap water and towel dry, I sprayed a dime-size amount of the 50 spray to 2 new fingers that had never been in contact with the previous two products, and quickly rubbed them into both closed eyes simultaneously.  </li>
            <li>, I just did a lab rat style eye test with 3 new sunscreens to see if they burned.</li>
            <li>This sunblock is very good at preventing sunburn, however the spray area is quite small making it difficult to get full coverage.  </li>
            <li>The only issue is that you have to rub it in for more even application (don&#x27;t just spay on and assume you&#x27;re OK), otherwise you will get uneven coverage and might get a slight sunburn.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Bought it at the last minute when my son was playing sand soccer on a hot weekend.  </li>
            <li>This really does cool you down!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just thankful it was cool enough outside</li>
            <li>I have pale skin that burns easy and went to Texas over the summer holiday</li>
            <li>It may be certain body chemistries mixed with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The spay makes an entire room really unconformable for breathing.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>out doors only.&lt;br /&gt;Never near children.</li>
            <li>I did it so that I would know which ones would make my eyes burn or sting before trying them on my 7 year old.  </li>
            <li>: I compared Banana Boat Sport Coolzone SPF50+ spray, and Neutrogena Sensitive Skin SPF60+ lotion, and Neutrogena Sport Face SPF70+ lotion.  </li>
            <li>For children under age 12, I&#x27;d stick with 60 (Sensitive Skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>prefer the generic one I had from CVS which had a much wider spray area.</li>
            <li>We have used it 2 different times and both times my whole family got burned...</li>
            <li>Although I state that I haven&#x27;t gotten a sunburn so far.</li>
            <li>Love the cooling sensation especially when we had to reapply after a few hours.  </li>
            <li>I put Lentil bean size amount on a clean finger (one finger for each sunscreen so they didn&#x27;t mix) and vigorously rubbed them onto my eyelid and the entire area around the eye until I felt a reaction with my eye still closed.  </li>
            <li>This is the least greasy sunscreen I have ever used, it dries fast and leaves a clean and not overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>Since I was testing 2 lotions from the same manufacturer and 1 spray, I first applied each lotion to an eye at the same time.</li>
            <li>The only nice thing about the cooling effect is that I can use the useless spray to cool down my stinging sunburnt skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Confused by the results, I sprayed more and rubbed it into my eyes again with identical reactions.  </li>
            <li>I ran to the kitchen again and dunked my head in the sink, and dried off after the burning subsided in the right eye.</li>
            <li>:  It&#x27;s been about 30 minutes since I started the test, and both eyes feel fine now except for the underlying subtle burn from the spray.  </li>
            <li>and it protected me very well while I spent a lot of time outside.</li>
            <li>I recommend this; not available locally in stores.&lt;br /&gt;No greasy mess when applied; aerosol application is easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;Al</li>

            <li> I am a mailman in northern Texas and we&#x27;re in a serious heat wave right now too.</li>
            <li> This actually caused a very subtle stinging in the left eye finally, but made my right eye feel like I had just poured Tabasco in my eye.</li>
            <li> After a 2 minute recovery and towel dry, I went back to try 50, which was the spray.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird smell on you afterwards.</li>
            <li> Item 50 was unnoticeable without a sheen immediately, 70 dried basically clear with a subtle whitening or lightening of the skin that persisted and was a bit shiny, and 60 remained visibly very white like clown makeup for a long time, and only really lightened after repeated rubbing every 5 minutes or so for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Saturday received, waiting for is always so long.</li>
            <li> Banana Boat has long been my sunscreen of choice.</li>
            <li> The problem is that you couldn&#x27;t tell where it landed and unlike other spray you are actually supposed to rub it in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews that had similar things happen....</li>
            <li> We waited 15-20 minutes for it to dry after each application.</li>
            <li> The swelling finally went down 3 days after the sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> I definitely don&#x27;t recommend spraying yourself or the kids down inside.</li>
            <li> In small print on the back of the bottle, it states \\&quot;just spray and go\\&quot; but in even smaller print</li>
            <li> I applied it to my eyes immediately after spraying and kept my eyelids closed.  </li>
            <li> I then got my fingers wet and rubbed my eyes to get the areas around my eyes really wet.</li>
            <li> Did not really notice a cooling effect.  </li>
            <li> Clearly, 60 is completely painless, 70 could drop an assailant in his tracks, and 50 was only painful briefly until it dried and then left the skin around my eyes feel stiff with a barely noticeable burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> Comparing, the spray can with the tube, I see that the active ingredients are similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is Hawaiian Tropic products just smell nice, but for some fragrance is a bad thing .</li>
            <li> My legs actually swelled up and were achy like I&#x27;d worked out too hard.  </li>
            <li> Now this was a bit confusing, but I got a different reaction in each eye from 50.  </li>
            <li> only negative that I found is the odor.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the spray stuff seems to wear off quicker then the coppertone which makes me wonder if it&#x27;s even there.</li>
            <li> You have to use both hands to hold it down to get it to spray.</li>
            <li> Used it on my sweaty son and my other 3 children, my husband and myself and none of us got burned!  </li>
            <li> I used this while in the sun for an hour and half to two hours.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like spray sunscreen due to the alcohol or over-powering fragrance and sometimes they burn.</li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like others, it is a little pricier, however its the brand and type</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t heavily scrub yourself in the shower after using this, it won&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li> I grabbed a few of these for a trip.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of its ease of use, I am likely to use the spray for casual sun exposure, say bike riding or walking in partial shade, instead of using nothing because of the trouble involved with applying the cream variety.</li>
            <li> The resulting burns were awful, and prevented us to from enjoying our vacation to the fullest.  </li>
            <li> Of all the places to miss, I ended up with a small strip of sunburn on my shins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this spray because it is so difficult to cover everywhere with regular sunblock lotion</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a very pleasant fragrance</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle hardly released any sunscreen.</li>
            <li> had the same outcome, brought it fishing and reapplied several times throughout the day, now I have the worst sunburn everywhere</li>
            <li> Poor spray, should just go with lotion is using this product.</li>
            <li> Applied this twice over a 4-hour period (approximately from noon-4pm).  </li>
            <li> Spray was very weak and we ended up sun burned at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin so water-resistant it feels weird.</li>
            <li> My husband didn&#x27;t put any sunscreen on his face or neck and his face is just as bad as my legs</li>
            <li> disappointed with this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell, but the product works great.  Use it every time me and my daughter go walk out in the sun.  Easy to apply and dries quick.</li>
            <li> We purchased this as a quicker alternative to putting sunscreen on our daughter for daycare. It covers and works well and she never had a sunburn with it. It has a nice, fresh smell to it also which was not off-putting.</li>
            <li> The spay makes an entire room really unconformable for breathing.&lt;br /&gt;Use out doors only.&lt;br /&gt;Never near children.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I travel to sunny places where a 50 SPF is what you really want.  This met the requirement, I have been sunburned too many times and I love it.  It smells nice too.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> My husband and I purchased this sunscreen for our first anniversary trip to Cabo.  We have been using spray on sunscreen for years, but this was the first time we used this product.  In small print on the back of the bottle, it states \\&quot;just spray and go\\&quot; but in even smaller print it states  \\&quot;spread evenly by hand\\&quot;.  This is not something that we&#x27;ve ever had to do, and it is the only spray sunscreen that requires this kind application (we read the instructions on every bottle at Target).  The resulting burns were awful, and prevented us to from enjoying our vacation to the fullest.  Over a week later our skin is peeling and blotchy.  Truly the worst burns either of us has ever had.</li>
            <li> Very effective with initial sting and stiff feel to skin, but effective and tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the name of science, I just did a lab rat style eye test with 3 new sunscreens to see if they burned. I did it so that I would know which ones would make my eyes burn or sting before trying them on my 7 year old.  I&#x27;ll end with a quick note on visibility of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MATERIAL: I compared Banana Boat Sport Coolzone SPF50+ spray, and Neutrogena Sensitive Skin SPF60+ lotion, and Neutrogena Sport Face SPF70+ lotion.  For simplicity, I&#x27;ll just refer to them by their SPF rating (50, 60, &amp; 70).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;METHODS: The test was simple. I put Lentil bean size amount on a clean finger (one finger for each sunscreen so they didn&#x27;t mix) and vigorously rubbed them onto my eyelid and the entire area around the eye until I felt a reaction with my eye still closed.  Since I was testing 2 lotions from the same manufacturer and 1 spray, I first applied each lotion to an eye at the same time. Product 60 in left eye and 70 in the right eye. After a good rinse with tap water and towel dry, I sprayed a dime-size amount of the 50 spray to 2 new fingers that had never been in contact with the previous two products, and quickly rubbed them into both closed eyes simultaneously.  The results were quite surprising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS:  Lotions were vastly different. I literally had no reaction to 60, but 70 felt like I had been pepper sprayed.  The more my right eye watered, the more it stung and burned. I stuck with it for a minute to see if 60 would react, but even though my left eye was getting watery out of sympathy for my right eye, I still felt nothing.  I finally couldn&#x27;t stand it and ran to the kitchen sink to rinse my eyes.  After a 2 minute recovery and towel dry, I went back to try 50, which was the spray.  Now this was a bit confusing, but I got a different reaction in each eye from 50.  I applied it to my eyes immediately after spraying and kept my eyelids closed.  Within 3 seconds, my right eye was burning like fire, but I didn&#x27;t feel anything from my left eye.  Confused by the results, I sprayed more and rubbed it into my eyes again with identical reactions.  I then got my fingers wet and rubbed my eyes to get the areas around my eyes really wet. This actually caused a very subtle stinging in the left eye finally, but made my right eye feel like I had just poured Tabasco in my eye. I ran to the kitchen again and dunked my head in the sink, and dried off after the burning subsided in the right eye. The left eye seemed fine.  The final test was direct spray onto the eyelid of each closed eye.  Surprisingly, it stung while the solvent was fresh, but after rubbing my eyes until it was dry, both eyes did not burn or sting at all. However, I did notice that the spray caused the skin around my eyes to very lightly burn continuously, and the skin felt stiff and unnatural whenever I would blink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:  It&#x27;s been about 30 minutes since I started the test, and both eyes feel fine now except for the underlying subtle burn from the spray.  Clearly, 60 is completely painless, 70 could drop an assailant in his tracks, and 50 was only painful briefly until it dried and then left the skin around my eyes feel stiff with a barely noticeable burning sensation.  For children under age 12, I&#x27;d stick with 60 (Sensitive Skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;APPEARANCE:  Very different appearance between the 3 products.  Item 50 was unnoticeable without a sheen immediately, 70 dried basically clear with a subtle whitening or lightening of the skin that persisted and was a bit shiny, and 60 remained visibly very white like clown makeup for a long time, and only really lightened after repeated rubbing every 5 minutes or so for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Still get burned, even after application</li>
            <li> Makes your skin so water-resistant it feels weird. If you can&#x27;t heavily scrub yourself in the shower after using this, it won&#x27;t come off. When camping, it wouldn&#x27;t come off for multiple days. I will not purchase this ever again.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective sunscreen, and it is also MUCH cheaper than buying it at your local pharmacy.  The only issue is that you have to rub it in for more even application (don&#x27;t just spay on and assume you&#x27;re OK), otherwise you will get uneven coverage and might get a slight sunburn.</li>
            <li> Downside, you use more than you need because you don&#x27;t really feel anything on your skin. Dries great, non-greasy, has no residue, or oder. Works great on my 4yr old and no issues on skin.</li>
            <li> feels like i just sprayed my eyes with mace</li>
            <li> I used this on Memorial Day and got a blotchy tan/burn--I looked like a leopard. Then a weekend in June I used this for a float trip and got the same uneven results but was mainly crisped to a nice tomato red while face sunscreen I used was the same SPF but was not as bad. The problem is that you couldn&#x27;t tell where it landed and unlike other spray you are actually supposed to rub it in. Of course I figured that out after the fact. If you get one thing from this review it is to not use it.</li>
            <li> Good Amazon.com price.  Needed to fill my cart. Worked well on pool day.</li>
            <li> Non- sticky, non-greasy, non-shiny) dries quickly, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Feels good especially after you have been exposes to the sun. It doesn&#x27;t burn like the regular sunscreen does. Good product</li>
            <li> I grabbed a few of these for a trip.  This sunblock is very good at preventing sunburn, however the spray area is quite small making it difficult to get full coverage.  Of all the places to miss, I ended up with a small strip of sunburn on my shins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the generic one I had from CVS which had a much wider spray area.</li>
            <li> We went to Gulf Shores, applied this sunscreen before sun exposure, then reapplied several times throughout the day. We waited 15-20 minutes for it to dry after each application. The whole family came home looking like lobsters. Thank god for aloe gel, and sunburn relief spray. Flat out didn&#x27;t provide good protection. I would skip this and try something different.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time. I guess it works well</li>
            <li> I recommend this; not available locally in stores.&lt;br /&gt;No greasy mess when applied; aerosol application is easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;Al</li>
            <li> Saturday received, waiting for is always so long. Amazon&#x27;s service is very thoughtful, have email reminder.&lt;br /&gt;Taste fresh, this summer, that it is safe to close to the sea... And I also bought at repairing the skin after sunburn.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird smell on you afterwards. Refreshing and clean, would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have fair and sensitive skin and need to have full-coverage sunscreen. I don&#x27;t usually like spray sunscreen due to the alcohol or over-powering fragrance and sometimes they burn. This variety has a pleasant scent and the spray is gently and cooling. The coverage seems good too.</li>
            <li> Wow! This really does cool you down! I&#x27;m super-impressed with this product. I thought the cooling action was going to be a flop, but it really works. My kids get a kick out of it, and obviously the sunscreen factor works, too. Very happy with this lotion.</li>
            <li> Wish I could give 0 stars, I might has well not bought sunscreen and wouldn&#x27;ve had the same outcome, brought it fishing and reapplied several times throughout the day, now I have the worst sunburn everywhere I wasn&#x27;t wearing clothes, will never buy again, going back to target brand...</li>
            <li> I was burned very badly while using this. The spray requires two hands in order to deliver any spray whatsoever and even then it was just a mist. Not enough to protect your skin at all. Not worth it!</li>
            <li> Easy application and long-term sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Our product was defective.  Spray was very weak and we ended up sun burned at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Solid spray and atomization.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years and it&#x27;s one of the best, if not THE best spray sunscreen on the market. Have used it in different conditions in Florida and have never gotten sunburnt once.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re going to get a lot more use out of lotions. They&#x27;re bigger, provide more product and just last longer. This is all about ease. I find Banana Boat to be sufficient for my needs, and I spend a lot of time in and around my pool. My only real complaint is Hawaiian Tropic products just smell nice, but for some fragrance is a bad thing .</li>
            <li> I got this spray because it is so difficult to cover everywhere with regular sunblock lotion so I figured this would solve the problem and it did! The protection was great too. I have pale skin that burns easy and went to Texas over the summer holiday and it protected me very well while I spent a lot of time outside. I reapplied it as it said after swimming for a while and didn&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
            <li> DO NOT PURCHASE!  This product does not work!  We have used it 2 different times and both times my whole family got burned...</li>
            <li> Poor spray, should just go with lotion is using this product.</li>
            <li> Applied this twice over a 4-hour period (approximately from noon-4pm).  My legs and chest are the most unnatural shade of red (and also purple in some spots) from being so burned.  My legs actually swelled up and were achy like I&#x27;d worked out too hard.  When I ran a hand over my leg, I could feel the swelling begin right on the line of the burn.  The swelling finally went down 3 days after the sun exposure.  Luckily, I had a different brand of SPF 70 sunscreen for my face, so that didn&#x27;t get burned at all.  My husband didn&#x27;t put any sunscreen on his face or neck and his face is just as bad as my legs (we&#x27;re both pasty white), which leads me to believe there wasn&#x27;t any sunscreen at all in the can, just a propellant.  I&#x27;m just thankful it was cool enough outside that I was wearing a hoodie so my whole body wasn&#x27;t affected.</li>
            <li> Excelente, mercadoria no prazo, em perfeito estado, o vendedor muito atencioso, forma de pagamento correta. Sem problemas com a mercadoria ou com o vendedor.</li>
            <li> The cooling effect is what sold this product for me. I am a mailman in northern Texas and we&#x27;re in a serious heat wave right now too. The cooling effect has been a nice addition plus an incentive to put sunscreen on, which I dread sometimes due to its greasy nature. This is the least greasy sunscreen I have ever used, it dries fast and leaves a clean and not overpowering scent. Reapplying is nice because the cooling effect is refreshing if you&#x27;ve been in the heat all day! A more intense and longer lasting cooling effect would be nice though.</li>
            <li> Good spray, nice smell.  Did not really notice a cooling effect.  I am fair skinned and this stuff really did the job.  I swim with my son for a couple hours each day, and have never burned while wearing this.</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle hardly released any sunscreen. I sprayed for a long amount of time, before I had felt confident my skin was entirely covered. After only being in the sun for an hour, I found streaks of sunburn on my body. I was very surprised since I had rubbed in the sunscreen to make sure I was completely covered.  The only nice thing about the cooling effect is that I can use the useless spray to cool down my stinging sunburnt skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Our family loves this sunscreen!  Bought it at the last minute when my son was playing sand soccer on a hot weekend.  Used it on my sweaty son and my other 3 children, my husband and myself and none of us got burned!  Love the cooling sensation especially when we had to reapply after a few hours.  I have continued to use this sunscreen during soccer camps and cub scout camp and none of my children have received a sunburn!  A friend borrowed it for a day and she always burns, but didn&#x27;t after using this product.  We are stocking up for the summer!</li>
            <li> Works great but make sure you don&#x27;t miss a spot when you spray!! I&#x27;ve made that mistake many times...</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and not greasy like other sprays. Whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> Easy application, and it smells great! Can&#x27;t beat it! One application kept us from getting scortched during an all day adventure at Sea World when it was 95°!</li>
            <li> Nice spray wish they made a larger one.</li>
            <li> Banana Boat has long been my sunscreen of choice. Until now, I have used the cream product that comes in squeeze tubes. I use it when I go hiking or skiing in the mountains where the UV is more intense than at sea level. I used to use the SPF 30, but moved up to SPF 50 when the 50 became available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Banana Boat spray is interesting. It is easier to apply than the cream. It goes on easily and quickly with the exception that you are warned not to spray it on your face. You are advised to spray it on your hands and then rub it on your face. That does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of its ease of use, I am likely to use the spray for casual sun exposure, say bike riding or walking in partial shade, instead of using nothing because of the trouble involved with applying the cream variety. The spray does appear to be effective. Comparing, the spray can with the tube, I see that the active ingredients are similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative that I found is the odor. It is not all that strong, but does last quite a while. The inactive ingredients listed on the spray can indicate that a \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; has been added. I think that it is quite possible that the spray product would be better without the added fragrance.</li>
            <li> The product works great for me and my kiddos the only major downside to it is the really strong smell.  It&#x27;s not a very pleasant fragrance but it gets the job done.  I definitely don&#x27;t recommend spraying yourself or the kids down inside.</li>
            <li> I love spray on sunscreens. With four kids - it makes going to the beach so much easier. But this spray can has a tendency to stop spraying. You have to use both hands to hold it down to get it to spray. They need make it easier.</li>
            <li> I used this while in the sun for an hour and half to two hours. I ended with a horrible sunburn and some sort of rash (benadryl and cortisone did not help the rash). The rash may or may not be related to the sunscreen,  but I&#x27;m positive the sunburn was. I&#x27;ve read other reviews that had similar things happen....some reviewers loved it though.  It may be certain body chemistries mixed with this sunscreen. I wouldn&#x27;t risk it! Disappointed. ..threw it away after 1 use.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite sunscreen.  The spray doesn&#x27;t come out very strong. I didn&#x27;t feel my kids had good coverage with this spray.</li>
            <li> I bought these since they were on sale. I normally buy coppertone sport since it works well. The banana boat ones smell nice and go on easily from the spray canister. My only complaint is the spray stuff seems to wear off quicker then the coppertone which makes me wonder if it&#x27;s even there. Although I state that I haven&#x27;t gotten a sunburn so far. I will use both of the canisters up and then decide whether to get them again. I think they will be worthy of buying again and wouldn&#x27;t say against doing so.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like others, it is a little pricier, however its the brand and type I choose every time.</li>
