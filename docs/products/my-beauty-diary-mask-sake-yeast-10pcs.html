            <li>class LOL</li>
            <li>LOVE it!!</li>
            <li>Smells great, smooths skin, feels good.</li>
            <li>but it does a good job of moisturizing my face.</li>
            <li>Price is good considering the quality of the mask.</li>
            <li>All MBD masks feel good and are hydrating</li>
            <li>It IS my own fault, and they may be great if you have time for them, but I just do not...</li>
            <li>Good for post-peel redness/pain.  </li>
            <li>Use a good cleanser before hand as you don&#x27;t rinse off the serum.</li>
            <li>It also has a smell of alcohol, the pleasant kind.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>These feel amazing on the face.  </li>
            <li>This is a $13.99 for a box of 10 masks, an amazing deal.</li>
            <li>Very nice, makes my skin smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice, but this one is better.</li>
            <li>It smell like fermented alcohol, sweet and pleasant, which i quite like.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love using this mask.</li>
            <li>But turn out I like the royal jelly one better.  </li>
            <li>These are one of my favorite varieties of MBD masks.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make me break out, like many masks do.</li>
            <li>I love these mask, they are awesome if you have a dry face..</li>
            <li>I will preface this by saying I&#x27;ve got pretty good skin to begin with.  </li>
            <li>(you can always cut the mask to suit your face, which is nice), and the mask is good quality and soft.</li>
            <li>the mask does rips easily.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t that easy to use, it&#x27;s a bit tricky to get your nose, mouth, and eyes lined up with the holes in the mask.  </li>
            <li>It has a cool, refreshing feel.</li>
            <li>I love all my beauty diary sheet masks, not because they are cheap, but they are effective and really does hydrate your skin,</li>
            <li>The fit is alright</li>
            <li>I could see the light reflect on my cheek.</li>
            <li>If I had time to lounge around for 20 minutes, with my head back, so the mask would stay on, the might be great...</li>
            <li>The masks are easy to use, and there is so much product in the pouch that I roll up and staple the top</li>
            <li>I bought different kinds of My beauty Diary Mask, so far, Sake yeast masks make me feel the best after using.</li>
            <li>The main ingredient here is &#x27;sake kasu&#x27;, the lees left over from the brewing of sake, which is rumored to be very good for skin.</li>
            <li>I love that the MBD masks come with a backing, because it makes unfolding them so much easier.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an okay moisturizer, but doesn&#x27;t do much for the skin.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this mask.</li>
            <li>My face felt mildly tacky and sticky, I didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite out of all the mask &#x27;flavors&#x27; that My Beauty Diary offers!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried about six varieties of MBD masks, and so far sake yeast is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It smells fresh and make my skin refresh after 15 min mask time.</li>
            <li>the point of using masks is that you should use them consistently, if you can&#x27;t afford using expensive masks consistently then it&#x27;s better to use a cheaper alternative but using it daily(consistency), it&#x27;ll be more affective than doing something extremely good for your skin once in a while.</li>
            <li>But like everybody else, I&#x27;m always looking for that next product that will make it that much better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like handling a wet paper towel.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin incredibly smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>scent is actually not that strong.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s completely closed, and I have more to use by just gently smoothing it on my face</li>
            <li>That all I really have to say.</li>
            <li>My face is visibly brighter, much brighter.</li>
            <li>It makes me very relaxed.</li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling very refreshed with visibly clearer skin.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and I feel my face brighter after each use.</li>
            <li>I find this mask really moisturizing and the sake lees (it isn&#x27;t really yeast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very drippy and saturated with the product, so sitting up was a problem.  </li>
            <li>For some reason, my skin is one to two shades &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; after using this product, and also very moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I and my husband used this twice, and we agree that this mask really has moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li>It gives me a very healthful, glowing alabaster look.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have dull skin that needs lots of rich nourishing, this mask is for normal skin and works pretty well and feels light, I will probably buy another package!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t tear easily and has plenty of product, soaking wet.</li>
            <li>(in the past it was love ;)</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for it.  </li>
            <li>a collagen one and usually have very nice skin with few visible acne scars in spite of needing two rounds of accutane in high school.</li>
            <li>This has good amount of moisture in and even after 5 min, still mask will stay wet than any other mask that will cost same as this.  </li>
            <li>Very please, will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li>When I took this mask off, I was completely astonish.</li>
            <li>I also moisturize well and only use gentle cleanser, so that also help my skin stay balanced.</li>
            <li>contain enzymes that are supposed to keep skin looking young.</li>
            <li>This mask keeps my skin soft and I like it.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s nothing in it that would break up sun or age spots, unless they mean that it has an anti-inflammatory effect, which is very true.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, acne-prone, combination skin, and this mask not only hydrates my skin, it soothes it and helps to prevent breakouts.</li>
            <li>I had around 10 fresh scars on my cheek, and they all look less red and bumpy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the type that use mask often because I didn&#x27;t find much differences in my previous experiences.</li>

            <li> I used this on a day where it reaches over 100 degrees outside, and this mask felt like a refreshing glass of cold water.</li>
            <li> So this definitely doesnt give a lasting effect, but that is typical of a mask.&lt;br /&gt;Btw</li>
            <li> My nose is oily during summer, and my cheek is dry during winter.</li>
            <li> This mask doesn&#x27;t wrinkle as it gets dry.  </li>
            <li> Having said that, the BD Sake Yeast mask was no different and average for me.</li>
            <li> When opened, the mask is dripping wet with serum.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still wet</li>
            <li> No big deal, I laid down and then I had the product running down into my ears, eyes, and hair.  </li>
            <li> It is very thin, and fit my round shape</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not right for my skin type, it has a tendency towards oil buildup</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of different Beauty Diary masks over the past few years</li>
            <li> so I fold it in half and put it on my neck for another 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> not ideal for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Smells a little boozy</li>
            <li> One little problem is that I can&#x27;t adjust the smell of the sake.</li>
            <li> My skin was smoother, poreless, firm and just shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why MBD calls this a &#x27;brightening&#x27;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend the sake mask for any skin type, but especially skin in need of soothing or vulnerable to allergy or environmental irritants.</li>
            <li> and I think their formula is changing as it&#x27;s not as moisturizing as it was in the past.</li>
            <li> At least it was an inexpensive experiment.</li>
            <li> A very expensive skin care line sells a similar mask with sake yeast, the cost is $20 PER MASK!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love using this mask. It smells a bit like sake, but it works. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my acne but it does a good job of moisturizing my face. I like using it overnight.</li>
            <li> These feel amazing on the face.  That all I really have to say.</li>
            <li> I use it before bed and my skin brightens when i wake up in the morning. Did not itch or causes redness. Price is good considering the quality of the mask.</li>
            <li> I bought different kinds of My beauty Diary Mask, so far, Sake yeast masks make me feel the best after using. I don&#x27;t really have dull skin that needs lots of rich nourishing, this mask is for normal skin and works pretty well and feels light, I will probably buy another package!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite out of all the mask &#x27;flavors&#x27; that My Beauty Diary offers! I have sensitive, acne-prone, combination skin, and this mask not only hydrates my skin, it soothes it and helps to prevent breakouts. The main ingredient here is &#x27;sake kasu&#x27;, the lees left over from the brewing of sake, which is rumored to be very good for skin. The fit is alright (you can always cut the mask to suit your face, which is nice), and the mask is good quality and soft. I love that the MBD masks come with a backing, because it makes unfolding them so much easier. I&#x27;m not sure why MBD calls this a &#x27;brightening&#x27; mask- there&#x27;s nothing in it that would break up sun or age spots, unless they mean that it has an anti-inflammatory effect, which is very true. I&#x27;d recommend the sake mask for any skin type, but especially skin in need of soothing or vulnerable to allergy or environmental irritants.</li>
            <li> Smells a little boozy but it made my skin look incredible. All MBD masks feel good and are hydrating but this actually made a visible difference in the look and texture of my skin. Very please, will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> I received this mask from my friend who went study abroad in Taiwan. These MBD mask are all the rage there. I&#x27;m not the type that use mask often because I didn&#x27;t find much differences in my previous experiences. But one day while cleaning up my room, I found this in my cosmetic drawer, so I decided to put it to use. When opened, the mask is dripping wet with serum. It is very thin, and fit my round shape face well. It also has a smell of alcohol, the pleasant kind. It smell like fermented alcohol, sweet and pleasant, which i quite like.&lt;br /&gt;I put this mask on for over 40 minutes. It has a cool, refreshing feel. I used this on a day where it reaches over 100 degrees outside, and this mask felt like a refreshing glass of cold water. I felt my face tighten a bit, but it could also because of the mask tightening as it dries. When I took this mask off, I was completely astonish. My face is visibly brighter, much brighter. My skin was smoother, poreless, firm and just shine. I could see the light reflect on my cheek. I had around 10 fresh scars on my cheek, and they all look less red and bumpy. This mask totally changed my view on sheet masks. I ventured out and tried a couple of different brand, and some from MBD as well, but I always come back to this.&lt;br /&gt;THe effect lasted throughout the next day. By the 3rd or 4th day, my skin became duller again. So this definitely doesnt give a lasting effect, but that is typical of a mask.&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I have combination-normal skin. My nose is oily during summer, and my cheek is dry during winter. I also moisturize well and only use gentle cleanser, so that also help my skin stay balanced.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for it.  But turn out I like the royal jelly one better.  but still a great product</li>
            <li> not ideal for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The mask seems just get from the wine. I like it verymuch. It makes me very relaxed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of different Beauty Diary masks over the past few years and I think their formula is changing as it&#x27;s not as moisturizing as it was in the past. Having said that, the BD Sake Yeast mask was no different and average for me. Either that or the weather is a lot dryer now which could be the case. I still like the masks (in the past it was love ;) and I will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> If I had time to lounge around for 20 minutes, with my head back, so the mask would stay on, the might be great...but I don&#x27;t. So, they (of course) fall off and I get about 2 minutes use out of them. It IS my own fault, and they may be great if you have time for them, but I just do not...</li>
            <li> I love these mask, they are awesome if you have a dry face..it keeps your skin hydrated for hours. I use it every night and it worked wonders with my face</li>
            <li> These are one of my favorite varieties of MBD masks. Leaves you feeling very refreshed with visibly clearer skin. There is a sake scent but I don&#x27;t mind it at all!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is very moisturizing and I feel my face brighter after each use. I only do facial mask once a week, and it works well!</li>
            <li> Smells great, smooths skin, feels good. But it&#x27;s not right for my skin type, it has a tendency towards oil buildup</li>
            <li> Just so so...Moisture, but does not work for pores... And the mask has the alcohol smell, so don&#x27;t use it before class LOL</li>
            <li> Good for post-peel redness/pain.  Used after Levulon and CO2 lasers.</li>
            <li> I love all my beauty diary sheet masks, not because they are cheap, but they are effective and really does hydrate your skin, the point of using masks is that you should use them consistently, if you can&#x27;t afford using expensive masks consistently then it&#x27;s better to use a cheaper alternative but using it daily(consistency), it&#x27;ll be more affective than doing something extremely good for your skin once in a while.</li>
            <li> I find this mask really moisturizing and the sake lees (it isn&#x27;t really yeast but the particles left after sake is made) contain enzymes that are supposed to keep skin looking young. I alternate it with a red ginseng mask and a collagen one and usually have very nice skin with few visible acne scars in spite of needing two rounds of accutane in high school. Use a good cleanser before hand as you don&#x27;t rinse off the serum.</li>
            <li> scent is actually not that strong.  the mask does rips easily. it&#x27;s an okay moisturizer, but doesn&#x27;t do much for the skin.</li>
            <li> I will preface this by saying I&#x27;ve got pretty good skin to begin with.  But like everybody else, I&#x27;m always looking for that next product that will make it that much better.  This product isn&#x27;t that easy to use, it&#x27;s a bit tricky to get your nose, mouth, and eyes lined up with the holes in the mask.  It&#x27;s kind of like handling a wet paper towel. It&#x27;s very drippy and saturated with the product, so sitting up was a problem.  No big deal, I laid down and then I had the product running down into my ears, eyes, and hair.  I was continuously wiping up with a towel.  I wouldn&#x27;t have cared about the inconvenience at all if it made a difference to my skin, but it didn&#x27;t.  The instructions say to leave the remaining goo on your face after you remove the mask and rub it into the skin, which I did.  My face felt mildly tacky and sticky, I didn&#x27;t like it.  At least it was an inexpensive experiment.</li>
            <li> Very nice, makes my skin smooth and hydrated. Doesn&#x27;t tear easily and has plenty of product, soaking wet. I use it on my face for 20 minutes and it it&#x27;s still wet so I fold it in half and put it on my neck for another 20 minutes. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about six varieties of MBD masks, and so far sake yeast is my favorite.  For some reason, my skin is one to two shades &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; after using this product, and also very moisturized.  LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> One little problem is that I can&#x27;t adjust the smell of the sake. Hopefully, I will get use to it. Aside from this problem, nothing bothers me. I and my husband used this twice, and we agree that this mask really has moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li> This mask doesn&#x27;t wrinkle as it gets dry.  This has good amount of moisture in and even after 5 min, still mask will stay wet than any other mask that will cost same as this.  This lines of mask which they have lots of different kinds I would suggest because of these reason.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and make my skin refresh after 15 min mask time. It also brighten my skin tone and reduce the scar of acne.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this mask. It makes my skin incredibly smooth and soft. It calms and soothes my complexion every time I use it, makes it look even-toned and lightens spots. It doesn&#x27;t make me break out, like many masks do. I also have the Royal Jelly mask - it&#x27;s nice, but this one is better. The masks are easy to use, and there is so much product in the pouch that I roll up and staple the top so it&#x27;s completely closed, and I have more to use by just gently smoothing it on my face (I don&#x27;t re-use the actual cloth mask). A very expensive skin care line sells a similar mask with sake yeast, the cost is $20 PER MASK! This is a $13.99 for a box of 10 masks, an amazing deal. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This mask keeps my skin soft and I like it.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says! Your face instantly looks BRIGHTER! It gives me a very healthful, glowing alabaster look.</li>
