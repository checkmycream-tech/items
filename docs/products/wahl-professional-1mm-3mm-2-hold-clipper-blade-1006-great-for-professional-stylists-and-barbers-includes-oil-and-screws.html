            <li>This blade was a perfect fit for my Sterling Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li>It allows you to get a cleaner cut than using a guard attachment and because of the thickness of the blade it does not cut too close, so you get a good even blend.</li>
            <li>It is a good quality blade</li>
            <li>and they fit perfectly.</li>

            <li>They fit perfectly and cut my hair very smoothly.</li>
            <li>Fit perfect, quick delivery</li>
            <li>The replacement blades gives a much better cut with fewer passes.</li>
            <li>Make sure you are buying for the appropriate Wahl clipper.</li>
            <li>fits fine</li>
            <li>It comes out looking just fine.</li>
            <li>The screws are not as good as original if replacement is for older clippers.</li>
            <li>I do not have my full set of clippers while deployed</li>
            <li>I needed replacement blades for an older Wahl clipper and the manufacturer instructions showed this part number.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I decided to become my own barber due to cost and dissatisfaction with multiple barbers.</li>
            <li>I have purchased genuine Wahl Blades through Amazon before and they worked as expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just replace my blade and it works like a new one.</li>

            <li> These blades cut just fine and should last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> These are perfect for cutting high on the sides of the head when cutting a fade.  </li>
            <li> This year, I noticed two different entries for the same product and one with a slightly cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I have a Wahl set with each clipper made to cut a differently from the other.  </li>
            <li> so I match these with the 2191 (fade blade) on my other set of clippers.  </li>
            <li> It has a very sharp edge allowing me to cut through very thick hair and also with ease and precision.</li>

            <li> This blade was a perfect fit for my Sterling Wahl clippers. It has a very sharp edge allowing me to cut through very thick hair and also with ease and precision. Thank you</li>
            <li> Blades work great and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> These blades are awesome! I decided to switch these out with the Precision blades on my Wahl Color Pro and I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results. The replacement blades gives a much better cut with fewer passes. I decided to become my own barber due to cost and dissatisfaction with multiple barbers. This combo works great!</li>
            <li> These blades cut just fine and should last for a long time.  They fit perfectly and cut my hair very smoothly.</li>
            <li> I have owned these blades before.  I have a Wahl set with each clipper made to cut a differently from the other.

            <li> Fit perfect, quick delivery</li>
            <li> No problems. Product as promised. fits fine</li>
            <li> It is a good quality blade</li>
            <li> The screws are not as good as original if replacement is for older clippers.</li>
            <li> I use this blade to trim the face and feet of my standard poodle.  Perfect size cut.  I use the 5F for the rest of her. It comes out looking just fine.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. Make sure you are buying for the appropriate Wahl clipper. Comes with extra lube in case you run out.</li>
            <li> Product as described and excellent customer service</li>
            <li> The originals wahl super taper blades; perfect. Cuts like hell. Highly recommended. I&#x27;ve just replace my blade and it works like a new one.</li>
            <li> I needed replacement blades for an older Wahl clipper and the manufacturer instructions showed this part number.  Couldn&#x27;t find them in the stores so purchased these blades on Amazon and they fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have purchased genuine Wahl Blades through Amazon before and they worked as expected. This year, I noticed two different entries for the same product and one with a slightly cheaper price. I went cheaper. My mistake. These blades couldn&#x27;t cut butter - they were duller than the pair I was trying to replace. I noticed that the instructions were in English and Chinese, so I am wondering if these were factory rejects or counterfeits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morale of the story - buy the slightly more expensive pair because these do not work.</li>
