            <li>hope you all enjoy using these and share some pics :) @tisonlyme143  </li>
            <li>It arrived early which is great.</li>
            <li>Arrived before scheduled date and there&#x27;s so many fun ways to use everything!</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product!</li>
            <li>other then that it was perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>but the brushes come apart a bit too easily, had to glue them together the day I got them.</li>
            <li>Nice and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re perfect to use to decorate your nails in pretty different designs and gemstones.</li>
            <li>Thanks i will be buying more products from you again!</li>
            <li>The dotting tools make it easy to do fun nail designs!</li>
            <li>I do use the gems too and find them great for little accents of color on top of a cute design.</li>
            <li>It took quite awhile for shipping, but she sure has had fun with it.</li>
            <li>Daughter will enjoy it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the wheels, even though they are smaller than what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Thought the kit was basically &#x27;cheap&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>that cause the shipping was free.</li>
            <li>Both the brushes and the dotting tools don&#x27;t seem like cheap tools at all.</li>
            <li>I am happy with my purchase, overall.</li>
            <li>For the price-this kit is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>Do not order this, it is cheap.</li>
            <li>Took pics after I opened the pkg, took clear crystals out of the package as it was opaque and couldn’t get a good view of them...</li>
            <li>The dotting tools and the jewels were very useful, however the brush brittles were all glued together and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>and it was SUPER cheap but not made cheap..</li>
            <li>I love this kit so so much!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for the price this item is well worth it!</li>
            <li>so I assume there are professional brushes out there) and perfect for me for home use, the other tools are really cute too.</li>
            <li>But you must clean your brushes and dotting tools or your design will be messed up.</li>
            <li>The number of crystals is more than I expected, the brushes seem like good quality (but I am a DIY’er</li>
            <li>Fun for nails...  quick and easy</li>
            <li>They are still filled with many different, colorful rhinestones to choose from! :)</li>
            <li>Super excited to get designing.</li>
            <li>Other than that, there products are great and worth every penny!</li>
            <li>They are good for simple designs.</li>
            <li>Cool nail art kit.</li>
            <li>It took some time to learn how to use the dotting tools but it is pretty easy.</li>
            <li>Such a great price for very helpful tools.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what it is and couldn&#x27;t be the price!  </li>
            <li>Great little kit for anyone who loves nail art.</li>
            <li>Just be prepared, shipping will take a month at minimum (Cheeky-Beauty out of Hong Kong), but it was free shipping, so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>A lot of fun.</li>
            <li>Only thing is that you gotta find your own way to put the design on.</li>
            <li>These are fun and lots to choose from in the kit.</li>
            <li>Worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>They came quicker than I expected them to and in good shape.</li>
            <li>well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>This set however is worth the money for the dotting tools and nail art brushes.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Nice set...too long to ship</li>
            <li>This was an awesome deal for me because i see other sales probably as much as this but only have the tools or one of these</li>
            <li>My daughter stole my first one.</li>
            <li>Everything that you see there is exactly how it looks when you get it.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Slow delivery but product was as described, happy customer</li>
            <li>I just love your products&amp; would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>might be higher or lower</li>
            <li>This was a present and my cousin love it...</li>
            <li>Everything is exactly as advertised, but I did not like the brushes.</li>
            <li>and they do not last on your fingers for more then five minutes.</li>
            <li>Was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>item exactly to description</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive and worth the price.</li>
            <li>Items came a day early and Im excited about using them.</li>
            <li>I love all the colors they give you and how much you actually get when you order this..</li>
            <li>Thanks alot</li>
            <li>The nail brushes don&#x27;t really work, maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to use them.</li>
            <li>Really like the jewels and the dotters.</li>
            <li>They are everything i expected and more.</li>
            <li>BTW thanks for the fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li>Fast fast shipping.</li>
            <li>i really like all these tools</li>
            <li>I started getting into doing my own nails since i fee like going to a salon is a waste of money.</li>
            <li>The dotting tools are nice, i haven&#x27;t used the brushes yet, and the rhinestone containers are small around 2 1/2 inches across.</li>
            <li>For the price I just love them and cant wait to use on my daughters little fingers.</li>
            <li>Love them and can&#x27;t wait to try them on my friends nails instead of mine because mine are short and theirs are long.</li>
            <li>Love the tools but the rinestone wheels are smaller than i expected.</li>
            <li>Everything is exactly the same as the picture.</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised that my order came in almost a week before it needed to!</li>
            <li>Estimated delivery was September 29-october 16, I received it a week early!  </li>
            <li>The tools are pretty sturdy and should easily last through her interest.</li>
            <li>Once the nail has had a little more time to dry completely I put a clear topcoat over the design and gem to really lock the gem in place!</li>
            <li>I just know that my daughter is changing her nail colors almost daily and seems to really like all the gee gaws.</li>
            <li>As far as price and product lets just say you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>iv have also used them for various unrelated projects and they held up very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the creation on her nail came out as professional</li>
            <li>My order came in 2weeks early</li>
            <li>it does not matter if you are young as a teenager or as old as I am  ( nana here )</li>
            <li>Love the tools and jewels but the brushes not so much it seems like they are of poor quality</li>
            <li>The shipping was a month long though I can&#x27;t complain so much about</li>
            <li>The brushes provide a thin line of polish if applied with a steady and light pressured hand.</li>
            <li>I will say that I didn&#x27;t realize the clear gems are different shapes, but that&#x27;s my mistake -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna order from this seller again in the near future.</li>
            <li>I had to super glue a few of back together.</li>
            <li>Holy cow that was fast..</li>

            <li> It arrived early which is great.</li>
            <li> Arrived before scheduled date and there&#x27;s so many fun ways to use everything!</li>
            <li> Other than that, great product!</li>
            <li> other then that it was perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> but the brushes come apart a bit too easily, had to glue them together the day I got them.</li>
            <li> Nice and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re perfect to use to decorate your nails in pretty different designs and gemstones.</li>
            <li> Thanks i will be buying more products from you again!</li>
            <li> The dotting tools make it easy to do fun nail designs!</li>
            <li> I do use the gems too and find them great for little accents of color on top of a cute design.</li>
            <li> It took quite awhile for shipping, but she sure has had fun with it.</li>
            <li> Daughter will enjoy it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the wheels, even though they are smaller than what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Thought the kit was basically &#x27;cheap&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> that cause the shipping was free.</li>
            <li> Both the brushes and the dotting tools don&#x27;t seem like cheap tools at all.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase, overall.</li>
            <li> For the price-this kit is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> Do not order this, it is cheap.</li>
            <li> Took pics after I opened the pkg, took clear crystals out of the package as it was opaque and couldn’t get a good view of them...</li>
            <li> The dotting tools and the jewels were very useful, however the brush brittles were all glued together and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> and it was SUPER cheap but not made cheap..</li>
            <li> I love this kit so so much!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for the price this item is well worth it!</li>
            <li> so I assume there are professional brushes out there) and perfect for me for home use, the other tools are really cute too.</li>
            <li> But you must clean your brushes and dotting tools or your design will be messed up.</li>
            <li> The number of crystals is more than I expected, the brushes seem like good quality (but I am a DIY’er</li>
            <li> Fun for nails...  quick and easy</li>
            <li> They are still filled with many different, colorful rhinestones to choose from! :)</li>
            <li> Super excited to get designing.</li>
            <li> Other than that, there products are great and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> They are good for simple designs.</li>
            <li> Cool nail art kit.</li>
            <li> It took some time to learn how to use the dotting tools but it is pretty easy.</li>
            <li> Such a great price for very helpful tools.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what it is and couldn&#x27;t be the price!  </li>
            <li> Great little kit for anyone who loves nail art.</li>
            <li> Just be prepared, shipping will take a month at minimum (Cheeky-Beauty out of Hong Kong), but it was free shipping, so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> A lot of fun.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that you gotta find your own way to put the design on.</li>
            <li> These are fun and lots to choose from in the kit.</li>
            <li> Worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> They came quicker than I expected them to and in good shape.</li>
            <li> well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> This set however is worth the money for the dotting tools and nail art brushes.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Nice set...too long to ship</li>
            <li> This was an awesome deal for me because i see other sales probably as much as this but only have the tools or one of these</li>
            <li> My daughter stole my first one.</li>
            <li> Everything that you see there is exactly how it looks when you get it.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Slow delivery but product was as described, happy customer</li>
            <li> I just love your products&amp; would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> might be higher or lower</li>
            <li> This was a present and my cousin love it...</li>
            <li> Everything is exactly as advertised, but I did not like the brushes.</li>
            <li> and they do not last on your fingers for more then five minutes.</li>
            <li> Was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> item exactly to description</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Items came a day early and Im excited about using them.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors they give you and how much you actually get when you order this..</li>
            <li> Thanks alot</li>
            <li> The nail brushes don&#x27;t really work, maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to use them.</li>
            <li> Really like the jewels and the dotters.</li>
            <li> They are everything i expected and more.</li>
            <li> BTW thanks for the fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> Fast fast shipping.</li>
            <li> i really like all these tools</li>
            <li> I started getting into doing my own nails since i fee like going to a salon is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The dotting tools are nice, i haven&#x27;t used the brushes yet, and the rhinestone containers are small around 2 1/2 inches across.</li>
            <li> For the price I just love them and cant wait to use on my daughters little fingers.</li>
            <li> Love them and can&#x27;t wait to try them on my friends nails instead of mine because mine are short and theirs are long.</li>
            <li> Love the tools but the rinestone wheels are smaller than i expected.</li>
            <li> Everything is exactly the same as the picture.</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised that my order came in almost a week before it needed to!</li>
            <li> Estimated delivery was September 29-october 16, I received it a week early!  </li>
            <li> The tools are pretty sturdy and should easily last through her interest.</li>
            <li> Once the nail has had a little more time to dry completely I put a clear topcoat over the design and gem to really lock the gem in place!</li>
            <li> I just know that my daughter is changing her nail colors almost daily and seems to really like all the gee gaws.</li>
            <li> As far as price and product lets just say you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> iv have also used them for various unrelated projects and they held up very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the creation on her nail came out as professional</li>
            <li> My order came in 2weeks early</li>
            <li> it does not matter if you are young as a teenager or as old as I am  ( nana here )</li>
            <li> Love the tools and jewels but the brushes not so much it seems like they are of poor quality</li>
            <li> The shipping was a month long though I can&#x27;t complain so much about</li>
            <li> The brushes provide a thin line of polish if applied with a steady and light pressured hand.</li>
            <li> I will say that I didn&#x27;t realize the clear gems are different shapes, but that&#x27;s my mistake -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna order from this seller again in the near future.</li>
            <li> I had to super glue a few of back together.</li>
            <li> Holy cow that was fast..</li>
            <li> the only thing is that the long black brushes get messed up fast.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t speak to &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34;, as I&#x27;m really not sure what a quality product in nails would look like.</li>
            <li> The sparkle container is much smaller than expected though.</li>
            <li> Shipping was long.</li>
            <li> It came with everything and arrived earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> My Gems arrived all mixed up, and the container for the gems is not very useful.</li>
            <li> the only thing with the set i can give all 5 stars is due to shipping it takes a while to get to you.</li>
            <li> took a very long time to get in</li>
            <li> The tip of the brushes and dotting tools sometimes became loose and even came off.</li>
            <li> It took me a little while to figure out how to open the studs case.</li>
            <li> I had put it in with some other nail items</li>
            <li> The only complaint is the gems.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected and the gem boxes where to small.</li>
            <li> The brushes are a little unwieldy.</li>
            <li> I feel a little bummed.</li>
            <li> She Never puts them down since she got them !  </li>
            <li> Very poore,very bad,,,,,,,</li>
            <li> I expected this to be cheep poor quality just to get me by.</li>
            <li> Did not use the Rhinestones as they were way to small.</li>
            <li> It is hard to choose!</li>
            <li> I was not happy that it took around a month to arrive.  </li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that my dotting tools did not come in the box</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this set.</li>
            <li> [:[:</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>

            <li> This is a great set. This is my second purchase of this set. My daughter stole my first one. However, both purchases took FOREVER to arrive. Just be prepared, shipping will take a month at minimum (Cheeky-Beauty out of Hong Kong), but it was free shipping, so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! I got everything all at once. Just to me who uses dotting tools, they felt a tad bit smaller and thinner than what I am used to. Other than that, there products are great and worth every penny! I love them all.</li>

            <li> It took me a little while to figure out how to open the studs case. Once I figured it out it was all good. I use everything. It&#x27;s all perfect for a great price.</li>

            <li> It took quite awhile for shipping, but she sure has had fun with it. I really can&#x27;t speak to &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34;, as I&#x27;m really not sure what a quality product in nails would look like. I just know that my daughter is changing her nail colors almost daily and seems to really like all the gee gaws. LOL - if you have someone who likes to play with her nails (and everyone else&#x27;s) - this product is for her!</li>
            <li> Really like the jewels and the dotters. Easy to use. The brushes are a little unwieldy. They are good for simple designs.</li>

            <li> Took a while to get, but I am happy.</li>
            <li> we cant stop doing our nails</li>
            <li> The dotting tools and the jewels were very useful, however the brush brittles were all glued together and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Great price, fun things to work with but the brushes come apart a bit too easily, had to glue them together the day I got them.</li>
            <li> Great little kit for anyone who loves nail art. A+</li>
            <li> Its good and all. Only thing is that you gotta find your own way to put the design on. Besides that its great!</li>
            <li> Perfect!  I expected this to be cheep poor quality just to get me by. But it&#x27;s great. They came individually wrapped, and the quality was awesome worth a lot more than I paid!</li>
            <li> I really liked the variety of things for the price! I love the rhinestones and can&#x27;t wait to try them out! I also liked that this order came with free shipping. I ordered this at the end of December and it was supposed to arrive between January 22 - February 3rd. I was happily surprised that my order came in almost a week before it needed to! Everything in the kit matched what was pictured/described. The rhinestone wheels may look like they are going to be bigger wheels, but I took a picture of my kit to clarify. I&#x27;m happy with the wheels, even though they are smaller than what I was expecting. They are still filled with many different, colorful rhinestones to choose from! :)</li>
            <li> I love this kit so so much! It came with everything it says! But you must clean your brushes and dotting tools or your design will be messed up.</li>
            <li> service was quick and product was good and being used rapidly.</li>
            <li> Everything that you see there is exactly how it looks when you get it. It&#x27;s pretty good quality and it works perfect for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality product and you can do some amazing designs with the gems, brushes, and the dotting tools. Definitely would buy again!</li>
            <li> Had to wait a month for shipping. If I had known I was ordering from over seas I would&#x27;ve ordered elsewhere.  As far as price and product lets just say you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> They work real good!!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this set.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it is and couldn&#x27;t be the price!  The sparkle container is much smaller than expected though.</li>
            <li> very nice came on time stones are cute .yes would buy again</li>
            <li> The tip of the brushes and dotting tools sometimes became loose and even came off. I had to super glue a few of back together. But considering the price, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Love the tools set. Very good price.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the strippers cause they became very streaky every time I use them, but everything else is great to use!</li>
            <li> These tools are great! They&#x27;re perfect to use to decorate your nails in pretty different designs and gemstones. Definitely recommend to others who want to spice up their nails!</li>
            <li> These are great for anyone who enjoys doing their nails!  Such a great price for very helpful tools.  I will say that I didn&#x27;t realize the clear gems are different shapes, but that&#x27;s my mistake - I should have looked closer at the photo.</li>
            <li> just as described and shipped fairly quickly , the brushes are nice and dont fall apart love it</li>
            <li> Did not use the Rhinestones as they were way to small. There also were not that many included. The dotting tools were awesome. Very strong with great sizes. iv have also used them for various unrelated projects and they held up very well.&lt;br /&gt;These are a GO!</li>
            <li> Estimated delivery was September 29-october 16, I received it a week early!  I love it! I tried the dotting tools which I have been waiting for it to put to use :) I have yet to try the rest! Thank you so much! I&#x27;m gonna order from this seller again in the near future.</li>
            <li> Very poore,very bad,,,,,,,</li>
            <li> i received it have not used it yet but look and seems good</li>
            <li> Picked this up for my 10 year-old grandaughter for Christmas.  There are TONS of sequins to work with, all in a variety of great colors. The tools are pretty sturdy and should easily last through her interest.</li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; love theses tools and says it&#x27;s a great bargain. Shipping was long.</li>
            <li> Well...it did arrive a couple days before Christmas so I could give it to my teenage granddaughter.  I did think the kit was..well, really basic.  I was not happy that it took around a month to arrive.  Thought the kit was basically &#x27;cheap&#x27;.  Don&#x27;t know if granddaughter actually liked it or not...haven&#x27;t heard.  I had put it in with some other nail items so she had kind of a &#x27;kit&#x27;.  Won&#x27;t be ordering anything like this again!</li>
            <li> Perfect! Good quality!!!!!</li>
            <li> took a very long time to get in but once I received it I fell in love with the product. brushes are great and so are each of the tools. The silver stones come in different shapes and sizes. This product def. leaves room for creativity.</li>
            <li> Love it! Very good quality</li>
            <li> Nice set...too long to ship</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for the price this item is well worth it!</li>
            <li> Great gift for my 10 yr old</li>
            <li> item just as described</li>
            <li> Slow delivery but product was as described, happy customer</li>
            <li> These are fun and lots to choose from in the kit. Finally learned to just dab my nail with one of the sticks then it will hold the gems for easy placement :)</li>
            <li> I placed my order on august 2nd and the shipping was suppose to come between September 2nd-18th but i just received my products here in the mail on august 20th. They are everything i expected and more. For the price I just love them and cant wait to use on my daughters little fingers. I just love your products&amp; would definitely purchase again. Thanks i will be buying more products from you again! BTW thanks for the fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> Great value! Worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> They came quicker than I expected them to and in good shape. The dotting tools are a godsend and the brushes have been put to good use already!</li>
            <li> Love the tools but the rinestone wheels are smaller than i expected. In the picture they&#x27;re magnified to look bigger.</li>
            <li> might be higher or lower I dont know how to use dotting tools</li>
            <li> Nice set but took some time to receive</li>
            <li> I purchased this to decorate my daughter&#x27;s nails. It took some time to learn how to use the dotting tools but it is pretty easy.</li>
            <li> This was a present and my cousin love it... the creation on her nail came out as professional</li>
            <li> Perfect decor set for my gel nails.  I love!</li>
            <li> Everything is exactly as advertised, but I did not like the brushes. The bristles were way too short for me. However, I loved everything else.</li>
            <li> YAASSSSSSS! GREATER PRICE AND A BARGAIN! I LOL ONE IT</li>
            <li> Arrived before scheduled date and there&#x27;s so many fun ways to use everything! I feel a little bummed. I know the description doesn&#x27;t say the tweezers were included, but the pictures made it seem as if they were. Other than that, great product!</li>
            <li> Items came a day early and Im excited about using them.</li>
            <li> The tools in this kit are great. The only complaint is the gems. I suggest see if this company has another kit without them in it. The get everywhere and they do not last on your fingers for more then five minutes. I would order rom this company again.</li>
            <li> I hate it. Not what I expected and the gem boxes where to small. It was even smaller than what it looks like in the picture. The shipping was a month long though I can&#x27;t complain so much about that cause the shipping was free.</li>
            <li> So many gems and so many shapes. It is hard to choose! The marbling tools and are brushes are the nicest I have ever had in 29 years of doing nails. I am highly impressed!</li>
            <li> Was exactly as advertised. Thank you!</li>
            <li> These are beautiful! I LOVE the brushes. Perfect for details.</li>
            <li> ITS AWSOME MY DAUGHTER LOVE IT</li>
            <li> It came with everything and arrived earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> Awesome amount of items for the price well worth the wait. Super excited to get designing.</li>
            <li> Perfect. My order came in 2weeks early so I was very happy about that. The brushes are great! The dotting tools are just perfect. They come in all sizes which is great. Both the brushes and the dotting tools don&#x27;t seem like cheap tools at all. I was pleased with that. Also, the rhinestones are just beautiful ♥ my package was delivered with everything in place and in perfect condition. Wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order this again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Forgot I ordered it so it was like a surprise.</li>
            <li> This was an awesome deal for me because i see other sales probably as much as this but only have the tools or one of these but this deal is awesome it has the brushes and dotting tools and gems (:</li>
            <li> My Daughter loved it, good seller!!</li>
            <li> My Gems arrived all mixed up, and the container for the gems is not very useful. I ended up pouring all the gems into a baggie since the colors were already not separated correctly. This set however is worth the money for the dotting tools and nail art brushes. The dotting tools make it easy to do fun nail designs! The brushes provide a thin line of polish if applied with a steady and light pressured hand. I do use the gems too and find them great for little accents of color on top of a cute design. You paint your nail and let it sit for 1 to 2 minutes, then apply a gem once the nail has become &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34;. Once the nail has had a little more time to dry completely I put a clear topcoat over the design and gem to really lock the gem in place! I feel like for the price of this set you get a pretty good deal since so many tools are also included. I am happy with my purchase, overall.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Nice and shiny. Tools are helpful for designs you see done in salons. Great price!</li>
            <li> Wow, I am super impressed. For the price-this kit is absolutely fantastic. The number of crystals is more than I expected, the brushes seem like good quality (but I am a DIY’er so I assume there are professional brushes out there) and perfect for me for home use, the other tools are really cute too. Shipping was more than 1 week faster than earliest estimate. Will order more from this brand. Took pics after I opened the pkg, took clear crystals out of the package as it was opaque and couldn’t get a good view of them...</li>
            <li> I love all the colors they give you and how much you actually get when you order this.. it does not matter if you are young as a teenager or as old as I am  ( nana here ) you will definitely love what you can do with these on your nails :) hope you all enjoy using these and share some pics :) @tisonlyme143  hope this helps</li>
            <li> You get everything that you see. The dotting tools are nice, i haven&#x27;t used the brushes yet, and the rhinestone containers are small around 2 1/2 inches across.</li>
            <li> It arrived early which is great. Everything was of great quality. The only thing I dislike is the capping of the gems, but it&#x27;s just a personal preference. Awesome.</li>
            <li> Still getting the swing of using these items but its exactly what I ordered with a great diamond variety!</li>
            <li> took forever to get her but was on time..I love this set its all in one and its great for those who are newbies at doing nails..I was a little disappointed that my dotting tools did not come in the box that I heard all cheeky dotting tools come in..but over all I was VERY HAPPY with this buy and it was SUPER cheap but not made cheap..</li>
            <li> Love the tools and jewels but the brushes not so much it seems like they are of poor quality the bristles of the brush keeps coming out when i do mt nails. I recommend the tools and jewels but not the brushes</li>
            <li> Love them. Fast fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried out the brushes yet but the dotting tools are great and the rhinestones are a bonus too for a perfect design.</li>
            <li> item exactly to description</li>
            <li> I started getting into doing my own nails since i fee like going to a salon is a waste of money. i really like all these tools the only thing is that the long black brushes get messed up fast. other then that it was perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Really great tools &amp; jewels. I am pleased with all of them.</li>
            <li> Great item, great price, tons of fun</li>
            <li> I love the brushes. This kit is a must have for anyone who does nails. Well worth the money.</li>

            <li> good amount of product for a good price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried to use these on my nails yet, but the items seem to be a good value for the price.</li>
