            <li>It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Not the best.  </li>
            <li>And the price is great too</li>
            <li>Arrived in great shape</li>
            <li>Eyebrows on FLEEK (lol)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find this brow gel particularly great.</li>
            <li>Great product to use on my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice product.  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe I didn&#x27;t own this sooner!</li>
            <li>A great product that I am so glad I found!</li>
            <li>but otherwise it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something that is inexpensive but good quality, I recommend this item.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t call it exceptional.</li>
            <li>Good price for a nice product.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I mostly like  that this product does not cause any flakes!</li>
            <li>I probably need a wax of some kind</li>
            <li>Also came with some nice tweasers!&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING</li>
            <li>Very light</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure this would work</li>
            <li>but I really love it.  </li>
            <li>caused a couple pimples, but does the job, for the most part</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brow gel and it has become one of my favorite must have items.</li>
            <li>The gel did not flake nor turned white and brows remained perfectly in place.</li>
            <li>Very happy with product.. will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>and I will buy more when I need more.  </li>
            <li>This works better than some</li>
            <li>I love the way this helps my eyebrows to look groomed for a well polished look.</li>
            <li>But okay.  </li>
            <li>I found Avon&#x27;s brow gel to work better.  </li>
            <li>but has a great hold and no stiff or sticky feel!</li>
            <li>It lasts most of the day if not all, and washes off easily in the evening.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok product for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>Works well, comes out on the brush and applies easily to the brows.</li>
            <li>Good as a clear mascara, but not as a brow gel.</li>
            <li>I love this so so much!</li>
            <li>Loving this simple but efficient brow gel after using many others.</li>
            <li>Keeps loose eyebrow hairs in place and works as a great mascara.</li>
            <li>At such good price, this is an unbeatable brow gel.</li>
            <li>I have extremely unruly eyebrows, and this has been a great help in taming them.</li>
            <li>Buy it, you will only love it!</li>
            <li>Very fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>It seems to work pretty well when I remember to use it.</li>
            <li>Love this and left it on my order again</li>
            <li>It does kind of leave a residue on the eyebrow hair though which needs to be wiped away a little bit</li>
            <li>My brows, now that I am older are a bit more thinner and scraggly and the grey hairs coarser.</li>
            <li>Makes them look really polished and neat.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>for those of us with crazy brows, this is perfect</li>
            <li>but the brush gathers and slathers on way too much product, so it is wasteful.</li>
            <li>It works really well for getting my eyebrows to fall in the correct way.</li>
            <li>I look neat and polished every day now thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>This is really helpful now that fuller brows are the preferred beauty look.</li>
            <li>It would probably help in a less challenging situation.</li>
            <li>The only downside is it runs out quickly</li>
            <li>Seems not only conditioning but is also FLAKE FREE so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d help if your brows just need a little taming, but not if they need a chair and a whip, like mine.</li>
            <li>Brows behave without any indication of make-up, which is how I like it, but it doesn&#x27;t last all day long, most of a day though.</li>
            <li>A little thicker/wetter look than expected, but overall pretty good for price.</li>
            <li>Love the low price compared to other brow gels.</li>
            <li>No crusting and no odd smell!</li>
            <li>It goes on clear.</li>
            <li>I work long hours and truly put this product to the test on a hot humid day.</li>
            <li>Great brow gel that doesn&#x27;t flake and isn&#x27;t too expensive!</li>
            <li>I can put it on easily and even brush over my eyebrows without the gel being stiff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks on brows, side burns and general hairline</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s not a strong hold at all so it does absolutely nothing for stray eyebrows</li>
            <li> My teen daughter uses this product daily and it helps keep her brows flat during the day at school.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I have to wipe off a lot of excess gel before applying since too much comes out on the brush and saturates my brows.</li>
            <li> My middle aged daughter-in-law loves and uses it regularly and introduced me to it.</li>
            <li> This gel lasts a long time and does what it promises to do.  </li>
            <li> The gel holds my eyebrows in place all day long!</li>
            <li> I cannot use ordinary hair gel on brows as I experience instant itching due to  harsh chemicals, so finding this reasonably sized mascara style gel is a reason to celebrate!</li>
            <li> I must admit I have only used this a few times but should use it regularly.</li>
            <li> My eyebrow are very thick and the hairs very long, this product helps to tame them crazy hairs but does not leave them hard at all, it&#x27;s just perfect!</li>
            <li> Not strong enough to control my brows.  </li>
            <li> Works to hold my brows in place without leaving a sticky or hard feeling or white flakes.</li>
            <li> I have thin Asian eyebrow hairs that stray out and don&#x27;t contour in one direction like Caucasian eyebrows do.</li>
            <li> I have unruly eyebrows and this product was a little too watery to tame them.  </li>
            <li> Not sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t tame my unruly, curly, eyebrow hairs.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to tame my brows after applying brow pencil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used expensive 8oz organic tubes in the past, that were not only expensive but would flake at times.</li>
            <li> and I hoped this would coax them into the correct direction, but, alas, no dice.</li>
            <li> The formula is very weak.</li>
            <li> that point the wrong direction because you plucked them the wrong way or slept on them.</li>
            <li> My brows grow downward in the middle (GRRR!!!)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure this would work but I really love it.  Goes on with one swipe and keeps my brows in place all day.  Makes them look really polished and neat.  Not sticky or stiff.  A great product that I am so glad I found!</li>
            <li> I love this so so much! It keeps your brows n place all day. The only downside is it runs out quickly</li>
            <li> Thank you! Very fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> I love it! And the price is great too</li>
            <li> It does the job. It does kind of leave a residue on the eyebrow hair though which needs to be wiped away a little bit but otherwise it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Arrived in great shape</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t tame my unruly, curly, eyebrow hairs.  It would probably help in a less challenging situation.</li>
            <li> Good as a clear mascara, but not as a brow gel. It don&#x27;t use it as a brow gel, because it doesn&#x27;t hold brows in place. I like it as a mascara though.</li>
            <li> Eyebrows were set and stayed! No crusting and no odd smell! Eyebrows on FLEEK (lol)</li>
            <li> This is excellent brow gel! I can put it on easily and even brush over my eyebrows without the gel being stiff! The gel holds my eyebrows in place all day long! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find this brow gel particularly great. I have thin Asian eyebrow hairs that stray out and don&#x27;t contour in one direction like Caucasian eyebrows do. I bought this because it has the mascara brush so I thought I could brush my eyebrows and contour it but it doesn&#x27;t hold up at all. The formula is very weak. I might try the wax pencil next.</li>
            <li> A little thicker/wetter look than expected, but overall pretty good for price.</li>
            <li> I bought this to tame my brows after applying brow pencil. My only complaint is that I have to wipe off a lot of excess gel before applying since too much comes out on the brush and saturates my brows.</li>

            <li> Not strong enough to control my brows.  I probably need a wax of some kind</li>
            <li> This is a basic eyebrow gel. No color, just holds the shape. Works well, comes out on the brush and applies easily to the brows. It lasts most of the day if not all, and washes off easily in the evening.</li>
            <li> This gel lasts a long time and does what it promises to do.  Best brow gel I have ever used.</li>

            <li> Use this every day! Great brow gel that doesn&#x27;t flake and isn&#x27;t too expensive!</li>
            <li> caused a couple pimples, but does the job, for the most part</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brow gel and it has become one of my favorite must have items. I work long hours and truly put this product to the test on a hot humid day. My eyebrows looked flawless during my 10 hr work day. The gel did not flake nor turned white and brows remained perfectly in place. Very happy with product.. will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase.  Good price for a nice product.  It works well and I will buy more when I need more.  If you are looking for something that is inexpensive but good quality, I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> The product works wonders! Keeps loose eyebrow hairs in place and works as a great mascara.</li>
            <li> Definitely works. I just wish the brush was alot smoother.</li>
            <li> Love this and left it on my order again</li>
            <li> Maybe my eyebrows are the problem, but this stuff didn&#x27;t do a thing for me!  My brows grow downward in the middle (GRRR!!!) and I hoped this would coax them into the correct direction, but, alas, no dice. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d help if your brows just need a little taming, but not if they need a chair and a whip, like mine.</li>
            <li> Great product to use on my eyebrows.  I like the way they make my brows look.</li>
            <li> I must admit I have only used this a few times but should use it regularly. When used, it did hold my brows in place. My brows, now that I am older are a bit more thinner and scraggly and the grey hairs coarser. This helped w/control and did not interfere w/the brow pencil. My middle aged daughter-in-law loves and uses it regularly and introduced me to it.</li>
            <li> Works to hold my brows in place without leaving a sticky or hard feeling or white flakes. Love the low price compared to other brow gels.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> This works better than some but I wouldn&#x27;t call it exceptional. If I found it on sale somewhere I would probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love the way this helps my eyebrows to look groomed for a well polished look. Great find!</li>
            <li> My teen daughter uses this product daily and it helps keep her brows flat during the day at school. She will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> ONE OF THE BEST! Very light but has a great hold and no stiff or sticky feel! Also came with some nice tweasers!&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok product for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I didn&#x27;t own this sooner! It works really well for getting my eyebrows to fall in the correct way. I look neat and polished every day now thanks to this product. It&#x27;s great! It goes on clear. It&#x27;s not clumpy, and it lasts all day. This is really helpful now that fuller brows are the preferred beauty look.</li>
            <li> Not the best.  But okay.  Doesn&#x27;t provide same hold as others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Loving this simple but efficient brow gel after using many others. Seems not only conditioning but is also FLAKE FREE so far. I&#x27;ve used it for 2 weeks on brows, side burns and general hairline and it&#x27;s working fantastically. At such good price, this is an unbeatable brow gel. I&#x27;ve used expensive 8oz organic tubes in the past, that were not only expensive but would flake at times. I cannot use ordinary hair gel on brows as I experience instant itching due to  harsh chemicals, so finding this reasonably sized mascara style gel is a reason to celebrate! Buy it, you will only love it!</li>
            <li> Has been my fav product since I once tried it.. My eyebrow are very thick and the hairs very long, this product helps to tame them crazy hairs but does not leave them hard at all, it&#x27;s just perfect!</li>
            <li> I have unruly eyebrows and this product was a little too watery to tame them.  I found Avon&#x27;s brow gel to work better.  This had no color as My eyebrows have enough color.</li>
            <li> I mostly like  that this product does not cause any flakes! I apply it about twice a day, but it holds well.</li>
