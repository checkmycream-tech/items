            <li>This is my all time favorite deodorant!!</li>
            <li>Have been using it for a about 15 days now, I love it!!</li>
            <li>it went on very nicely and gave me order protection</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the unscented gel deodorant and is very effective.</li>
            <li>It had a very nice smell that lingered well after application</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>This deodorant is amazing!</li>
            <li>but all opinions are my own from my experience of using it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never met a gel deodorant that I liked - until now!  </li>
            <li>Loving this stuff!</li>
            <li>And the best part is we got to try it free from BzzAgent!</li>
            <li>I felt confident wearing it for the wedding and shared how impressed with the product I was with the rest of the bridesmaids.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice!</li>
            <li>Another thing I really liked about it was that it lasted!</li>
            <li>best part is that I got it for free through BzzAgent.com!</li>
            <li>I love that amazon will ship it to my door for a great price!</li>
            <li>I am really glad that I did because I was impressed that the scent was not over powering, I had no sticky feeling, my clothes did not have any traces of the gel.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff very good use is a lot!</li>
            <li>It works great, goes on smooth, smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks!</li>
            <li>but it is a pleasant girly scent that is not over baring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and It has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>What I lvoe best is that this one will not stain your clothes like the Lady Mitchum brand does and it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes on great and smells amazing also.</li>
            <li>it worked good.  </li>
            <li>I loved this product</li>
            <li>/&gt;this product worked fairly well.</li>
            <li>one, the scent is surprisingly good.</li>
            <li>The gel did not feel good at all</li>
            <li>I do feel like it did a good job controlling odor and wetness, but the price of that was too high!&lt;br</li>
            <li>A good price with Subscribe and Save discount.</li>
            <li>I also really loved the gel</li>
            <li>Otherwise good product and</li>
            <li>so I know the value of a good product.</li>
            <li>At the end of two of my theme park days, I did not smell as good as I would have with the clinical strength version either.</li>
            <li>It feels good and it works  (even for me, for a</li>
            <li>and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good deodorant.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d probably be good before then.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been really really good...</li>
            <li>I stay smelling good all day</li>
            <li>but this one works fairly well for me.</li>
            <li>Good pricing and product.</li>
            <li>i loved the smell</li>
            <li>Outlast has been a good product</li>
            <li>It is a really good product.</li>
            <li>Well I received this deodorant for free as part of a promotion with the brand, and I must say I am quite impressed!</li>
            <li>I have a lot of allergies and have to be fairly picky about what type of deodorants I buy for my family members.  </li>
            <li>and it was a good product.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m amazed it worked as good as it did.</li>
            <li>It smells really good</li>
            <li>One thing I am worried about is that I hope this deodorant will work as good in the summer since I am testing this product in the winter.</li>
            <li>and I must say that it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>My clothes are no longer stained with deodorant stains and my armpits smell good.</li>
            <li>so it may be good sweat protection.  </li>
            <li>Good unscented deodorant.</li>
            <li>This is GOOD news for the consumer because the aluminum is a cause of cancer.</li>
            <li>Maybe a good selection in the summer, but I don&#x27;t see myself using a gel through the winter months.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t seem to sweat, although to be fair</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and smells really good.  </li>
            <li>SOOOOOOOOOO GOOD</li>
            <li>I was delighted with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and the protection is great for every day work and life.  </li>
            <li>But I got it put it on and loved it.  </li>
            <li>It was smooth, and the curve of the applicator is perfectly sized for my underarms (maybe I&#x27;m just too used to using the guys&#x27; one!).</li>
            <li>The effectiveness of deodorant is sensational.</li>
            <li>Gel, no fragrance, super!!!</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with.</li>
            <li>It is a great deodarant that stands up to the tests of many a sweat tests.  </li>
            <li>I was very glad about that.</li>
            <li>so i am very pleased with that part.  </li>
            <li>It would better to find a perfect clear gel deodorant to save cloths and also smell perfect.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s refreshing and has a great scent.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to get this product free from BzzAgent to test it out and review!  </li>

            <li>i recieved a trial size of this amazing deodorant from bzzagent</li>
            <li>so I would have not tried it on my own.</li>
            <li>Oh and can not forget, it smells nice too.</li>
            <li>There is a really nice park around the building</li>

            <li>When your body is clogged up with chemicals, it cannot effectively “detox”.</li>

            <li>I also agree it is highly effective as an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the scent, and could smell it throughout the day as I became more</li>
            <li>the fresh really good smell is just an added bonus!</li>

            <li>And in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>When I needed to apply it, I found that the container had been &amp;#34;squeezed&amp;#34; so that a lot of excess gel was on the top of the applicator - much more than I needed to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it out.</li>
            <li>I got this as part of a Bzzagent campaign, and I love it.  </li>

            <li>and i&#x27;m allergic/sensitive to many scents</li>
            <li>What could be better?</li>
            <li>Personally, I love the travel size as it fits in my toiletry bag I take along camping.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m glad i accepted the challenge.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>

            <li>I only have to apply it once a day and does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li>and I have found odor and wetness to be more of a problem since I started menopause.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about odor, stains or streaks on the hottest or most humid days.</li>

            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>No smell is better than &amp;#34;peaches&amp;#34; or someone&#x27;s idea of &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li>I love the way the smell lasts and lasts.  </li>
            <li>I do love the smell of this deodorant and would consider switching brands if it didn’t give me a rash</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a product sample free from clearlybetterchallenge.com  as a member of One2One Network, but all opinions and experiences are my own.</li>

            <li>Such a great product!</li>
            <li>I love being able to put my deodorant at any point during my dressing routine in the morning.  </li>

            <li>Got it free from bzzagent!</li>
            <li>I found that the deodorant works so well that it held up even with the most vigorous workout.</li>

            <li>Its okay, but not for every arm pit.  </li>
            <li>For me it is just okay.</li>

            <li>My favorite deodorant and I wouldn&#x27;t consider changing.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use more than two</li>

            <li>Goes on smooth and the smell is just amazing.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and now have it delivered through my Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
            <li>I did receive this product for free for an *honest* review, it has no way changed my opinion*</li>
            <li>and I have love it.</li>
            <li>The order that I have tried love that the sun dries out within minutes</li>
            <li>It does work sometimes for me in regards to not sweating through my shirts, some days it works better than others.</li>
            <li>If you are more concerned with how your clothing looks</li>
            <li>I sweat profusely, I have tried a number of products but none worked and most of them darkened my underarms.</li>
            <li>I tested the product as part of Bzzz marketing campaign, and I&#x27;m glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have purchased deodorant hoping it performs as advertised.  </li>
            <li>No matter how many say they won&#x27;t, they always do.  </li>
            <li>Love Love Love this product.  </li>
            <li>would anyone expect to go more than a day without reapplying deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>and it dries very quickly, best of all it last all day.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>but surely it couldn&#x27;t be me, not so soon after applying.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly pleased.</li>
            <li>The best antiperspirant/deodorant for sweating and odor, especially stress sweat, and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li>I received this lovely product after getting it as part of a Bzzkit from Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li>Many of my summer shirts now have residue on the inside armpits that refuse to wash off.  </li>
            <li>Love the way this goes on....not sticky afterwards although you do have to wait a minute or two for the stickiness to go away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure  my husband would.  </li>
            <li>what more could a girl ask for?</li>
            <li>I think it would be okay.</li>
            <li>I used it with my favorite LBD and went dancing.</li>
            <li>I Love that it has no scent.</li>
            <li>I was able to discover a great new product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that I can put it on Friday morning and still be smelling fresh and clean on Saturday.</li>
            <li>great deodorant leaves you clean and fresh smelling for 48 hours</li>
            <li>very excited about this product.</li>
            <li>and I was actually very pleasantly surprised at how good it is!  </li>
            <li>pleasant, not too strong&lt;br /&gt;Application- Easy to use, click dispenses just the right amount of gel.</li>
            <li>It is really a clean scent, so they’ve named it aptly.</li>
            <li>The scent is a nice clean scent, nothing too overpowering.</li>
            <li>While it smell great it doesn&#x27;t hold up to high stress situations like  presenting at work.  </li>
            <li>Finally I started experimenting with women&#x27;s deodorants, and this one is perfect -- the clear gel, unscented works great and doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes.  </li>
            <li>So the first day I tried it I loved the way it felt when I put it on .</li>
            <li>So, I grew my armpit hair out for 35 days for the first time in my life to see how good this deodorant could work for me.</li>
            <li>this product is one of the best deodorants I have tried in a long time.</li>
            <li>My kids are brutally honest so that was a true test.  </li>
            <li>This is the first gel deodorant that I&#x27;ve used and I loved it.</li>
            <li>but the comments are my own true opinions of the product.</li>
            <li>I find the formula gentle and effective!</li>
            <li>It goes on clear, the fragrance is great (no deodorant should smell like baby powder, very appreciative that this one absolutely does NOT) and it lasts for 48 hours, maybe even longer</li>
            <li>and I smelled fresh all day!  YAY!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sticky, like all of the gel deodorants I&#x27;ve ever tried, but unlike the others, the 48 hour claim sure seems to be true!</li>
            <li>For the most part, I am happy with the clear gel.</li>
            <li>This is a really awesome product , it keeps you dry</li>
            <li>On top of that, I&#x27;m a runner, so I need a deodorant with a strong antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>It keeps me dry all day and smells great!  </li>
            <li>i got the active scent and am happy with the smell, its not overpowering and its pleasant.  </li>

            <li>I was impressed with its ability to combat odor in my 95-104 degree yoga classes, though obviously it can&#x27;t be expected to keep me from sweating in those environments.</li>

            <li>I wish there were more invisible solids available, but until then I will keep this around for when I am wearing sleeveless on a night out.</li>
            <li>The protection was good, the scent was fabulous and I loved the fact there wasn&#x27;t any white residue on my clothes; however,  I do not think I would buy this deodorant because of the guming effect  </li>

            <li>Missed a day and still fine.  </li>
            <li>When I was just sitting around in an air conditioned house, it worked out fine.</li>

            <li>I would recommend this deodorant, I was given this product free to try and review.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and it goes on clear.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always buying $11 deodorant and was glad to see that I don&#x27;t have to spend that much any more.</li>
            <li>Even after all that when I gave my kids a hug, my 8 year old said, &amp;#34;You smell good; did you just get out of the shower?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve had to throw away some of my most beloved shirts/dresses because of a build up of white marks that could not be cleaned.</li>
            <li>loved the way the clear gel went on.</li>
            <li>liked the thickness of the gel, it was just right and not too much like most gels I have used.</li>
            <li>a Bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;The gel has a nice fresh scent, although it&#x27;s overpowering right after applying.</li>
            <li>I normally would never buy a gel deodorant (don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve EVER used gel before this), but I received this free to try, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a great deodorant, but I was extremely allergic to this</li>
            <li>Not once have I seen a white mark on any of my clothing this week and this leaves me extremely pleased with the product as well!!</li>
            <li>I found exactly what I was looking for!!.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m somewhat desensitized to the scent of the actual deodorant or if it just doesn&#x27;t smell that strongly, but I didn&#x27;t ever catch a pleasant aroma, either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I no longer perspire daintily and stress sweat is not a pretty odor.  </li>
            <li>Since I started using Secret® Clinical Strength, I have been able to stay calm, cool, collected and sweat smell free.</li>
            <li>The clear gel dries very fast, smells great, and lasts.  </li>
            <li>Still a bit strong, but more pleasant than other gel deodorants.</li>
            <li>it smells clean and goes on light...</li>
            <li>The smell was light, but clean smelling.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and dries quick.  </li>
            <li>This gel formula dries quickly, stays all day, and smells quite strong, but I like the perfume-y smell.</li>
            <li>My new favorite!</li>
            <li>This stuff has now become my new favorite deodorant!</li>
            <li>smells great, dries fast, last a long time even on super stressful days, and has the best bottling and lid design I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;now</li>
            <li>It kept me fresh &amp; clean all day!</li>
            <li>I just love it its my new favorite product.</li>
            <li>It feels cool and refreshing and caused no burning sensation on my skin when I applied it right after</li>
            <li>No white marks, quick drying, and great smell.</li>
            <li>Great deodorant, lasts a long time, doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, but leaves a fresh and smooth feel</li>
            <li>and I can actually smell the amazing scent all day without having to sniff my pits!</li>
            <li>It really last and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>I loved the fresh scent and the gel is very easily absorbed without leaving that yucky feeling of having too much under your arms.</li>
            <li>The comments most said was it was a bit sticky at first but went away within seconds</li>
            <li>I have to admit I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think about this when I first got it.</li>
            <li>Great consistency and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>I wanted to see how good of a job this wet gel would work on both smooth skin, and not so smooth skin!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I was pretty satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I tried it after giving birth as many woman know your body experiences lots of changes in that first week after giving birth.</li>
            <li>At first I thought I would love this deodorant</li>
            <li>and I was so excited.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s great to be able to slide my shirt on and not have to worry about the mess it will leave on my clothes.</li>
            <li>So when I was offered this campaign, I was excited to try this.</li>
            <li>even after a sweaty workout my armpits were fresh!</li>
            <li>so I was excited to give gel deodorant a try.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was that I seemed to have a defective stick that didn&#x27;t want to expel any of the gel out the top even after relentlessly turning the crank.</li>
            <li>Definitely excited to keep using this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fact that the amount is lowered and it works better than the products with higher amounts is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>With that said, since I used the first one I have bought two more since.  </li>
            <li>All I used was one twist or one click of the gel and applied under each arm, the product is light and cool on the skin.</li>
            <li>I was not too excited at the opportunity because I cannot find a deodorant that I like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the product and it smells great and the freshness lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The smell is very light &amp; nice and this is the first deodorant i&#x27;ve used that actually controls my under arm sweat, and I haven&#x27;t noticed sweat stains on my shirts &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of those products you want to keep using because the scent is so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>and I still smell clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>This is the best deodorant i have found so far to actually work for my daughter.</li>
            <li>The completely clean scent isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>The clean &#x27;</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I like the clean scent of this product, too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is pleasantly clean smelling but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like that it keeps my armpits looking clean and they look like there&#x27;s no deodorant on them.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed by this deodorant and glad I try it as a promotion from Secret.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enought to try this product for free</li>
            <li>Outlast Completely Clean arrived at my door</li>
            <li>When I first open the cap, the scent was already gushing out and it smelled so beautiful.</li>
            <li>It smells great and keeps me dry.</li>
            <li>(super important or</li>
            <li>It goes one clean and is not sticky or gooey.</li>
            <li>“Completely Clean” does what it is projected to do in the allotted time of 48 hours and</li>
            <li>Clean yet not overpowering fragrance and does not compete with my perfume...</li>
            <li>I could still smell that clean scent at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Fresh scent , not too strong</li>
            <li>the application actually went quite... pleasant.</li>
            <li>I love this new deodorant and the smell, keeps sweat from coming and getting all over your clothes, and good for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>More importantly it keeps me dry and odor free morning till night!!  </li>
            <li>Another positive is I am usually very sensitive when it comes to underarm products and so far I have had no issues, so that is GREAT!</li>
            <li>I live in the hot, humid South, and need good protection.</li>
            <li>Here in Texas the weather has been super hot and my deodorant lasted through out the day. :)</li>
            <li>it works great, goes on clear and dries clear and anything that gets on my shirt cleans off easily.</li>
            <li>Right!  </li>
            <li>Love this deodorant, drys quickly doesn&#x27;t leave white marks and keeps me smelling awesome all day long.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, dries quick, and I smell fresh all day.</li>
            <li>so, i was super excited about trying out this</li>
            <li>I worked hard in the garden one day and it worked perfect.  </li>
            <li>It lasts all day and does a remarkable job at keeping you dry and smelling fresh!</li>
            <li>Wow what a product it works and isn&#x27;t hard on the pocket its a win, win .</li>
            <li>It goes on clear, dries fast and clear, smells great and lasts!</li>
            <li>works as expected and great price.</li>
            <li>It works great, but if it&#x27;s too hot outside it does not work.</li>
            <li>so i was pretty happy when i finally ran out.</li>
            <li>I really like that it does not stain your shirt and doesn&#x27;t have the funky smell that many gel deodorants have.</li>
            <li>No white marks on the clothes, smells good.  </li>
            <li>and I was smelling as sweet as I had before the race began.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it, but I really do.</li>
            <li>It smells more neutral, and I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s a scent that doesn&#x27;t really battle with any of my perfumes or body fragrances like lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s true</li>
            <li>They stayed true to what I&#x27;ve come to expect from them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks Buzz Agent :)</li>
            <li>Bought it for my wife, she uses this type and Walmart/Publix for some reason are both out of Unscented Clear Gel kind.</li>
            <li>I really liked the formula compared to the old dove deodorant i was using.</li>
            <li>Yesterday I put the deodorant on in the morning before leaving for work, no white marks, so that was a good start.</li>
            <li>I must say that I love this product it really works for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure</li>
            <li>but now i will have to buy the full size.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to whether or not it lasts a full 48 hours since I apply deodorant every morning</li>
            <li>I did notice a light fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Therefore I don&#x27;t know if this holds true to what it claims.</li>
            <li>(when I can get the chance to experience the full effect of this product).</li>
            <li>I really like this deodorant, but it did make it seem like I was sweating more.  </li>
            <li>It gets me through a full work day, my kids soccer practice my run AND a yoga class.  </li>
            <li>I had gotten some of this at the store in the winter and liked the clear gel.  </li>
            <li>this one still smells lovely when I am getting ready for bed.</li>
            <li>I had gone to the fair, and being in low 80s</li>
            <li>However, I am expressing my true opinions in this review.*&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I blast each pit with the cool air setting from my hairdryer.</li>
            <li>that I  bought the full sized bottle.  </li>
            <li>I truely wanted it to work</li>
            <li>I even put it to the true test on a stretch of five days off work.  </li>
            <li>If you wear a regular strength deodorant you should be good</li>
            <li>NOT BAD</li>
            <li>It was a really nice soft sweet lavender scent.</li>
            <li>application was very easy, the smell is pleasant, and for someone who tends toward excessive sweating</li>
            <li>love that it goes on clear and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Secret did.. best thing about this one is that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong deodorant smell which I also like.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had to try it straight for 48hrs just because I love being clean, but most I have tried don&#x27;t last more than 8 hrs.</li>
            <li>I have pretty strong &amp;#34;B.O.&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li>Upon first application I thought the scent was going to be too strong for me</li>
            <li>At first, I thought I would enjoy this deodorant, and was excited to receive it as a product tester.</li>
            <li>I was given a free sample of this product from Buzz and it is an awesome product it dries fast goes on clear and definitely outlast any deodorant I have tried.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To sum up the use of the product, I can conclude that it indeed leaves you fresh and clean and protects the full 48 hours.</li>
            <li>Though I probably wouldn&#x27;t use this everyday, its definitely good with tank tops!</li>
            <li>The smell is great but not overbearing like other deodorants can be.</li>
            <li>The odor control was pretty good, not the full 48 hours as it suggests, but much better than other deodorant I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>It smells fresh and clean, and leaves you smelling fresh and clean too.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and clean and kinda reminds me of water with hints of flowers.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice clean smell to it, similar to the smell of clean clothes coming out of the dryer.  </li>
            <li>This is seriously the best product ever.</li>
            <li>beyond it provides protection and leaves you feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly</li>
            <li>BUT I WOULD LIKE EVEN MORE A DEODORANT FREE OF ALUMINUM AND WITH NATURAL INGREDIENTS.</li>
            <li>No residue or stains on the skin or clothes and dries quickly when applied.</li>
            <li>I love this particular antiperspirant/deodorant</li>
            <li>My most favorite thing about this product is no white streaks!</li>
            <li>It is a bit gooey and then it dries relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes on, and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>I must admit some mornings get super hectic with 3 kids running around</li>
            <li>The gel dries super quick and I never have to reapply.</li>
            <li>This is the only deodorant I will use; I think it&#x27;s better than better than Clinical Strength.</li>
            <li>Thank you secret for letting me try this wonderful product for free.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It also dries quickly on the skin and does not leave any marks on my clothing.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I felt this product provided great protection at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to be super sweaty, but I do work up a sweat when out running.  </li>
            <li>I prefer unscented because scents can irritate my nose, but this one quickly dissipates and does not bother me.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and there is no wetness.</li>
            <li>I did feel like it wore away quickly, but that could just be me being paranoid.</li>
            <li>if i sweat a lot though it wears off kinda quickly.</li>
            <li>Like many of you, I&#x27;ve used many different types of deodorant in my day.  </li>
            <li>Because it dries so quickly, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about clothing stains or streaks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just loved the fact it didn&#x27;t leave white mess also how great it smelled.</li>
            <li>giving you a great underarm smell, i remain pretty dry and odorless without leaving marks on your underarm and clothes.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t overpowering and is clean smelling, but once I get to sweating, my sweat smell comes right on through.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>BzzAgent sent me a free trial and it was the first time I&#x27;d tried it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still very hot here in Florida</li>
            <li>, lavender is my favorite and one that is not offered by my normal deodorant brand.</li>
            <li>The deodorant also does not last for very many &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I tried this deoderant I received for free and really like it!  </li>
            <li>I normally have three deodorants on hand as I cannot find one that I love.</li>
            <li>I like how this product goes on, it certainly smells great, but it was a thin mask for me and didn&#x27;t really stand up that great to Zumba class.</li>
            <li>Love the new secret it smells awesome and make me feel fresh from the time I get up till the time I go to sleep!</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast® Clear Gel worked great, went on clear, and smelled great for 48 hours!</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t experience white marks, and the scent is light, and fresh!</li>
            <li>And the unscented is great for people that are sensitive to most other deodorant scents.</li>
            <li>I love the secret brand and will continue to buy the products, they smell great and do provide protection just not 48 hours worth!</li>
            <li>I love this new deodorant with one exception.  </li>
            <li>My response was as you all know I love to try new thing</li>
            <li>A new favorite for me.</li>
            <li>This is defiantly my new favorite deodorant</li>
            <li>but I was extremely pleased with this new antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>Perfect in Florida humidity: it can be hard to find a deodorant that works well in the florida heat!</li>
            <li>I wear a lot of black, and this is great.  </li>
            <li>first of all, the field trip starts with a 30 minute drive, with said children, then a good 25 minute wait before the zoo actually allows us inside..</li>
            <li>but that goes away quickly and leaves you feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>Strong smells really bother me.</li>
            <li>The gel goes on easily, dries fast, and doesn&#x27;t leave any marks.</li>
            <li>I love the clear gel better than any other kind.</li>
            <li>BUT know that you are purchasing a quality product that does exactly what it says it does, which is like a breath of fresh air these days!</li>
            <li>I was pretty stoked about that!  </li>
            <li>On the first work-day I used this product, it passed the stink test!</li>
            <li>I thought that this deoderant did exactly what it claimed - reduced underarm wetness!</li>
            <li>and i love the fact that it is clear, which is a great thing when i am wearing dark colors it wont show up on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was HOT!</li>
            <li>I was happy with the smell but, like other gels, it didnt feel good when applied and didnt seem to do the job of other deodorants.</li>
            <li>This was the first trip that I wasn&#x27;t concerned about my odor!</li>
            <li>I love this clear gel deodorant!</li>
            <li>My Secret ;) for my wedding came to me in the nick of time in an awesome FREE BzzKit.</li>
            <li>Love the clear gel!</li>
            <li>During the dry fall and now winter this is possibly the best deodorant I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Easy on skin and leaves you fresh and ready to go for day</li>
            <li>It has a great smell, dries fast, doesn&#x27;t leave marks, and keeps you dry.</li>
            <li>This antiperspirant is effective in keeping me dry and odor free.  </li>
            <li>I also like that it drys quickly, so you can put your shirt on right after.</li>
            <li>Sitting in an air conditioned office all day didn&#x27;t offer much to see how the product worked but throughout the day it seemed to be fine.</li>
            <li>After my shower I reapplied and even after one of the hottest days in July, my underarms stayed dry and smelling fresh (well, more like perfume, but better than the alternative.)  </li>
            <li>I got to try it out for free thanks to Bzz Agent</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really enjoy this product much.</li>
            <li>The gel goes on smoothly and evenly and dries fast.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent, the protection is great and so far I don&#x27;t see white streaks (which I don&#x27;t think I would anyway with a clear gel).  </li>
            <li>This clear gel smells fresh and great when you pull off the safety tap next</li>
            <li>It has amazing 48-hour odor protection and leaves no white marks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like this product, I was surprised to find that not only did it smell great</li>
            <li>but it kept me feeling fresh all day.</li>
            <li>but since I #Gotitfree from BzzAgent to review I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth the try</li>
            <li>I loved the deodorant so much I ended tossing my current one and replaced it with this one.  </li>
            <li>I got this free from BzzAgent and will definitely be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li>Again, Secret has a great deodorant that protects from odor and lasts all day!</li>
            <li>and i feel fresh all day.  </li>
            <li>But for the price it was totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I really love the fact that it is a gel deodorant that doesn&#x27;t leave marks and dries clear.</li>
            <li>but, this wins.</li>
            <li>No sweat stains, smell fresh, and can change my shirt without leaving streak marks.</li>
            <li>Keeps me fresh all day.</li>
            <li>and it keeps me feeling fresh all day.</li>
            <li>and I still smelled as fresh as I did when I put it on which for me</li>
            <li>FEELS PLEASANTLY NICE ON THE SKIN,LONG LASTING</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it goes on clear an leaves</li>
            <li>I love that it is clear</li>
            <li>However, this was a nice change from my regular deoderant.</li>
            <li>Have never been a big fan of the gel, but after I tried it I liked it.</li>
            <li>I received this as a free promotional item and at first I really liked it, but after one really long day I found it did not work.</li>
            <li>I also love the clear gel.  </li>
            <li>It stayed in place and I am a frequent sweater and found that it was able to keep up with me.</li>
            <li>Keeps your armpits smelling fresh all day and night.</li>
            <li>If you dont have sensitive skin you may be ok</li>
            <li>I love that it goes on clear.  </li>
            <li>I love the Clear gel.</li>
            <li>and so far my friends are enjoying it, as well.</li>
            <li>I love the clear see through stick.  </li>
            <li>Goes on clear, doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on clothes, and keeps you smelling great thru the day.</li>
            <li>I have tried Secret OutLast Deodorant and absolutely loved it!!</li>
            <li>Thank you Secret and BzzAgent for another awesome product for me to review!</li>
            <li>I was able to try this clear get deodorant.</li>
            <li>In this day and age, everyone is trying to be more health conscious</li>
            <li>When these chemicals are absorbed into our bodies, it may cause a change in our DNA, which in turn makes cells into cancerous cells.</li>
            <li>Keeps me smelling fresh all day.  </li>
            <li>Got this to review from secret and I must say that it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>I was looking to make the switch to a deodorant that wouldn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothing and was as effective as the one I was using.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite deodorant/antiperspirant so far in my life.  </li>
            <li>I experimented with \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants and NONE of them worked (I bought every kind I could find over several years).  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>and afterwards I was still smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only kind I use now.</li>
            <li>It only took this Dad 22 years to find something she liked</li>
            <li>Fresh scent.</li>
            <li>The Secret outlast gel works great!</li>
            <li>I love the clear gel.</li>
            <li>so it was nice not seeing white streaks on my clothes.</li>
            <li>Even after a day at the office and then a gym workout the formula has kept me smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>This is an easy to use and high performing deoderant.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised - for the most part, you can get dressed without residue marks pretty quickly after application.</li>
            <li>I had a very positive experience while using this product this week</li>
            <li>THIS became my favorite after so many years compared to any other and I have used the clinical ones but, this wins.</li>
            <li>I loved the way it made me smell, which is kind of weird, I know, but I just smelled so fresh... and it lasted overnight!</li>
            <li>For a gel it also dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Does not leave unwanted marks on clothing and dries super fast!</li>
            <li>If it didn&#x27;t dry so quickly I wouldn&#x27;t have liked it.</li>
            <li>Upon completing this trial, I also checked the underarms of my clothing to make sure that there were no deodorant marks left from the “Completely Clean”, there were no marks.</li>
            <li>As good as this did, I decided to see if it worked under extreme pressure.</li>
            <li>It melts right away and is washed away by sweat.</li>
            <li>Everything you could want from a deodorant, right??  </li>
            <li>The gel dries right when it becomes in contact with the skin.</li>
            <li>so I can get dressed right away.</li>
            <li>But my right arm pit is showing wetness which is a bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always had issues finding the right deodorant.</li>
            <li>Right away I could feel the difference and smell the difference.  </li>
            <li>I have tried clear gels in the past and they never seemed to work, but this one is awesome!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely impressed with Secret and this gel, and I will absolutely be purchasing this!</li>
            <li>This is easy to use to much, but I love that I don&#x27;t get white streaks on my clothing!</li>
            <li>Good for active people.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this deodorant free from Secret, and I&#x27;ve got to say I love this deodorant!</li>
            <li>Keeps you dry all day and more, and keep you feeling (and smelling!)</li>
            <li>I have noticed that the product runs out more quickly than the traditional version.</li>
            <li>I must say I was pleasantly surprised how it went on smooth with no streaking and dryed quickly.</li>
            <li>When I opened the deodorant, I was surprised to find, that it actually smelled pleasant.</li>
            <li>Best of all, not nasty residue was left behind.</li>
            <li>It has a great scent and it made me feel fresh without the white residue left after putting it on.</li>
            <li>I love the entire Secret brand, but Outlast is the best.</li>
            <li>Would it work for 48 hours.. maybe, but as a nurse I reapply everyday (my patients appreciate it :P)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed with the Secret Outlast Clear Gel (I was sent this product for free from BzzAgent to try out).</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free from Secret in exchange for my honest review</li>
            <li>I was able to try Secret Outlast through #bzzagent for free for my HONEST opinion.</li>
            <li>Today was a great test; a full day of chasing a 3-year-old around and then a late night hot yoga class</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and dries up super quick and doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue on my close like the bar deodorant</li>
            <li>This is a good product that has not let me down yet.</li>
            <li>No white marks and strong protection!</li>
            <li>Now that I am switching over to sleeveless dress and tops, it is nice to find a deodorant that not only dries clear, but keeps me smelling good all day long.</li>
            <li>Wore it to the zoo the other day and stayed dry climbing all the hills which felt awesome -</li>
            <li>I am glad that I can easily add this deodorant to one of my other orders.</li>
            <li>With an amazing smell that leaves you felling fresh and clean when in truth you are a hot mess.  </li>
            <li>I love that it dries fast and stays strong all day long!</li>
            <li>Works great, no chalky white lines on clothing, &amp; really by next am</li>
            <li>Overall, great product and will likely by again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to strong smells</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not sticky, it dries super fast</li>
            <li>My husband actually smells good when his Old Spice antiperspirant kicks in</li>
            <li>I went into this campaign (I was given a free sample courtesy of Secret) thinking that I wouldn&#x27;t find anything great</li>
            <li>The wetness was not a big issue, I honestly don&#x27;t have that much of a problem there</li>
            <li>, I was impressed with the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel deoderant.</li>
            <li>Keep me fresh and clean even in very busy days.</li>
            <li>Not sure that it can actually last 48 hours but does a great job and for the price.....even better.</li>
            <li>Overall I think it is a great deal, especially when you want to make sure you don&#x27;t have any white marks on your clothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Secret outlast goes on easy, dries fast and smells great.  </li>
            <li>It fell flat as far as performance wise.</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast is easily the best deodorant on the market, 2 days protection, no white marks</li>
            <li>I live in the oh so lovely New York City...</li>
            <li>I love the scent (active fresh), which is crisp and clean.</li>
            <li>What I love more is that it&#x27;s clear and dry fast!</li>
            <li>I was excited to get a new deodorant</li>
            <li>always excited to try a new deoderant.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and  the quick dry after putting this product on.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong at first, but it smells good and it really does last a long time(close to 48 hours).</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, dries quickly and leaves no white marks.  </li>
            <li>, I would and have bought this again, the best thing is a little go&#x27;s a long way</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know how it holds up to a hot, sweaty day yet.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and it does last all day.</li>
            <li>First, it works.</li>
            <li>but the top  popped off and afterwards deodorant would  only come out one side of the stick.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Seems to work exactly how I&#x27;d like my deodorant to work.</li>
            <li>i love the scent and lasting wetness control.  </li>
            <li>i have already purchased more for myself and teen daughter.  </li>
            <li>Better than lesser name, discount brands.</li>
            <li>I really like it though!</li>
            <li>, it was my first using a gel deodorant.</li>
            <li>Too hot</li>
            <li>There are a lot of scents that I can&#x27;t handle because they cause migraines, but this product is definitely on the OK list.</li>
            <li>Absolutely!</li>
            <li>Just when I thought it couldn&#x27;t get any better it actually did.</li>
            <li>Other than this, the updated formulas is a thousand times better than the original formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s HOT in South Carolina.</li>
            <li>I am still deciding on the sent, while it was a bit over powering at first thinking</li>
            <li>You do not need a second application in most cases, but I applied again on occasions I took a night-time shower after taking a day time shower.</li>
            <li>I tested this product on a hot summer day while running errands which included a lot of unloading and loading items from my car and walking to my apartment.</li>
            <li>At last, in frustration, I gave the top of the&lt;br /&gt;dispenser</li>
            <li>With most of them they left a mark in my clothing</li>
            <li>Yet, I was still faced with sweating or over powering odor from my daily routine on more stressful days.</li>
            <li>I would definitely use Outlast if I were wearing a tank top or a sleeveless dress.</li>
            <li>pretty fresh.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No wierd white spots when i wear armless top</li>
            <li>and I have to say it&#x27;s definitely among the better deodorants on the market.</li>
            <li>but, i would love to have something work for the entire day that i am using it, between showers, and this did!</li>
            <li>Also, using it straight out of the shower stings the pits!</li>
            <li>I also have to wear suits in this hot weather for 9 hours each day and this is the deodorant I rely on.</li>
            <li>and I really like it !</li>
            <li>It holds up and dies exactly what it said it would</li>
            <li>But now I&#x27;m excited I received this sample of outlast clear gel!</li>
            <li>but it worked well up until I showered the next day for sure.</li>
            <li>and I really really like it!</li>
            <li>everybody has different experience and this was mine :)</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t sweat even in this hot summer weather.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve never found a woman&#x27;s scent that I wanted to smell when the going gets hot.  </li>
            <li>I love it lasts or says it last for 48 hours.  </li>
            <li>and I feel confident enough in my protection that I don&#x27;t mind being stopped to talk with neighbors along my route.</li>
            <li>but this one comes with more oz and will last longer than the clinical.</li>
            <li>I do, this deodorant stuck by me the whole way!</li>
            <li>I did not have the usual issue of having to warm up the stick to get it to come out smoothly</li>
            <li>Ever since we moved from Chicago to North Carolina, I&#x27;ve not only been sweating more, but also been showing it to the world.</li>
            <li>I have severe hot flashes with means a lot of sweat and odors.</li>
            <li>It controlled my wetness and odor better than my regular brand.  </li>
            <li>I want it prevented in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>At  first it did not hold.  </li>
            <li>I use to use the Lady Speed Stick Fusion 24/7 deodorant before my first kid</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>And I love that I can put it on without worrying about ruining an outfit with unsightly white streaks or residue on my sleeveless tops.</li>
            <li>as a frequent traveler, I prefer to  travel lightly and minimize my liquids and gels for going through TSA, so I&#x27;m going to have to leave this one at home when I&#x27;m traveling my air.</li>
            <li>even threw my hot flashes and night sweats .</li>
            <li>no white spots on my tank top</li>
            <li>I gave this product 5 stars because after having my son 4 years ago, I haven&#x27;t been able to find a deodorant that works until I finally tried this out.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m more of a solid fan.</li>
            <li>Love love love secret outlast!</li>
            <li>I love that I am able to see how much is left and not left guessing as to when I will run out.</li>
            <li>Every gel that I have tried before always felt sticky when I first put it on.  </li>
            <li>Plus it does not leave a buildup on my clothes when I first put it on.  </li>
            <li>I got this Deodorant Clear Gel for free as a promotion from &amp;#34;Secret&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It dries fast, lasts all day, and doesn&#x27;t break me out!</li>
            <li>It also did not leave any white marks &amp; it smelled fantastic!</li>
            <li>First of all, it does not leave any marks.</li>
            <li>Plus, I never have to throw out my favorite clothes for white mark</li>
            <li>It really smelled like you are fresh out of the shower...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident that it would last longer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than aerosol, solid and roll on type deodorants.</li>
            <li>If you are in the hot sun for hours, nope.</li>
            <li>The first couple of days I tried it</li>
            <li>I wear a scent, I wish it to be my own perfume, not some arbitrary scent from my underarm deodorant.</li>
            <li>Works for the first 4 - 6 hours, but can&#x27;t quite make it to the 10-hour mark on a stressful day.</li>
            <li>The first day I tried it</li>
            <li>But sure enough it was.  </li>
            <li>I like that this product does exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, clear and lasts.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more a personal quirk than criticism.  </li>
            <li>the first use</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure that all of the 5-star reviews are accurate for the previous formula.  </li>
            <li>however it does dry instantly and works great and lasts all day....</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get a free sample of this product, but I may continue using it even after the sample runs out.</li>
            <li>I got the chance to try Secret Outlast for free, and I was excited!!!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth with no mess.</li>
            <li>I was asked to sample Secret Outlast in Completely Clean scented deodorant for free by the company and then write a review of my honest</li>
            <li>I tried this the other day and the first thing I noticed was how nice it smelled.</li>
            <li>it faded shortly after applying leaving me to so far positive that I have just a nice light fresh sent, just enough to make me feel fresh.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and as you know it get super hot.</li>
            <li>Also, you get no ugly white marks on your clean shirt.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear, leaves no sticky residue on clothes and you feel fresh all day!</li>
            <li>The fact that this is unscented too is nice because the little one is sensitive to strong scents.</li>
            <li>I was impressed when the Secret Outlast dried very quickly on my skin!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on clear and clean just like it says it will.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a solid deodorant kind of girl but thought I&#x27;d give the clear gel a try.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with Secret Outlast Clear Gel.</li>
            <li>secret clear outlast is awesome.</li>
            <li>It has a light fresh smell, but once you put it on there is not that &amp;#34;deodorant smell.&amp;#34; The only thing I do not like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t dispense evenly; sometimes you need one click, and sometimes you need 3.</li>
            <li>The Secret Outlast Clear Gel held up great!!</li>
            <li>I can see how much I have left and when I need to make a run to the store for more.  </li>
            <li>Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel is the best thing to hit the market in ages.</li>
            <li>The product has a series of holes on the top and a twist mechanism at the bottom to dispense the gel and a see-thru sleek dispenser that allows the user to know how much they have left.</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast unscented clear gel deodorant is great!</li>
            <li>I did the sniff check because i was pretty certain</li>
            <li>I live in a very hot and humid city</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and cool and keeps me dry</li>
            <li>it was more wet (for lack of a better term), but it dried very quickly</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find a deodorant for a long time that I felt confident wearing</li>
            <li>I am a sweater though, the only thing that will stop my wet spots if wearing a close fitting shirt is a clinical strength deodorant, and even that is not 100% sure thing.</li>
            <li>After a long day I was glad to see it worked</li>
            <li>On particularly hot days, I noticed it does not control sweat as much as the clinical strength days.</li>
            <li>I was happy to get the chance to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel free from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love that I could smell it all day long, and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about any odor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i love this product because it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>For anyone that has body odor or wetness issues I would recommend this product as long as you&#x27;re okay with the ingredients.</li>
            <li>At first I think I was using way too much product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;ll never go back to the soft solid.  </li>
            <li>I felt confident all day long.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t worry much about marks using this deodorant, and it&#x27;s pretty scentless.</li>
            <li>It does smell good, and lasts far longer than any other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>I also love the active fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the Clean fresh scent, not the unscented or floral one.</li>
            <li>Even though I am not too active most of the time, I would find myself feeling not so fresh by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I live in the most southern part of Alabama and it&#x27;s always humid and hot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already loyal to the Secret brand but was happy to review a gel, since I normally use the stick.</li>
            <li>I applied it at night and didn&#x27;t reapply in the morning when I proceeded with my normal routine: 30 minute walk outside, 30 minute strength workout, and at the end of both sweat sessions I was completely dry and smelling great.</li>
            <li>But shockingly, Secret Outlast Clear Gel felt great going on and actually provided amazing protection.</li>
            <li>Youwill be able to raise your hands high, hug, and be in close proximity of others without worrying if they could smell a musty order coming from your body, without anyone questioning your daily hygiene routine.</li>
            <li>over-powering scents.&lt;br /&gt;II received a free full size Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel as part of a promotion, and discovered that they&#x27;ve stuck with that winning formula.  </li>
            <li>The new formula dries faster, and keeps my underarm area fresh for hours.</li>
            <li>All I can say is if you are looking to try new deodorant, I would recommend giving this a try, it will be worth it.</li>
            <li>It drys quickly and clearly.  </li>
            <li>I was blessed enough to receive it as a free sample the first time</li>
            <li>I have not tried a gel in many years as I don&#x27;t like the feeling of needing to walk around with my arms up to let it dry</li>
            <li>Pluses are that it is a clear gel that works well, leaves no residue and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>The Active Fresh scent is light and as the name suggests fresh.</li>
            <li>The gel dries quickly and clear without sticky residue.  </li>
            <li>The odor and wetness protection easily lasts over 24 hours, even when outside on the beach.</li>
            <li>It dries very quickly, and I didn&#x27;t have any white marks on my clothing.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and dries quickly which is a plus.</li>
            <li>I like to wait a minutes or two to be sure it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li>So far it has preformed super in all categories</li>
            <li>However, I was super pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li>am very pleased with the results of Secret Outlast Completely Clean and plan to use it as my absolute go to deodorant!  </li>
            <li>Goes on clear and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>With 3 kids, I&#x27;m always on the go and never know where I&#x27;m going to end up, so it&#x27;s nice to know that pit stains and underarm odor are one less worry.</li>
            <li>I am really surprised by how quickly it dries.</li>
            <li>and  this deodorant keeps me dry and odor free all day!</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a gel, but I like the dry stick much better.</li>
            <li>Love that it keeps me dry all day, even in stressful situations.</li>
            <li>It dries quick and has no harsh scents.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell which I definitely like.</li>
            <li>It still did not work and left a strong smell of &amp;#34;my armpits need help&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>At first I really liked the deodorant but after a few days, the deodorant started guming up in my arm pits.  </li>
            <li>I worry about applying such a strong chemical to my skin but it does work so I will stick with it for now.</li>
            <li>I am an active person and sweat regularly - this is a very effective antiperspirant that I will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li>I have sensation problems where certain things give me the shivers.  </li>
            <li>The Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Get deoderant really fit that requirement nicely.  </li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t plan to forget deoderant regularly, it was nice to know that this would hold up for a really long time and keep me smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>If any of you know anything about New York city, it&#x27;s that the summers are generally pretty hot and humi.</li>
            <li>It was also great especially in this case because I didn&#x27;t have to worry about getting the typical deodorant stains on my dress.</li>
            <li>till still using this product passing the torch down to my teen girl happy to say she really enjoys this along will all of secrets products.</li>
            <li>This goes on clear and dries super fast.</li>
            <li>If you want to stay dry and smelling good without that chalky white stuff getting on your clothes.</li>
            <li>but I just kept brushing it all around my armpit until I can feel that I&#x27;ve coated the entire area and surprisingly, it was almost completely dry.</li>
            <li>After flailing around like a maniac with my arms up for a good 5 minutes, it was finally dry enough for me to put on</li>
            <li>The other great thing about Secret deodorant is that it is affordable and very easy to find coupons for.</li>
            <li>Secret&#x27;s new Outlast Clear Gel smelled great before I even opened it!</li>
            <li>Got a chance to try this product for free via the ClearlyBetterChallenge through Secret &amp; I must say that I love it!</li>
            <li>Especially in situations where I feel I need extra coverage meaning use more deodorant!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is rare that I can find a deodorant that I really like and frequently use a deodorant once or twice and throw it away!</li>
            <li>My older son gave it a try as well (and this boy sweats a lot), and he was amazed that it worked so well on him!</li>
            <li>I do love this product but am taking away 1 star due to the minor sting. :)</li>
            <li>I tend to be in a hurry most mornings, so I was surprised that dried quickly (literally within seconds)!</li>
            <li>overall i really liked this deodorant and the cost is right around the typical deodorant cost so it is worth giving a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is this completely clean scent smells almost exactly the same as the one I normally wear.</li>
            <li>I guess there is also the craziness that I never feel like I know how many clicks I need to get the right amount for each arm without clicking too much out of the tube and feeling like a slimy mess for 5 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have found that the scent of Secret Outlast Completely Clean is a super clean, crisp and refreshing scent and seems to last throughout the day..</li>
            <li>I found Secret Outlast® Clear Gel which is a unique deodorant in many stores and online easily.</li>
            <li>fact that it wont leave chalky marks on clothes is such a huge deal....especially on date</li>
            <li>Love that it is unscented, it does feel really wet going on, but dries really fast.</li>
            <li>I typically prefer a floral or summery scent than the clean scent available for this product.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product FREE thanks to Secret &amp; BzzAgent!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the one I can currently using, the scent of this deodorant is more feminine.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and smells really fresh the whole time I had it on.</li>
            <li>The clean fresh scent lifts your spirits while you stay dry.  </li>
            <li>The wetness protection and lack of white marks is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I really like this product for a number of reasons.  </li>
            <li>/bo this stuff really did work.</li>
            <li>come on Summer - I&#x27;m ready for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really wanted to like this deodorant, but it just doesn&#x27;t do what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>product by Secret has done a great job for me.  </li>
            <li>If I take a shower or workout, it seems helpful to reapply it, but it seems to keep my skin from sweating a whole lot.</li>
            <li>i love that it goes on clear and really doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on your clothing like the white stick deodorants.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really do a whole lot for odor control or wetness.  </li>
            <li>It really wakes me up in the morning.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t need much - just one click per underarm.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gel, but it is not sticky and dries fast.</li>
            <li>I did not care much for this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>but this stuff drys really fast.</li>
            <li>and I have to say this protection lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>I was odor free definitely for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had much experience with gel based deodorants</li>
            <li>I also haven&#x27;t been feeling sweating as much as I used to.</li>
            <li>it really lasts all day</li>
            <li>Dries fast with no residue.</li>
            <li>Had difficulty locating a fragrance free gel deodorant at local stores.</li>
            <li>So I belong to a website that sends free products to try and this is one of them I recently received and liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I have had sensitivities to deodorant my whole life.  </li>
            <li>Because this one really does what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>got a free sample, and tried it only because I had it.  </li>
            <li>I started using my free sample, and it goes on just like a solid --</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ve switched and really the results</li>
            <li>The deodorant worked out really well.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need much, it lasts me about two days even if I sweat which it takes a lot for me to sweat</li>
            <li>I absolutely looooove this deodorant.</li>
            <li>No annoying white marks rubbing off on clothes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like this product.  </li>
            <li>The gel dries fast, doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky feel that I remember</li>
            <li>With smooth skin, the gel dries quicker and definitely holds close to the 48 hours.</li>
            <li>after that there is the 30 minute drive home, as well as unpacking the vehicle of all of the items necessary for a comfortable field trip.</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>So much so, that I leave one in my office desk for morning freshness.</li>
            <li>I got to try this thanks to BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>Works very well to help with odor protection.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how well it works beyond about 12 hours but up until 12 hours, it still worked very well.</li>
            <li>It really works (even if you skip a day).</li>
            <li>This gel is so much easier to use.</li>
            <li>As an antiperspirant and deodorant, it works very well.</li>
            <li>Men really can use it also.</li>
            <li>and I really dis-like deodorants where I smell myself all day.  </li>
            <li>but I also didn&#x27;t reapply as much</li>
            <li>so I could really tell if it worked or not.</li>
            <li>I only smelled the light smell of the deodorant.</li>
            <li>This deodorant lasted the whole day while I was running and playing basketball</li>
            <li>This was surprisingly better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to everyone !</li>
            <li>this really worked.</li>
            <li>but it dries very fastand</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>My family and I are very outdoors.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>but this really doesn&#x27;t leave any, which is perfection.</li>
            <li>did find that on really humid days (which we have in California)</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>is very sticky</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get any allergic reaction to it and the gel dries really fast.</li>
            <li>BUT, the real test was my husband.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a hardworking guy than can really sweat.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care much for that in a deodorant.  </li>
            <li>neither should you if you want a deodorant that really works.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find the Secret Unscented.  </li>
            <li>It also works very well for what it&#x27;s intended....</li>
            <li>so I really wanted to like it.  </li>
            <li>This is another great product from Secret.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this to review and was not expecting much.  </li>
            <li>It also works very well for what it&#x27;s intended....</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really outlast, but it is unscented.</li>
            <li>It is fast drying</li>
            <li>Then the absolute</li>
            <li>and I did enjoy the fact that it didnt leave white marks, but it did not provide 48 hours of protection though.</li>
            <li>And it really protected me from stinking while sweating.    </li>
            <li>I can highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much for it to do its job.</li>
            <li>I have to admit I am a very sweaty person</li>
            <li>thanks to Bzzagent</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I even touched it before I put my shirt on to make sure it wasn&#x27;t wet</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I worked reasonably well.</li>
            <li>&gt; All in all, if you are in a position where you really don&#x27;t sweat, this may be the deodorant for you.</li>
            <li>Really it&#x27;s all you could ask for in a deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I sell Scentsy at events and was out in the heat and sun for a whole weekend.  </li>
            <li>Works really well without drying skin.</li>
            <li>If i dispense too much then i just reverse the direction and the product returns to the contains  </li>
            <li>(if you didn&#x27;t disperse too much )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, i like it.</li>
            <li>Should have read description more carefully.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m putting too much on</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This stuff REALLY works for 48 hours.  </li>
            <li>this deo really controlled my BO.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>but over all I really like it</li>
            <li>It really does give 48 hour protection.</li>
            <li>I liked when I put on the clear gel how it didn&#x27;t stain my shirts and because its clear I was not worried about stains or visible white residue when when wearing sleeveless shirts.</li>
            <li>did receive this product as a free trial from secret and Bzzagent all opinions shared are my own.</li>
            <li>I love that this product goes on clear, with no white lines to worry about.</li>
            <li>I have tried a million different products and Secret is the best antiperspirant on the market.</li>
            <li>Overall I have been thrilled with my initial bottle and will continue to use</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product free from BzzAgent and Secret, but opinions are all my own.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t remain any white mark on the cloths because it is clear gel and most of all</li>
            <li>Much better than the white bars that they say goes on clear</li>
            <li>I recieved this as a promotion from the brand and will sure be buying it in the near future.</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast is the most effective odor protection is have used so far.</li>
            <li>but sometimes it oozes out a bit on its own.</li>
            <li>There is no white marks on my clothes, fresh scent, and worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I only need a tiny amount for effective all day odor protection.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall just makes the cut as another average deodorant with nothing super fantastic to note.</li>
            <li>To put it to the test, I put the deodorant on first and then put my black tank top on.</li>
            <li>It keeps me dry all day long and even though it&#x27;s unscented it smells good.</li>
            <li>Other than that the product seems to be inline with  the rest of their odor  protection products, however, I would love to see a paraben and aluminum free deodorant in their future lines!</li>
            <li>You stay fresh all day with no mess.  </li>
            <li>While it is not bad on a normal day, for those days I am more physically active, it doesn&#x27;t completely keep odors away.  </li>
            <li>when first applied, It has a cold/wet feeling which was new to me.</li>
            <li>From the first time I used this new product I was hooked.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a wonderful product Secret!!</li>
            <li>I love the quick to dry gel which will not leave white marks.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely loved the Secret Outlast clean and clear gel</li>
            <li>I is easy to use, dries fast and lasts long!</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend to anyone who like a fresh scent!</li>
            <li>This deodorant is unique in that it actually does what it says it will!</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant so much, I have been using the same basic Secret deodorant for as long as I can remember but for the first time in years I am so impressed that I am making the switch.</li>
            <li>;) I love that this clear gel doesn&#x27;t feel all wet and goopy going on</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t think this product works quite as well for odor protection as clinical strength products, it&#x27;s better than the other non-clinical strength products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Other then that I love it.</li>
            <li>I have not been happy with my solid deodorants that leave marks and also do not seem to last long.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is as powerful as the clinical strength that Secret makes, but it is still pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li>however you want to be sure not to get it on your clothes like other deodorants, or it will show on your shirt.  </li>
            <li>I was thoroughly impressed with Secret outlast!!</li>
            <li>Many of the other women&#x27;s deodorants reek of perfume,</li>
            <li>its works a lot better than the other brands that I am use to.  </li>
            <li>I even wake up the next morning smelling fresh without need to reapply!</li>
            <li>i love the way it smells and it lasts almost half the day compared to other deoderants i love secret outlast deoderant &amp;#60;i recieved this item for free in return of an honest product review from bzzagent</li>
            <li>I thought it was hilarious, but also cool that it even worked for my hard working man.</li>
            <li>I have always loved secret because of its great long lasting protection like no other.</li>
            <li>This is a great deodorant it keeps my underarms dry and not stinky after a full busy day and for a full 48 hours without white marks on my clothes :) my only complaint is I wish it dried just a tag faster :)</li>
            <li>I received Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel free to review and it is now my new favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li>The deoderant seemed to dry out very quickly.</li>
            <li>I like it because it does exactly what it says it will do - keep you feeling clean and dry all day.</li>
            <li>First off, I gotta say, Secret Outlast Clear Gel in Completely Clean smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>i would totally recommend this to anyone, the gel goes on smoothly and dries quickly, it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on your clothes and</li>
            <li>On Day 3 I continued my regular schedule applying “Completely Clean”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this went on smooth no stinging, and dried very quickly with no visible residue.  </li>
            <li>If you are mildly active, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>It works and it dries fast, which was one of the main things I was worried about.</li>
            <li>Secret outlast is the best deodorant ever it works all day long and don&#x27;t leave marks</li>
            <li>This gel is cool to the touch and makes me squirm for the first few moments after applying it, but it quickly dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant it smells great and works hard when you work hard</li>
            <li>I use it on special occasions only.</li>
            <li>Once it finally dried it worked great and kept me dry all day.  </li>
            <li>I wear a lot of black, so I loved that this product does leave the white debris on my clothes.  </li>
            <li>it goes on as a clear gel, but dries very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothes -</li>
            <li>I have used secret and its ok for easy days</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve always used secret products, so i was super excited when i was chosen to receive this product free from clearlybetterchallenge.com as a member of one2one</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I was extremely satisfied with Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel - it kept me dry and still smelling great, even after a long sweat-filled workout!</li>
            <li>The scent is very clean but may be stronger than other deodorants.</li>
            <li>I am more of a natural products person, so I would not normally go pick this up from the store.</li>
            <li>I love it also because it does not get on my dark clothing, which I wear a lot of in fall an winter.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin and shave my underarms every 2 days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Secret Outlast for several days and can honestly say that the product has lived up to most of the hype.</li>
            <li>I went through it twice as fast as my normal deodorant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>glad i got to try this for free from bzzagent, now i dont have to waste my money on it later.</li>
            <li>I will however get a full size of this deodorant and i will update my review later</li>
            <li>I was recently sent a full size sample of this product by BzzAgent to test out.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely no white marks and a true 48 hour protection.  </li>
            <li>most of my deodorants last for several months, but this one runs out rather fast, which is one of the issues with the &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; deodorants.</li>
            <li>After a couple of days using Secret Outlast, I am thrilled!</li>
            <li>first day I wore this deoderant, I had a 14 hour day at work that was extremely busy.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any white marks so that part of the claim seems true.</li>
            <li>It may not be strong enough to keep me dry for an entire day, but it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel doesn&#x27;t have a strong sent, but it smells clean...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other brands, and this one beats them all!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll come off a little), and I am good to go for an entire day.</li>
            <li>First, it does not irritate my super sensitive skin (which is a big priority for me).  </li>
            <li>This is going to be a new deodorant in my household!</li>
            <li>Through a tough work week and busy home life, it worked just great.</li>
            <li>Next time I will try a different scent, but other than that, it was a great find.</li>
            <li>I was able to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel as part of BzzAgent, and I was impressed that it didn&#x27;t leave any white marks (or other marks from the clear gel) on my clothing.</li>
            <li>It keeps you dry and odor free all day.  </li>
            <li>it kept me dry and odor free, and i wore it on a marathon day.</li>
            <li>I’ve tried many of the clinical deodorants which are much more expensive and this seems to do a better job for less money.</li>
            <li>Seriously, if you are looking for a nondudely smelling deodorant that won&#x27;t leave gross white bits in your underarm hair, this is the best choice.</li>
            <li>I can always count on staying dry and streal free.</li>
            <li>and it was dry and felt smooth.</li>
            <li>Even better, I wear a lot of black</li>
            <li>I had enough odor to notice it on myself, but luckily I don&#x27;t think anyone else</li>
            <li>so it dried fairly quickly, left no residue and had good staying power.</li>
            <li>but better than than the solid because you can&#x27;t get white marks on your clothes.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it says that it will last for 48 hours, although I will probably never know because I reapply daily.  </li>
            <li>after the grandchildren went back home with my daughter, i still had many hours left in the day to test the product....</li>
            <li>There are never any white marks on my clothes, and it dries quickly and not sticky.</li>
            <li>This one is holding STEADY.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to share this with other woman, it REALLY works and does what it says!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>As for odor, I never smelled anything particularly foul coming from me, so I assumed it worked out.</li>
            <li>I absolutley love the Secret Outlast gel, I got this free in a campain from bzzagent.</li>
            <li>The smell ist decent.</li>
            <li>It actually is clear, which is rare from deodorants that purport to be clear.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that there really is no white residue left on your clothes</li>
            <li>Luckily, I brought  back up deodorant.</li>
            <li>trichlorohydrex gly 18% as the main ingredient, while outlast uses aluminum zirconium octachlorohydrex gly 16%.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rating 4 stars though because my only criticism I can offer is a big deal for me, it feels damp when it goes on as most gels tend to do</li>
            <li>Received a free sample for a review and wasn&#x27;t really expected much from it.</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast does have a scent, it&#x27;s pleasant but one might be upset if they go into it expecting it to be scentless.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t leave you the sticky feeling that mostly others do pause and gives you a refreshing sensation in the aroma lost long especially since I&#x27;m really active doing CrossFit</li>
            <li>Since I have had that problem with other deodorants, I just did the usual very light dusting of a powder on top of the deodorant to keep that from happening.  </li>
            <li>Keeps me nice and dry all day long.</li>
            <li>When you first put on the deodorant it is wet but dries quickly</li>
            <li>and I believe it is one of the reasons it&#x27;s not sticky.the inside of the lid meet with the design on the top of the bottle sealing it off for a tight close.</li>
            <li>thought it was just the high stress/nervous situation of the day</li>
            <li>i highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I really like it and really did feel fresh for a long time!  </li>
            <li>There has got to be a more natural ingredient that can be used for wetness control other than the aluminum.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know which arm was which, but one clearly smelled much better than the other.</li>
            <li>It (much to my surprise) even remained clear with a mild amount of perspiration mixed in.</li>
            <li>since i started using this, they have just about completely gone away!!</li>
            <li>am very picky about deodorants and rarely find that their claims to leave no residue or white marks to be completely unfounded!</li>
            <li>So no wasted deodorant!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got to try this product, as I was pleasantly surprised at how fast Secret Outlast absorbed into my skin!</li>
            <li>, I usually sweat a lot, but this new deodorant kept me dry and works great.  </li>
            <li>It works fine just as long as it&#x27;s not too hot outside.</li>
            <li>I am able to use Secret&#x27;s outlast right after a shave and no side effects at all!  </li>
            <li>This product goes on clear and dries fast.  </li>
            <li>After walking through downtown and then doing some light housework at home I noticed that my underarms again felt sticky and wet.</li>
            <li>The first thing I did when I received Secret deodorant was to smell it, and omg it was amazing.</li>
            <li>i had told everyone at a womens outreach program about the deodorant and had them smell it and see what they thought before i used it and tried to hear what they all thought about it, everyone seemed to think it smelled amazing even though a few thought it was very overpowering, they still seems to like the overall smell.</li>
            <li>It dries clear and really helps control perspiration.</li>
            <li>Keeps me clean and dry.</li>
            <li>I also really like that it applies clear -</li>
            <li>The scent is minimal as opposed to the Mitchum&#x27;s Scent Free Gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of gels, but I liked how fast this one dried.</li>
            <li>and after a few weeks didn&#x27;t work as well any more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, overall its worth a shot and it may work for you</li>
            <li>Normally, I would never think to purchase any type of gel product out of fear of feeling wetness all day.</li>
            <li>Its especially great in the summer when you wear short sleeves or tank tops and don&#x27;t want to get the white deodorant on your clothes or worse</li>
            <li>I love that it last so long</li>
            <li>its nice not having dark clothes with white deodorant streaks on them after getting dressed.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve stuck with stick formulas, dealing with white marks and cakey residue they left on my shirts and dresses because I thought they protected me better than their clear gel counterparts.</li>
            <li>Of course I did what any normal person would do...</li>
            <li>I did find the deodorant effective for at least 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another good product from the Secret line</li>
            <li>Even when I tour theme parks with my Secret Clinical Strength version, I smell good at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Loved Secret Outlast</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I feel Secret Outlast is good value for money.</li>
            <li>The deodorant is good, but not great.</li>
            <li>Chasing after a toddler, getting in and out of the pool, and running around showing houses, it&#x27;s not hard for me to work up a sweat.  </li>
            <li>As far as the wet feeling from the gel, it dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It smells great, dries super fast, and lasts through my crazy days and nights as a stay at home mom and home based business owner!  </li>
            <li>I have not liked gel in the past, but this quick drying has worked great.</li>
            <li>However, the new Outlast Clear Gel did not do much to help wetness.</li>
            <li>it drys super fast, and leaves absolutely no residue under the arm (or on your clothing).</li>
            <li>Finally a deodorant that keeps me dry all day.. love the gel and the way it doesn&#x27;t ruin my clothes</li>
            <li>This one is a quick drying gel that goes on completely clear and won&#x27;t leave white marks on your clothing.  </li>
            <li>This pleasant smelling deodorant does not leave icky white marks on your clothing, even the darkest of colors.  </li>
            <li>my husband and i were working on digging and planting in our flower beds, and the cleanup involved afterwards, then getting dinner ready, eating, cleanup after that, as well as other preperations for the next day that take a couple more hours.</li>
            <li>You know what I mean, you get a nice shirt on, then get dolled up and change your mind.</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast Clear Gel is working awesome so far and keeping me dry all day!</li>
            <li>It goes on with a cool feeling and kept me dry all day.</li>
            <li>That is why I love Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>As I said before, I am very picky and found that Secret Outlast Completely Clean went on smooth, not sticky and stayed that way throughout my day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It worked just as well as the solid deodorant that I used to use (even in the hot Georgia summer!), and left no marks on my cloths, so I think I&#x27;m ready to switch!</li>
            <li>I tried it and was impressed that it took very little to cover my underarm area and dried almost instantly.</li>
            <li>Alas, it doesn&#x27;t last an entire day for me, and the scent isn&#x27;t very pleasant toward the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Goes on clear, no stains, dries within seconds and last all day in Iowa&#x27;s hot humid weather!</li>
            <li>It came on smooth, i had no leftover residue like other brands.</li>
            <li>I notice that it goes on clear and dries pretty fast leaving no white spots on your clothing.</li>
            <li>Loved that there is no white marks left on my dark clothes</li>
            <li>I got to sample this new product from Bzz Agent.  </li>
            <li>Since this was a new product I brought it along in my bag</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with the new formula.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely my new go to deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i live in florida, so we have to deal with florida heat.</li>
            <li>I am on the market for a new antiperspirant as  we speak.</li>
            <li>I live in South Carolina.</li>
            <li>I also live in Arizona, so sweating can be quite an issue during the summer months.  </li>
            <li>They have a new buyer in me.</li>
            <li>This deodorant lasts all day and I will never have to remember apply again finding my new deodorant.</li>
            <li>This will be my new go-to deodorant.</li>
            <li>, this product does live up to its claims.</li>
            <li>I am a new mom, so</li>
            <li>Definitely my new deodorant of choice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so whats new with this one.  </li>
            <li>I am a park ranger, and I live and work in South Louisiana.</li>
            <li>I deff found a new deodorant to use.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I got in my car to head home that I remembered the new deoderant that I had put on that day.</li>
            <li>How well does it live up to the claim?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the new outlast clear gel would be only putting it mildly.</li>
            <li>The gel goes on quickly, cleanly and not much is needed.</li>
            <li>Several weeks ago, in a huge hurry to get out the door, I actually forgot to apply my deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I love Secret Outlast, it drys fast, keeps me smelling and feeling clean as well as not leaving white marks.</li>
            <li>This deodorant went on smooth, dried quickly, and didn&#x27;t leave white marks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already a fan of Secret already and use it regularly because of how great it works for me.</li>
            <li>an adult, this product definitely helps keep me fresh all day, every day.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Reduces underarm wetness, 48-hour odor protection, strong enough for a woman and goes on clear with no white marks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>helping it dry quickly.</li>
            <li>loved this Secret Outlast Clear Gel.  </li>
            <li>It goes on clear and stays clear the whole day.  </li>
            <li>I will say that after using a dry solid for so many years it was an adjustment going to a clear gel.  </li>
            <li>This clear gel deodorant dries really fast compared to the old one I used 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>in one big SPLOCH ( that&#x27;s the sound and only</li>
            <li>I got this when I ran out of my secret outlast unscented solid deodorant because of the great reviews.</li>
            <li>I switched to the regular powder scent Secret Deodorant and it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>I am not a big fan of gel products but, it went on smooth and dried quickly.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this &amp;#34;New Formula&amp;#34; clear gel Secret Outlast deodorant.  </li>
            <li>It has a slight fragrance, nothing too strong and it won&#x27;t overpower your perfume the way that some deodorant fragrances will.  </li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical at first since I haven&#x27;t always had the best luck with clear solids.</li>
            <li>It feels a little sticky at first but dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I remain pretty dry and odorless for a decent amount of time!  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>In the North Carolina 100 degree heat, I was very surprised how well this deodorant worked.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>but it dried pretty quickly and didn&#x27;t get on my clothes.</li>
            <li>It seemed to absorb quickly into my skin and left no wet feeling or clumps.</li>
            <li>The scent is also light and you just smell &amp;#34;fresh.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li>but once it came up, the flow didn&#x27;t dispense too freely but easy enough to control and get just enough for use without waste.</li>
            <li>Although the stress was high at times, I never had to worry about any older or wetness because yes secret outlast clear gel is amazing and works so well.</li>
            <li>I was steer clear of this stuff!</li>
            <li>My mom loves this clear gel!  </li>
            <li>I used to have to keep deodorant in my purse to reapply, but not with this clear gel!</li>
            <li>I would have never tried the clear gel if it weren&#x27;t for you guys!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always pleasantly surprised when a product does what it&#x27;s advertised to do!</li>
            <li>I would never trust a 48 hour protection guarantee, especially because I do hot power yoga and do a lot of walk/running.</li>
            <li>Secret® Clinical Strength does what it needs to do and keeps me fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>I did not have any more irritation from using this deodorant when compared to others I have used in the past</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always tried solid deodorants and this was my first time trying gel deodorant.</li>
            <li>I do not usually shower twice a day, but I make exceptions on sweaty days or after swimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>though i doubted it completely!</li>
            <li>first of all i do not need something to work for 48 hours, as i do shower daily...</li>
            <li>Usually I am not a gel person</li>
            <li>I did yard work that day and it was hot outside</li>
            <li>No white marks on my shirts, no uncomfortable sweat</li>
            <li>I have to wear clear gels because of how much I sweat, and my old clear gel no longer worked.</li>
            <li>I have been using this products for the past 5 months and continue to love it.</li>
            <li>I applied it once in the morning and after a long day at work and at the gym I was still smelling fresh when I went home.</li>
            <li>Recently, I received a completely different deodorant which keeps me fresh for whole day</li>
            <li>After using the product for about a week I can say that I am pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>It really DOES keep my armpits dry and clean and after the 3rd day</li>
            <li>How can one provide better protection or last longer than other.</li>
            <li>I am personally not a fan of the feeling of the gel for the first seconds</li>
            <li>I work in the hot sun six days a week and have tried a lot of brands in hopes to not feel completely gross by the end of each day.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>, which was a little strong smelling for my liking.  </li>
            <li>The scent is a little strong for me</li>
            <li>and I was excited that as a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li>I felt like it never dried, though it says its a quick dry formula.</li>
            <li>Thank you BzzAgent and Secret for letting me try my new favorite deodorant!</li>
            <li>because first off, it&#x27;s super sticky since it&#x27;s a roll on in liquid form which takes much longer to dry, and second, it only provides me with up to 12 hours of coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret</li>
            <li>I usually use the solid but was excited to try the completely clean clear gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying a FREE SAMPLE of Secret Outlast Clear Gel thanks to #SECRET and I have to say this is a great product.</li>
            <li>The first day I used it, I noticed that it went on clear and left no whiteness on my armpits.</li>
            <li>The gel dried super fast, but didn&#x27;t go through a full day without getting my shirt wet on my underarm area.  </li>
            <li>I  felt  dry and fresh all day when using the product</li>
            <li>and I stayed fresh and dry.</li>
            <li>It keep me dry and fresh all day and gave me the confidence to do everything I needed.</li>
            <li>SO FRESH AND DRY</li>
            <li>I noticed I was still dry and fresh all day.</li>
            <li>An hour after the application I noticed that the gel felt rather sticky on my skin (where is the dry and fresh feel?).</li>
            <li>It does go on wet, but dries fairly quick.  </li>
            <li>I have always used Secret deodorant in the past and I must say this is one of the best products on the market.</li>
            <li>Especially when you love wearing dark clothing.</li>
            <li>I usually use secret clinical and have always been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>it does have a faint but pleasant scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Applied the product after my morning shower and started my day, it is summer and currently about 100 degrees outside where I live and this kept me dry and odor free all day!</li>
            <li>I was thoroghly impressed with this product in comparison to my former product (Lady Speed Stick), though I am still getting a slight irritation from this it is not nearly as intense as previous.</li>
            <li>I recently received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel through BzzAgent as a means to experience the product for free!  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the residue/white stuff left behind by most solid deodorants, so I was excited to try out this gel formula.</li>
            <li>I have a fairly physical job and remaining dry throughout the day is important to me.  </li>
            <li>No white marks on my favorite black too.</li>
            <li>It dried super fast after I put it on</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, especially for new moms!</li>
            <li>The only draw back is that it is a little cold when you first put it on, but worth getting used to, to make sure that I have clean clothing and can get dressed right away!  </li>
            <li>Works all day and no mess!</li>
            <li>There are NO awful white marks, and if  you let it dry properly then you will have NO gel streaks on your clothes either.</li>
            <li>and I am left with pure odor and wetness protection instead of a scent to mask any nastiness.</li>
            <li>I stayed very dry and smelled fresh.</li>
            <li>My wedding day is fast approaching, and I am so glad that my dress will not be covered in a white streaky mess.</li>
            <li>I was under the sun all day at a local theme park, so as long as I still smell good, a little sweat doesn&#x27;t bother me!</li>
            <li>He only used it a few ays until I could get him some more, but I know he enjoyed how hard it worked even for him.</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast Completely Clean deodorant makes me feel 100% sure during my extremely long work days!</li>
            <li>My underarms were wet for about thirty seconds, but after that they stayed dry and fresh all day, even after exercising!!</li>

            <li>Truly Clear.</li>
            <li>clear gel doesn&#x27;t leave marks on your clothing, so I never have to worry about that.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used clear gel deodorants before and they didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only is it completely invisible, but it works very well as an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>Unscented, and clear.</li>
            <li>and it was clear like nothing was there</li>
            <li>It went on clear</li>
            <li>One twist of the deodorant provides enough odor and wetness protection for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>As you can imagine I am always busy and running around.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell masculine either.</li>
            <li>As far as odor protection, I sweat a lot</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used natural (doesn&#x27;t cut it for me), RX (can taste the metallic &amp; burns), so I got stuck using one brand &amp; that was failing.....</li>
            <li>you have any degree of sensitive skin-</li>
            <li>With that being said I tried the product and was pleasantly surprised with it.</li>
            <li>I switched to this sensitive gel and my underarm reactions/sensitivities are completely gone.  </li>
            <li>I recommend giving it a try if you&#x27;ve been a solid deodorant player your whole life.  </li>
            <li>We were there nearly 40 hours before he was admitted to the hospital.</li>
            <li>I wore the same clothes the whole time.  </li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>My day was no where near a 24 hour period</li>
            <li>I give this deodorant a huge two thumbs up and will definitely buy another when my free sample that Secret gave me for a promotion</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being a busy mom and it also being summer.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not missing my old deodorant.</li>
            <li>Drys fast and tends to last all day!!!</li>
            <li>I became self conscious and from then</li>
            <li>and I am the last one to get ready.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always on the go, running around, just grocery shopping is a complete workout.</li>
            <li>It advertises that for 48 &#x27;epic&#x27; hours I can be protected from odor AND wetness.</li>
            <li>get moderate BO when I sweat, and this product absolutely eliminates that problem for me short of when I&#x27;m really exerting myself and leaking sweat like a sieve.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product for someone with sensitive skin, and I would not use it when you are planning to wear any non cotton based clothing.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Bzz Agent and thanks to Secret for allowing me to try the product for free.</li>
            <li>I haven’t developed one yet</li>
            <li>a set of 3 year old twin boys and now a 4 month baby girl.</li>
            <li>I lead a busy work/mommy life...</li>
            <li>Thanks to Secret and Buzz agent, I got to try the Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant for free!</li>
            <li>Perhaps I have an unusual body chemistry, but for me, I find I do have to apply it the next day, or I will experience perspiration under my arms.</li>
            <li>The fact that these ingredients are found in breast cancer patients&#x27; tissues makes me stay FAR AWAY.</li>
            <li>Price offer is reasonable, and expiry date on product is valid for a year and six months from now, this is a plus as oppose to othe purchased products where products last for 2-3 months from delivery date.</li>
            <li>I only give it a one star because I don&#x27;t sweat so much</li>
            <li>the air looked sort of like the silent hill movie (very foggy, creepy-like)...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t participate in any activities that produce a lot of sweat, and I just naturally don&#x27;t tend to have an odor.</li>
            <li>However, when I received this in the mail, and used it, I was surprised.  </li>
            <li>It dries fast, lasts all day and beyond, and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my shirt.  </li>
            <li>But when I came I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>It dries really fast and left no deodorant stains on my shirt.</li>
            <li>This masks it and deals with the unpleasantness of getting old.  </li>
            <li>My issue with this deodorant is that it does not last through much activity.</li>
            <li>Just beware if you have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It only needed one click and it covered the whole area.</li>
            <li>and my pits feel soft.</li>
            <li>Well FINALLY I found one that really does what it claims and does not leave marks.  </li>
            <li>I was about to reach for the stick that I keep in my desk, but I thought that I would see if the deoderant really held up (I had taken a shower the night before and applied deoderant afterwards) for multiple days.</li>
            <li>- the no whitemarks claim I found to be just about 100% true, even in my dark colored work out clothes.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to see that for about $4 a stick, Secret Outlast worked really well</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this for everyday and will definitely purchase.</li>
            <li>Thanks again Secret for sending me the free sample!</li>
            <li>(I received Secret Outlast Clear Gel to test out and any opinions are 100% my own.)</li>
            <li>I literally walked 8 miles and still smelled fresh and didn&#x27;t have any wet marks on my shirt underarm.</li>
            <li>I have always been a soft solid deodorant person, but recently was able to try Secret Outlast for free via Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li>Even to the next day I was still fresh when I took a shower that next afternoon .</li>
            <li>but as soon as the formula dries down the scent pretty much disapates</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually not a fan of gel deodorants but this one was quick to dry and left no marks on my clothing.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothes, and I love to wear black tops!</li>
            <li>I received my free BzzAgent sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel right before leaving on my family vacation.</li>
            <li>I am constantly in the need for an advanced odor protection deodorant and Secret Outlast Clear Gel has not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Meaning, I felt damp, thus I didn&#x27;t pull my shirt on until it had time to dry, and later in the day I felt sticky after a full day of work.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t like gel deodorant, but this one dries quickly and it really works.</li>
            <li>so when Secret offered to send me a free sample I wasn&#x27;t too excited about it, but figured why not since it had been years since I last tried their gel deodorant</li>
            <li>The other key point is that it seems to last all day, even on the hottest, more humid of days.</li>
            <li>I have tried different types of deodorant through the years from the regular powdery stuff, sprays, and clear gels and none have left me feeling clean at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It comes out too easily so dont turn the dispenser until it oozes, because it will keep oozing!  </li>
            <li>I work in a hot wherehouse and come home with my shirt dry, and without being smelly.  </li>
            <li>I received a sample of the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel complimentary for testing purposes from Bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and dries very quickly, leaving no residue or that &#x27;wet feeling&#x27; behind.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a long-time user of Secret Deodorant, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be instantly blown away, but I have to admit that I&#x27;m pretty impressed with the Secret Outlast Clear Gel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>as a member of one2one network, i received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com and being that i am almost 50 years old, and have used many types of deodorant, i am so excited to say that the secret outlast cleargel i was sent actually did what it claims to do...</li>
            <li>In the summer I sweat so much it is unbearable that I take at least 3 showers for the day and still not feel clean.</li>
            <li>humidity is ridiculous here in the south, and i need something that is powerful and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>It also seemed to dry quickly for me and did not require any extra drying time.</li>
            <li>But I had the opportunity to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel for free thanks to BzzAgent and now my mind has been opened!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a clear and lasting deodorant!</li>
            <li>I typically use men&#x27;s clear solid for dryness and odor protection (I don&#x27;t love the scent, but it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that keeps me dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Outlast Clear Gel really does go on clear; it doesn&#x27;t dry out my underarms.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t apply such a huge glob of it on my underarms (enough for 50 pairs of pits) and it would take hours to dry, if at all</li>
            <li>It kept me feeling fresh and dry all day love secret</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d convert from my regular solid to this, but it did smell fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one less thing to worry about considering I spend the whole day taking care of my 4 month old and don&#x27;t get to spend much time on myself.</li>
            <li>My review is for the Active Fresh scent which doesn&#x27;t appear to be sold on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got the active fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to be leaving any residue on my clothing - even if I put on clothing freshly after putting on the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of longevity, the deodorant seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li>Works really well - no wetness or odor even after a long busy day.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample from secret just in time for my first trip of the season - to AZ</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t a fan of the Active Fresh scent</li>
            <li>I also like the scent active fresh scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent I got was actually Active Fresh</li>
            <li>Normally I can&#x27;t use a clear get without having to reapply it several times.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical at first because although I love the scents available in Secret products however the deodorant has never been able to keep up with me.</li>
            <li>I am a high school biology teacher, and spend several hours each day on my feet in front of my students and in the lab.</li>
            <li>This product is consistent with the Secret line of products as it offers 48 hour odor protection, fends off armpit sweat and leaves me feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I am dry, not white streaks and it smiles amazingly fresh.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin so many of the women&#x27;s scents are irritating.</li>
            <li>This is gentle, won&#x27;t clog hair shafts and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>have had some busy days lately, one of which included me walking around outside in the heat for most of the day.</li>
            <li>Lately i have been having a problem with my shirts becoming discolored after using my husbands deodorant.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent that is not overwhelming (although I would have preferred something that had no scent).  </li>
            <li>He felt strange about a &amp;#34;woman&#x27;s&amp;#34; deodorant, but since it was unscented, he didn&#x27;t mind so much.</li>
            <li>It really does protect from odor and wetness all day long.</li>
            <li>, the only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is I feel the product wouldn&#x27;t last as long vs a solid , it seems like you use more gel vs the solid .</li>
            <li>It conked out mid day on a normal, non stressed, non sweaty day.</li>
            <li>I should disclaim that I normally have to use the extra odor protection deodorant, if I applied twice a day</li>
            <li>It goes on pretty wet, but has never stained my clothes.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is not replacing my current deodorant simply because I don&#x27;t know how it will perform in the summer, but I am reserving judgement until I know for certain.</li>
            <li>so after getting up at 7 am, and applying the secret clearlast gel and finally getting ready to shower at 11pm, i was extremely happy to realize that i had not gotten wet under my arms, and there was no marks on my clothing!!!!</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel helps to protect against the main causes of sweat: heat, activity and stress sweat!</li>
            <li>They did make their promise on it being a truly clear deodorant, but if it&#x27;s clear yet ineffective in every other way, I don&#x27;t see much point in buying</li>
            <li>This is no longer the same product and should get a new name.  </li>
            <li>The only thing for me was that it didn&#x27;t live up to the 48 hour claim.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert so, having wetness protection would have been a big bonus for me.</li>
            <li>But drying time is very fast unlike other gel deodorants.</li>
            <li>This product has only gotten better by making it clear with the new Secret Outlast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am trying the product for free with no obligation to review thanks to Secret.</li>
            <li>Switched from Dove to Secret Outlast thanks to BZZAGENT and I must say the difference is incredibly huge..</li>
            <li>also trying the product for free thanks to Secret.</li>
            <li>I received a FREE sample from BzzAgent thanks to Secret and will continue to purchase the product.</li>
            <li>I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand trying the product for free thanks to Secret.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying this product for free thanks to Secret through a Bzzz campaign.  </li>
            <li>I really like this stuff in dry climates.</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel stick worked really well from the start.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much I sweated it kept me dry.</li>
            <li>The scents are always fresh, I got active fresh, and kept the everyday stink away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that Secret improved the Clear Gel formula, and will continue to use</li>
            <li>(generally this is what I have not liked about gel deodorants in the past, but I was pleased with how quickly it dried.)&lt;br /&gt;Odor</li>
            <li>Love Secret clear gel.</li>
            <li>The first day or two, I stayed in the house and did normal everyday things</li>
            <li>I love Secret outlast clear gel.</li>
            <li>I love secret outlast clear gel.</li>
            <li>I love the Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant because of the scent and the odor protection.</li>
            <li>They say you need only one click, but I used two for each arm, it just doesn&#x27;t seem like enough deodorant with one click to even get it the whole way across your armpit</li>
            <li>I really love Secret Outlast Clear Gel.  </li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t go that long without showering), this stuff seems to do a pretty bang up job of lasting all day!</li>
            <li>It dried quickly and I didn&#x27;t need to worry about it getting on my tops.</li>
            <li>I tried this and was amazed that  this dried quickly.</li>
            <li>I applied the product and the gel dried quickly and did not leave a residue.</li>
            <li>It dried sooo quickly, and did not feel sticky at all.</li>
            <li>I have been using Secret Outlast for a few days now and it has worked great for me.</li>
            <li>but this one dried quickly and it did not feel gross.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>I normally do not like gel deodorant,but so far I&#x27;m loving Secret Outlast Clear Gel.</li>
            <li>I love the clear gel factor, no more white on clothes (even the ones that go on clear, the white stays white on clothes).</li>
            <li>First I am allergic to many different perfumes, second I can&#x27;t stand many perfumes and lastly I would hate to make someone have a severe allergic reaction just because I am vain...</li>
            <li>I really like the cool scent and all day protection of the Secret Outlast clear gel.</li>
            <li>Then apply the  clear gel no mess no white residue .</li>
            <li>So the first pit needs two clicks to have enough gel and the second pit only needs one.  </li>
            <li>I live in a climate that&#x27;s hot all year round, even our &amp;#34;winters&amp;#34; hold up in the 70 degree area, so deoderant is a must have for me.</li>
            <li>are the downsides: The first application didn&#x27;t last very long (where is the odor protection?)</li>
            <li>It can get on your clothes if you don’t let it dry first, but if does get on your clothes there are no white marks.</li>
            <li>This is the first Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant that finally kept me dry...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It keeps my fresh and dry all day long on a buys hospital unit.  </li>
            <li>Second, the clear gel dries fast with no sticky feeling and third, no white residue on my clothes or underarms!  </li>
            <li>It definitely kept me smelling fresh all day and not having to worry about white marks was a huge plus over Secret&#x27;s Clinical Strength deoderant that I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>Sometimes after shaving, I do experience a slight burning if I put this on right after.  </li>

            <li>I have sensitive skin and already enjoy Secret brand deodorants, but the new Outlast has kept me feeling fresher longer.</li>
            <li>no marks were even left behind on a black tank, so that was great.</li>
            <li>With five children I lead a pretty active life.</li>
            <li>Yes i sweated a little bit but at the end of the day I was still fresh.</li>
            <li>As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.&lt;br /&gt;Secret Outlast Clear Gel Antiperspirant and Deodorant lists the following...</li>
            <li>I get frustrated having to clean off deodorant from my clothing after I put it on, and I feel like I need more deodorant afterwards.</li>
            <li>, I was inside in the AC, not very active.</li>
            <li>but I generally use unscented.  </li>
            <li>Last year I remember trying the Clear Gel in ooh-la-lavender</li>
            <li>I like that it goes on clear and does not leave white stains on my clothing.</li>
            <li>It is clear so it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on your clothes.</li>
            <li>And because it is a clear gel there were no white streaks.</li>
            <li>However, this one dries almost instantly and dries clear with no residue.</li>
            <li>When you first put it on, it feels a bit awkward but the name does not lie, it outlasts many deodorants.</li>
            <li>I would only recommend this clear gel to women that prefer gels.</li>
            <li>my deodorant in the past always broke much sooner than it should have wasting too much product.</li>
            <li>The gel dries clear so no white residue on my clothes or in my pits.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve always felt that clear gels don&#x27;t work as well as white antiperspirants.&lt;br</li>
            <li>no white marks, goes on clear, lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I barely knew  </li>
            <li>No messy streaks is a definite plus!</li>
            <li>I only wish that the smell of the deodorant was stronger because I like to notice my deodorant smell without having to directly smell my armpits.</li>
            <li>So far not white lines.</li>
            <li>:  Smell, so far no white marks</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as 48 hour odor protection and no white mark residue</li>
            <li>Not sure what the exact difference is between the two aluminums, but I do know the Ph one lasts much longer and actually does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I love Secret Outlast Deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many Secret deodorants</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Secret Outlast</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the comfort Secret Outlast</li>
            <li>Secret sent me this product to try for free and I switched to this brand lightning speed !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Secret user for many years.  </li>
            <li>Secret is my favorite, no matter what scent.</li>
            <li>Secret deodorant is my favorite brand.</li>
            <li>Its nice not have that white &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34; residue that solid deodorants leave behind.</li>
            <li>remember its ok to have a secret.</li>
            <li>I put the secret on as soon as i got it in the mail, it works so much better than you could ever imagine.</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast is my favorite deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I used a clinical strength before trying this and the Secret Outlast is BETTER than the clinical deodorant!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have never used Secret deodorant before receiving this sample, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>It is really frustrating when you put on a top and look in the mirror and have the deodorant marks on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure everyone knows how frustrating they can be.</li>
            <li>I love Secret deodorant.</li>
            <li>Thank you Secret for letting me try this for free!</li>
            <li>I love secret outlast deodorant.</li>
            <li>Kind of feels weird going on because it&#x27;s gel</li>
            <li>In the past I haven&#x27;t been much of a fan of the gel deodorants, but this one dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky or wet under your arms.</li>
            <li>I love the new secret outlast!  </li>
            <li>I have about 15 different brands of deodorant at home, I live in the desert and its a daily necessity.</li>
            <li>It controlled the sweat, did not leave white streaks and dried quickly.</li>
            <li>There was no white marks and it dried quickly.</li>
            <li>i chose to do the real test when i took a day off of work to go on a field trip for my almost 5 year old granddaughter, knowing that my other 2 younger granddaughters would be there as well.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on it felt a little wet and cool, but within seconds it dried and felt normal.</li>
            <li>As soon as I applied it the product dried right away</li>
            <li>Second, no marks even if you put a black tank top on immediately after applying it, or if you put it on while wearing a black tank.  </li>
            <li>but I will say it has a clean scent that will last through a busy day at least and maybe a hour work out.</li>
            <li>I remain pretty dry and odorless for a long period of time!  </li>
            <li>very comparable to other name brand deodorants of</li>
            <li>When it did come up it was either to much or not enough making me thing I would always over use or never get enough and in the long run made me think I would go through it quicker.</li>
            <li>My very first thought was Is there anything in this small bottle to test?</li>
            <li>I was really amazed at how it works because it lasts up to 48 hours and protects from wetness due to sweat.</li>
            <li>After having tried pretty much every deodorant on the market, including the clinical ones, Secret&#x27;s Outlast Clear Gel in Unscented is a godsend.</li>
            <li>I definitely put this deodorant to the test the first day I wore it with a day spent volunteering outside and an evening</li>
            <li>I really like d that it does not take long to dry as that was my major concern with gel deodorants.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s actually working really great because I haven&#x27;t notice any bad armpit odor.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and didn&#x27;t leave any ugly white stains on my clothes!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclosure: I received the Secret Outlast Clear Gel for free from the One2One Network via clearlybetterchallenge.com</li>
            <li>I received a sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel as part of a brand promotion for free in exchange for my review.</li>
            <li>When I joined BzzAgent I started recieving products then I recieved Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant for free and</li>
            <li>I am a bzzagent and had the opportunity to try Secret Outlast Clear gel as a free sample.</li>
            <li>I was previously using Degree because, as my girlfriend likes to laugh, I &amp;#34;sweat like a man.&amp;#34; I was pleasantly surprised when this product not only kept me dry, it also didn&#x27;t have an odor.</li>
            <li>It last really well and left my shirt dry all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally a solid girl, but this clear gel actually exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I received a free stick of Secret Outlast® Clear Gel from Bzzagent.com to product review.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating, is only because it did dry fast at all like advertised.</li>
            <li>It goes on dry and clear so it leaves no messy white marks on your skin or clothes.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant from BzzAgent, and used it every day for about for two weeks.</li>
            <li>However, after 35 days, I tried this deodorant again, and found that even though it is a wet gel, and feels like it is covering my entire armpit, I did notice the deodorant was less effective and held out about half the time of 24</li>
            <li>The feeling of freshness lasts all day, I don&#x27;t feel the need to apply again before going to the gym after work because I still feel dry and fresh, but don&#x27;t have the caked on deodorant that I usually get with the normal stick type.</li>
            <li>Two hours later, just normal behavior no working out or being outdoors for long</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to have a chance to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel for free thanks to Secret</li>
            <li>I love Secret but have always used the invisible solid.</li>
            <li>i received no other compensation and this is my personal review.  </li>
            <li>Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel rocks!</li>
            <li>You just might want to try Secret Outlast completely clean and clear gel deodorant!</li>
            <li>The gel didn&#x27;t leave any marks on my clothing, however I didn&#x27;t really care for the dry time (which wasn&#x27;t long).</li>
            <li>I noticed no smell and definitely kept the sweating under my arms to a minimum - a consistent performance with my typical product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I sweat right through it and get rubbed raw.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a whole day and products hardly ever last me a whole day.</li>
            <li>but when it come to my body if the product is not a good fit I would not hesitate to say so.</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t speak for it&#x27;s lasting 48 hours, because i shower every 24 hours at minimum, however it stands up to my exercising and general sweating throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I was giving the secret out last clear gel 48hour protection from bzzagent free for  a campaign to try and review.</li>
            <li>on my lunch break,  When I get done walking, I can not head back to the office as a hot sweaty mess.</li>
            <li>I  was excited to try secret outlast clear gel</li>
            <li>The first few weeks I had no issues</li>
            <li>Despite that small issue, the deodorant itself worked and kept me fresh all day.  </li>
            <li>Being from Florida its hot year round.</li>
            <li>decided to give Secret Outlast the ultimate test, using for the first time when I was leaving to run my first 5k.  </li>
            <li>Our fall here has brought us temps in the upper 80&#x27;s - if you want to use a fragrance free aSend CLEAR gel deodorant that will not leave you hanging, use Secret Outlast.</li>
            <li>It really works, keeps you dry all day long!</li>
            <li>I noticed before how I used to sweat a lot and ever since I had been trying Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel, I noticed the differenced on my clothes.</li>
            <li>I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel as a sample from the company as a Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from BzzAgent for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I tried Secret Outlast Completely Clean clear gel deodorant.</li>
            <li>Although I did like the product I was not very fond of the scent i received which was active fresh.</li>
            <li>I notice you need to keep the container standing straight up and down so that the gel comes out evenly.  </li>
            <li>i live in florida, so it&#x27;s already hot and the secret outlast clear gel</li>
            <li>I am very active and spend a large amount of time walking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is one aspect that prevented me from giving Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel a full 5 stars - and that is due to its ability to travel without making a mess.  </li>
            <li>It goes on clear, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about marks on my clothing and it works all day long!</li>
            <li>Not great and not bad!    </li>
            <li>When I applied the clear gel it started to dry immediately.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear and it keeps me dry, but not for 48 hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear as it say and when you put it on you have to wait for it to dry which is understanding.</li>
            <li>It does dry clear</li>
            <li>My wife pretty much agrees, though she she complains of gradual build-up if she doesn&#x27;t let this stuff dry for a few minutes before slipping into a shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Its not messy and it last long.</li>
            <li>I would still prefer to use my normal secret powder fresh for my T-Shirt days.</li>
            <li>Over the course of my vacation I went to the beach several times, went on a few boat rides, and did a lot of walking on hot humid days.</li>
            <li>It washes off easily with that sticky feeling some deodorants leave behind.</li>
            <li>that Secret Outlast Completely Cleans claims were completely true and stood up to the claim of ongoing freshness and no sweat or odor.&lt;br /&gt;Secret</li>
            <li>I had stopped using Secret years ago, I had just outgrown the strong sents added.  </li>
            <li>While it does take a little bit of time to dry it was worth the wait for me.</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast, was super light after applying, was a little cold at first when applying, dried super fast.</li>
            <li>After testing the Secret Outlast Clear Gel in Active Fresh for a couple of days, I really like it.</li>
            <li>Not only does it keep me dry, but it goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t get my clothes all yucky.</li>
            <li>It kept me dry from early morning after my shower to the next day!</li>
            <li>It does dry fast and does not leave a sticky wet feeling under your pits.</li>
            <li>and I do love that way it works, how dry I stay, its non irritating and</li>
            <li>Normally I use a solid stick deodorant, I decided to try this out in hopes of escaping the white marks on my clothing, plus I received  it for free to Try from secret through bzzagent!.</li>
            <li>I sweat on a normal day when I&#x27;m not being active</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a bunch of deodorants over the years, and previously settled on SpeedStick style white cake and Sure roll-ons that, over time, always resulted in a thick, clumpy build-up in my shirts, and an ever-present sticky coating on my pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am fine with any secret products except outlast.</li>
            <li>Before I got it for free, thanks to Secret &amp; BzzAgent, I was previously using an invisible solid</li>
            <li>I was a little leery about trying this product as the idea of goo under my arms wasn&#x27;t sounding very helpful to me.  </li>
            <li>I have been a Secret user for my entire adult life, and I was lucky enough to receive a free Secret Outlast by being a BzzAgent of Bzzagent.com.  </li>
            <li>I had high hope for Secret Outlast Clear Gel, and after receiving it in a FREE BzzKit, was anxious to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I did not smell bad, but I did not smell good either.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of gel deodorants and they always left me feeling wet and my skin irritated, with the outlast clear gel I had no issues at all.</li>

            <li> LOVE!!</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite deodorant!!</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a about 15 days now, I love it!!</li>
            <li> it went on very nicely and gave me order protection</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the unscented gel deodorant and is very effective.</li>
            <li> It had a very nice smell that lingered well after application</li>
            <li> Amazing product!</li>
            <li> This deodorant is amazing!</li>
            <li> but all opinions are my own from my experience of using it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never met a gel deodorant that I liked - until now!  </li>
            <li> Loving this stuff!</li>
            <li> And the best part is we got to try it free from BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> I felt confident wearing it for the wedding and shared how impressed with the product I was with the rest of the bridesmaids.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice!</li>
            <li> Another thing I really liked about it was that it lasted!</li>
            <li> best part is that I got it for free through BzzAgent.com!</li>
            <li> I love that amazon will ship it to my door for a great price!</li>
            <li> I am really glad that I did because I was impressed that the scent was not over powering, I had no sticky feeling, my clothes did not have any traces of the gel.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff very good use is a lot!</li>
            <li> It works great, goes on smooth, smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks!</li>
            <li> but it is a pleasant girly scent that is not over baring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and It has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> What I lvoe best is that this one will not stain your clothes like the Lady Mitchum brand does and it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> It goes on great and smells amazing also.</li>
            <li> it worked good.  </li>
            <li> I loved this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;this product worked fairly well.</li>
            <li> one, the scent is surprisingly good.</li>
            <li> The gel did not feel good at all</li>
            <li> I do feel like it did a good job controlling odor and wetness, but the price of that was too high!&lt;br</li>
            <li> A good price with Subscribe and Save discount.</li>
            <li> I also really loved the gel</li>
            <li> Otherwise good product and</li>
            <li> so I know the value of a good product.</li>
            <li> At the end of two of my theme park days, I did not smell as good as I would have with the clinical strength version either.</li>
            <li> It feels good and it works  (even for me, for a</li>
            <li> and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good deodorant.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d probably be good before then.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been really really good...</li>
            <li> I stay smelling good all day</li>
            <li> but this one works fairly well for me.</li>
            <li> Good pricing and product.</li>
            <li> i loved the smell</li>
            <li> Outlast has been a good product</li>
            <li> It is a really good product.</li>
            <li> Well I received this deodorant for free as part of a promotion with the brand, and I must say I am quite impressed!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of allergies and have to be fairly picky about what type of deodorants I buy for my family members.  </li>
            <li> and it was a good product.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m amazed it worked as good as it did.</li>
            <li> It smells really good</li>
            <li> One thing I am worried about is that I hope this deodorant will work as good in the summer since I am testing this product in the winter.</li>
            <li> and I must say that it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> My clothes are no longer stained with deodorant stains and my armpits smell good.</li>
            <li> so it may be good sweat protection.  </li>
            <li> Good unscented deodorant.</li>
            <li> This is GOOD news for the consumer because the aluminum is a cause of cancer.</li>
            <li> Maybe a good selection in the summer, but I don&#x27;t see myself using a gel through the winter months.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t seem to sweat, although to be fair</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and smells really good.  </li>
            <li> SOOOOOOOOOO GOOD</li>
            <li> I was delighted with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and the protection is great for every day work and life.  </li>
            <li> But I got it put it on and loved it.  </li>
            <li> It was smooth, and the curve of the applicator is perfectly sized for my underarms (maybe I&#x27;m just too used to using the guys&#x27; one!).</li>
            <li> The effectiveness of deodorant is sensational.</li>
            <li> Gel, no fragrance, super!!!</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with.</li>
            <li> It is a great deodarant that stands up to the tests of many a sweat tests.  </li>
            <li> I was very glad about that.</li>
            <li> so i am very pleased with that part.  </li>
            <li> It would better to find a perfect clear gel deodorant to save cloths and also smell perfect.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s refreshing and has a great scent.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to get this product free from BzzAgent to test it out and review!  </li>

            <li> amazing deoderant</li>
            <li> I have never had it leave any marks which is amazing to me.  </li>
            <li> It works great against odor too, which is just as important.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> i recieved a trial size of this amazing deodorant from bzzagent</li>
            <li> so I would have not tried it on my own.</li>
            <li> Oh and can not forget, it smells nice too.</li>
            <li> There is a really nice park around the building</li>
            <li> He ended up loving the protection it gave him.</li>
            <li> Nice</li>
            <li> liked this deodorant</li>
            <li> well, you never know when it is going to come in handy.</li>

            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s affordable and the packaging is nice as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotion, and all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t think it was as effective after about 8 hours as well.</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> The times I used it, I liked it.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled that it worked this well!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> thats about all I liked.</li>
            <li> this is my honest unbiased opinion on my experience with this product.</li>
            <li> When your body is clogged up with chemicals, it cannot effectively “detox”.</li>
            <li> I admit I kind of shrugged and just figured it would be like the rest of them.</li>
            <li> Says on all day doesn&#x27;t get marks on clothes loving it.</li>
            <li> from my mother who i got it for she so loved it and it refreshing smell and</li>
            <li> my opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I also agree it is highly effective as an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the scent, and could smell it throughout the day as I became more</li>
            <li> the fresh really good smell is just an added bonus!</li>
            <li> I had the completely clean scent- which smelled great.</li>
            <li> Works great, goes on clean and doesn&#x27;t ruin clothes</li>
            <li> it has a pleasant scent and applies easily.</li>
            <li> Great protection, smells great, and totally black dress loved!  </li>
            <li> item is also amazing because as an mom of three running around with kids, running errands and my yoga time, I have finally found the perfect superior protection deodorant.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me after testing this out it was great.</li>
            <li> Has pleasant light fragrance.</li>
            <li> The smell is light and pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> And I love the refreshing scent!</li>

            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> When I needed to apply it, I found that the container had been &amp;#34;squeezed&amp;#34; so that a lot of excess gel was on the top of the applicator - much more than I needed to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried it out.</li>

            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a product sample free from clearlybetterchallenge.com  as a member of One2One Network, but all opinions and experiences are my own.</li>

            <li> I sweat profusely, I have tried a number of products but none worked and most of them darkened my underarms.</li>
            <li> I tested the product as part of Bzzz marketing campaign, and I&#x27;m glad that I did.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have purchased deodorant hoping it performs as advertised.  </li>
            <li> No matter how many say they won&#x27;t, they always do.  </li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product.  </li>
            <li> would anyone expect to go more than a day without reapplying deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works ok.</li>
            <li> and it dries very quickly, best of all it last all day.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> but surely it couldn&#x27;t be me, not so soon after applying.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly pleased.</li>
            <li> The best antiperspirant/deodorant for sweating and odor, especially stress sweat, and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li> I received this lovely product after getting it as part of a Bzzkit from Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li> Many of my summer shirts now have residue on the inside armpits that refuse to wash off.  </li>
            <li> Love the way this goes on....not sticky afterwards although you do have to wait a minute or two for the stickiness to go away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure  my husband would.  </li>
            <li> what more could a girl ask for?</li>
            <li> I think it would be okay.</li>
            <li> I used it with my favorite LBD and went dancing.</li>
            <li> I Love that it has no scent.</li>
            <li> I was able to discover a great new product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that I can put it on Friday morning and still be smelling fresh and clean on Saturday.</li>
            <li> great deodorant leaves you clean and fresh smelling for 48 hours</li>
            <li> very excited about this product.</li>
            <li> and I was actually very pleasantly surprised at how good it is!  </li>
            <li> pleasant, not too strong&lt;br /&gt;Application- Easy to use, click dispenses just the right amount of gel.</li>
            <li> It is really a clean scent, so they’ve named it aptly.</li>
            <li> The scent is a nice clean scent, nothing too overpowering.</li>
            <li> While it smell great it doesn&#x27;t hold up to high stress situations like  presenting at work.  </li>
            <li> Finally I started experimenting with women&#x27;s deodorants, and this one is perfect -- the clear gel, unscented works great and doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> So the first day I tried it I loved the way it felt when I put it on .</li>
            <li> So, I grew my armpit hair out for 35 days for the first time in my life to see how good this deodorant could work for me.</li>
            <li> this product is one of the best deodorants I have tried in a long time.</li>
            <li> My kids are brutally honest so that was a true test.  </li>
            <li> This is the first gel deodorant that I&#x27;ve used and I loved it.</li>
            <li> but the comments are my own true opinions of the product.</li>
            <li> I find the formula gentle and effective!</li>
            <li> It goes on clear, the fragrance is great (no deodorant should smell like baby powder, very appreciative that this one absolutely does NOT) and it lasts for 48 hours, maybe even longer</li>
            <li> and I smelled fresh all day!  YAY!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky, like all of the gel deodorants I&#x27;ve ever tried, but unlike the others, the 48 hour claim sure seems to be true!</li>
            <li> For the most part, I am happy with the clear gel.</li>
            <li> This is a really awesome product , it keeps you dry</li>
            <li> On top of that, I&#x27;m a runner, so I need a deodorant with a strong antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry all day and smells great!  </li>
            <li> i got the active scent and am happy with the smell, its not overpowering and its pleasant.  </li>
            <li> The scent is nice and fresh and not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li> clean!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try a gel again, as I haven&#x27;t used a gel in many, many years.</li>
            <li> I liked the deodorant and liked even more that it went on clear!</li>
            <li> The sent is nice and light, it goes on very easy and dries really fast even for a jell!  </li>
            <li> you need to but this it work amazing stay fresh all day</li>
            <li> I was impressed with its ability to combat odor in my 95-104 degree yoga classes, though obviously it can&#x27;t be expected to keep me from sweating in those environments.</li>

            <li> I wish there were more invisible solids available, but until then I will keep this around for when I am wearing sleeveless on a night out.</li>
            <li> The protection was good, the scent was fabulous and I loved the fact there wasn&#x27;t any white residue on my clothes; however,  I do not think I would buy this deodorant because of the guming effect  </li>

            <li> I need a strong, long-lasting deodorant to keep up with my fast-paced, on-the-go lifestyle.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that strong.</li>
            <li> I got this free through BzzAgent, I got the Completely Clean scent!</li>
            <li> I have been very impressed with Secret throughout my lifetime (age 64 now) and this stuff is the best so far.  </li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing , it does exactly as it says.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this item I would have given it a 5 along with an enthusiastic review.  </li>
            <li> Do love love love the fact I don&#x27;t have to worry about any white marks on my clothes, which is a huge selling point for me!!</li>
            <li> However, once it was on, it seemed pretty effective.  </li>
            <li> and I can honestly say it does exactly what it says..</li>
            <li> I honestly think this is the first deodorant I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t leave them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it goes on wet but dries really fast, and the best thing I love is that it feels like a very smooth silky feel under your under arms.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and easy.  </li>
            <li> this is especially great for wearing black or tank tops.</li>
            <li> It went on smooth and covered easily.</li>
            <li> Missed a day and still fine.  </li>
            <li> When I was just sitting around in an air conditioned house, it worked out fine.</li>
            <li> and you typically don&#x27;t have to worry about protection, this would be perfect for you.</li>
            <li> The gel dries incredibly fast--in fact, it was dry before I even had my outfit for the day assembled.</li>
            <li> super love this product</li>
            <li> , it smells pretty good, leaves NO white marks, and most importantly it literally OUTLASTS my day!!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that even though I got my sample for free, I did stop using my normal deodorant in order to give this a fair review and my experience and opinion is 100% genuine.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand and love it so very much!</li>
            <li> It is also effective and seems to live up to most of the product claims.</li>
            <li> Yes, this does go on clear, dries quickly and smells great.  </li>
            <li> I got this for free, and I am ready to purchase some more!  </li>
            <li> This has a unique and beautiful smell that does not change after sweating and does not leave white stripes on my clothes every time I change clothes that Day!</li>
            <li> I love it and it keeps me dry and smelling good most of the day.  </li>
            <li> So, it is easy accessible and affordable too.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but it is a huge difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The gel dries fast after putting it on and it smells really nice too.</li>

            <li> I would recommend this deodorant, I was given this product free to try and review.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and it goes on clear.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always buying $11 deodorant and was glad to see that I don&#x27;t have to spend that much any more.</li>
            <li> Even after all that when I gave my kids a hug, my 8 year old said, &amp;#34;You smell good; did you just get out of the shower?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve had to throw away some of my most beloved shirts/dresses because of a build up of white marks that could not be cleaned.</li>
            <li> loved the way the clear gel went on.</li>
            <li> liked the thickness of the gel, it was just right and not too much like most gels I have used.</li>
            <li> a Bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;The gel has a nice fresh scent, although it&#x27;s overpowering right after applying.</li>
            <li> I normally would never buy a gel deodorant (don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve EVER used gel before this), but I received this free to try, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a great deodorant, but I was extremely allergic to this</li>
            <li> Not once have I seen a white mark on any of my clothing this week and this leaves me extremely pleased with the product as well!!</li>
            <li> I found exactly what I was looking for!!.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m somewhat desensitized to the scent of the actual deodorant or if it just doesn&#x27;t smell that strongly, but I didn&#x27;t ever catch a pleasant aroma, either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I no longer perspire daintily and stress sweat is not a pretty odor.  </li>
            <li> Since I started using Secret® Clinical Strength, I have been able to stay calm, cool, collected and sweat smell free.</li>
            <li> The clear gel dries very fast, smells great, and lasts.  </li>
            <li> Still a bit strong, but more pleasant than other gel deodorants.</li>
            <li> it smells clean and goes on light...</li>
            <li> The smell was light, but clean smelling.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and dries quick.  </li>
            <li> This gel formula dries quickly, stays all day, and smells quite strong, but I like the perfume-y smell.</li>
            <li> My new favorite!</li>
            <li> This stuff has now become my new favorite deodorant!</li>
            <li> smells great, dries fast, last a long time even on super stressful days, and has the best bottling and lid design I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;now</li>
            <li> It kept me fresh &amp; clean all day!</li>
            <li> I just love it its my new favorite product.</li>
            <li> It feels cool and refreshing and caused no burning sensation on my skin when I applied it right after</li>
            <li> No white marks, quick drying, and great smell.</li>
            <li> Great deodorant, lasts a long time, doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, but leaves a fresh and smooth feel</li>
            <li> and I can actually smell the amazing scent all day without having to sniff my pits!</li>
            <li> It really last and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I loved the fresh scent and the gel is very easily absorbed without leaving that yucky feeling of having too much under your arms.</li>
            <li> The comments most said was it was a bit sticky at first but went away within seconds</li>
            <li> I have to admit I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think about this when I first got it.</li>
            <li> Great consistency and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I wanted to see how good of a job this wet gel would work on both smooth skin, and not so smooth skin!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I was pretty satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I tried it after giving birth as many woman know your body experiences lots of changes in that first week after giving birth.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I would love this deodorant</li>
            <li> and I was so excited.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s great to be able to slide my shirt on and not have to worry about the mess it will leave on my clothes.</li>
            <li> So when I was offered this campaign, I was excited to try this.</li>
            <li> even after a sweaty workout my armpits were fresh!</li>
            <li> so I was excited to give gel deodorant a try.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was that I seemed to have a defective stick that didn&#x27;t want to expel any of the gel out the top even after relentlessly turning the crank.</li>
            <li> Definitely excited to keep using this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fact that the amount is lowered and it works better than the products with higher amounts is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> With that said, since I used the first one I have bought two more since.  </li>
            <li> All I used was one twist or one click of the gel and applied under each arm, the product is light and cool on the skin.</li>
            <li> I was not too excited at the opportunity because I cannot find a deodorant that I like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the product and it smells great and the freshness lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The smell is very light &amp; nice and this is the first deodorant i&#x27;ve used that actually controls my under arm sweat, and I haven&#x27;t noticed sweat stains on my shirts &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those products you want to keep using because the scent is so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> and I still smell clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant i have found so far to actually work for my daughter.</li>
            <li> The completely clean scent isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> The clean &#x27;</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I like the clean scent of this product, too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is pleasantly clean smelling but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that it keeps my armpits looking clean and they look like there&#x27;s no deodorant on them.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed by this deodorant and glad I try it as a promotion from Secret.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enought to try this product for free</li>
            <li> Outlast Completely Clean arrived at my door</li>
            <li> When I first open the cap, the scent was already gushing out and it smelled so beautiful.</li>
            <li> It smells great and keeps me dry.</li>
            <li> (super important or</li>
            <li> It goes one clean and is not sticky or gooey.</li>
            <li> “Completely Clean” does what it is projected to do in the allotted time of 48 hours and</li>
            <li> Clean yet not overpowering fragrance and does not compete with my perfume...</li>
            <li> I could still smell that clean scent at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Fresh scent , not too strong</li>
            <li> the application actually went quite... pleasant.</li>
            <li> I love this new deodorant and the smell, keeps sweat from coming and getting all over your clothes, and good for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> More importantly it keeps me dry and odor free morning till night!!  </li>
            <li> Another positive is I am usually very sensitive when it comes to underarm products and so far I have had no issues, so that is GREAT!</li>
            <li> I live in the hot, humid South, and need good protection.</li>
            <li> Here in Texas the weather has been super hot and my deodorant lasted through out the day. :)</li>
            <li> it works great, goes on clear and dries clear and anything that gets on my shirt cleans off easily.</li>
            <li> Right!  </li>
            <li> Love this deodorant, drys quickly doesn&#x27;t leave white marks and keeps me smelling awesome all day long.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy, dries quick, and I smell fresh all day.</li>
            <li> so, i was super excited about trying out this</li>
            <li> I worked hard in the garden one day and it worked perfect.  </li>
            <li> It lasts all day and does a remarkable job at keeping you dry and smelling fresh!</li>
            <li> Wow what a product it works and isn&#x27;t hard on the pocket its a win, win .</li>
            <li> It goes on clear, dries fast and clear, smells great and lasts!</li>
            <li> works as expected and great price.</li>
            <li> It works great, but if it&#x27;s too hot outside it does not work.</li>
            <li> so i was pretty happy when i finally ran out.</li>
            <li> I really like that it does not stain your shirt and doesn&#x27;t have the funky smell that many gel deodorants have.</li>
            <li> No white marks on the clothes, smells good.  </li>
            <li> and I was smelling as sweet as I had before the race began.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it, but I really do.</li>
            <li> It smells more neutral, and I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s a scent that doesn&#x27;t really battle with any of my perfumes or body fragrances like lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s true</li>
            <li> They stayed true to what I&#x27;ve come to expect from them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks Buzz Agent :)</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife, she uses this type and Walmart/Publix for some reason are both out of Unscented Clear Gel kind.</li>
            <li> I really liked the formula compared to the old dove deodorant i was using.</li>
            <li> Yesterday I put the deodorant on in the morning before leaving for work, no white marks, so that was a good start.</li>
            <li> I must say that I love this product it really works for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure</li>
            <li> but now i will have to buy the full size.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to whether or not it lasts a full 48 hours since I apply deodorant every morning</li>
            <li> I did notice a light fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> Therefore I don&#x27;t know if this holds true to what it claims.</li>
            <li> (when I can get the chance to experience the full effect of this product).</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant, but it did make it seem like I was sweating more.  </li>
            <li> It gets me through a full work day, my kids soccer practice my run AND a yoga class.  </li>
            <li> I had gotten some of this at the store in the winter and liked the clear gel.  </li>
            <li> this one still smells lovely when I am getting ready for bed.</li>
            <li> I had gone to the fair, and being in low 80s</li>
            <li> However, I am expressing my true opinions in this review.*&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I blast each pit with the cool air setting from my hairdryer.</li>
            <li> that I  bought the full sized bottle.  </li>
            <li> I truely wanted it to work</li>
            <li> I even put it to the true test on a stretch of five days off work.  </li>
            <li> If you wear a regular strength deodorant you should be good</li>
            <li> NOT BAD</li>
            <li> It was a really nice soft sweet lavender scent.</li>
            <li> application was very easy, the smell is pleasant, and for someone who tends toward excessive sweating</li>
            <li> love that it goes on clear and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Secret did.. best thing about this one is that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong deodorant smell which I also like.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to try it straight for 48hrs just because I love being clean, but most I have tried don&#x27;t last more than 8 hrs.</li>
            <li> I have pretty strong &amp;#34;B.O.&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li> Upon first application I thought the scent was going to be too strong for me</li>
            <li> At first, I thought I would enjoy this deodorant, and was excited to receive it as a product tester.</li>
            <li> I was given a free sample of this product from Buzz and it is an awesome product it dries fast goes on clear and definitely outlast any deodorant I have tried.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To sum up the use of the product, I can conclude that it indeed leaves you fresh and clean and protects the full 48 hours.</li>
            <li> Though I probably wouldn&#x27;t use this everyday, its definitely good with tank tops!</li>
            <li> The smell is great but not overbearing like other deodorants can be.</li>
            <li> The odor control was pretty good, not the full 48 hours as it suggests, but much better than other deodorant I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> It smells fresh and clean, and leaves you smelling fresh and clean too.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and clean and kinda reminds me of water with hints of flowers.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice clean smell to it, similar to the smell of clean clothes coming out of the dryer.  </li>
            <li> This is seriously the best product ever.</li>
            <li> beyond it provides protection and leaves you feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly</li>
            <li> BUT I WOULD LIKE EVEN MORE A DEODORANT FREE OF ALUMINUM AND WITH NATURAL INGREDIENTS.</li>
            <li> No residue or stains on the skin or clothes and dries quickly when applied.</li>
            <li> I love this particular antiperspirant/deodorant</li>
            <li> My most favorite thing about this product is no white streaks!</li>
            <li> It is a bit gooey and then it dries relatively quickly.</li>
            <li> It goes on, and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> I must admit some mornings get super hectic with 3 kids running around</li>
            <li> The gel dries super quick and I never have to reapply.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I will use; I think it&#x27;s better than better than Clinical Strength.</li>
            <li> Thank you secret for letting me try this wonderful product for free.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It also dries quickly on the skin and does not leave any marks on my clothing.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I felt this product provided great protection at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to be super sweaty, but I do work up a sweat when out running.  </li>
            <li> I prefer unscented because scents can irritate my nose, but this one quickly dissipates and does not bother me.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly and there is no wetness.</li>
            <li> I did feel like it wore away quickly, but that could just be me being paranoid.</li>
            <li> if i sweat a lot though it wears off kinda quickly.</li>
            <li> Like many of you, I&#x27;ve used many different types of deodorant in my day.  </li>
            <li> Because it dries so quickly, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about clothing stains or streaks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just loved the fact it didn&#x27;t leave white mess also how great it smelled.</li>
            <li> giving you a great underarm smell, i remain pretty dry and odorless without leaving marks on your underarm and clothes.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t overpowering and is clean smelling, but once I get to sweating, my sweat smell comes right on through.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> BzzAgent sent me a free trial and it was the first time I&#x27;d tried it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still very hot here in Florida</li>
            <li> , lavender is my favorite and one that is not offered by my normal deodorant brand.</li>
            <li> The deodorant also does not last for very many &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I tried this deoderant I received for free and really like it!  </li>
            <li> I normally have three deodorants on hand as I cannot find one that I love.</li>
            <li> I like how this product goes on, it certainly smells great, but it was a thin mask for me and didn&#x27;t really stand up that great to Zumba class.</li>
            <li> Love the new secret it smells awesome and make me feel fresh from the time I get up till the time I go to sleep!</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast® Clear Gel worked great, went on clear, and smelled great for 48 hours!</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t experience white marks, and the scent is light, and fresh!</li>
            <li> And the unscented is great for people that are sensitive to most other deodorant scents.</li>
            <li> I love the secret brand and will continue to buy the products, they smell great and do provide protection just not 48 hours worth!</li>
            <li> I love this new deodorant with one exception.  </li>
            <li> My response was as you all know I love to try new thing</li>
            <li> A new favorite for me.</li>
            <li> This is defiantly my new favorite deodorant</li>
            <li> but I was extremely pleased with this new antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> Perfect in Florida humidity: it can be hard to find a deodorant that works well in the florida heat!</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of black, and this is great.  </li>
            <li> first of all, the field trip starts with a 30 minute drive, with said children, then a good 25 minute wait before the zoo actually allows us inside..</li>
            <li> but that goes away quickly and leaves you feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Strong smells really bother me.</li>
            <li> The gel goes on easily, dries fast, and doesn&#x27;t leave any marks.</li>
            <li> I love the clear gel better than any other kind.</li>
            <li> BUT know that you are purchasing a quality product that does exactly what it says it does, which is like a breath of fresh air these days!</li>
            <li> I was pretty stoked about that!  </li>
            <li> On the first work-day I used this product, it passed the stink test!</li>
            <li> I thought that this deoderant did exactly what it claimed - reduced underarm wetness!</li>
            <li> and i love the fact that it is clear, which is a great thing when i am wearing dark colors it wont show up on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was HOT!</li>
            <li> I was happy with the smell but, like other gels, it didnt feel good when applied and didnt seem to do the job of other deodorants.</li>
            <li> This was the first trip that I wasn&#x27;t concerned about my odor!</li>
            <li> I love this clear gel deodorant!</li>
            <li> My Secret ;) for my wedding came to me in the nick of time in an awesome FREE BzzKit.</li>
            <li> Love the clear gel!</li>
            <li> During the dry fall and now winter this is possibly the best deodorant I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Easy on skin and leaves you fresh and ready to go for day</li>
            <li> It has a great smell, dries fast, doesn&#x27;t leave marks, and keeps you dry.</li>
            <li> This antiperspirant is effective in keeping me dry and odor free.  </li>
            <li> I also like that it drys quickly, so you can put your shirt on right after.</li>
            <li> Sitting in an air conditioned office all day didn&#x27;t offer much to see how the product worked but throughout the day it seemed to be fine.</li>
            <li> After my shower I reapplied and even after one of the hottest days in July, my underarms stayed dry and smelling fresh (well, more like perfume, but better than the alternative.)  </li>
            <li> I got to try it out for free thanks to Bzz Agent</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really enjoy this product much.</li>
            <li> The gel goes on smoothly and evenly and dries fast.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent, the protection is great and so far I don&#x27;t see white streaks (which I don&#x27;t think I would anyway with a clear gel).  </li>
            <li> This clear gel smells fresh and great when you pull off the safety tap next</li>
            <li> It has amazing 48-hour odor protection and leaves no white marks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like this product, I was surprised to find that not only did it smell great</li>
            <li> but it kept me feeling fresh all day.</li>
            <li> but since I #Gotitfree from BzzAgent to review I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth the try</li>
            <li> I loved the deodorant so much I ended tossing my current one and replaced it with this one.  </li>
            <li> I got this free from BzzAgent and will definitely be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Again, Secret has a great deodorant that protects from odor and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> and i feel fresh all day.  </li>
            <li> But for the price it was totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I really love the fact that it is a gel deodorant that doesn&#x27;t leave marks and dries clear.</li>
            <li> but, this wins.</li>
            <li> No sweat stains, smell fresh, and can change my shirt without leaving streak marks.</li>
            <li> Keeps me fresh all day.</li>
            <li> and it keeps me feeling fresh all day.</li>
            <li> and I still smelled as fresh as I did when I put it on which for me</li>
            <li> FEELS PLEASANTLY NICE ON THE SKIN,LONG LASTING</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it goes on clear an leaves</li>
            <li> I love that it is clear</li>
            <li> However, this was a nice change from my regular deoderant.</li>
            <li> Have never been a big fan of the gel, but after I tried it I liked it.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free promotional item and at first I really liked it, but after one really long day I found it did not work.</li>
            <li> I also love the clear gel.  </li>
            <li> It stayed in place and I am a frequent sweater and found that it was able to keep up with me.</li>
            <li> Keeps your armpits smelling fresh all day and night.</li>
            <li> If you dont have sensitive skin you may be ok</li>
            <li> I love that it goes on clear.  </li>
            <li> I love the Clear gel.</li>
            <li> and so far my friends are enjoying it, as well.</li>
            <li> I love the clear see through stick.  </li>
            <li> Goes on clear, doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on clothes, and keeps you smelling great thru the day.</li>
            <li> I have tried Secret OutLast Deodorant and absolutely loved it!!</li>
            <li> Thank you Secret and BzzAgent for another awesome product for me to review!</li>
            <li> I was able to try this clear get deodorant.</li>
            <li> In this day and age, everyone is trying to be more health conscious</li>
            <li> When these chemicals are absorbed into our bodies, it may cause a change in our DNA, which in turn makes cells into cancerous cells.</li>
            <li> Keeps me smelling fresh all day.  </li>
            <li> Got this to review from secret and I must say that it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> I was looking to make the switch to a deodorant that wouldn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothing and was as effective as the one I was using.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant/antiperspirant so far in my life.  </li>
            <li> I experimented with \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants and NONE of them worked (I bought every kind I could find over several years).  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> and afterwards I was still smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only kind I use now.</li>
            <li> It only took this Dad 22 years to find something she liked</li>
            <li> Fresh scent.</li>
            <li> The Secret outlast gel works great!</li>
            <li> I love the clear gel.</li>
            <li> so it was nice not seeing white streaks on my clothes.</li>
            <li> Even after a day at the office and then a gym workout the formula has kept me smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> This is an easy to use and high performing deoderant.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised - for the most part, you can get dressed without residue marks pretty quickly after application.</li>
            <li> I had a very positive experience while using this product this week</li>
            <li> THIS became my favorite after so many years compared to any other and I have used the clinical ones but, this wins.</li>
            <li> I loved the way it made me smell, which is kind of weird, I know, but I just smelled so fresh... and it lasted overnight!</li>
            <li> For a gel it also dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Does not leave unwanted marks on clothing and dries super fast!</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t dry so quickly I wouldn&#x27;t have liked it.</li>
            <li> Upon completing this trial, I also checked the underarms of my clothing to make sure that there were no deodorant marks left from the “Completely Clean”, there were no marks.</li>
            <li> As good as this did, I decided to see if it worked under extreme pressure.</li>
            <li> It melts right away and is washed away by sweat.</li>
            <li> Everything you could want from a deodorant, right??  </li>
            <li> The gel dries right when it becomes in contact with the skin.</li>
            <li> so I can get dressed right away.</li>
            <li> But my right arm pit is showing wetness which is a bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always had issues finding the right deodorant.</li>
            <li> Right away I could feel the difference and smell the difference.  </li>
            <li> I have tried clear gels in the past and they never seemed to work, but this one is awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely impressed with Secret and this gel, and I will absolutely be purchasing this!</li>
            <li> This is easy to use to much, but I love that I don&#x27;t get white streaks on my clothing!</li>
            <li> Good for active people.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this deodorant free from Secret, and I&#x27;ve got to say I love this deodorant!</li>
            <li> Keeps you dry all day and more, and keep you feeling (and smelling!)</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the product runs out more quickly than the traditional version.</li>
            <li> I must say I was pleasantly surprised how it went on smooth with no streaking and dryed quickly.</li>
            <li> When I opened the deodorant, I was surprised to find, that it actually smelled pleasant.</li>
            <li> Best of all, not nasty residue was left behind.</li>
            <li> It has a great scent and it made me feel fresh without the white residue left after putting it on.</li>
            <li> I love the entire Secret brand, but Outlast is the best.</li>
            <li> Would it work for 48 hours.. maybe, but as a nurse I reapply everyday (my patients appreciate it :P)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with the Secret Outlast Clear Gel (I was sent this product for free from BzzAgent to try out).</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free from Secret in exchange for my honest review</li>
            <li> I was able to try Secret Outlast through #bzzagent for free for my HONEST opinion.</li>
            <li> Today was a great test; a full day of chasing a 3-year-old around and then a late night hot yoga class</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and dries up super quick and doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue on my close like the bar deodorant</li>
            <li> This is a good product that has not let me down yet.</li>
            <li> No white marks and strong protection!</li>
            <li> Now that I am switching over to sleeveless dress and tops, it is nice to find a deodorant that not only dries clear, but keeps me smelling good all day long.</li>
            <li> Wore it to the zoo the other day and stayed dry climbing all the hills which felt awesome -</li>
            <li> I am glad that I can easily add this deodorant to one of my other orders.</li>
            <li> With an amazing smell that leaves you felling fresh and clean when in truth you are a hot mess.  </li>
            <li> I love that it dries fast and stays strong all day long!</li>
            <li> Works great, no chalky white lines on clothing, &amp; really by next am</li>
            <li> Overall, great product and will likely by again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to strong smells</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not sticky, it dries super fast</li>
            <li> My husband actually smells good when his Old Spice antiperspirant kicks in</li>
            <li> I went into this campaign (I was given a free sample courtesy of Secret) thinking that I wouldn&#x27;t find anything great</li>
            <li> The wetness was not a big issue, I honestly don&#x27;t have that much of a problem there</li>
            <li> , I was impressed with the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel deoderant.</li>
            <li> Keep me fresh and clean even in very busy days.</li>
            <li> Not sure that it can actually last 48 hours but does a great job and for the price.....even better.</li>
            <li> Overall I think it is a great deal, especially when you want to make sure you don&#x27;t have any white marks on your clothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Secret outlast goes on easy, dries fast and smells great.  </li>
            <li> It fell flat as far as performance wise.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast is easily the best deodorant on the market, 2 days protection, no white marks</li>
            <li> I live in the oh so lovely New York City...</li>
            <li> I love the scent (active fresh), which is crisp and clean.</li>
            <li> What I love more is that it&#x27;s clear and dry fast!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get a new deodorant</li>
            <li> always excited to try a new deoderant.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and  the quick dry after putting this product on.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong at first, but it smells good and it really does last a long time(close to 48 hours).</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, dries quickly and leaves no white marks.  </li>
            <li> , I would and have bought this again, the best thing is a little go&#x27;s a long way</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know how it holds up to a hot, sweaty day yet.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and it does last all day.</li>
            <li> First, it works.</li>
            <li> but the top  popped off and afterwards deodorant would  only come out one side of the stick.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Seems to work exactly how I&#x27;d like my deodorant to work.</li>
            <li> i love the scent and lasting wetness control.  </li>
            <li> i have already purchased more for myself and teen daughter.  </li>
            <li> Better than lesser name, discount brands.</li>
            <li> I really like it though!</li>
            <li> , it was my first using a gel deodorant.</li>
            <li> Too hot</li>
            <li> There are a lot of scents that I can&#x27;t handle because they cause migraines, but this product is definitely on the OK list.</li>
            <li> Absolutely!</li>
            <li> Just when I thought it couldn&#x27;t get any better it actually did.</li>
            <li> Other than this, the updated formulas is a thousand times better than the original formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s HOT in South Carolina.</li>
            <li> I am still deciding on the sent, while it was a bit over powering at first thinking</li>
            <li> You do not need a second application in most cases, but I applied again on occasions I took a night-time shower after taking a day time shower.</li>
            <li> I tested this product on a hot summer day while running errands which included a lot of unloading and loading items from my car and walking to my apartment.</li>
            <li> At last, in frustration, I gave the top of the&lt;br /&gt;dispenser</li>
            <li> With most of them they left a mark in my clothing</li>
            <li> Yet, I was still faced with sweating or over powering odor from my daily routine on more stressful days.</li>
            <li> I would definitely use Outlast if I were wearing a tank top or a sleeveless dress.</li>
            <li> pretty fresh.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No wierd white spots when i wear armless top</li>
            <li> and I have to say it&#x27;s definitely among the better deodorants on the market.</li>
            <li> but, i would love to have something work for the entire day that i am using it, between showers, and this did!</li>
            <li> Also, using it straight out of the shower stings the pits!</li>
            <li> I also have to wear suits in this hot weather for 9 hours each day and this is the deodorant I rely on.</li>
            <li> and I really like it !</li>
            <li> It holds up and dies exactly what it said it would</li>
            <li> But now I&#x27;m excited I received this sample of outlast clear gel!</li>
            <li> but it worked well up until I showered the next day for sure.</li>
            <li> and I really really like it!</li>
            <li> everybody has different experience and this was mine :)</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t sweat even in this hot summer weather.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never found a woman&#x27;s scent that I wanted to smell when the going gets hot.  </li>
            <li> I love it lasts or says it last for 48 hours.  </li>
            <li> and I feel confident enough in my protection that I don&#x27;t mind being stopped to talk with neighbors along my route.</li>
            <li> but this one comes with more oz and will last longer than the clinical.</li>
            <li> I do, this deodorant stuck by me the whole way!</li>
            <li> I did not have the usual issue of having to warm up the stick to get it to come out smoothly</li>
            <li> Ever since we moved from Chicago to North Carolina, I&#x27;ve not only been sweating more, but also been showing it to the world.</li>
            <li> I have severe hot flashes with means a lot of sweat and odors.</li>
            <li> It controlled my wetness and odor better than my regular brand.  </li>
            <li> I want it prevented in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> At  first it did not hold.  </li>
            <li> I use to use the Lady Speed Stick Fusion 24/7 deodorant before my first kid</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> And I love that I can put it on without worrying about ruining an outfit with unsightly white streaks or residue on my sleeveless tops.</li>
            <li> as a frequent traveler, I prefer to  travel lightly and minimize my liquids and gels for going through TSA, so I&#x27;m going to have to leave this one at home when I&#x27;m traveling my air.</li>
            <li> even threw my hot flashes and night sweats .</li>
            <li> no white spots on my tank top</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because after having my son 4 years ago, I haven&#x27;t been able to find a deodorant that works until I finally tried this out.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m more of a solid fan.</li>
            <li> Love love love secret outlast!</li>
            <li> I love that I am able to see how much is left and not left guessing as to when I will run out.</li>
            <li> Every gel that I have tried before always felt sticky when I first put it on.  </li>
            <li> Plus it does not leave a buildup on my clothes when I first put it on.  </li>
            <li> I got this Deodorant Clear Gel for free as a promotion from &amp;#34;Secret&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It dries fast, lasts all day, and doesn&#x27;t break me out!</li>
            <li> It also did not leave any white marks &amp; it smelled fantastic!</li>
            <li> First of all, it does not leave any marks.</li>
            <li> Plus, I never have to throw out my favorite clothes for white mark</li>
            <li> It really smelled like you are fresh out of the shower...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident that it would last longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than aerosol, solid and roll on type deodorants.</li>
            <li> If you are in the hot sun for hours, nope.</li>
            <li> The first couple of days I tried it</li>
            <li> I wear a scent, I wish it to be my own perfume, not some arbitrary scent from my underarm deodorant.</li>
            <li> Works for the first 4 - 6 hours, but can&#x27;t quite make it to the 10-hour mark on a stressful day.</li>
            <li> The first day I tried it</li>
            <li> But sure enough it was.  </li>
            <li> I like that this product does exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, clear and lasts.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s more a personal quirk than criticism.  </li>
            <li> the first use</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure that all of the 5-star reviews are accurate for the previous formula.  </li>
            <li> however it does dry instantly and works great and lasts all day....</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get a free sample of this product, but I may continue using it even after the sample runs out.</li>
            <li> I got the chance to try Secret Outlast for free, and I was excited!!!</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth with no mess.</li>
            <li> I was asked to sample Secret Outlast in Completely Clean scented deodorant for free by the company and then write a review of my honest</li>
            <li> I tried this the other day and the first thing I noticed was how nice it smelled.</li>
            <li> it faded shortly after applying leaving me to so far positive that I have just a nice light fresh sent, just enough to make me feel fresh.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and as you know it get super hot.</li>
            <li> Also, you get no ugly white marks on your clean shirt.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear, leaves no sticky residue on clothes and you feel fresh all day!</li>
            <li> The fact that this is unscented too is nice because the little one is sensitive to strong scents.</li>
            <li> I was impressed when the Secret Outlast dried very quickly on my skin!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on clear and clean just like it says it will.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a solid deodorant kind of girl but thought I&#x27;d give the clear gel a try.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with Secret Outlast Clear Gel.</li>
            <li> secret clear outlast is awesome.</li>
            <li> It has a light fresh smell, but once you put it on there is not that &amp;#34;deodorant smell.&amp;#34; The only thing I do not like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t dispense evenly; sometimes you need one click, and sometimes you need 3.</li>
            <li> The Secret Outlast Clear Gel held up great!!</li>
            <li> I can see how much I have left and when I need to make a run to the store for more.  </li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel is the best thing to hit the market in ages.</li>
            <li> The product has a series of holes on the top and a twist mechanism at the bottom to dispense the gel and a see-thru sleek dispenser that allows the user to know how much they have left.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast unscented clear gel deodorant is great!</li>
            <li> I did the sniff check because i was pretty certain</li>
            <li> I live in a very hot and humid city</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and cool and keeps me dry</li>
            <li> it was more wet (for lack of a better term), but it dried very quickly</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a deodorant for a long time that I felt confident wearing</li>
            <li> I am a sweater though, the only thing that will stop my wet spots if wearing a close fitting shirt is a clinical strength deodorant, and even that is not 100% sure thing.</li>
            <li> After a long day I was glad to see it worked</li>
            <li> On particularly hot days, I noticed it does not control sweat as much as the clinical strength days.</li>
            <li> I was happy to get the chance to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel free from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love that I could smell it all day long, and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about any odor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i love this product because it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> For anyone that has body odor or wetness issues I would recommend this product as long as you&#x27;re okay with the ingredients.</li>
            <li> At first I think I was using way too much product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;ll never go back to the soft solid.  </li>
            <li> I felt confident all day long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t worry much about marks using this deodorant, and it&#x27;s pretty scentless.</li>
            <li> It does smell good, and lasts far longer than any other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I also love the active fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the Clean fresh scent, not the unscented or floral one.</li>
            <li> Even though I am not too active most of the time, I would find myself feeling not so fresh by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I live in the most southern part of Alabama and it&#x27;s always humid and hot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already loyal to the Secret brand but was happy to review a gel, since I normally use the stick.</li>
            <li> I applied it at night and didn&#x27;t reapply in the morning when I proceeded with my normal routine: 30 minute walk outside, 30 minute strength workout, and at the end of both sweat sessions I was completely dry and smelling great.</li>
            <li> But shockingly, Secret Outlast Clear Gel felt great going on and actually provided amazing protection.</li>
            <li> Youwill be able to raise your hands high, hug, and be in close proximity of others without worrying if they could smell a musty order coming from your body, without anyone questioning your daily hygiene routine.</li>
            <li> over-powering scents.&lt;br /&gt;II received a free full size Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel as part of a promotion, and discovered that they&#x27;ve stuck with that winning formula.  </li>
            <li> The new formula dries faster, and keeps my underarm area fresh for hours.</li>
            <li> All I can say is if you are looking to try new deodorant, I would recommend giving this a try, it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> It drys quickly and clearly.  </li>
            <li> I was blessed enough to receive it as a free sample the first time</li>
            <li> I have not tried a gel in many years as I don&#x27;t like the feeling of needing to walk around with my arms up to let it dry</li>
            <li> Pluses are that it is a clear gel that works well, leaves no residue and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> The Active Fresh scent is light and as the name suggests fresh.</li>
            <li> The gel dries quickly and clear without sticky residue.  </li>
            <li> The odor and wetness protection easily lasts over 24 hours, even when outside on the beach.</li>
            <li> It dries very quickly, and I didn&#x27;t have any white marks on my clothing.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear and dries quickly which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I like to wait a minutes or two to be sure it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> So far it has preformed super in all categories</li>
            <li> However, I was super pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li> am very pleased with the results of Secret Outlast Completely Clean and plan to use it as my absolute go to deodorant!  </li>
            <li> Goes on clear and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> With 3 kids, I&#x27;m always on the go and never know where I&#x27;m going to end up, so it&#x27;s nice to know that pit stains and underarm odor are one less worry.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised by how quickly it dries.</li>
            <li> and  this deodorant keeps me dry and odor free all day!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a gel, but I like the dry stick much better.</li>
            <li> Love that it keeps me dry all day, even in stressful situations.</li>
            <li> It dries quick and has no harsh scents.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell which I definitely like.</li>
            <li> It still did not work and left a strong smell of &amp;#34;my armpits need help&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> At first I really liked the deodorant but after a few days, the deodorant started guming up in my arm pits.  </li>
            <li> I worry about applying such a strong chemical to my skin but it does work so I will stick with it for now.</li>
            <li> I am an active person and sweat regularly - this is a very effective antiperspirant that I will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> I have sensation problems where certain things give me the shivers.  </li>
            <li> The Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Get deoderant really fit that requirement nicely.  </li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t plan to forget deoderant regularly, it was nice to know that this would hold up for a really long time and keep me smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> If any of you know anything about New York city, it&#x27;s that the summers are generally pretty hot and humi.</li>
            <li> It was also great especially in this case because I didn&#x27;t have to worry about getting the typical deodorant stains on my dress.</li>
            <li> till still using this product passing the torch down to my teen girl happy to say she really enjoys this along will all of secrets products.</li>
            <li> This goes on clear and dries super fast.</li>
            <li> If you want to stay dry and smelling good without that chalky white stuff getting on your clothes.</li>
            <li> but I just kept brushing it all around my armpit until I can feel that I&#x27;ve coated the entire area and surprisingly, it was almost completely dry.</li>
            <li> After flailing around like a maniac with my arms up for a good 5 minutes, it was finally dry enough for me to put on</li>
            <li> The other great thing about Secret deodorant is that it is affordable and very easy to find coupons for.</li>
            <li> Secret&#x27;s new Outlast Clear Gel smelled great before I even opened it!</li>
            <li> Got a chance to try this product for free via the ClearlyBetterChallenge through Secret &amp; I must say that I love it!</li>
            <li> Especially in situations where I feel I need extra coverage meaning use more deodorant!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is rare that I can find a deodorant that I really like and frequently use a deodorant once or twice and throw it away!</li>
            <li> My older son gave it a try as well (and this boy sweats a lot), and he was amazed that it worked so well on him!</li>
            <li> I do love this product but am taking away 1 star due to the minor sting. :)</li>
            <li> I tend to be in a hurry most mornings, so I was surprised that dried quickly (literally within seconds)!</li>
            <li> overall i really liked this deodorant and the cost is right around the typical deodorant cost so it is worth giving a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is this completely clean scent smells almost exactly the same as the one I normally wear.</li>
            <li> I guess there is also the craziness that I never feel like I know how many clicks I need to get the right amount for each arm without clicking too much out of the tube and feeling like a slimy mess for 5 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have found that the scent of Secret Outlast Completely Clean is a super clean, crisp and refreshing scent and seems to last throughout the day..</li>
            <li> I found Secret Outlast® Clear Gel which is a unique deodorant in many stores and online easily.</li>
            <li> fact that it wont leave chalky marks on clothes is such a huge deal....especially on date</li>
            <li> Love that it is unscented, it does feel really wet going on, but dries really fast.</li>
            <li> I typically prefer a floral or summery scent than the clean scent available for this product.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product FREE thanks to Secret &amp; BzzAgent!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the one I can currently using, the scent of this deodorant is more feminine.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear and smells really fresh the whole time I had it on.</li>
            <li> The clean fresh scent lifts your spirits while you stay dry.  </li>
            <li> The wetness protection and lack of white marks is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I really like this product for a number of reasons.  </li>
            <li> /bo this stuff really did work.</li>
            <li> come on Summer - I&#x27;m ready for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really wanted to like this deodorant, but it just doesn&#x27;t do what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> product by Secret has done a great job for me.  </li>
            <li> If I take a shower or workout, it seems helpful to reapply it, but it seems to keep my skin from sweating a whole lot.</li>
            <li> i love that it goes on clear and really doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on your clothing like the white stick deodorants.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really do a whole lot for odor control or wetness.  </li>
            <li> It really wakes me up in the morning.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t need much - just one click per underarm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gel, but it is not sticky and dries fast.</li>
            <li> I did not care much for this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> but this stuff drys really fast.</li>
            <li> and I have to say this protection lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> I was odor free definitely for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had much experience with gel based deodorants</li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t been feeling sweating as much as I used to.</li>
            <li> it really lasts all day</li>
            <li> Dries fast with no residue.</li>
            <li> Had difficulty locating a fragrance free gel deodorant at local stores.</li>
            <li> So I belong to a website that sends free products to try and this is one of them I recently received and liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have had sensitivities to deodorant my whole life.  </li>
            <li> Because this one really does what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> got a free sample, and tried it only because I had it.  </li>
            <li> I started using my free sample, and it goes on just like a solid --</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve switched and really the results</li>
            <li> The deodorant worked out really well.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need much, it lasts me about two days even if I sweat which it takes a lot for me to sweat</li>
            <li> I absolutely looooove this deodorant.</li>
            <li> No annoying white marks rubbing off on clothes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like this product.  </li>
            <li> The gel dries fast, doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky feel that I remember</li>
            <li> With smooth skin, the gel dries quicker and definitely holds close to the 48 hours.</li>
            <li> after that there is the 30 minute drive home, as well as unpacking the vehicle of all of the items necessary for a comfortable field trip.</li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> So much so, that I leave one in my office desk for morning freshness.</li>
            <li> I got to try this thanks to BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Works very well to help with odor protection.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how well it works beyond about 12 hours but up until 12 hours, it still worked very well.</li>
            <li> It really works (even if you skip a day).</li>
            <li> This gel is so much easier to use.</li>
            <li> As an antiperspirant and deodorant, it works very well.</li>
            <li> Men really can use it also.</li>
            <li> and I really dis-like deodorants where I smell myself all day.  </li>
            <li> but I also didn&#x27;t reapply as much</li>
            <li> so I could really tell if it worked or not.</li>
            <li> I only smelled the light smell of the deodorant.</li>
            <li> This deodorant lasted the whole day while I was running and playing basketball</li>
            <li> This was surprisingly better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to everyone !</li>
            <li> this really worked.</li>
            <li> but it dries very fastand</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> My family and I are very outdoors.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> but this really doesn&#x27;t leave any, which is perfection.</li>
            <li> did find that on really humid days (which we have in California)</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> is very sticky</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any allergic reaction to it and the gel dries really fast.</li>
            <li> BUT, the real test was my husband.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a hardworking guy than can really sweat.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care much for that in a deodorant.  </li>
            <li> neither should you if you want a deodorant that really works.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find the Secret Unscented.  </li>
            <li> It also works very well for what it&#x27;s intended....</li>
            <li> so I really wanted to like it.  </li>
            <li> This is another great product from Secret.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this to review and was not expecting much.  </li>
            <li> It also works very well for what it&#x27;s intended....</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really outlast, but it is unscented.</li>
            <li> It is fast drying</li>
            <li> Then the absolute</li>
            <li> and I did enjoy the fact that it didnt leave white marks, but it did not provide 48 hours of protection though.</li>
            <li> And it really protected me from stinking while sweating.    </li>
            <li> I can highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This works very well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much for it to do its job.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I am a very sweaty person</li>
            <li> thanks to Bzzagent</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I even touched it before I put my shirt on to make sure it wasn&#x27;t wet</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I worked reasonably well.</li>
            <li> &gt; All in all, if you are in a position where you really don&#x27;t sweat, this may be the deodorant for you.</li>
            <li> Really it&#x27;s all you could ask for in a deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I sell Scentsy at events and was out in the heat and sun for a whole weekend.  </li>
            <li> Works really well without drying skin.</li>
            <li> If i dispense too much then i just reverse the direction and the product returns to the contains  </li>
            <li> (if you didn&#x27;t disperse too much )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, i like it.</li>
            <li> Should have read description more carefully.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m putting too much on</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff REALLY works for 48 hours.  </li>
            <li> this deo really controlled my BO.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.  </li>
            <li> but over all I really like it</li>
            <li> It really does give 48 hour protection.</li>
            <li> I liked when I put on the clear gel how it didn&#x27;t stain my shirts and because its clear I was not worried about stains or visible white residue when when wearing sleeveless shirts.</li>
            <li> did receive this product as a free trial from secret and Bzzagent all opinions shared are my own.</li>
            <li> I love that this product goes on clear, with no white lines to worry about.</li>
            <li> I have tried a million different products and Secret is the best antiperspirant on the market.</li>
            <li> Overall I have been thrilled with my initial bottle and will continue to use</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product free from BzzAgent and Secret, but opinions are all my own.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t remain any white mark on the cloths because it is clear gel and most of all</li>
            <li> Much better than the white bars that they say goes on clear</li>
            <li> I recieved this as a promotion from the brand and will sure be buying it in the near future.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast is the most effective odor protection is have used so far.</li>
            <li> but sometimes it oozes out a bit on its own.</li>
            <li> There is no white marks on my clothes, fresh scent, and worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I only need a tiny amount for effective all day odor protection.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall just makes the cut as another average deodorant with nothing super fantastic to note.</li>
            <li> To put it to the test, I put the deodorant on first and then put my black tank top on.</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry all day long and even though it&#x27;s unscented it smells good.</li>
            <li> Other than that the product seems to be inline with  the rest of their odor  protection products, however, I would love to see a paraben and aluminum free deodorant in their future lines!</li>
            <li> You stay fresh all day with no mess.  </li>
            <li> While it is not bad on a normal day, for those days I am more physically active, it doesn&#x27;t completely keep odors away.  </li>
            <li> when first applied, It has a cold/wet feeling which was new to me.</li>
            <li> From the first time I used this new product I was hooked.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for a wonderful product Secret!!</li>
            <li> I love the quick to dry gel which will not leave white marks.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the Secret Outlast clean and clear gel</li>
            <li> I is easy to use, dries fast and lasts long!</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to anyone who like a fresh scent!</li>
            <li> This deodorant is unique in that it actually does what it says it will!</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant so much, I have been using the same basic Secret deodorant for as long as I can remember but for the first time in years I am so impressed that I am making the switch.</li>
            <li> ;) I love that this clear gel doesn&#x27;t feel all wet and goopy going on</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t think this product works quite as well for odor protection as clinical strength products, it&#x27;s better than the other non-clinical strength products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Other then that I love it.</li>
            <li> I have not been happy with my solid deodorants that leave marks and also do not seem to last long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is as powerful as the clinical strength that Secret makes, but it is still pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li> however you want to be sure not to get it on your clothes like other deodorants, or it will show on your shirt.  </li>
            <li> I was thoroughly impressed with Secret outlast!!</li>
            <li> Many of the other women&#x27;s deodorants reek of perfume,</li>
            <li> its works a lot better than the other brands that I am use to.  </li>
            <li> I even wake up the next morning smelling fresh without need to reapply!</li>
            <li> i love the way it smells and it lasts almost half the day compared to other deoderants i love secret outlast deoderant &amp;#60;i recieved this item for free in return of an honest product review from bzzagent</li>
            <li> I thought it was hilarious, but also cool that it even worked for my hard working man.</li>
            <li> I have always loved secret because of its great long lasting protection like no other.</li>
            <li> This is a great deodorant it keeps my underarms dry and not stinky after a full busy day and for a full 48 hours without white marks on my clothes :) my only complaint is I wish it dried just a tag faster :)</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel free to review and it is now my new favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li> The deoderant seemed to dry out very quickly.</li>
            <li> I like it because it does exactly what it says it will do - keep you feeling clean and dry all day.</li>
            <li> First off, I gotta say, Secret Outlast Clear Gel in Completely Clean smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> i would totally recommend this to anyone, the gel goes on smoothly and dries quickly, it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on your clothes and</li>
            <li> On Day 3 I continued my regular schedule applying “Completely Clean”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this went on smooth no stinging, and dried very quickly with no visible residue.  </li>
            <li> If you are mildly active, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> It works and it dries fast, which was one of the main things I was worried about.</li>
            <li> Secret outlast is the best deodorant ever it works all day long and don&#x27;t leave marks</li>
            <li> This gel is cool to the touch and makes me squirm for the first few moments after applying it, but it quickly dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant it smells great and works hard when you work hard</li>
            <li> I use it on special occasions only.</li>
            <li> Once it finally dried it worked great and kept me dry all day.  </li>
            <li> I wear a lot of black, so I loved that this product does leave the white debris on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> it goes on as a clear gel, but dries very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothes -</li>
            <li> I have used secret and its ok for easy days</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve always used secret products, so i was super excited when i was chosen to receive this product free from clearlybetterchallenge.com as a member of one2one</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I was extremely satisfied with Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel - it kept me dry and still smelling great, even after a long sweat-filled workout!</li>
            <li> The scent is very clean but may be stronger than other deodorants.</li>
            <li> I am more of a natural products person, so I would not normally go pick this up from the store.</li>
            <li> I love it also because it does not get on my dark clothing, which I wear a lot of in fall an winter.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and shave my underarms every 2 days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Secret Outlast for several days and can honestly say that the product has lived up to most of the hype.</li>
            <li> I went through it twice as fast as my normal deodorant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> glad i got to try this for free from bzzagent, now i dont have to waste my money on it later.</li>
            <li> I will however get a full size of this deodorant and i will update my review later</li>
            <li> I was recently sent a full size sample of this product by BzzAgent to test out.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no white marks and a true 48 hour protection.  </li>
            <li> most of my deodorants last for several months, but this one runs out rather fast, which is one of the issues with the &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; deodorants.</li>
            <li> After a couple of days using Secret Outlast, I am thrilled!</li>
            <li> first day I wore this deoderant, I had a 14 hour day at work that was extremely busy.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any white marks so that part of the claim seems true.</li>
            <li> It may not be strong enough to keep me dry for an entire day, but it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel doesn&#x27;t have a strong sent, but it smells clean...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other brands, and this one beats them all!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll come off a little), and I am good to go for an entire day.</li>
            <li> First, it does not irritate my super sensitive skin (which is a big priority for me).  </li>
            <li> This is going to be a new deodorant in my household!</li>
            <li> Through a tough work week and busy home life, it worked just great.</li>
            <li> Next time I will try a different scent, but other than that, it was a great find.</li>
            <li> I was able to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel as part of BzzAgent, and I was impressed that it didn&#x27;t leave any white marks (or other marks from the clear gel) on my clothing.</li>
            <li> It keeps you dry and odor free all day.  </li>
            <li> it kept me dry and odor free, and i wore it on a marathon day.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried many of the clinical deodorants which are much more expensive and this seems to do a better job for less money.</li>
            <li> Seriously, if you are looking for a nondudely smelling deodorant that won&#x27;t leave gross white bits in your underarm hair, this is the best choice.</li>
            <li> I can always count on staying dry and streal free.</li>
            <li> and it was dry and felt smooth.</li>
            <li> Even better, I wear a lot of black</li>
            <li> I had enough odor to notice it on myself, but luckily I don&#x27;t think anyone else</li>
            <li> so it dried fairly quickly, left no residue and had good staying power.</li>
            <li> but better than than the solid because you can&#x27;t get white marks on your clothes.  </li>
            <li> I also love that it says that it will last for 48 hours, although I will probably never know because I reapply daily.  </li>
            <li> after the grandchildren went back home with my daughter, i still had many hours left in the day to test the product....</li>
            <li> There are never any white marks on my clothes, and it dries quickly and not sticky.</li>
            <li> This one is holding STEADY.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to share this with other woman, it REALLY works and does what it says!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> As for odor, I never smelled anything particularly foul coming from me, so I assumed it worked out.</li>
            <li> I absolutley love the Secret Outlast gel, I got this free in a campain from bzzagent.</li>
            <li> The smell ist decent.</li>
            <li> It actually is clear, which is rare from deodorants that purport to be clear.</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that there really is no white residue left on your clothes</li>
            <li> Luckily, I brought  back up deodorant.</li>
            <li> trichlorohydrex gly 18% as the main ingredient, while outlast uses aluminum zirconium octachlorohydrex gly 16%.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating 4 stars though because my only criticism I can offer is a big deal for me, it feels damp when it goes on as most gels tend to do</li>
            <li> Received a free sample for a review and wasn&#x27;t really expected much from it.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast does have a scent, it&#x27;s pleasant but one might be upset if they go into it expecting it to be scentless.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave you the sticky feeling that mostly others do pause and gives you a refreshing sensation in the aroma lost long especially since I&#x27;m really active doing CrossFit</li>
            <li> Since I have had that problem with other deodorants, I just did the usual very light dusting of a powder on top of the deodorant to keep that from happening.  </li>
            <li> Keeps me nice and dry all day long.</li>
            <li> When you first put on the deodorant it is wet but dries quickly</li>
            <li> and I believe it is one of the reasons it&#x27;s not sticky.the inside of the lid meet with the design on the top of the bottle sealing it off for a tight close.</li>
            <li> thought it was just the high stress/nervous situation of the day</li>
            <li> i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Our dermatologist highly recommends this for men and women.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Secret outlast clear gel deodorant is a very nice product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I really like it and really did feel fresh for a long time!  </li>
            <li> There has got to be a more natural ingredient that can be used for wetness control other than the aluminum.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know which arm was which, but one clearly smelled much better than the other.</li>
            <li> It (much to my surprise) even remained clear with a mild amount of perspiration mixed in.</li>
            <li> since i started using this, they have just about completely gone away!!</li>
            <li> am very picky about deodorants and rarely find that their claims to leave no residue or white marks to be completely unfounded!</li>
            <li> So no wasted deodorant!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got to try this product, as I was pleasantly surprised at how fast Secret Outlast absorbed into my skin!</li>
            <li> , I usually sweat a lot, but this new deodorant kept me dry and works great.  </li>
            <li> It works fine just as long as it&#x27;s not too hot outside.</li>
            <li> I am able to use Secret&#x27;s outlast right after a shave and no side effects at all!  </li>
            <li> This product goes on clear and dries fast.  </li>
            <li> After walking through downtown and then doing some light housework at home I noticed that my underarms again felt sticky and wet.</li>
            <li> The first thing I did when I received Secret deodorant was to smell it, and omg it was amazing.</li>
            <li> i had told everyone at a womens outreach program about the deodorant and had them smell it and see what they thought before i used it and tried to hear what they all thought about it, everyone seemed to think it smelled amazing even though a few thought it was very overpowering, they still seems to like the overall smell.</li>
            <li> It dries clear and really helps control perspiration.</li>
            <li> Keeps me clean and dry.</li>
            <li> I also really like that it applies clear -</li>
            <li> The scent is minimal as opposed to the Mitchum&#x27;s Scent Free Gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of gels, but I liked how fast this one dried.</li>
            <li> and after a few weeks didn&#x27;t work as well any more.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, overall its worth a shot and it may work for you</li>
            <li> Normally, I would never think to purchase any type of gel product out of fear of feeling wetness all day.</li>
            <li> Its especially great in the summer when you wear short sleeves or tank tops and don&#x27;t want to get the white deodorant on your clothes or worse</li>
            <li> I love that it last so long</li>
            <li> its nice not having dark clothes with white deodorant streaks on them after getting dressed.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve stuck with stick formulas, dealing with white marks and cakey residue they left on my shirts and dresses because I thought they protected me better than their clear gel counterparts.</li>
            <li> Of course I did what any normal person would do...</li>
            <li> I did find the deodorant effective for at least 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another good product from the Secret line</li>
            <li> Even when I tour theme parks with my Secret Clinical Strength version, I smell good at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Loved Secret Outlast</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I feel Secret Outlast is good value for money.</li>
            <li> The deodorant is good, but not great.</li>
            <li> Chasing after a toddler, getting in and out of the pool, and running around showing houses, it&#x27;s not hard for me to work up a sweat.  </li>
            <li> As far as the wet feeling from the gel, it dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It smells great, dries super fast, and lasts through my crazy days and nights as a stay at home mom and home based business owner!  </li>
            <li> I have not liked gel in the past, but this quick drying has worked great.</li>
            <li> However, the new Outlast Clear Gel did not do much to help wetness.</li>
            <li> it drys super fast, and leaves absolutely no residue under the arm (or on your clothing).</li>
            <li> Finally a deodorant that keeps me dry all day.. love the gel and the way it doesn&#x27;t ruin my clothes</li>
            <li> This one is a quick drying gel that goes on completely clear and won&#x27;t leave white marks on your clothing.  </li>
            <li> This pleasant smelling deodorant does not leave icky white marks on your clothing, even the darkest of colors.  </li>
            <li> my husband and i were working on digging and planting in our flower beds, and the cleanup involved afterwards, then getting dinner ready, eating, cleanup after that, as well as other preperations for the next day that take a couple more hours.</li>
            <li> You know what I mean, you get a nice shirt on, then get dolled up and change your mind.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Clear Gel is working awesome so far and keeping me dry all day!</li>
            <li> It goes on with a cool feeling and kept me dry all day.</li>
            <li> That is why I love Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> As I said before, I am very picky and found that Secret Outlast Completely Clean went on smooth, not sticky and stayed that way throughout my day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It worked just as well as the solid deodorant that I used to use (even in the hot Georgia summer!), and left no marks on my cloths, so I think I&#x27;m ready to switch!</li>
            <li> I tried it and was impressed that it took very little to cover my underarm area and dried almost instantly.</li>
            <li> Alas, it doesn&#x27;t last an entire day for me, and the scent isn&#x27;t very pleasant toward the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Goes on clear, no stains, dries within seconds and last all day in Iowa&#x27;s hot humid weather!</li>
            <li> It came on smooth, i had no leftover residue like other brands.</li>
            <li> I notice that it goes on clear and dries pretty fast leaving no white spots on your clothing.</li>
            <li> Loved that there is no white marks left on my dark clothes</li>
            <li> I got to sample this new product from Bzz Agent.  </li>
            <li> Since this was a new product I brought it along in my bag</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with the new formula.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely my new go to deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i live in florida, so we have to deal with florida heat.</li>
            <li> I am on the market for a new antiperspirant as  we speak.</li>
            <li> I live in South Carolina.</li>
            <li> I also live in Arizona, so sweating can be quite an issue during the summer months.  </li>
            <li> They have a new buyer in me.</li>
            <li> This deodorant lasts all day and I will never have to remember apply again finding my new deodorant.</li>
            <li> This will be my new go-to deodorant.</li>
            <li> , this product does live up to its claims.</li>
            <li> I am a new mom, so</li>
            <li> Definitely my new deodorant of choice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so whats new with this one.  </li>
            <li> I am a park ranger, and I live and work in South Louisiana.</li>
            <li> I deff found a new deodorant to use.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I got in my car to head home that I remembered the new deoderant that I had put on that day.</li>
            <li> How well does it live up to the claim?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the new outlast clear gel would be only putting it mildly.</li>
            <li> The gel goes on quickly, cleanly and not much is needed.</li>
            <li> Several weeks ago, in a huge hurry to get out the door, I actually forgot to apply my deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I love Secret Outlast, it drys fast, keeps me smelling and feeling clean as well as not leaving white marks.</li>
            <li> This deodorant went on smooth, dried quickly, and didn&#x27;t leave white marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already a fan of Secret already and use it regularly because of how great it works for me.</li>
            <li> an adult, this product definitely helps keep me fresh all day, every day.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Reduces underarm wetness, 48-hour odor protection, strong enough for a woman and goes on clear with no white marks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> helping it dry quickly.</li>
            <li> loved this Secret Outlast Clear Gel.  </li>
            <li> It goes on clear and stays clear the whole day.  </li>
            <li> I will say that after using a dry solid for so many years it was an adjustment going to a clear gel.  </li>
            <li> This clear gel deodorant dries really fast compared to the old one I used 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> in one big SPLOCH ( that&#x27;s the sound and only</li>
            <li> I got this when I ran out of my secret outlast unscented solid deodorant because of the great reviews.</li>
            <li> I switched to the regular powder scent Secret Deodorant and it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of gel products but, it went on smooth and dried quickly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this &amp;#34;New Formula&amp;#34; clear gel Secret Outlast deodorant.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight fragrance, nothing too strong and it won&#x27;t overpower your perfume the way that some deodorant fragrances will.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first since I haven&#x27;t always had the best luck with clear solids.</li>
            <li> It feels a little sticky at first but dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I remain pretty dry and odorless for a decent amount of time!  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> In the North Carolina 100 degree heat, I was very surprised how well this deodorant worked.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> but it dried pretty quickly and didn&#x27;t get on my clothes.</li>
            <li> It seemed to absorb quickly into my skin and left no wet feeling or clumps.</li>
            <li> The scent is also light and you just smell &amp;#34;fresh.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> but once it came up, the flow didn&#x27;t dispense too freely but easy enough to control and get just enough for use without waste.</li>
            <li> Although the stress was high at times, I never had to worry about any older or wetness because yes secret outlast clear gel is amazing and works so well.</li>
            <li> I was steer clear of this stuff!</li>
            <li> My mom loves this clear gel!  </li>
            <li> I used to have to keep deodorant in my purse to reapply, but not with this clear gel!</li>
            <li> I would have never tried the clear gel if it weren&#x27;t for you guys!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always pleasantly surprised when a product does what it&#x27;s advertised to do!</li>
            <li> I would never trust a 48 hour protection guarantee, especially because I do hot power yoga and do a lot of walk/running.</li>
            <li> Secret® Clinical Strength does what it needs to do and keeps me fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> I did not have any more irritation from using this deodorant when compared to others I have used in the past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always tried solid deodorants and this was my first time trying gel deodorant.</li>
            <li> I do not usually shower twice a day, but I make exceptions on sweaty days or after swimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> though i doubted it completely!</li>
            <li> first of all i do not need something to work for 48 hours, as i do shower daily...</li>
            <li> Usually I am not a gel person</li>
            <li> I did yard work that day and it was hot outside</li>
            <li> No white marks on my shirts, no uncomfortable sweat</li>
            <li> I have to wear clear gels because of how much I sweat, and my old clear gel no longer worked.</li>
            <li> I have been using this products for the past 5 months and continue to love it.</li>
            <li> I applied it once in the morning and after a long day at work and at the gym I was still smelling fresh when I went home.</li>
            <li> Recently, I received a completely different deodorant which keeps me fresh for whole day</li>
            <li> After using the product for about a week I can say that I am pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> It really DOES keep my armpits dry and clean and after the 3rd day</li>
            <li> How can one provide better protection or last longer than other.</li>
            <li> I am personally not a fan of the feeling of the gel for the first seconds</li>
            <li> I work in the hot sun six days a week and have tried a lot of brands in hopes to not feel completely gross by the end of each day.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> , which was a little strong smelling for my liking.  </li>
            <li> The scent is a little strong for me</li>
            <li> and I was excited that as a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> I felt like it never dried, though it says its a quick dry formula.</li>
            <li> Thank you BzzAgent and Secret for letting me try my new favorite deodorant!</li>
            <li> because first off, it&#x27;s super sticky since it&#x27;s a roll on in liquid form which takes much longer to dry, and second, it only provides me with up to 12 hours of coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret</li>
            <li> I usually use the solid but was excited to try the completely clean clear gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a FREE SAMPLE of Secret Outlast Clear Gel thanks to #SECRET and I have to say this is a great product.</li>
            <li> The first day I used it, I noticed that it went on clear and left no whiteness on my armpits.</li>
            <li> The gel dried super fast, but didn&#x27;t go through a full day without getting my shirt wet on my underarm area.  </li>
            <li> I  felt  dry and fresh all day when using the product</li>
            <li> and I stayed fresh and dry.</li>
            <li> It keep me dry and fresh all day and gave me the confidence to do everything I needed.</li>
            <li> SO FRESH AND DRY</li>
            <li> I noticed I was still dry and fresh all day.</li>
            <li> An hour after the application I noticed that the gel felt rather sticky on my skin (where is the dry and fresh feel?).</li>
            <li> It does go on wet, but dries fairly quick.  </li>
            <li> I have always used Secret deodorant in the past and I must say this is one of the best products on the market.</li>
            <li> Especially when you love wearing dark clothing.</li>
            <li> I usually use secret clinical and have always been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> it does have a faint but pleasant scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Applied the product after my morning shower and started my day, it is summer and currently about 100 degrees outside where I live and this kept me dry and odor free all day!</li>
            <li> I was thoroghly impressed with this product in comparison to my former product (Lady Speed Stick), though I am still getting a slight irritation from this it is not nearly as intense as previous.</li>
            <li> I recently received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel through BzzAgent as a means to experience the product for free!  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the residue/white stuff left behind by most solid deodorants, so I was excited to try out this gel formula.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly physical job and remaining dry throughout the day is important to me.  </li>
            <li> No white marks on my favorite black too.</li>
            <li> It dried super fast after I put it on</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, especially for new moms!</li>
            <li> The only draw back is that it is a little cold when you first put it on, but worth getting used to, to make sure that I have clean clothing and can get dressed right away!  </li>
            <li> Works all day and no mess!</li>
            <li> There are NO awful white marks, and if  you let it dry properly then you will have NO gel streaks on your clothes either.</li>
            <li> and I am left with pure odor and wetness protection instead of a scent to mask any nastiness.</li>
            <li> I stayed very dry and smelled fresh.</li>
            <li> My wedding day is fast approaching, and I am so glad that my dress will not be covered in a white streaky mess.</li>
            <li> I was under the sun all day at a local theme park, so as long as I still smell good, a little sweat doesn&#x27;t bother me!</li>
            <li> He only used it a few ays until I could get him some more, but I know he enjoyed how hard it worked even for him.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean deodorant makes me feel 100% sure during my extremely long work days!</li>
            <li> My underarms were wet for about thirty seconds, but after that they stayed dry and fresh all day, even after exercising!!</li>
            <li> This Secret Clear Gel is amazing.</li>
            <li> Thank you secret and thank you Bzzagent for this amazing product.</li>
            <li> The Secret Outlast Clear Gel is amazing.</li>

            <li> I like the gel and that in goes on clear.  </li>
            <li> Unscented Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Deodorant was for me.  </li>
            <li> IT WENT ON CLEAR</li>
            <li> AND IT STAYED CLEAR NO MARKS ON MY BLOUSES.  </li>
            <li> Goes on clear and dries fast, no white gunk to get on clothes.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear;</li>
            <li> /&gt;This does go on clear and will not stain your clothes.</li>
            <li> I like the clear gel because there is no guessing when you run out</li>
            <li> I will continue to wear this Outlast Clear Gel.</li>
            <li> Until, I was offered to try Outlast Clear Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It went on clear and stayed clear.  </li>
            <li> which any adult knows is complete torture when you have young ones.</li>
            <li> It also held up to its name about being a clear deodorant.</li>
            <li> Goes on clear and dries clear.</li>
            <li> It is clear</li>
            <li> It went on clear and did not leave any residue at all.</li>
            <li> This goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is clear</li>
            <li> it is clear and stays clear</li>
            <li> I like the gel version because it goes on clear and stays clear</li>
            <li> This Clear Gel is everything in one.</li>
            <li> Trying the clear gel opened my eyes, its clear and does no leave marks.</li>
            <li> Truly Clear.</li>
            <li> clear gel doesn&#x27;t leave marks on your clothing, so I never have to worry about that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used clear gel deodorants before and they didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only is it completely invisible, but it works very well as an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Unscented, and clear.</li>
            <li> and it was clear like nothing was there</li>
            <li> It went on clear</li>
            <li> One twist of the deodorant provides enough odor and wetness protection for the whole day.  </li>
            <li> As you can imagine I am always busy and running around.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell masculine either.</li>
            <li> As far as odor protection, I sweat a lot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used natural (doesn&#x27;t cut it for me), RX (can taste the metallic &amp; burns), so I got stuck using one brand &amp; that was failing.....</li>
            <li> you have any degree of sensitive skin-</li>
            <li> With that being said I tried the product and was pleasantly surprised with it.</li>
            <li> I switched to this sensitive gel and my underarm reactions/sensitivities are completely gone.  </li>
            <li> I recommend giving it a try if you&#x27;ve been a solid deodorant player your whole life.  </li>
            <li> We were there nearly 40 hours before he was admitted to the hospital.</li>
            <li> I wore the same clothes the whole time.  </li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> My day was no where near a 24 hour period</li>
            <li> I give this deodorant a huge two thumbs up and will definitely buy another when my free sample that Secret gave me for a promotion</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being a busy mom and it also being summer.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not missing my old deodorant.</li>
            <li> Drys fast and tends to last all day!!!</li>
            <li> I became self conscious and from then</li>
            <li> and I am the last one to get ready.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the go, running around, just grocery shopping is a complete workout.</li>
            <li> It advertises that for 48 &#x27;epic&#x27; hours I can be protected from odor AND wetness.</li>
            <li> get moderate BO when I sweat, and this product absolutely eliminates that problem for me short of when I&#x27;m really exerting myself and leaking sweat like a sieve.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for someone with sensitive skin, and I would not use it when you are planning to wear any non cotton based clothing.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Bzz Agent and thanks to Secret for allowing me to try the product for free.</li>
            <li> I haven’t developed one yet</li>
            <li> a set of 3 year old twin boys and now a 4 month baby girl.</li>
            <li> I lead a busy work/mommy life...</li>
            <li> Thanks to Secret and Buzz agent, I got to try the Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant for free!</li>
            <li> Perhaps I have an unusual body chemistry, but for me, I find I do have to apply it the next day, or I will experience perspiration under my arms.</li>
            <li> The fact that these ingredients are found in breast cancer patients&#x27; tissues makes me stay FAR AWAY.</li>
            <li> Price offer is reasonable, and expiry date on product is valid for a year and six months from now, this is a plus as oppose to othe purchased products where products last for 2-3 months from delivery date.</li>
            <li> I only give it a one star because I don&#x27;t sweat so much</li>
            <li> the air looked sort of like the silent hill movie (very foggy, creepy-like)...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t participate in any activities that produce a lot of sweat, and I just naturally don&#x27;t tend to have an odor.</li>
            <li> However, when I received this in the mail, and used it, I was surprised.  </li>
            <li> It dries fast, lasts all day and beyond, and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my shirt.  </li>
            <li> But when I came I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> It dries really fast and left no deodorant stains on my shirt.</li>
            <li> This masks it and deals with the unpleasantness of getting old.  </li>
            <li> My issue with this deodorant is that it does not last through much activity.</li>
            <li> Just beware if you have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It only needed one click and it covered the whole area.</li>
            <li> and my pits feel soft.</li>
            <li> Well FINALLY I found one that really does what it claims and does not leave marks.  </li>
            <li> I was about to reach for the stick that I keep in my desk, but I thought that I would see if the deoderant really held up (I had taken a shower the night before and applied deoderant afterwards) for multiple days.</li>
            <li> - the no whitemarks claim I found to be just about 100% true, even in my dark colored work out clothes.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to see that for about $4 a stick, Secret Outlast worked really well</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this for everyday and will definitely purchase.</li>
            <li> Thanks again Secret for sending me the free sample!</li>
            <li> (I received Secret Outlast Clear Gel to test out and any opinions are 100% my own.)</li>
            <li> I literally walked 8 miles and still smelled fresh and didn&#x27;t have any wet marks on my shirt underarm.</li>
            <li> I have always been a soft solid deodorant person, but recently was able to try Secret Outlast for free via Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li> Even to the next day I was still fresh when I took a shower that next afternoon .</li>
            <li> but as soon as the formula dries down the scent pretty much disapates</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not a fan of gel deodorants but this one was quick to dry and left no marks on my clothing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothes, and I love to wear black tops!</li>
            <li> I received my free BzzAgent sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel right before leaving on my family vacation.</li>
            <li> I am constantly in the need for an advanced odor protection deodorant and Secret Outlast Clear Gel has not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Meaning, I felt damp, thus I didn&#x27;t pull my shirt on until it had time to dry, and later in the day I felt sticky after a full day of work.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like gel deodorant, but this one dries quickly and it really works.</li>
            <li> so when Secret offered to send me a free sample I wasn&#x27;t too excited about it, but figured why not since it had been years since I last tried their gel deodorant</li>
            <li> The other key point is that it seems to last all day, even on the hottest, more humid of days.</li>
            <li> I have tried different types of deodorant through the years from the regular powdery stuff, sprays, and clear gels and none have left me feeling clean at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It comes out too easily so dont turn the dispenser until it oozes, because it will keep oozing!  </li>
            <li> I work in a hot wherehouse and come home with my shirt dry, and without being smelly.  </li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel complimentary for testing purposes from Bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and dries very quickly, leaving no residue or that &#x27;wet feeling&#x27; behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long-time user of Secret Deodorant, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be instantly blown away, but I have to admit that I&#x27;m pretty impressed with the Secret Outlast Clear Gel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> as a member of one2one network, i received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com and being that i am almost 50 years old, and have used many types of deodorant, i am so excited to say that the secret outlast cleargel i was sent actually did what it claims to do...</li>
            <li> In the summer I sweat so much it is unbearable that I take at least 3 showers for the day and still not feel clean.</li>
            <li> humidity is ridiculous here in the south, and i need something that is powerful and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li> It also seemed to dry quickly for me and did not require any extra drying time.</li>
            <li> But I had the opportunity to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel for free thanks to BzzAgent and now my mind has been opened!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a clear and lasting deodorant!</li>
            <li> I typically use men&#x27;s clear solid for dryness and odor protection (I don&#x27;t love the scent, but it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that keeps me dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Outlast Clear Gel really does go on clear; it doesn&#x27;t dry out my underarms.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t apply such a huge glob of it on my underarms (enough for 50 pairs of pits) and it would take hours to dry, if at all</li>
            <li> It kept me feeling fresh and dry all day love secret</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d convert from my regular solid to this, but it did smell fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one less thing to worry about considering I spend the whole day taking care of my 4 month old and don&#x27;t get to spend much time on myself.</li>
            <li> My review is for the Active Fresh scent which doesn&#x27;t appear to be sold on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got the active fresh scent.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be leaving any residue on my clothing - even if I put on clothing freshly after putting on the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of longevity, the deodorant seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Works really well - no wetness or odor even after a long busy day.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from secret just in time for my first trip of the season - to AZ</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t a fan of the Active Fresh scent</li>
            <li> I also like the scent active fresh scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent I got was actually Active Fresh</li>
            <li> Normally I can&#x27;t use a clear get without having to reapply it several times.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because although I love the scents available in Secret products however the deodorant has never been able to keep up with me.</li>
            <li> I am a high school biology teacher, and spend several hours each day on my feet in front of my students and in the lab.</li>
            <li> This product is consistent with the Secret line of products as it offers 48 hour odor protection, fends off armpit sweat and leaves me feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I am dry, not white streaks and it smiles amazingly fresh.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin so many of the women&#x27;s scents are irritating.</li>
            <li> This is gentle, won&#x27;t clog hair shafts and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> have had some busy days lately, one of which included me walking around outside in the heat for most of the day.</li>
            <li> Lately i have been having a problem with my shirts becoming discolored after using my husbands deodorant.</li>
            <li> It has a light scent that is not overwhelming (although I would have preferred something that had no scent).  </li>
            <li> He felt strange about a &amp;#34;woman&#x27;s&amp;#34; deodorant, but since it was unscented, he didn&#x27;t mind so much.</li>
            <li> It really does protect from odor and wetness all day long.</li>
            <li> , the only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is I feel the product wouldn&#x27;t last as long vs a solid , it seems like you use more gel vs the solid .</li>
            <li> It conked out mid day on a normal, non stressed, non sweaty day.</li>
            <li> I should disclaim that I normally have to use the extra odor protection deodorant, if I applied twice a day</li>
            <li> It goes on pretty wet, but has never stained my clothes.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is not replacing my current deodorant simply because I don&#x27;t know how it will perform in the summer, but I am reserving judgement until I know for certain.</li>
            <li> so after getting up at 7 am, and applying the secret clearlast gel and finally getting ready to shower at 11pm, i was extremely happy to realize that i had not gotten wet under my arms, and there was no marks on my clothing!!!!</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel helps to protect against the main causes of sweat: heat, activity and stress sweat!</li>
            <li> They did make their promise on it being a truly clear deodorant, but if it&#x27;s clear yet ineffective in every other way, I don&#x27;t see much point in buying</li>
            <li> This is no longer the same product and should get a new name.  </li>
            <li> The only thing for me was that it didn&#x27;t live up to the 48 hour claim.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert so, having wetness protection would have been a big bonus for me.</li>
            <li> But drying time is very fast unlike other gel deodorants.</li>
            <li> This product has only gotten better by making it clear with the new Secret Outlast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am trying the product for free with no obligation to review thanks to Secret.</li>
            <li> Switched from Dove to Secret Outlast thanks to BZZAGENT and I must say the difference is incredibly huge..</li>
            <li> also trying the product for free thanks to Secret.</li>
            <li> I received a FREE sample from BzzAgent thanks to Secret and will continue to purchase the product.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand trying the product for free thanks to Secret.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying this product for free thanks to Secret through a Bzzz campaign.  </li>
            <li> I really like this stuff in dry climates.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel stick worked really well from the start.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much I sweated it kept me dry.</li>
            <li> The scents are always fresh, I got active fresh, and kept the everyday stink away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that Secret improved the Clear Gel formula, and will continue to use</li>
            <li> (generally this is what I have not liked about gel deodorants in the past, but I was pleased with how quickly it dried.)&lt;br /&gt;Odor</li>
            <li> Love Secret clear gel.</li>
            <li> The first day or two, I stayed in the house and did normal everyday things</li>
            <li> I love Secret outlast clear gel.</li>
            <li> I love secret outlast clear gel.</li>
            <li> I love the Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant because of the scent and the odor protection.</li>
            <li> They say you need only one click, but I used two for each arm, it just doesn&#x27;t seem like enough deodorant with one click to even get it the whole way across your armpit</li>
            <li> I really love Secret Outlast Clear Gel.  </li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t go that long without showering), this stuff seems to do a pretty bang up job of lasting all day!</li>
            <li> It dried quickly and I didn&#x27;t need to worry about it getting on my tops.</li>
            <li> I tried this and was amazed that  this dried quickly.</li>
            <li> I applied the product and the gel dried quickly and did not leave a residue.</li>
            <li> It dried sooo quickly, and did not feel sticky at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using Secret Outlast for a few days now and it has worked great for me.</li>
            <li> but this one dried quickly and it did not feel gross.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I normally do not like gel deodorant,but so far I&#x27;m loving Secret Outlast Clear Gel.</li>
            <li> I love the clear gel factor, no more white on clothes (even the ones that go on clear, the white stays white on clothes).</li>
            <li> First I am allergic to many different perfumes, second I can&#x27;t stand many perfumes and lastly I would hate to make someone have a severe allergic reaction just because I am vain...</li>
            <li> I really like the cool scent and all day protection of the Secret Outlast clear gel.</li>
            <li> Then apply the  clear gel no mess no white residue .</li>
            <li> So the first pit needs two clicks to have enough gel and the second pit only needs one.  </li>
            <li> I live in a climate that&#x27;s hot all year round, even our &amp;#34;winters&amp;#34; hold up in the 70 degree area, so deoderant is a must have for me.</li>
            <li> are the downsides: The first application didn&#x27;t last very long (where is the odor protection?)</li>
            <li> It can get on your clothes if you don’t let it dry first, but if does get on your clothes there are no white marks.</li>
            <li> This is the first Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant that finally kept me dry...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It keeps my fresh and dry all day long on a buys hospital unit.  </li>
            <li> Second, the clear gel dries fast with no sticky feeling and third, no white residue on my clothes or underarms!  </li>
            <li> It definitely kept me smelling fresh all day and not having to worry about white marks was a huge plus over Secret&#x27;s Clinical Strength deoderant that I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> Sometimes after shaving, I do experience a slight burning if I put this on right after.  </li>

            <li> I have sensitive skin and already enjoy Secret brand deodorants, but the new Outlast has kept me feeling fresher longer.</li>
            <li> no marks were even left behind on a black tank, so that was great.</li>
            <li> With five children I lead a pretty active life.</li>
            <li> Yes i sweated a little bit but at the end of the day I was still fresh.</li>

            <li> I get frustrated having to clean off deodorant from my clothing after I put it on, and I feel like I need more deodorant afterwards.</li>
            <li> , I was inside in the AC, not very active.</li>
            <li> but I generally use unscented.  </li>
            <li> Last year I remember trying the Clear Gel in ooh-la-lavender</li>
            <li> I like that it goes on clear and does not leave white stains on my clothing.</li>
            <li> It is clear so it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on your clothes.</li>
            <li> And because it is a clear gel there were no white streaks.</li>
            <li> However, this one dries almost instantly and dries clear with no residue.</li>
            <li> When you first put it on, it feels a bit awkward but the name does not lie, it outlasts many deodorants.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this clear gel to women that prefer gels.</li>
            <li> my deodorant in the past always broke much sooner than it should have wasting too much product.</li>
            <li> The gel dries clear so no white residue on my clothes or in my pits.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve always felt that clear gels don&#x27;t work as well as white antiperspirants.&lt;br</li>
            <li> no white marks, goes on clear, lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I barely knew  </li>
            <li> No messy streaks is a definite plus!</li>
            <li> I only wish that the smell of the deodorant was stronger because I like to notice my deodorant smell without having to directly smell my armpits.</li>
            <li> So far not white lines.</li>
            <li> :  Smell, so far no white marks</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as 48 hour odor protection and no white mark residue</li>
            <li> Not sure what the exact difference is between the two aluminums, but I do know the Ph one lasts much longer and actually does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I love Secret Outlast Deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many Secret deodorants</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Secret Outlast</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the comfort Secret Outlast</li>
            <li> Secret sent me this product to try for free and I switched to this brand lightning speed !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Secret user for many years.  </li>
            <li> Secret is my favorite, no matter what scent.</li>
            <li> Secret deodorant is my favorite brand.</li>
            <li> Its nice not have that white &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34; residue that solid deodorants leave behind.</li>
            <li> remember its ok to have a secret.</li>
            <li> I put the secret on as soon as i got it in the mail, it works so much better than you could ever imagine.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast is my favorite deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I used a clinical strength before trying this and the Secret Outlast is BETTER than the clinical deodorant!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have never used Secret deodorant before receiving this sample, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> It is really frustrating when you put on a top and look in the mirror and have the deodorant marks on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure everyone knows how frustrating they can be.</li>
            <li> I love Secret deodorant.</li>
            <li> Thank you Secret for letting me try this for free!</li>
            <li> I love secret outlast deodorant.</li>
            <li> Kind of feels weird going on because it&#x27;s gel</li>
            <li> In the past I haven&#x27;t been much of a fan of the gel deodorants, but this one dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky or wet under your arms.</li>
            <li> I love the new secret outlast!  </li>
            <li> I have about 15 different brands of deodorant at home, I live in the desert and its a daily necessity.</li>
            <li> It controlled the sweat, did not leave white streaks and dried quickly.</li>
            <li> There was no white marks and it dried quickly.</li>
            <li> i chose to do the real test when i took a day off of work to go on a field trip for my almost 5 year old granddaughter, knowing that my other 2 younger granddaughters would be there as well.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on it felt a little wet and cool, but within seconds it dried and felt normal.</li>
            <li> As soon as I applied it the product dried right away</li>
            <li> Second, no marks even if you put a black tank top on immediately after applying it, or if you put it on while wearing a black tank.  </li>
            <li> but I will say it has a clean scent that will last through a busy day at least and maybe a hour work out.</li>
            <li> I remain pretty dry and odorless for a long period of time!  </li>
            <li> very comparable to other name brand deodorants of</li>
            <li> When it did come up it was either to much or not enough making me thing I would always over use or never get enough and in the long run made me think I would go through it quicker.</li>
            <li> My very first thought was Is there anything in this small bottle to test?</li>
            <li> I was really amazed at how it works because it lasts up to 48 hours and protects from wetness due to sweat.</li>
            <li> After having tried pretty much every deodorant on the market, including the clinical ones, Secret&#x27;s Outlast Clear Gel in Unscented is a godsend.</li>
            <li> I definitely put this deodorant to the test the first day I wore it with a day spent volunteering outside and an evening</li>
            <li> I really like d that it does not take long to dry as that was my major concern with gel deodorants.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s actually working really great because I haven&#x27;t notice any bad armpit odor.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and didn&#x27;t leave any ugly white stains on my clothes!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclosure: I received the Secret Outlast Clear Gel for free from the One2One Network via clearlybetterchallenge.com</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel as part of a brand promotion for free in exchange for my review.</li>
            <li> When I joined BzzAgent I started recieving products then I recieved Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant for free and</li>
            <li> I am a bzzagent and had the opportunity to try Secret Outlast Clear gel as a free sample.</li>
            <li> I was previously using Degree because, as my girlfriend likes to laugh, I &amp;#34;sweat like a man.&amp;#34; I was pleasantly surprised when this product not only kept me dry, it also didn&#x27;t have an odor.</li>
            <li> It last really well and left my shirt dry all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally a solid girl, but this clear gel actually exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I received a free stick of Secret Outlast® Clear Gel from Bzzagent.com to product review.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating, is only because it did dry fast at all like advertised.</li>
            <li> It goes on dry and clear so it leaves no messy white marks on your skin or clothes.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant from BzzAgent, and used it every day for about for two weeks.</li>
            <li> However, after 35 days, I tried this deodorant again, and found that even though it is a wet gel, and feels like it is covering my entire armpit, I did notice the deodorant was less effective and held out about half the time of 24</li>
            <li> The feeling of freshness lasts all day, I don&#x27;t feel the need to apply again before going to the gym after work because I still feel dry and fresh, but don&#x27;t have the caked on deodorant that I usually get with the normal stick type.</li>
            <li> Two hours later, just normal behavior no working out or being outdoors for long</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to have a chance to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel for free thanks to Secret</li>
            <li> I love Secret but have always used the invisible solid.</li>
            <li> i received no other compensation and this is my personal review.  </li>
            <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel rocks!</li>
            <li> You just might want to try Secret Outlast completely clean and clear gel deodorant!</li>
            <li> The gel didn&#x27;t leave any marks on my clothing, however I didn&#x27;t really care for the dry time (which wasn&#x27;t long).</li>
            <li> I noticed no smell and definitely kept the sweating under my arms to a minimum - a consistent performance with my typical product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sweat right through it and get rubbed raw.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a whole day and products hardly ever last me a whole day.</li>
            <li> but when it come to my body if the product is not a good fit I would not hesitate to say so.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t speak for it&#x27;s lasting 48 hours, because i shower every 24 hours at minimum, however it stands up to my exercising and general sweating throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I was giving the secret out last clear gel 48hour protection from bzzagent free for  a campaign to try and review.</li>
            <li> on my lunch break,  When I get done walking, I can not head back to the office as a hot sweaty mess.</li>
            <li> I  was excited to try secret outlast clear gel</li>
            <li> The first few weeks I had no issues</li>
            <li> Despite that small issue, the deodorant itself worked and kept me fresh all day.  </li>
            <li> Being from Florida its hot year round.</li>
            <li> decided to give Secret Outlast the ultimate test, using for the first time when I was leaving to run my first 5k.  </li>
            <li> Our fall here has brought us temps in the upper 80&#x27;s - if you want to use a fragrance free aSend CLEAR gel deodorant that will not leave you hanging, use Secret Outlast.</li>
            <li> It really works, keeps you dry all day long!</li>
            <li> I noticed before how I used to sweat a lot and ever since I had been trying Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel, I noticed the differenced on my clothes.</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel as a sample from the company as a Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from BzzAgent for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I tried Secret Outlast Completely Clean clear gel deodorant.</li>
            <li> Although I did like the product I was not very fond of the scent i received which was active fresh.</li>
            <li> I notice you need to keep the container standing straight up and down so that the gel comes out evenly.  </li>
            <li> i live in florida, so it&#x27;s already hot and the secret outlast clear gel</li>
            <li> I am very active and spend a large amount of time walking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is one aspect that prevented me from giving Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel a full 5 stars - and that is due to its ability to travel without making a mess.  </li>
            <li> It goes on clear, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about marks on my clothing and it works all day long!</li>
            <li> Not great and not bad!    </li>
            <li> When I applied the clear gel it started to dry immediately.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear and it keeps me dry, but not for 48 hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear as it say and when you put it on you have to wait for it to dry which is understanding.</li>
            <li> It does dry clear</li>
            <li> My wife pretty much agrees, though she she complains of gradual build-up if she doesn&#x27;t let this stuff dry for a few minutes before slipping into a shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its not messy and it last long.</li>
            <li> I would still prefer to use my normal secret powder fresh for my T-Shirt days.</li>
            <li> Over the course of my vacation I went to the beach several times, went on a few boat rides, and did a lot of walking on hot humid days.</li>
            <li> It washes off easily with that sticky feeling some deodorants leave behind.</li>
            <li> that Secret Outlast Completely Cleans claims were completely true and stood up to the claim of ongoing freshness and no sweat or odor.&lt;br /&gt;Secret</li>
            <li> I had stopped using Secret years ago, I had just outgrown the strong sents added.  </li>
            <li> While it does take a little bit of time to dry it was worth the wait for me.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast, was super light after applying, was a little cold at first when applying, dried super fast.</li>
            <li> After testing the Secret Outlast Clear Gel in Active Fresh for a couple of days, I really like it.</li>
            <li> Not only does it keep me dry, but it goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t get my clothes all yucky.</li>
            <li> It kept me dry from early morning after my shower to the next day!</li>
            <li> It does dry fast and does not leave a sticky wet feeling under your pits.</li>
            <li> and I do love that way it works, how dry I stay, its non irritating and</li>
            <li> Normally I use a solid stick deodorant, I decided to try this out in hopes of escaping the white marks on my clothing, plus I received  it for free to Try from secret through bzzagent!.</li>
            <li> I sweat on a normal day when I&#x27;m not being active</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a bunch of deodorants over the years, and previously settled on SpeedStick style white cake and Sure roll-ons that, over time, always resulted in a thick, clumpy build-up in my shirts, and an ever-present sticky coating on my pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am fine with any secret products except outlast.</li>
            <li> Before I got it for free, thanks to Secret &amp; BzzAgent, I was previously using an invisible solid</li>
            <li> I was a little leery about trying this product as the idea of goo under my arms wasn&#x27;t sounding very helpful to me.  </li>
            <li> I have been a Secret user for my entire adult life, and I was lucky enough to receive a free Secret Outlast by being a BzzAgent of Bzzagent.com.  </li>
            <li> I had high hope for Secret Outlast Clear Gel, and after receiving it in a FREE BzzKit, was anxious to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I did not smell bad, but I did not smell good either.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of gel deodorants and they always left me feeling wet and my skin irritated, with the outlast clear gel I had no issues at all.</li>
            <li> For that reason  it is hard to find the right deodorant to substain me throughout all my activities.</li>
            <li> and I did not sweat or smell like I normally can with other brands!</li>
            <li> The one I got is scented and though it&#x27;s a clear gel, it doesn&#x27;t take long to dry</li>
            <li> As long as I allow the clear gel to dry</li>
            <li> I am a very active person and my normal deodorant wasn&#x27;t working so when I finally ran out</li>
            <li> a slight order smell which I thought was normal till I used this today.</li>
            <li> I also do not have to worry about white marks, like I do with the Secret Original.  </li>
            <li> Secret is my favorite deodorant and outlasts any other brand I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Knowing what I know about Secret and how I trust the brand, I was excited to finally try a gel deodorant from a brand that I trusted.  </li>
            <li> Putting it on, it did feel a little different than the solid that I normally use...</li>
            <li> the Day 2, I continued my regular schedule without applying the Secret Outlast “Completely Clean”.</li>
            <li> The other bonus is that its a clear gel</li>
            <li> I have become completely immune to other anti-perspirants.</li>
            <li> It doesnt leave the white marks behind like most other brands, and for someone who is overweight and sweats a lot this keeps up with my body odor!</li>
            <li> but there was no moisturizing component to Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel as there are in other brands of deodorant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After working out I have noticed that is works really well, and several of my friends asked me to, so I shared my new secret with them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i am a huge fan of all secret products because they are well made and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I used this in the morning with a busy and active day and it worked as promised.  </li>
            <li> Secret Outlast has kept me looking clean all summer.  </li>
            <li> There is NOTHING worse than white marks on that treasured summer time staple, the black tank top.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a deodorant that can help me keep up with my active 5 year old girl</li>
            <li> The brand of deodorant I received and tested is the Secret Outlast “Completely Clean”.</li>
            <li> I will definitely recommend this product to everyone for its long lasting effect and freshness.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I am not wild about and the reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it contains aluminum, which is said to be a possible cause for breast cancer.</li>
            <li> I usually prefer a solid deodorant and feel that gel versions leave a sticky residue but Secret Outlast Gel dried quickly and felt smooth.</li>
            <li> I switched away from Secret years ago because the formula that I loved and had used for years suddenly (but not so mysteriously) stopped performing once they released the Secret Clinical Strength for $8 a stick.</li>
            <li> but it may only be because I am pregnant and my senses are all crazy sharp right now.</li>
            <li> Thanks to buzz agent got to try out this new secret and have to say it works well.</li>
            <li> I accidentally dropped this product on my floor and the whole top shattered which was a little disappointing because now I can not use up the rest.</li>
            <li> With this clear gel it left no marks on my black shirt</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get to try this as a promotion from the Secret brand.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be given a sample from secret and im</li>
            <li> Secret claims this deodorant dries quickly, leaves no white marks and lasts for 48 hours.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it looks like this gel just isn&#x27;t strong enough for me.</li>
            <li> It took a little while to dry, a little goes a long way, but so worth it to not have to worry!</li>
            <li> I used to be a huge proponent of invisible solids (which I generally over applied and occasionally reapplied), but I&#x27;ve decided that I&#x27;m switching over to the single click and swipe of Secret Outlast!</li>
            <li> I order this one all the time...goes on clear and stays put without leaving a residue on dark clothing.</li>
            <li> dries so fast no more holding your hand&#x27;s over your head in front of a fan for 5 min.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have much luck with gels, but this doesnt leave you feeling sticky like some do.</li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time and actually works for me.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who needs long lasting protection and does not like to reapply throughout the day.</li>
            <li> As for it being a gel I feel may not last as long</li>
            <li> Really a long lasting Fragrance and protection.</li>
            <li> I don’t know why some people mentioned that it not last long?</li>
            <li> I don’t think the Gel in the stick would last long.  </li>
            <li> I work out on a daily basis, and this deodorant lasts for the long haul, through my workout and after when I am running around and can&#x27;t freshen up quite yet.  </li>
            <li> Does the job perfectly, last all day long.</li>
            <li> Gives long lasting protection whether working out or just going about</li>
            <li> was the true test and where I am now sold on the Secret Outlast and will buy and use it from now on.  </li>
            <li> I am a tried and true Secret Antiperspirant user and have been for years.  </li>
            <li> Network**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am someone who is generally skeptical of new deodorants because I have had so many problems with them in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this for those on the go, that need long-term protection, and no more white streaks on shirts!</li>
            <li> For everyday wear, this is my new go to product.</li>
            <li> For so so very long I&#x27;ve had issues with the dreaded white marks.</li>
            <li> and i couldnt wait to put it on, but it didnt last very long</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t and not last very long which this did.  </li>
            <li> Third, it controls odor for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically use clear gel deodorants, because I don&#x27;t like the way my skin feels wet/cold after applying it.</li>
            <li> All I wanted was a deodorant that could keep me dry and odor free for at least half the day.</li>
            <li> To my surprise it did not leave any &#x27;White&#x27; marks on my dress and kept me dry throughout the night of dancing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s staying power last for days (I was admitted to the hospital and remained after surgery for days with no shower) without odor and kept me dry.</li>
            <li> I recently received a free sample of secret outlast clear gel thanks to secret!</li>
            <li> but it never really actually felt dry for a while.  </li>
            <li> no wetness just dry and solid protection.</li>
            <li> If only it would dry faster....</li>
            <li> So I will be switching to gel and continue using that to help me stay dry, especially during the summer.</li>
            <li> I have found that I NEED TO LET IT DRY before getting dressed, and I would suggest you do the same.  </li>
            <li> my typical busy working mom day.  </li>
            <li> It left me feeling dry with no sticky feeling even after 48 hours of testing this product</li>
            <li> it still left me dry with no discomfort of sweating, as well leaving no trace on my clothing whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I was overjoyed that it went on clear and dried the same way.</li>
            <li> it only felt wet for a second.</li>
            <li> I frequently had issues with my &amp;#34;invisible solid&amp;#34; leaving white marks on my clothes when I changed from my everyday clothes into tigher-fitting tops for working out.</li>
            <li> It surprisingly dried much faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> Secret however worked very well, it dried very fast</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting use to having a deodorant go on feeling a little wet but drys quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I have been able to find recently that does not leave a smell that is unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure I whether it lasts a full 48 hours as I generally shower at least once a day (sometimes twice).</li>
            <li> I just went on a long hike this weekend and it kept me dry the entire time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast come in clear gel formula, doesn&#x27;t live white marks.</li>
            <li> Other roll-ons feel sticky and gross after, but this dries in an instant, and I can&#x27;t even feel it anymore.  </li>
            <li> only BIG con is the fact that I couldn&#x27;t get access to the gel due to a perhaps defective applicator.</li>
            <li> Although it kept me very dry while being outside in 100degree weather, I could not stand the smell after it had been on me for an hour or two.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Invisible Solid keeps you dry, fearless and fresh all day long, and beyond.</li>
            <li> I do admit I was a little surprised at the smell since it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding one that I really like.</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is the same as any other deodorant in this style of container -- settling between uses causes the product to not dispense the same the first time versus the second.  </li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Clear Gel does as it promises; 48hrs protection, Clear swipe, Instant drying time, Unscented, ....</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this product from BzzAgent for free and i was a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> I received a free stick of this deodorant as a promotion from Secret, so I tried it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as &amp;#34;floral&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34; as a lot of deodorants, but I don&#x27;t consider that a problem.</li>
            <li> i have been a long time secret user and am continued to love them with this clear secret.</li>
            <li> and i dont think it lasts as long as it states.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts for long.  </li>
            <li> no extra deodorant comes up while closed even if you do click it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t work long term for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it four stars was because it was wet for a minute or two after applying.</li>
            <li> Then add in the North Carolina heat and humidity and it doesn&#x27;t take long for me to sweat through every deodorant and end up with underarm wetness.</li>
            <li> I tried Secret Outlast thanks to a free sample from Secret.</li>
            <li> But the fact that it stayed sticky for so long I will not purchase.</li>
            <li> Personally I do switch deodorants often and this one seems like a diamond in the rough.</li>
            <li> all day long wether</li>
            <li> Both scented or unscented, the lasting power is beyond what I expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally like gel deodorants they usually leaving me feeling moist and not fully protected.  </li>
            <li> Does not stain your clothing and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I even dread the Winter months because that means long sleeves that I always sweat in.</li>
            <li> You do not smell your body odor for a long time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long</li>
            <li> , I have to wait a long time before I can get dressed.  </li>
            <li> After a few days I was outside in the hot sun for small amounts of time.</li>
            <li> who goes that long between showering anyway.</li>
            <li> First secret outlast last forever even on your sweatist days.</li>
            <li> I hope you keep making this one because I have a difficult time finding something I can use on sensitive skin that really works!</li>
            <li> I tried Secret as part of a campaign thru BZZAgent and I have tried many brands and types in the past years.  </li>
            <li> For years I have been using Secret Powder Fresh deodorant.</li>
            <li> Secret is the golden brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this in the fall and winter so not certain how it would hold up to the heat of summer.  </li>
            <li> One coat of Secret Outlast and you are fresh and dry all day long...</li>
            <li> The new Clear Gel Secret Outlast is no exception.</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel unscented from clearlybetterchallenge for review...</li>
            <li> Half way through the day of my big presentation I was reapplying to keep back ordor and wetness.  </li>
            <li> It was wet one second and dry before I even got my shirt on.</li>
            <li> Finally, I wear a lot of black clothing and again the product lives up the it&#x27;s claim of no marks left on clothing.</li>
            <li> I used it for a run in 95 degree heat while pushing my double jogger and while wearing black, and my pit were the only thing not sweaty and stinky when I was done!  </li>
            <li> No no happened: The gel turned flaky and left WHITE stains on my black dress.</li>
            <li> found that Secret Outlast goes on wet but dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Decided to order this Secret deodorant here just because the price is right</li>
            <li> I stay dry all day long without goopy stuff on my shirts or in my pits.  </li>
            <li> It barely lasts half of my day.</li>
            <li> My under arms stayed dry all day long.  </li>
            <li> and it takes so long to dry</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry all day long in the Florida heat.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s quite tame as far as scents go.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant is different than the traditional white deodorant.  </li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t take long to dry, it doesn&#x27;t go on dry.</li>
            <li> After applying my underarms are immediately dry and stay dry all day long.</li>
            <li> On that note... This deodorant is for those of us who have active lives and plain old regular deodorant wont do the trick.</li>
            <li> There was no wetness seeping through to clothes (which has happened in the past from other gels), or white marks since it&#x27;s clear!</li>
            <li> even after a long workout!  </li>
            <li> Love Secret!!</li>
            <li> With other brands I would have needed to reapply several times throughout the day.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothing like some other deodorants do.</li>
            <li> It works at protecting you from the chance of embarrassment due to odors and unsightly white marks.</li>
            <li> I took this on a camping trip where I was hiking around all day and only went into town for showers every other day.</li>
            <li> (as I have had to with other similar products).  </li>
            <li> but I used long before the bzz kit arrived!</li>
            <li> I am one of those people who buys the same type of deodorant every time, and was actually a little weary about a gel as I had tried one several years ago and didn&#x27;t care for it</li>
            <li> While I like Secret Outlast, wish it worked better for the times when I exercise hard.</li>
            <li> It was still very wet, and then my blouse had a mark and was stuck to my skin for a short time.  </li>
            <li> This product changed my opinion about deodorant gels have change in a positive way thanks to Secret!!</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry even working in a greenhouse at 99 degrees for 5 hours.</li>
            <li> but my pits were dry</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry with no embarrassing odor all day.</li>
            <li> It caused rashes after shaving, didn&#x27;t keep dry, or work as a deodorant.</li>
            <li> this product kept me dry even on the hottest of days at baseball games.</li>
            <li> and I am still dry</li>
            <li> and I can say that I like the way the product goes on and that it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes, but it takes a while to dry and then gets a bit sticky causing any loosening lint from clothing to stick to the area.</li>
            <li> But my underarms were dry</li>
            <li> waiting on your gel deodorant to dry.</li>
            <li> I have never been one to use clear gel; I never liked the way it felt or the &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; marks it left on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry underarms, this has no moisturizer.</li>
            <li> While I still felt dry</li>
            <li> Takes some time to dry, so plan dressing accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product works just as it said it would, dry protection all day.</li>
            <li> IT takes just a minute to dry</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any ladies that struggle with keeping dry it</li>
            <li> I did not feel like it was keeping me dry at all</li>
            <li> I do wait to put a shirt on until dry.  </li>
            <li> I remember it being kinda sticky and took quite a while to dry after putting it on</li>
            <li> your looking for a deodorant to keep you dry and oder</li>
            <li> After concluding my walk, I can report that while my body was drenched in sweat, my underarms were dry as can be with no odor.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave me 100% dry</li>
            <li> It dries seconds after application and keeps you dry all day.</li>
            <li> It does take a minute or so to dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; so you will want to let it dry some before getting dressed.</li>
            <li> and it takes about a minute to dry.  </li>
            <li> All gels I have tried before this were so sticky and never seemed to dry.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars, except the deodorant did not keep my armpits completely dry.</li>
            <li> : Didn&#x27;t keep me dry</li>
            <li> the fact that I can put this on after my shower, let it dry</li>
            <li> If it would dry faster upon application I would buy this all the time.  </li>
            <li> Even being about and about today in the 80s again, my shirt is dry.  </li>
            <li> It takes a couple minutes for the gel to dry</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m dry morning till night with no worries.</li>
            <li> I was going to wait to let it dry</li>
            <li> I was dry..</li>
            <li> This formula works for me, and my arms have been dry.</li>
            <li> I let it dry for a minute before getting dressed, and if it&#x27;s humid</li>
            <li> problem I have with the gel, is that it did not keep me dry.</li>
            <li> I have always used secret clinical since it was the only thing that would really help me, until I received this.  </li>
            <li> I have had such trouble finding a deodorant that would work well for me and last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> it applies clear and similar to gel but less heavy feel to it.</li>
            <li> I recently had a chance to test this product thanks to a promotional brand from Secret and BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> When playing with my children outside I did not have to worry having to  about change my shirt from being to active from the body odor smell.</li>
            <li> This product is clear and leaves little to no marks!  </li>
            <li> This product is clear and leaves little to no marks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to clinical for working out hard and the Outlast for normal days.</li>
            <li> Now I have 100% switched sides, this deodorant is AMAZING, yes its a little wet and cold when you put it on</li>
            <li> My only (very slight) complaint is that it&#x27;s a little harsh on my sensitive skin, but the benefits are worth it.</li>
            <li> To limit the wet feeling while I was performing other tasks, I tried to apply this as last-minute in the dressing process as possible.</li>
            <li> so I was quite surprised when I was thinking about the past 5 days&#x27; experience</li>
            <li> I used to apply all kinds of deodorants but almost all of them were either ruin my dress with white marks or ruins my perfume with their fragrance.</li>
            <li> but actually steaks on dark clothes.</li>
            <li> Even though I am a natural products person, I might buy a small size of this for my purse or car or travel kit.</li>
            <li> It gets hot out in the sun while digging in the dirt and secret managed to solve my dilemma.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately when this came in, I couldn&#x27;t get the full effect to know whether  this would pass the test.</li>
            <li> I tried to go natural; those products failed in ways that I couldn&#x27;t tolerate in my personal and professional life.  </li>
            <li> One minor note (not really a critique):</li>
            <li> It does have a very faint smell, but it&#x27;s the faintest and most tolerable</li>
            <li> and finally you get it open and the deodorant spills every where AWFUL PACKAGING product might be good but</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel deodorant from BzzAgent and have been using it for the past few days.</li>
            <li> On the way home, I backed down the dial, so that there was extra head space under the applicator, which did help a bit.  </li>
            <li> Thumbs down on odor control and that is a big need...</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to twist anything back down.</li>
            <li> It was definitely something I will buy again down the road.</li>
            <li> It definitely K.O.-ed all the other deodorants I have used in the pass!</li>
            <li> so when I tried this, my hopes were not high.</li>
            <li> my fav deodorant, no white powder to mess my tees, just keeps me dry and odor-free.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve only used this product in the cooler months, I have used other Secret products and they work really well.</li>
            <li> The product has a new formula (at least as of my Feb-2015 order).  </li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t smell bad for 5 days straight!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all most impossible to find a deodorant that is unscented.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The aroma of the deodorant however, is slightly overbearing for my regular T-shirt</li>
            <li> I’ve only used it about 3 times and its almost half way gone.  </li>
            <li> I was actually doing a small review for a different product review company</li>
            <li> , there was no particular smell and</li>
            <li> does (which I&#x27;d same company and says black dress approved</li>
            <li> I could wear my black shirt without having white spots.</li>
            <li> Also to my surprise, there were no white marks on my black dress.</li>
            <li> day later I wore a black, sleeveless dress.</li>
            <li> Comparable to any other deodorant with same active ingredient.</li>
            <li> my days are long and this product held up under my extreme pressure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various clinical strength deodorants, and I was never satisfied -- I was always left with wet marks under my arms either through heat or sweat.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise no clear advantage over other deodorants.</li>
            <li> Goes on a little cold but dries quickly and clear.</li>
            <li> I have used the blow dryer on a low setting to speed up the drying process and it takes just a few seconds for dry time.</li>
            <li> However, It did hold up well in comparison to other clear deodorants I have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used gels a long time ago but have never been crazy about them because they took a long time to dry and stung after applying to freshly shaved pits.</li>
            <li> Secret, you&#x27;ve got a new friend in me!!</li>
            <li> Even after working out I did not have odor, and only a little sweat.</li>
            <li> I still felt dry and could not smell anything other than the scent of the deodorant.</li>
            <li> Like other gels, it goes on and takes forever to dry</li>
            <li> I am not thrilled with this but thank you secret for the free trial size sample.</li>
            <li> Therefore I give Secret Outlast Clear Gel Antiperspirant and Deodorant a solid 5 on a scale of 1 - 10.</li>
            <li> I received a promotional sample of Secret Outlast Unscented Women&#x27;s Clear Gel free of charge, and I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> I think so far I have positives and a few negatives for the Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant.</li>
            <li> I prefer gel deodorants because I do not like the chunky white sticks – they create stains and making for a painfully embarrassing experience when you left your arms – no one wants to see the white stuff!</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter Becca tried out Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant on Thursday for cheer-leading practice.</li>
            <li> I finally found it is Secret Outlast® Clear Gel.</li>
            <li> I was recently in my sister&#x27;s wedding and brought my Secret Outlast Clear Gel (SOCG) that I received through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve shied away from gel formulas because they felt wet and sticky, and didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I purchased Secret Outlast Clear Gel Unscented Antiperspirant and Deodorant because I was looking for a antiperspirant/deodorant that wouldn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast Clear Gel to try in a recent campaign on Bzzagent!  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Secret outlast clear gel deodorant since I received it last week.</li>
            <li> I am a bzzagent and recently received the Secret Outlast Clear Gel Antiperspirant to try.  </li>
            <li> and I really like this Secret Outlast deodorant.</li>
            <li> Days where not much was happening</li>
            <li> Total waste of money, I&#x27;m going to toss it in the bin.</li>
            <li> I used to think that the gel just made my armpits wet</li>
            <li> I will say that my shirt did get some underarm wet spots-</li>
            <li> However even though I had wet spots</li>
            <li> I spent the day doing yard work, exercising, and even some outdoor yoga.</li>
            <li> I can say that Secret Outlast really does provide protection for two days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Am I supposed to congratulate myself that only a few dollars were lost&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> it really kept the secret well.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that it would leave a wet feeling, but no, not at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast is advertised as a fast drying product without any residue that will provide wetness and odor protection for up to 48 hours.</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell I have some odor issues going on within just a few hours of wearing this product.</li>
            <li> It also leave a wet sticky feel once I apply it.</li>
            <li> I felt like this was still wet, even 10 minutes after I put it on.</li>
            <li> Lasted longer than I expected, but I still needed to use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> This works really well, and I haven&#x27;t broken out in hives.</li>
            <li> I only use 1-2 clicks) is the promoted \\&quot;few seconds\\&quot; drying time...</li>
            <li> wet</li>
            <li> wet becuase</li>
            <li> It does go on wet.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Secret</li>
            <li> Thanks BzzAgent and Secret for giving me the opportunity to review this product.</li>
            <li> It always felt sticky or wet and I just didn&#x27;t feel like it did anything.</li>
            <li> Thanks to secret and Bzzagents</li>
            <li> no marks on my darker clothes, and you don&#x27;t feel wet or sticky under the arms like one would imagine.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the sample for a few weeks and the product itself seems to last</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave any white messy residue like you might thing</li>
            <li> With this product I put it to the test I went camping and the harder</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it at the beach and even after getting wet</li>
            <li> and I spent the day shopping, A lot.</li>
            <li> that is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> This product goes on wet and stays sticky all day.</li>
            <li> This deodorant/antiperspirant works well, but it goes on so wet</li>
            <li> Second, it does not leave any gummy residue on my skin after a few hours of wear.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling wet or sticky.</li>

            <li> Secret Outlast really works.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the wet gel.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like feeling wet under there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really 48 hour protection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m strictly a Secret Clinical Strength Invisible Solid kinda gal, but I was pleasantly surprised by the SOCG.  </li>
            <li> After it dried I had no issues and the mark dried completely as well (no stain on the blouse)</li>
            <li> and I really hate how most deodorant leaves white marks on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> I have a very busy, active job and lately, I had noticed my deoderant was not holding up its end of the bargain by the end of the day</li>
            <li> (that is my underarms are dry!!)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of my past with trying it, but it really does go on completely clear, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on your clothes, and keeps you dry!  </li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s an hour at the gym or two hours of high intensity interval training Secret Outlast has kept me dry!</li>
            <li> If I was traveling via air, I would not use Secret Clear Gel, as I normally carry on my bag, and Secret Gel would be part of my liquid allotment, while the solid is not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used Secret solid for a long time, but always thought that the clear gel was too messy.</li>
            <li> which cuts down on dry time</li>
            <li> You could also, ahem, go #2 and let it dry whilst sitting down.  </li>
            <li> I decided to purchase secret outlast clear gel deodorant instead  of  my usual go to  clear stick brand of deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Secret Outlast may be my new go-to antiperspirant!</li>
            <li> This product was cold going on but dried quickly on application with no white marks and no need to reapply throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I will continue using other Secret product, just not this particular one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast Clear Gel to try in a recent campaign on BzzagentI have never used secret deodorant before, but this one really surprised me.</li>
            <li> I received this product as part of the BzzAgent campaign, actually I was somewhat skeptical about trying a new deoderant.</li>
            <li> It does go on wet, and takes a few minutes to dry, but it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky to me.  </li>
            <li> I do not have the time, nor do I want to wait 10 minutes for the Secret Outlast to dry completely before I can dress.  </li>
            <li> I did not need that much to experiment with the product from previous use of Secret deodorant</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first since I haven&#x27;t used a clear gel since Jr High school and usually any brand other than Dove makes my arm pits break out in an unattractive and uncomfortable rash but</li>
            <li> It was a little cold going on but dried very quickly and kept me dry all day.  </li>
            <li> It goes on clear and clean, doesn&#x27;t result in any cruddy residue buildup in my armpit hair, and it keeps me dry and odor-free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty stinky gal - sorry dudes</li>
            <li> Before I felt like I was constantly reapplying and that is now a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> I have been using men&#x27;s deodorant for year&#x27;s due to an inability to find a deodorant that works in a woman&#x27;s brand.  </li>
            <li> but I also work a full-time job that it is really extremely stressful since I work for claims.</li>
            <li> with other long-lasting antiperspirants deodorants I applied mine at night before bed.</li>
            <li> and it outlasted all other deodorants that we tried.</li>
            <li> I switched back to a solid deodorant and it took at least 3 days for the pain to go away!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t overpowering like a lot of the other scents.</li>
            <li> However, I did accumulate moisture under my under arms that I do not experience with other deodorants when working in the yard.</li>
            <li> I got to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel thanks to BzzAgent and Secret.</li>
            <li> , it was an uncomfortable feeling, like I had never put anything on in the first place accompanied by a sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> a sharp rap, and a bit of gel appeared.</li>
            <li> With temperatures hovering around 100 degrees, I’ve had the opportunity to test this product in extreme heat conditions.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not particularly hot.</li>
            <li> so no more white marks for me</li>
            <li> It leaves no white marks and is clean,leaves you without an odor even if you are a heavy sweater like me!  </li>
            <li> No more white marks on my clothes!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> but I kept getting cysts in my underarm area &amp; the doctor throught it was due to my deodorant clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> They left my underarms feeling wet and sticky, not to mention the embarrassing residue it left behind on my clothes.</li>
            <li> No more white marks!  </li>
            <li> it is not sticky at all, which is a problem i have had with other</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s not uncommon for me to have wet armpits after being outside for just a short period of time.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It did not cause me to have any skin irritations nor did it cause any other skin issues.  </li>
            <li> The problem did not occur at any other time.  </li>
            <li> The dial wouldn&#x27;t budge when turned one way and when turned the other way, it just wound it up until it couldn&#x27;t move anymore</li>
            <li> I will not be using any other deodorant again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant for the past several weeks</li>
            <li> It contains aluminum, which is said to be cancer-causing, and has a bunch of other toxic ingredients in it.  </li>
            <li> the odor protection definately outlasts any other deodorants i&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> It also keeps me well protected longer than the other deodorant I use to use.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works just as well as it claims.</li>
            <li> unscented  due to allergic reaction to every other deodorant</li>
            <li> I had the pleasure to review Secret Outlast Clear Gel deodorant thanks to Secret and bzzagent.</li>
            <li> This product has worked just as well as my other stick deodorant.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Clear Gel is going to keep me dry all Spring and Summer!</li>
            <li> When it is over 100 degrees outside this deodorant does it job of keeping you less wet than usual</li>
            <li> When the opportunity came up to review new Secret Outlast</li>
            <li> I am already a fan of the Secret brand so trying this new version wasn&#x27;t a stretch for me.</li>
            <li> find I wet less and am protected all day from odor.</li>
            <li> The cold goes away quickly</li>
            <li> DID YOU THINK SECRET WOMENS FAVORITE BRAND OF DEODORANT/ANTIPERSPERANT WOULD FAIL.</li>
            <li> Secret outlast left  no white marks one clothes.</li>
            <li> I tend to sweat a lot and am active all day with 3 kiddos</li>
            <li> I had tried different powders of different brands, and I had tried the Secret clinical strength.</li>
            <li> active ingredient listed on this page</li>
            <li> I lead an active lifestyle and don&#x27;t want something to mask the scent.</li>
            <li> I did some research on the active ingredient that helps with perspiration — is a type of metal (aluminum).</li>
            <li> No white residue left behind.</li>
            <li> As an active mom and wife I need a deodorant that works.</li>
            <li> Which, oddly enough was a different secret deodorant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I may not have totally replaced my go to brand but secret will definitely be added in .</li>
            <li> No having to reapply every few hours, and no white marks on my black running clothes!</li>
            <li> The Secret Outlast really surprised me!</li>
            <li> Yay no more white marks on my black work shirts</li>
            <li> I made this purchase because i&#x27;ve recently switched to Secret&#x27;s PH balanced invisible solid late last year.</li>
            <li> I recently wore a black sleeveless dress and as promised the Secret Outlast Gel did not leave white marks on my dress.  </li>
            <li> Put it on (a little goes a long way) and, shirtless, brush your teeth or do your hair or something that raises your arms just a little for a minute or so.  </li>
            <li> I carefully twist just a little bit out and applied it to my underarm.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t is that it&#x27;s hard to wach off.</li>
            <li> It definitely keeps up with how hard I work.</li>
            <li> You know when you need to skip the shower, but you&#x27;ve been working hard and then that &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34; creeps in the next day....</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel its long lasting for tough workouts or being in the sun all day</li>
            <li> It does get a little sticky after awhile if I am super active, but it&#x27;s not often since it&#x27;s getting cold out around here.</li>
            <li> so I could use it when first opening it up, I actually began to think I got a bad one</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed with the product as my past experience with Secret has been great.</li>
            <li> Thanks again Secret!</li>
            <li> the past, I&#x27;ve tried Secret deodorant and for whatever reason, it didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> i received a sample of secret outlast clear gel to experience and review.  </li>
            <li> the Secret Outlast Clear Gel did control my underarm wetness.</li>
            <li> I received Secret&#x27;s Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant as part of a promotion from the company and just have to get the word out -</li>
            <li> I was Leary about trying Secret Outlast Womens Clear Gel</li>
            <li> Thanks Secret!</li>
            <li> That would be my only complaint that I would have chosen another scent because it smelled to me like mens deodorant.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use my Secret oulast clear gel until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> The Secret Outlast Women&#x27;s Clear Gel met my expectations also.  </li>
            <li> Years ago I tried one of Secret&#x27;s clear gel deodorants and didn&#x27;t care for it at all.</li>
            <li> I received my secret outlast clear gel from Bzzagent</li>
            <li> I walk an average of 1-2 miles per day.</li>
            <li> The product does seem to last at least overnight.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product is that I don&#x27;t like the scent.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of the Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant through BZZagent.</li>
            <li> Thanks Secret for helping me outlast the heat!</li>
            <li> I got the Secret Outlast Clear Gel (Lavender) parcel from BzzAgent on Monday</li>
            <li> Thanks Secret and Bzzagent!</li>
            <li> I put the Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant through the ringer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to replace my stick deodorant with the Secret Outlast Clear Gel from now on.  </li>
            <li> Finding another outfit is never fun.  </li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant to try from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> No worries when I wear my secret outlast clear gel.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t  use anything else except  secret clear gel</li>
            <li> This goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind when it dries.</li>
            <li> I woke up late the 2nd day</li>
            <li> BzzAgent sent me a sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel Antiperspirant / Deodorant to sample and review.</li>
            <li> Im a busy young mom, and this Secret deoderant keeps my sweaty mom pits a secret too.</li>
            <li> And wow secret you made a believer not to mention a customer out of me.</li>
            <li> Secret outlast far surpassed that.</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotion from Secret and as a person with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast didn&#x27;t stand a chance of keeping me completely dry for an entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My fault for twisting too far up, of course, but sometimes the stick was rather dry making the application process difficult.</li>
            <li> But with the Secret Outlast Clear Gel, I didn&#x27;t smell a slight order at all...</li>
            <li> At gym time I could feel the drops of sweat coming down from my underarm area.  </li>
            <li> It lasted all day from getting dressed in the morning until I laid down that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have a little sting if you just shaved, im assuming due to the alcohol in it</li>
            <li> This deoderant does not clash with any other scents you may want to wear!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately their wasn&#x27;t much Secret Outlast Clear deodorant in the sample i was provided, i only had enough to use for two days.</li>
            <li> It provides me with hours of protection and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any white marks which numerous deodorant have that I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I was already a big fan of Secret Deodorant having used their Clinical Strength formula for the past several years.  </li>
            <li> As a long time user of Secret solid I am always skeptical of new brands or formulas, but this one didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> So I was a bit skeptical when I heard of the new Secret Outlast clear gel.</li>
            <li> I always use Secret Solid deoderants, but wanted to try this new Secret Outlast Gel...</li>
            <li> I went out dancing for a friends 50th birthday party and wore a black dress.</li>
            <li> not even the black</li>
            <li> I DID NOT WEAR A BLACK BLOUSE</li>
            <li> I threw it out before I was even half way through the product.</li>
            <li> The price is considerably less than stores, and unscented is a plus for me too.</li>
            <li> and it would be less sticky?  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed I don&#x27;t have any of the skin irritation I was getting with the typical deodorant either.</li>
            <li> I can put on black and not have deodorant on my clothing.  </li>
            <li> I can wear black with no problem</li>
            <li> I wore a black sleeveless shirt</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of black</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t worry about streaks on my black shirt.</li>
            <li> Do not get me wrong, this is a decent deodorant.</li>
            <li> Whether I was baking in a hot kitchen, working out at the gym or stressing over a deadline, Secret&#x27;s Clear Gel didn&#x27;t fail me!</li>
            <li> It worked well even during my morning spin class and weekly softball games where other deodorants I have used in the past could not keep up with my active lifestyle.</li>
            <li> Works for a long time and seems to kick in when sweating or working hard.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hot-natured gal prone to sweat, and I&#x27;m also very active.</li>
            <li> Cue the first day I used this... 90 degrees out, muggy...</li>
            <li> It also does not leave a mess on clothing.</li>
            <li> I have used gels in the past and they always seems to leave my arm pits sticky and my clothing wet.</li>
            <li> He put his regular deodorant under one arm and the Secret Outlast under the other.</li>
            <li> It has a very faint scent, but it just smells fresh.</li>
            <li> I was originally not impressed with any other clear gels I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks now and it has not let me down.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that the dial at the bottom which is where you twist the gel up is really tight</li>
            <li> and it just kept turning until it reached a tension too tight to move.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying a new deodorant</li>
            <li> I have always struggled with wet armpit stains and the past few days</li>
            <li> have tried clear deodorants in the past and was never happy.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about 48 hour really lasting that long...</li>
            <li> Off and on I have tried gel deodorants with little luck of it protecting me all day.</li>
            <li> Usually, I would hold my arms up and literally fan it with the other hand, not with this.</li>
            <li> Just a little damp when I used it</li>
            <li> Not fun!</li>
            <li> The 0.5oz sample lasted me a little over three weeks using it once or twice a day depending on outings.</li>
            <li> I even went swimming with my little ones and when I got out</li>
            <li> it was like little beads of this deodorant on my armpits.</li>
            <li> it did get a little sticky on the skin.  </li>
            <li> but you still need to allow a little time for drying before you put your clothing on.  </li>
            <li> I usually would not choose a gel type, due to the residue and &amp;#34;wetness&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve felt with those types deodorants.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about using a gel</li>
            <li> money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using secret clinical strength for a while because brands like BAN and Lady Mitchum were not enough to help cover my body odor for longer than half a day.</li>
            <li> Although it says unscented, there is a slight fragrance to it albeit very slight and not at all noticeable once it</li>
            <li> a little heavy</li>
            <li> When it comes to gels, I wish they dried a little faster.</li>
            <li> Compared to Secret&#x27;s other products, this one contains 16% aluminum something or other rather than 19% in some of their other products.</li>
            <li> Hands down a leader in it&#x27;s industry!</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry all day long, dries quickly and does not leave those annoying marks on your clothes!</li>
            <li> I had a sticky sensation after a hard day at work, in reality the sticky sensation would prevent me from purchasing Secret Outlast Clear Gel.</li>
            <li> I only gave 4 stars because I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple of days and since the weather is cold now</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when trying this clear deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Hate being out of the softball field and having these huge sweat marks under my arm pits.</li>
            <li> I was never big on secret products</li>
            <li> Thank you Secret for making such a quality product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever tried, but without the white residue those leave behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now for a few weeks</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get an allergic reaction, but I smelled like sweat everyday.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Gel will now be a regular in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> Guess what -- the Secret Outlast kept me from smelling like I was wearing the same clothes for 3 days and hadn&#x27;t had a shower.  </li>
            <li> Now I only wish Secret Outlast made a toothpaste...</li>
            <li> So I put it to the test for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too messy.</li>
            <li> I recently received a sample from Secret to test and review.</li>
            <li> Clinical strength came out a few years ago and after I tried it, I swore I would never try another &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This week I am leaving for a conference where I know no one and have never been so I will be putting Secret Outlast to the extensive test!</li>
            <li> After using it for the last couple of weeks, I have to say that I&#x27;m making the switch to Secret Outlast.</li>
            <li> I already like the secret brand, but I am just not big on these gel deodorants.</li>
            <li> I tried it out a few times before writing this to make ssure my review was up to par.</li>
            <li> Also, I must say that I am a few years into menopause</li>
            <li> and I did for a few days</li>
            <li> I just received a sample from bzzzagent and I will only purchase secret outlast from now on.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t smell anything weird (like old deodorant) while i&#x27;m at the gym.</li>
            <li> Completing everyday activities for a few hours, and the deoderizer was not longer doing its job.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for...an unscented gel that wasn&#x27;t too thin, and was actually UNSCENTED.</li>
            <li> I was worried that it would be sticky and messy.  </li>
            <li> one thing I can credit Secret with is that I did not end up with white marks on my clothing or my skin.</li>
            <li> I was a firm believer in the clinical strength</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I was hooked.</li>
            <li> I am usually a heavy sweater</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of gel deodorants for a few reasons:  </li>
            <li> I was amazed that the Secret Outlast kept me protected even into this next day.  </li>
            <li> Since I was a teen, Secret has been my go-to deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used secret for years and will continue if I can find the invisible solid.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly it dried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few hours and still no wetness</li>
            <li> so when I joined the Buzz Agent campaign for the secret outlast I decided that I would have an open mind.</li>
            <li> feel the gel left behind, but it seemed to go away after it dried.</li>
            <li> a few years ago, I stole some of my wife&#x27;s Secret gel, and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually not a huge fan of using the gel ones because I&#x27;ve used one before that</li>
            <li> almost half the price the drug store is charging!  </li>
            <li> I gave it the black dress test and it PASSED!</li>
            <li> I can hardly count the number of times in the past that I have twisted up a solid stick deodorant only to have the stick break off.</li>
            <li> Not only did it not feel sticky or leave disgusting white marks, but it actually works  all day long!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a part of BzzAgent, and when they invited me to try out a small sample of Secret outlast, thanks to Secret...</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Secret Antiperspirant/deodorant, but usually purchase in the solid form.</li>
            <li> Let me state for the record, that Secret is the only brand of deodorant that I have been using for the past 20 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this deodorant free from Secret, and I must say I was very skeptical about \\&quot;gel\\&quot; deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Usually with Dove I can smell my self a little even after using it...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cold - especially in the winter, they take a while to not feel wet - slowing me down when I&#x27;m rushing to get out the door in the morning, and the biggest one - in my past experience they just didn&#x27;t work as well at preventing wetness and odor as stick deodorants.  </li>
            <li> It has been hot as balls and I must say, by the end of the day was shocked that I did not smell of death.</li>
            <li> have been a fan of Secret for a long time, so when I was offered the chance to review this product I jumped at the chance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Secret deodorant girl for a long time.</li>
            <li> When I received this stick in my kit, I was a little skeptical, but because I was out of clinical strength that day, this was my only option.</li>
            <li> My daughter is an athlete and it&#x27;s important not to show you sweat or smell bad during and after the game.  </li>
            <li> I personally do not like the cold wet sticky feel of the gel.</li>
            <li> Also, I am not a great fan of gel deodorants, so this is a personal negative for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always felt that Secret has a formula that doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate your skin.  </li>
            <li> I generally use clinical formulas, but holy cow are they expensive!</li>
            <li> I switched to the Secret brand a few couple of years ago when my other deodorant stopped working.</li>
            <li> Third, this stuff is tough!  </li>
            <li> and have absolutely no under arm odor!!!!</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of time to get out of the container the first time which can be annoying.</li>
            <li> I normally do Not wear gel deodorant because I hate that it takes so long to dry and stays sticky after.</li>
            <li> In addition, while I still do sweat pretty profusely, this definitely helps keep those nasty pit stains at bay...</li>
            <li> I was a suave girl in the past</li>
            <li> but no more.  </li>
            <li> about 2  miles usually 3 times a week  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product actually lasting over 48 hours but on a trip to Europe from door to door 18 hours, the deodorant worked.</li>
            <li> I was not sure how I was going to like a gel as I have never used one before.  </li>
            <li> It will save me tons of money in the future using Outlast instead of an expensive clinical strength deodorant.</li>
            <li> Like that it&#x27;s not white, but in sweaty conditions, it fails for me.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>
            <li> /&gt;First time trying it, I was skeptical because I thought it would be very similar to Clinical Strength.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually sweat.</li>
            <li> but I was not able to review that scent.</li>
            <li> and I usually don&#x27;t use a gel deodorant.</li>
            <li> and if I get too lazy just one.</li>
            <li> I usually find gel deodorants to be sticky which</li>
            <li> If your like me and you dont like  buying a deodorant that fails and don&#x27;t last .</li>
            <li> I usually use stick</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually even wear deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with excessive sweating and odor.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the gel deodorants can be rather messy and this was not at all!  </li>
            <li> In addition to the problems I have had in the past I was worried about the fact that this one is a gel.  </li>
            <li> It allows the user to have confidence that this product will protect them from excessive sweating and order.</li>
            <li> I usually go for the floral/fruity scents because I feel like &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scents always smelled like baby powder.</li>
            <li> However, that small problem has not kept me from using this product.</li>
            <li> At 1st I was not sure because it was a gel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the 48 hour odor protection claim but.</li>
            <li> Well, stink no more.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to find at the local stores for some reason.</li>
            <li> it is thick and gloppy almost and take a lil spell to dry, it&#x27;s even worse if you&#x27;ve just taken a shower.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using this deodorant as in the past Secret hasn&#x27;t been my go to brand, however I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I have tried other secret products in the past and they just didn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the other scented forms and continue to purchase Secret Outlast as my go-to deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this every day for a week now and have to say there is a noticeable difference in this for me, even compared to other Secret Products that weren&#x27;t working well for me.</li>
            <li> Usually when I try new deodorants I usually get a really bad rash.  </li>
            <li> I tried Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant a bit skeptical of what I was going to experience.</li>
            <li> I am usually nit a big fan if gel formulas because they tend to feel a little nasty, but with Secret it went on a bit wet and dried almost instantly!</li>
            <li> I usually have a hard time finding a deodorant that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the past I has sweat a lot, but when I used the Secret Outlast I sweat considerably less and did not have BO.</li>
            <li> It blocks bad odors for up to 48 hours which makes it different from other competiting brands</li>
            <li> Having a wet feeling until the deodorant sets is not ideal.</li>
            <li> Secret outlast has dropped my showers down to 2</li>
            <li> get to work and feel horrible, but YET my armpits were fine.</li>
            <li> but I always have a hard time finding it in an unscented formula.</li>
            <li> and you can hardly notice it is there.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> Even though it is lot all natural, it is not all that bad for you.</li>
            <li> I had to substitute with baby powder at least one day after shaving to help prevent that from happening.  </li>
            <li> I was completely skeptical of a gel-type going on wet and feeling that way throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The one thing that is disappointing is this does not last all day, half-way through the day</li>
            <li> Deoderant gets forgotten at least once a week.</li>
            <li> When you change your shirt even with the clear solids, it is WHITE, and that shirt is dirty no matter what now!!!!</li>
            <li> Overall Secret Outlast lives up to the Secret name!</li>
            <li> But after applying it stayed sticky for at least 3 hours.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked gels before but this one doesn&#x27;t smear or wear off.</li>
            <li> See, I work as a Medical assistant in a busy doctor&#x27;s office and this also means I have to run around from room to room and often get insanely overheated.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d at least give it a chance.  </li>
            <li> I had used some several years back and hated it.  </li>
            <li> But I thought I ought to at least give it a chance, eh?</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of clear/wet products, but this one does not leave that icky feeling in your armpits.</li>
            <li> biggest complaint about this product is the residue it leaves.  </li>
            <li> Works as it should at least no one has complained about any odors on me.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using secret outlast for a few weeks and a BZZagent...</li>
            <li> The new formula is wetter and sticker :(</li>
            <li> No more!  </li>
            <li> i was given this product as part of a bzz agent review and i was skeptical because my past experience with gel deodorant was that it was cold and gooey, however this product surprised me.</li>
            <li> no more deodorant streaks on my clothes!</li>
            <li> unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;outlast&amp;#34; other deodorants.</li>
            <li> The deodorant provided protection for those two days without failure.</li>
            <li> Since switching to Secret Unscented, no more problems.</li>
            <li> I usually use a sold deodorant and hate how they always seem to leave behind a white mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, and it&#x27;s expensive enough for me to reduce my review by a star.</li>
            <li> Seriously my husband ran out of deodorant</li>
            <li> However, I appreciate not having to chase a half a block of broken deodorant block across the bathroom floor!</li>
            <li> I am seriously amazed with this product.</li>
            <li> Seriously, she LOVES this product without question.</li>
            <li> and I had to let it dry before putting clothes on because that feeling makes me crazy</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast allowed me to work and play hard without worring about sweat and odors.</li>
            <li> only bad thing I have to say about this product is the price.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t leave any ugly white marks on my clothes either.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Once you put it on you will notice it feels wet and cold</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t cake up or leave those ugly white marks on clothing or bedding.  </li>
            <li> I had those cold, tacky underams and a wet shirt by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll replace my usual Secret product with the Unscented Secret Outlast from now on.</li>
            <li> I did not have to reapply deodorant throughout my day, which when you are busy can be annoying.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and I hate perfumed deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I usually use solid and hate when it breaks off.  </li>
            <li> I am CERTAIN you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical Secret Outlast would work...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find!  </li>
            <li> I live in Texas and need something that can withstand the brutal Texas summer heat.</li>
            <li> it takes at least 20-30 seconds!  </li>
            <li> I had at least 24 hour protection!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very hard to wash off and leave residue on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> , there remains a bit of a dry time, but it didn&#x27;t seem as bad as I remembered it to be.  </li>
            <li> I am very skeptical of gel deoderants, haven&#x27;t used them in years due to the sticky gooey feeling.</li>
            <li> I mean a ton!</li>
            <li> Besides, it is sad to buy a dress and lose it after just one or a couple times because of deodorant&#x27;s white marks and bad smell because of sweat.</li>
            <li> Only downfall I&#x27;ve found is that it feels cold when I put it on after the shower on cold days.</li>
            <li> I have used Secret over the years</li>
            <li> I got a sample of Secret Outlast from Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> (I received a sample through a Secret promotion)</li>
            <li> I’ve been using Secret Outlast Gel for two weeks now</li>
            <li> I have always been a Secret user.  </li>
            <li> so I was not expecting to like it when I received it from the secret to review.</li>
            <li> In desperation he tried my secret.  </li>
            <li> but I just prefer Secret Clinical Strength</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of Secret Outlast Gel Deodorant by BzzAgent in return for a test of the product and review.</li>
            <li> I like the brand products of secret</li>
            <li> from Secret and was eager to try the product out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Secret for years, but I never buy gel because it sounds sticky and messy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for Secret clinical and when I found it, it was quite spendy</li>
            <li> I have been a Secret user now for 34 years.  </li>
            <li> With Secret Outlast Gel the fear is gone.</li>
            <li> Once again Secret has outdone itself..</li>
            <li> As a faithful Secret deodorant user, I received  a sample from BzzAgent.com.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time working out and this Secret, held up.</li>
            <li> Secret outlast is a keeper, that&#x27;s for sure!&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> That was until I tried Secret outlast.</li>
            <li> I like Secret products and the Secret Outlast</li>
            <li> I figured I would give Secret outlast a try.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> and I walked away a Secret believer.</li>
            <li> #34;ooh-la-lavender&amp;#34; from Secret through BzzAgent</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast didn&#x27;t outlast my mom perspiration.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice any smell throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend secret to any one of my friends.</li>
            <li> No white crap.</li>
            <li> I will however continue to use Secret deodorant until the day I pass this earth.</li>
            <li> Secret outlast gel that is ..</li>
            <li> I never once had any wetness while using Secret Outlast.  </li>
            <li> I put the Secret Outlast on today, then waited 2 or 3 minutes and had to get dressed.  </li>
            <li> Thank you secret for letting try and review your product through Bzz Agent</li>
            <li> Secret is what my mom used to wear, with rather dismal results.  </li>
            <li> I was offered to try this Secret Outlast 48 hour deodorant as a Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> But when I sweat I don&#x27;t have a scent if I put on my Secret Outlast.</li>
            <li> I was sent this Secret Outlast Gel as a trial from the Secret company and BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> Secret Outlast leaves no marks at all....ever.</li>
            <li> I received it from as a promotion  from  secret</li>
            <li> This product of Secret is aces with my daughter.</li>
            <li> I received my Secret Outlast as a product review for BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> Secret Outlast works throughout the day without the need for reapplication.</li>
            <li> I received this deodorant from buzz campaign from Secret.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this from Bzzagent and Secret for a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be sticking with Secret Outlast from now on.</li>
            <li> I do use Secret deodorants but this one will not be purchased again.</li>
            <li> Thank you bzzagent and Secret for letting me try this product.</li>
            <li> I got this product to test from secret,  although I don&#x27;t know if it lasts 48 hours</li>
            <li> I received my Secret Outlast via a promotion with Secret.</li>
            <li> and when i used the product in the past i hated that wet feeling.</li>
            <li> I am a heavy sweater and have been buying the very expensive &#x27;Clinical&#x27; deodorants</li>
            <li> Sorry Secret, not this time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not impressed with this formula but would recommend the secret clinical deodorant.</li>
            <li> Very cold and wet, it was so uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> But today I went outside to wash my dog and sweated crazy!!</li>
            <li> For the past month that i&#x27;ve been using this, I haven&#x27;t had any painful cysts.  </li>
            <li> Although I may have looked a bit like a crazy lady during the process, at least I didn&#x27;t smell like one!</li>
            <li> Try it if you want to be fresher &amp; can&#x27;t stand harsh RX&#x27;s!!!!</li>
            <li> A 10 hour shift of heavy lifting and running like mad with no b.o.!  </li>
            <li> I hate to feel sticky under there even if its just a little.  </li>
            <li> and then the weird, sticky feeling after.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate that Secret Outlast is unscented because it allows me to wear the perfume of my choice without clashing scents!</li>
            <li> The Secret&#x27;s out, I have found a replacement - and I am sticking with it!  </li>
            <li> Thank-you Secret!</li>
            <li> This product in the i scented formula is difficult to find in the store</li>
            <li> The one thing i dread about the summer months is wearing sleeveless shirts &amp; having those nasty white marks all over!</li>
            <li> but that didn&#x27;t phase Secret Outlast!</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast!</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was skeptical about the gel.  </li>
            <li> and I can tell you secret outlast works!</li>
            <li> Unscented gel antiperspirant &amp; deoderant is often difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> I am not really impressed by this deodorant at all.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical to try this product since I&#x27;ve been using Degree deodorant all of my life.</li>
            <li> I have used gels in the past, and I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Secret Outlast because it works!</li>
            <li> It turned out - yep, that was the underarm with the Secret!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t know if I will be purchasing this deodorant once I am done with it.</li>
            <li> but now I am switching to the Secret Outlast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve officially made the switch to Secret Outlast!</li>
            <li> I was worried that the gel would be sticky and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> After a couple days of using Secret Outlast though, I changed my mind!</li>
            <li> I must admit I was skeptical of this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially I  was skeptical because I&#x27;m just to invisible solids</li>
            <li> Alas!</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> So I have to reapply and that can be inconvenient.</li>
            <li> When I applied the gel it wasn&#x27;t cold</li>
            <li> I was afraid there would be a problem with wetness being that this was a gel</li>
            <li> If your cold</li>
            <li> I started cringing because it&#x27;s so cold and sticky</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s COLD</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m male and have always hated men&#x27;s deodorant due to the awful smell (the \\&quot;Axe revolution\\&quot; in men&#x27;s products is just AWFUL) --</li>
            <li> Secret, you&#x27;ve done it again!!  </li>
            <li> Ladies and gentlemen, I&#x27;ve been proven wrong!  </li>
            <li> IS VERY DIFFICULT</li>
            <li> a completely worthless, useless product that did nothing that it was supposed to do?</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s impossible to find a men&#x27;s product that&#x27;s unscented, works *</li>
            <li> Notoriously I have bad body odor, but when I use this product theres no worry.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t smell bad</li>
            <li> but I had nothing bad to say</li>
            <li> I never smelled bad and I used the unscented formula.</li>
            <li> Its not to bad but to me</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought it was</li>
            <li> I used to be nervous in parties because I felt bad when I sweat a lots.</li>
            <li> so I am shocked at how well it works.  </li>
            <li> oh my how its cold when you put it on your pits!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed, to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> The turn dial at the bottom is mildly annoying because it&#x27;s a lot of effort to get that &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; noise, but</li>
            <li> i hate it when a deodorant leaves a residue after I shower and this deodorant doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> and I still smelled sweaty at the end of the day which makes me feel nasty and dirty.</li>
            <li> I hate it.  </li>
            <li> I hate deodorants that have scents.  </li>
            <li> but I hate knowing it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> I was shocked!</li>
            <li> I hated having to wait to get dressed for fear that the deodorant would come off on my clothing.</li>
            <li> I hated everything about them</li>
            <li> Moms, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I hate it!</li>
            <li> Worst deodorant ever!</li>
            <li> I was under the worst stress of my life and didn&#x27;t get a shower for 3 days.  </li>
            <li> but then again i cant say its the worst i have ever tried.</li>
            <li> deodorant scents are nasty.</li>
            <li> Lest we not forget how dreadful the subways are.</li>
            <li> It felt so incredibly disgusting when it touched my skin.</li>
            <li> however the price of that is just outrageous!</li>
            <li> Secret rocks!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed!</li>
            <li> No AC. 90+ degree heat and horrible humidity.</li>
            <li> WORST PACKAGING EVER you have to take a knife and hit it and cut it and bang on it</li>
            <li> THIS HAPPENED TO ME twice out of three times buying it, AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL</li>
            <li> I continued without nasty underarm sweating and no odor.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Thanks to buzz agent got to try out this new secret and have to say it works well. I was never big on secret products so I would have not tried it on my own. The gel dries fast after putting it on and it smells really nice too. #getitfree</li>
            <li> I love Secret Outlast Deodorant.  I got to sample this new product from Bzz Agent.  I was very impressed!  One twist of the deodorant provides enough odor and wetness protection for the whole day.  It goes on easy and dries quick.  Also, you get no ugly white marks on your clean shirt.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for awhile now. I love the smell and  the quick dry after putting this product on.  I did notice during the  day my armpits would feel a bit sticky.  Maybe this could be when the protection of this product starts kicking in before you start sweating.  Over all I recommend this product. :)</li>
            <li> I am a stay at home mom and nanny. I also have a passion for gardening and photography. As you can imagine I am always busy and running around. Well, as a member of one2one network, I received a free sample for review and Secret has done it again. The scents are always fresh, I got active fresh, and kept the everyday stink away. It gets hot out in the sun while digging in the dirt and secret managed to solve my dilemma. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is simply because I am not a fan of the gunky gel formula but I can always purchase a solid instead. Thanks again Secret!</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. I&#x27;m a pretty stinky gal - sorry dudes, that&#x27;s just how it is for a lot of us - and I like the way this product holds up. It lasts a whole day and products hardly ever last me a whole day. In addition, while I still do sweat pretty profusely, this definitely helps keep those nasty pit stains at bay...ugh, those are so gross I used to carry an extra shirt around...and now I don&#x27;t have to. it&#x27;s nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only bad thing I have to say about this product is the price. I hate it! It&#x27;s expensive, and it&#x27;s expensive enough for me to reduce my review by a star. BUT know that you are purchasing a quality product that does exactly what it says it does, which is like a breath of fresh air these days! Literally. Ha. Ha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using secret outlast for a few weeks and a BZZagent... While it smell great it doesn&#x27;t hold up to high stress situations like  presenting at work.  Half way through the day of my big presentation I was reapplying to keep back ordor and wetness.  I wouldnt mind reapplying if it didn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;48 hour protection&amp;#34; on the bottle.  Since this was a new product I brought it along in my bag just incase... so Glad I did!  While it covered the odor it didnt keep me dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was just the high stress/nervous situation of the day but I have found myself blow drying my arm pits after blow drying my hair often before work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed with the product as my past experience with Secret has been great.</li>
            <li> I have used Secret over the years and I was excited that as a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. When I received my deodorant I immediately put it to the test. I used it when I was heading out to a formal event where I was wearing a beautiful ballroom dress. I was overjoyed that it went on clear and dried the same way. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about white marks on my dress.&lt;br /&gt;This item is also amazing because as an mom of three running around with kids, running errands and my yoga time, I have finally found the perfect superior protection deodorant.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant, drys quickly doesn&#x27;t leave white marks and keeps me smelling awesome all day long.</li>
            <li> This products stands up to the 48 hour challenge!  I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks now and it has not let me down. Notoriously I have bad body odor, but when I use this product theres no worry. The other bonus is that its a clear gel and I don&#x27;t have to worry about marks on my clothes. Lastly, I love that there is an unscented option. I don&#x27;t like scented deodorant because I don&#x27;t like it interfering with my perfume.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel rocks! Great scent. No chalky white marks and it works great!!!&lt;br /&gt;Even on days when I&#x27;m at the gym I still feel and smell fresh.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it wont leave chalky marks on clothes is such a huge deal....especially on date nights!!&lt;br /&gt;I got to try it free as part of a promotion but trust me I will be buying this again. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I can not speak well enough about this product.  I have been trying to find a deodorant for a long time that I felt confident wearing and this is the one!  I love it.  It drys quickly and clearly.  It last for a 10-12 hour work day no problem.  Even when I sweat I do not develop an odor.  If you are looking for a deodorant that works this is the one!  I was blessed enough to receive it as a free sample the first time but I will be purchasing it from now on.  Thank you Secret for making such a quality product.</li>
            <li> I have been a Secret user for my entire adult life, and I was lucky enough to receive a free Secret Outlast by being a BzzAgent of Bzzagent.com.  I am extremely impressed with how well it works.  Other roll-ons feel sticky and gross after, but this dries in an instant, and I can&#x27;t even feel it anymore.  When I work out the next morning, I do not have any problem with wetness or oder.  I also do not have to worry about white marks, like I do with the Secret Original.  It&#x27;s a great product, and I will buy it from now on!</li>
            <li> I have not tried a gel in many years as I don&#x27;t like the feeling of needing to walk around with my arms up to let it dry and then the weird, sticky feeling after.  I received a sample of this product and hesitated to try it for the above reasons.  It&#x27;s great.  Dries quickly, smell is not overpowering and keeps wetness away!  I only gave 4 stars because I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple of days and since the weather is cold now, I don&#x27;t know how it holds up to a hot, sweaty day yet.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant i have found so far to actually work for my daughter. This is awesome at keeping her perspiration under control.  She love that it comes in unscented and powder.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of Secret Outlast from Bzz Agent. I really like that it does not stain your shirt and doesn&#x27;t have the funky smell that many gel deodorants have. I would definitely recommend this. It keeps me dry even working in a greenhouse at 99 degrees for 5 hours.</li>
            <li> I got this free through BzzAgent, I got the Completely Clean scent! Would definitely recommend to anyone who like a fresh scent! It works great! Will be trying the Ohh La La Lavender one next.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always pleasantly surprised when a product does what it&#x27;s advertised to do! This deodorant went on smooth, dried quickly, and didn&#x27;t leave white marks. The completely clean scent isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> Best out there now. Love the scent and it does last all day.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Got it from BZZ Agent as part of my Bzz Kit.  No white marks on the clothes, smells good.  I would recommend this product !</li>
            <li> I really like this product for a number of reasons.  First, it works. It keeps you dry and odor free all day.  Second, the clear gel dries fast with no sticky feeling and third, no white residue on my clothes or underarms!  I definitely recommend it.  (I received a sample through a Secret promotion)</li>
            <li> I received this in the free to try and review and I really like this Secret Outlast deodorant. I went out dancing for a friends 50th birthday party and wore a black dress. To my surprise it did not leave any &#x27;White&#x27; marks on my dress and kept me dry throughout the night of dancing. The next morning it was still working and I know this since I left the hotel without taking a shower till I got home! #GotItFree #buzzagent</li>
            <li> Wore it for a 5K being chased by Zombies and it held up!  The rest of my body was sweaty by the end but my pits were dry and I was smelling as sweet as I had before the race began.  Goes on smooth and easy.  Takes a little getting use to having a deodorant go on feeling a little wet but drys quickly.  Haven&#x27;t had any white marks on my clothing yet either.  Not sure that it can actually last 48 hours but does a great job and for the price.....even better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a solid deodorant kind of girl but thought I&#x27;d give the clear gel a try.  I’d always thought the gel would be sticky but it wasn’t.  It was a little cold going on but dried very quickly and kept me dry all day.  I recently wore a black sleeveless dress and as promised the Secret Outlast Gel did not leave white marks on my dress.  I’ve been using Secret Outlast Gel for two weeks now and I’m still a happy, stink-free customer.  I would definitely recommend this deodorant to my friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already a fan of Secret already and use it regularly because of how great it works for me. The new Clear Gel Secret Outlast is no exception. It goes on easily and dries pretty quickly. I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave any spots or marks on my clothes. It keeps me dry with no embarrassing odor all day. I plan on continuing to use it. As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> I received this for testing as a bzzagent.  The gel dried super fast, but didn&#x27;t go through a full day without getting my shirt wet on my underarm area.  Days where not much was happening it worked good.  At gym time I could feel the drops of sweat coming down from my underarm area.  I do love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> It caused rashes after shaving, didn&#x27;t keep dry, or work as a deodorant. Total waste of money, I&#x27;m going to toss it in the bin.</li>
            <li> I love the new secret outlast!  I was a suave girl in the past but no more.  Before I felt like I was constantly reapplying and that is now a thing of the past.  One coat of Secret Outlast and you are fresh and dry all day long...even after a long workout!  Thank you for the chance to try it free!  #gotitfree</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff in dry climates. During summer in Houston Texas this stuff just doesn&#x27;t survive. It melts right away and is washed away by sweat. During the dry fall and now winter this is possibly the best deodorant I have ever used. It&#x27;s staying power last for days (I was admitted to the hospital and remained after surgery for days with no shower) without odor and kept me dry. I love it also because it does not get on my dark clothing, which I wear a lot of in fall an winter. This will be my go to during those time periods. Even over the clinical strengths this one is great! Although I have purchased this product before, I did receive this product as a bzzagent and from the brand to review. #gotitfree</li>
            <li> WHILE THERE ARE FEW NATURAL DEODORANTS IN THE MARKET, I HAVE FOUND WHEN IT COMES TO NATURAL, STICKS AREN&#x27;T THAT EFFECTIVE AND FIND A PERFECT BLEND OF INGREDIENTS IS VERY DIFFICULT SO AS A MEMBER OF ONE2ONE NETWORK, I RECEIVED A FREE SAMPLE OF SECRET&#x27;S NEW OUTLAST CLEAR GEL TO TRY AND TEST. I LIKE COLOR, THICKNESS OF GEL,SCENT AND FEELING AFTER USING IT, BUT I WOULD LIKE EVEN MORE A DEODORANT FREE OF ALUMINUM AND WITH NATURAL INGREDIENTS.</li>
            <li> I like that this doesnt have a scent. I can almost never find this in the stores.</li>
            <li> use it every day and wonderful that it doesnt smell of anything just takes care of the stink and sweat!</li>
            <li> This is a good product and it goes on clear. It does not leave the white marks on your clothing when getting dress. I know I have gotten dress and then have to wipe off a shirt because I got deodorant on it. Oh and can not forget, it smells nice too. I we be using this product again. As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com</li>
            <li> My review is for the Active Fresh scent which doesn&#x27;t appear to be sold on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I&#x27;ve tried Secret deodorant and for whatever reason, it didn&#x27;t really work for me. to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the new outlast clear gel would be only putting it mildly. I love it! application was very easy, the smell is pleasant, and for someone who tends toward excessive sweating/bo this stuff really did work. Even after an entire day of work and then working out, I fell like it lasted and worked - I don&#x27;t smell stinky. very excited about this product. come on Summer - I&#x27;m ready for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with Secret Outlast Clear Gel. I really don&#x27;t like the residue/white stuff left behind by most solid deodorants, so I was excited to try out this gel formula. When the gel dries, NOTHING is left behind...except odor protection! This product works great and lives up to the expectations. I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it, but I really do. Even though I received this as a free sample, I&#x27;m going to be purchasing it for myself. It works just as well as any solid I&#x27;ve ever tried, but without the white residue those leave behind. The scent is also light and you just smell &amp;#34;fresh.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Secret Antiperspirant/deodorant, but usually purchase in the solid form. Last year I remember trying the Clear Gel in ooh-la-lavender and it didn&#x27;t work out for me, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with the new formula. After testing the Secret Outlast Clear Gel in Active Fresh for a couple of days, I really like it. The new formula dries faster, and keeps my underarm area fresh for hours. I love that I don&#x27;t experience white marks, and the scent is light, and fresh! I&#x27;m so glad that Secret improved the Clear Gel formula, and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received the Secret Outlast Clear Gel for free from the One2One Network via clearlybetterchallenge.com</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this deodorant, but it just doesn&#x27;t do what it claims to do. I got the active fresh scent. I love the smell. it isn&#x27;t overpowering and is clean smelling, but once I get to sweating, my sweat smell comes right on through.&lt;br /&gt;I do like that it is clear. it goes on clear and stays clear. no marks were even left behind on a black tank, so that was great. being a gel it is thick and gloppy almost and take a lil spell to dry, it&#x27;s even worse if you&#x27;ve just taken a shower.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that I was able to try this and not buy this. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. it just doesn&#x27;t blend to work with my chemistry.</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. I loved this product my days are long and this product held up under my extreme pressure</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this &amp;#34;New Formula&amp;#34; clear gel Secret Outlast deodorant.  I have tried many Secret deodorants but this one is really awesome. First of all, it has a great scent!  To use, you twist it at the bottom for the gel to come out and it goes on wet but dries really fast, and the best thing I love is that it feels like a very smooth silky feel under your under arms.  I used this in the morning with a busy and active day and it worked as promised.  It&#x27;s definitely my new go to deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> as a member of one2one network, i received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;this product worked fairly well. it only felt wet for a second. it kept me dry and odor free, and i wore it on a marathon day. i wasn&#x27;t thinking when i did it, but glad it worked out :).</li>
            <li> love this deodorant. It controlled the sweat, did not leave white streaks and dried quickly. As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel .</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve always used secret products, so i was super excited when i was chosen to receive this product free from clearlybetterchallenge.com as a member of one2one network!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as an adult, this product definitely helps keep me fresh all day, every day.  i never have to worry about reapplying or feeling embarrassed.  it smells clean and goes on light...just what i want!  i will definitely continue to use this product and will definitely purchase it again and again!</li>
            <li> I really like the cool scent and all day protection of the Secret Outlast clear gel. It goes on with a cool feeling and kept me dry all day. it didn&#x27;t leave any ugly white marks on my clothes either. I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> i am a member of one2one network and i got this as a free sample. i finally found what i have been looking for! secret clear outlast is awesome. giving you a great underarm smell, i remain pretty dry and odorless without leaving marks on your underarm and clothes. super love this product and i am buzzing this to my family and friends! Finally! I built ore confidence!</li>
            <li> Great scent but the mechanics of the actual  product need improved.  I  felt  dry and fresh all day when using the product but the top  popped off and afterwards deodorant would  only come out one side of the stick.  Other than that the product seems to be inline with  the rest of their odor  protection products, however, I would love to see a paraben and aluminum free deodorant in their future lines!</li>
            <li> I received the product free from clearlybetterchallenge.com  as a member of one2one network to test it. I am convinced i found my go-to deodorant forever. I loved the fresh scent and the gel is very easily absorbed without leaving that yucky feeling of having too much under your arms. I will definitely recommend this product to everyone for its long lasting effect and freshness.</li>
            <li> I received the product free from clearlybetterchallenge.com as a member of one2one network.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product by Secret has done a great job for me.  The scent I received was &amp;#34;active fresh&amp;#34;, which was a little strong smelling for my liking.  That is the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.  I wear a lot of black, so I loved that this product does leave the white debris on my clothes.  It also did a nice job of keeping me feeling fresh all day.  Next time I will try a different scent, but other than that, it was a great find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long-time user of Secret Deodorant, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be instantly blown away, but I have to admit that I&#x27;m pretty impressed with the Secret Outlast Clear Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one, the scent is surprisingly good. It&#x27;s not nearly as &amp;#34;floral&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34; as a lot of deodorants, but I don&#x27;t consider that a problem. It doesn&#x27;t smell masculine either. It smells more neutral, and I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s a scent that doesn&#x27;t really battle with any of my perfumes or body fragrances like lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel goes onto the skin very smoothly as well. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be leaving any residue on my clothing - even if I put on clothing freshly after putting on the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of longevity, the deodorant seems to last a long time. I&#x27;ve had no problem with it working all throughout the day. If I take a shower or workout, it seems helpful to reapply it, but it seems to keep my skin from sweating a whole lot. This is going to be so helpful this summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to work exactly how I&#x27;d like my deodorant to work. No complaints from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> as a member of one2one network, i received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com  i have been a long time secret user and am continued to love them with this clear secret. it has a pleasant scent and applies easily. i can&#x27;t speak for it&#x27;s lasting 48 hours, because i shower every 24 hours at minimum, however it stands up to my exercising and general sweating throughout the day. i live in florida, so we have to deal with florida heat. i love that it goes on clear and really doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on your clothing like the white stick deodorants. this is especially great for wearing black or tank tops.</li>
            <li> i received a sample of secret outlast clear gel to experience and review.  i received no other compensation and this is my personal review.  i have used the product for 3 weeks now and had a fantastic experience with odor control and dryness.  i live in florida, so it&#x27;s already hot and the secret outlast clear gel gave me outstanding results! i love the scent and lasting wetness control.  it goes on as a clear gel, but dries very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothes - that is a total win!  i have already purchased more for myself and teen daughter.  i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like how this product goes on, it certainly smells great, but it was a thin mask for me and didn&#x27;t really stand up that great to Zumba class. It didn&#x27;t really do a whole lot for odor control or wetness.  I received this sample from One2One Network</li>
            <li> Perfect in Florida humidity: it can be hard to find a deodorant that works well in the florida heat! humidity is ridiculous here in the south, and i need something that is powerful and fresh smelling. this product kept me dry even on the hottest of days at baseball games. the scent is not overpowering. goes on smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel. I had never used a gel before. I love the scent (active fresh), which is crisp and clean. It really wakes me up in the morning. The gel goes on easily and I didn&#x27;t need much - just one click per underarm. My underarms were wet for about thirty seconds, but after that they stayed dry and fresh all day, even after exercising!!</li>
            <li> Disclosure: As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.&lt;br /&gt;Secret Outlast Clear Gel Antiperspirant and Deodorant lists the following...&lt;br /&gt;Reduces underarm wetness, 48-hour odor protection, strong enough for a woman and goes on clear with no white marks.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true the Secret Outlast Clear Gel did control my underarm wetness. I didn&#x27;t notice any underarm odor in between daily showers. The gel didn&#x27;t leave any marks on my clothing, however I didn&#x27;t really care for the dry time (which wasn&#x27;t long). Meaning, I felt damp, thus I didn&#x27;t pull my shirt on until it had time to dry, and later in the day I felt sticky after a full day of work. Therefore I give Secret Outlast Clear Gel Antiperspirant and Deodorant a solid 5 on a scale of 1 - 10. The fact I felt the need to wait before pulling on a top or dress and the fact I had a sticky sensation after a hard day at work, in reality the sticky sensation would prevent me from purchasing Secret Outlast Clear Gel. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, I know everyone has a different body type and deodorant needs.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant! It&#x27;s a gel, but it is not sticky and dries fast. Just a click of the wheel, apply and I&#x27;m good to go! It goes on clear, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about marks on my clothing and it works all day long! Even on the days that I worked out, there was no need to reapply! I appreciate that Secret Outlast is unscented because it allows me to wear the perfume of my choice without clashing scents! As a member of One2One Network, I received a sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel unscented from clearlybetterchallenge for review...but all opinions are my own from my experience of using it!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic addition to the Secret Deodorant line. Outlast Clear Gel really does go on clear; it doesn&#x27;t dry out my underarms. More importantly it keeps me dry and odor free morning till night!!  Today was a great test; a full day of chasing a 3-year-old around and then a late night hot yoga class and I am still dry (that is my underarms are dry!!) and have absolutely no under arm odor!!!! I&#x27;m thoroughly and completely impressed!!  And in love with this product. LOVE!! LOVE!! LOVE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s New Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like this product, I was surprised to find that not only did it smell great but it kept me feeling fresh all day. I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast deodorant for free to try.  I love it.  I like the gel and that in goes on clear.  I have one the that is scented but it is a pleasant girly scent that is not over baring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find I wet less and am protected all day from odor.</li>
            <li> What can we say? My daughter is an athlete and it&#x27;s important not to show you sweat or smell bad during and after the game.  With the 48 hour odor protection we had nothing to worry about here.</li>
            <li> I received Secret&#x27;s Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant as part of a promotion from the company and just have to get the word out - this deodorant is great!  I have been using men&#x27;s deodorant for year&#x27;s due to an inability to find a deodorant that works in a woman&#x27;s brand.  The Secret&#x27;s out, I have found a replacement - and I am sticking with it!  One side effect of the men&#x27;s brand was that it would give me rashes (on occasion) when I shaved my armpits.  I had to substitute with baby powder at least one day after shaving to help prevent that from happening.  No more!  I am able to use Secret&#x27;s outlast right after a shave and no side effects at all!  With it lasting for the 24 hours I need it to, I can&#x27;t think of any reason to go back to my men&#x27;s brand and can go forward smelling like a woman and feeling fully protected!  Thank-you Secret!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from bzzagent.com to try and I can say that I like the way the product goes on and that it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes, but it takes a while to dry and then gets a bit sticky causing any loosening lint from clothing to stick to the area. I wear a lot of darker colored tanks and noticed the lint sticking to the area in excess. Which I did not like at all.</li>
            <li> I was Leary about trying Secret Outlast Womens Clear Gel but since I #Gotitfree from BzzAgent to review I figured it was worth a try. I would never trust a 48 hour protection guarantee, especially because I do hot power yoga and do a lot of walk/running. I was impressed with its ability to combat odor in my 95-104 degree yoga classes, though obviously it can&#x27;t be expected to keep me from sweating in those environments. I personally do not like the cold wet sticky feel of the gel. The cold goes away quickly but I do feel it leaves me feeling sticky for hours after it put it on. If you don&#x27;t mind gels then I can see how this would be a great product for you - the no whitemarks claim I found to be just about 100% true, even in my dark colored work out clothes.</li>
            <li> I have always been a Secret user.  The Invisible Solid stick is my go-to: full-size, travel-size - vanilla or coconut scented.  I&#x27;ve always felt that Secret has a formula that doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate your skin.  They don&#x27;t have over-powering scents.&lt;br /&gt;II received a free full size Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel as part of a promotion, and discovered that they&#x27;ve stuck with that winning formula.  Whether I was baking in a hot kitchen, working out at the gym or stressing over a deadline, Secret&#x27;s Clear Gel didn&#x27;t fail me! They stayed true to what I&#x27;ve come to expect from them.&lt;br /&gt;There is one aspect that prevented me from giving Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel a full 5 stars - and that is due to its ability to travel without making a mess.  I had it in my travel bag for the car trip this Thanksgiving holiday.  When I needed to apply it, I found that the container had been &amp;#34;squeezed&amp;#34; so that a lot of excess gel was on the top of the applicator - much more than I needed to use.  On the way home, I backed down the dial, so that there was extra head space under the applicator, which did help a bit.  If I was traveling via air, I would not use Secret Clear Gel, as I normally carry on my bag, and Secret Gel would be part of my liquid allotment, while the solid is not.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was extremely satisfied with Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel - it kept me dry and still smelling great, even after a long sweat-filled workout!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It really works, keeps you dry all day long!</li>
            <li> I did not care much for this deodorant.  The gel did not feel good at all and i dont think it lasts as long as it states.</li>
            <li> The effectiveness of deodorant is sensational. No residue or stains on the skin or clothes and dries quickly when applied. The scent lasts for long.  \\&quot;I received a product sample, the opinions are mine.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this product as part of a promotion.  I always use an invisible solid so I was reluctant to try it, but I couldn&#x27;t believe how great it worked in the end.  It dried super fast after I put it on and it held up even through a running workout.  This is not the gel deodorant of my teenage years!  I&#x27;m glad I tried it out.</li>
            <li> I got a free bottle of the Secret Outlast to try as a promotion from the brand. For the most part, I am happy with the clear gel. I like that it goes on clear and does not leave white stains on my clothing. As far as odor protection, I sweat a lot and I still get some odor by the end of the day with this product. While it is not bad on a normal day, for those days I am more physically active, it doesn&#x27;t completely keep odors away.  While it doesn&#x27;t take long to dry, it doesn&#x27;t go on dry. I have used the blow dryer on a low setting to speed up the drying process and it takes just a few seconds for dry time. While I like Secret Outlast, wish it worked better for the times when I exercise hard.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel helps to protect against the main causes of sweat: heat, activity and stress sweat! Secret® Clinical Strength does what it needs to do and keeps me fresh all day long. Not only am I, a mom, a wife but I also work a full-time job that it is really extremely stressful since I work for claims. I noticed before how I used to sweat a lot and ever since I had been trying Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel, I noticed the differenced on my clothes. Since I started using Secret® Clinical Strength, I have been able to stay calm, cool, collected and sweat smell free. There is a really nice park around the building were I work and I can walk  about 2  miles usually 3 times a week  on my lunch break,  When I get done walking, I can not head back to the office as a hot sweaty mess. That is why I love Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel.&lt;br /&gt;Love it is one of thest deodorant on the market</li>
            <li> Great protection, smells great, and totally black dress loved!  I got this for free, and I am ready to purchase some more!  Not a gel fan, but it worked great.</li>
            <li> I Received  this product free from BzzAgent.com to try and give my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is it works. It is unscented so it doesn&#x27;t mix with your fragrance, perfume or cologne. It is clear so it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on your clothes. And the protection lasts.&lt;br /&gt;Like with other long-lasting antiperspirants deodorants I applied mine at night before bed. Sometimes I reapply in the morning. But at night when I put on my club dress I don&#x27;t need to apply at. And it works!&lt;br /&gt;I can dance the night away and not have to worry about if my armpits stink.&lt;br /&gt;No I do caution you there&#x27;s a lot of chemicals in this product. These chemicals do leach into the skin and can affect your hormones. So I don&#x27;t use this product every day. I use it on special occasions only.</li>
            <li> I got this as part of a Bzzagent campaign, and I love it.  This will be the deodorant I buy all the time now.  We are in the middle of moving and remodeling a home.  Saturday I removed carpet from our living room.  I had sweat dripping from my hair and making my shirt stick to my back.  But my underarms were dry and I did not stink!!!!  I could not believe how well this worked.  Perfect for everyday with out any fear of your deodorant giving out.</li>
            <li> This product in the i scented formula is difficult to find in the store and I love it. I am so glad Amazon carries it. Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used natural (doesn&#x27;t cut it for me), RX (can taste the metallic &amp; burns), so I got stuck using one brand &amp; that was failing..... Ugh, I don&#x27;t want to stink! Then I saw this on TV, I immediately put on my Prime List &amp; don&#x27;t regret. Works great, no chalky white lines on clothing, &amp; really by next am I still don&#x27;t stink! Try it if you want to be fresher &amp; can&#x27;t stand harsh RX&#x27;s!!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you to #Secretoutlast and #bzzagent.com for allowing me to try this product for free. I was skeptical of this product actually lasting over 48 hours but on a trip to Europe from door to door 18 hours, the deodorant worked. It was also tested at a wedding on bridesmaids and there was no white marks and through all the dancing and sweating it also lasted. There was no detection of odor and no wetness. The comments most said was it was a bit sticky at first but went away within seconds and it outlasted all other deodorants that we tried. #Secretoutlast this is a winner.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying a new deodorant but I received this as part of a trial for bzz agent. I have to say that I am truly sold. I used to think that the gel just made my armpits wet but this stuff drys really fast. It does have a little sting if you just shaved, im assuming due to the alcohol in it helping it dry quickly. I used to only use dove and I have to say this protection lasts much longer. The dove wears off within 12 hours and this absolutly does not. I do love this product but am taking away 1 star due to the minor sting. :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Secret Outlast I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it staining my clothes it went on very nicely and gave me order protection I am very happy I found this product I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand with BZZAGENT</li>
            <li> top of the line oder protection. I love this stuff. smells great, dries fast, last a long time even on super stressful days, and has the best bottling and lid design I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;now I normally do Not wear gel deodorant because I hate that it takes so long to dry and stays sticky after. so I was not expecting to like it when I received it from the secret to review. man I was in for an awsome suprise one I was very satisfied with. First secret outlast last forever even on your sweatist days. With an amazing smell that leaves you felling fresh and clean when in truth you are a hot mess.  dries so fast no more holding your hand&#x27;s over your head in front of a fan for 5 min. waiting on your gel deodorant to dry. oh and i have not seen Any white marks on any of my cloths not even the black ones.&lt;br /&gt;The concept of the bottle and lid is just jaw dropping. The bottle does not have tones of holes on the top so you end up with globs of deodorant when you try to use it. which cuts down on dry time and I believe it is one of the reasons it&#x27;s not sticky.the inside of the lid meet with the design on the top of the bottle sealing it off for a tight close. no extra deodorant comes up while closed even if you do click it.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the try I bet you will fall in love with it 2.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product as part of a buzz campaign, and I&#x27;m glad i did. Seriously my husband ran out of deodorant and I didnt know. In desperation he tried my secret.  He ended up loving the protection it gave him. I thought it was hilarious, but also cool that it even worked for my hard working man. He only used it a few ays until I could get him some more, but I know he enjoyed how hard it worked even for him. It gave me even more confidence in the product.  It also works great for me.</li>
            <li> I have never been one to use clear gel; I never liked the way it felt or the &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; marks it left on my clothes.  This changed that! I was skeptical because of my past with trying it, but it really does go on completely clear, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on your clothes, and keeps you dry!  for months, i had been battling bumps after shaving under my arms...since i started using this, they have just about completely gone away!! I was pretty stoked about that!  I am glad I #gotitfree from #bzzagent...i&#x27;m a convert, lol!</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel as a sample from the company as a Bzz Agent. Here is what I think:&lt;br /&gt;Scent- pleasant, not too strong&lt;br /&gt;Application- Easy to use, click dispenses just the right amount of gel. Gel slides on, not gooey. Dries VERY QUICKLY! (generally this is what I have not liked about gel deodorants in the past, but I was pleased with how quickly it dried.)&lt;br /&gt;Odor Control- Comparable to any other deodorant with same active ingredient. Better than lesser name, discount brands. I was odor free definitely for 24 hours. (I applied it every 24hours so I can not attest for 48 hour odor free claim).&lt;br /&gt;Sweat Protection- I will say that my shirt did get some underarm wet spots- I am a sweater though, the only thing that will stop my wet spots if wearing a close fitting shirt is a clinical strength deodorant, and even that is not 100% sure thing. However even though I had wet spots I didn&#x27;t smell bad&lt;br /&gt;Residue- left ZERO residue on clothes, not a trace on my shirt after I put it on&lt;br /&gt;Irritation- I have pretty sensitive skin and shave my underarms every 2 days. I did not have any more irritation from using this deodorant when compared to others I have used in the past but there was no moisturizing component to Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel as there are in other brands of deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;Price- very comparable to other name brand deodorants of similar size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall- A good-great deodorant. Pluses are that it is a clear gel that works well, leaves no residue and dries quickly. Otherwise no clear advantage over other deodorants. If you have dry underarms, this has no moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I recently received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel through BzzAgent as a means to experience the product for free!  I loved the deodorant so much I ended tossing my current one and replaced it with this one.  I enjoyed the comfort Secret Outlast Unscented Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Deodorant was for me.  I used it a multiple of times especially when exercising.  I liked when I put on the clear gel how it didn&#x27;t stain my shirts and because its clear I was not worried about stains or visible white residue when when wearing sleeveless shirts.</li>
            <li> As a long time user of Secret solid I am always skeptical of new brands or formulas, but this one didn&#x27;t disappoint. It goes on clear, dries fast and clear, smells great and lasts! I haven&#x27;t used it the 48 hours it claims to last but can say that for me it has worked for at leas 24 hours! I got this free from BzzAgent and will definitely be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I received this deodorant to use and right an honest review for BzzAgent. I was excited to get a new deodorant and I haven&#x27;t had much experience with gel based deodorants, I was looking forward to trying this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end of my third day using this- my armpits were on fire!  I switched back to a solid deodorant and it took at least 3 days for the pain to go away! I do feel like it did a good job controlling odor and wetness, but the price of that was too high!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any degree of sensitive skin- I was steer clear of this stuff!</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get to try this as a promotion from the Secret brand. I have used Secret solid for a long time, but always thought that the clear gel was too messy. I was pleasantly surprised - for the most part, you can get dressed without residue marks pretty quickly after application. The clean &#x27;no scent&#x27; is a welcome change from the traditional &#x27;baby powder&#x27;. I have noticed that the product runs out more quickly than the traditional version. However, I appreciate not having to chase a half a block of broken deodorant block across the bathroom floor!</li>
            <li> I was sent this product for free by Secret and I can confirm that its a great product. It keeps me smelling great, even when I don&#x27;t shower and just want to touch up. I also haven&#x27;t been feeling sweating as much as I used to. Thanks Secret!</li>
            <li> When I first started using this item I would have given it a 5 along with an enthusiastic review.  After about a month using it daily, I&#x27;m giving it an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; review and rating.  Yes, this does go on clear, dries quickly and smells great.  The first few weeks I had no issues but it was almost like my body got used to it and after a few weeks didn&#x27;t work as well any more.  While I still felt dry I had enough odor to notice it on myself, but luckily I don&#x27;t think anyone else ever noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall its worth a shot and it may work for you but it didn&#x27;t work long term for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***received free for review***</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received one thru Bzzagent.com and love it.Fresh scent , not too strong it really lasts all day long.&lt;br /&gt;No white marks on ur clothes people !! Love Secret clear gel.</li>
            <li> I am a bzzagent member and was sent this to try for free.  It is a great deodarant that stands up to the tests of many a sweat tests.  I have always used secret clinical since it was the only thing that would really help me, until I received this.  The clear gel dries very fast, smells great, and lasts.  I recommend</li>
            <li> Another good product from the Secret line</li>
            <li> I am on a 200 pound weight loss journey and workout daily. I&#x27;m constantly looking for a deodorant that stands up to the multiple daily workouts and just something that doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes or last maybe an hour or two! I&#x27;ve been using this product now for a few weeks and i&#x27;m happy to report that it stands up to the ultimate tests! Whether it&#x27;s an hour at the gym or two hours of high intensity interval training Secret Outlast has kept me dry! I did receive this product to test from the brand, Thanks Buzz Agent :)</li>
            <li> As a woman in the construction industry, I need an antiperspirant/deodorant that can keep my pits from flowing like a waterfall! I was completely skeptical of a gel-type going on wet and feeling that way throughout the day. I received a sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel as part of a brand promotion for free in exchange for my review. Normally, I would never think to purchase any type of gel product out of fear of feeling wetness all day. I&#x27;m glad I got to try this product, as I was pleasantly surprised at how fast Secret Outlast absorbed into my skin! There was no wetness seeping through to clothes (which has happened in the past from other gels), or white marks since it&#x27;s clear! On the first work-day I used this product, it passed the stink test! A 10 hour shift of heavy lifting and running like mad with no b.o.!  I used to be a huge proponent of invisible solids (which I generally over applied and occasionally reapplied), but I&#x27;ve decided that I&#x27;m switching over to the single click and swipe of Secret Outlast!</li>
            <li> NOT BAD BUT LIKR THE POWDER ON THE BEST</li>
            <li> Took this deodorant camping... I smelled like sweat.&lt;br /&gt;Took this deodorant hiking.... I smelled like sweat.&lt;br /&gt;Took this deodorant back home... I smelled like sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get an allergic reaction, but I smelled like sweat everyday. I consider myself a medium sweater, so it may work well for light sweaters. I am on the market for a new antiperspirant as  we speak.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife, she uses this type and Walmart/Publix for some reason are both out of Unscented Clear Gel kind.</li>
            <li> #GotItFreeFromSecret.  Secret, you&#x27;ve done it again!!  This pleasant smelling deodorant does not leave icky white marks on your clothing, even the darkest of colors.  You stay fresh all day with no mess.  Thanks for a wonderful product Secret!!</li>
            <li> For so so very long I&#x27;ve had issues with the dreaded white marks. NEVER will you experience them with this product. I recieved as a tester for Bzzagent, and now I&#x27;m hooked. It dries within seconds after proper usage, and it last for hours and hours. Im a busy young mom, and this Secret deoderant keeps my sweaty mom pits a secret too.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. Dries fast with no residue. No marks on clothing at all. It&#x27;s like you are not wearing any deodorant at all. But it is very effective against wetness and odor no matter what you are doing! No need to reapply! I got this product as a trial from buzz agent. I really like it though!</li>
            <li> The one thing i dread about the summer months is wearing sleeveless shirts &amp; having those nasty white marks all over! This eliminates that all together! I have always loved secret because of its great long lasting protection like no other. the fresh really good smell is just an added bonus! definitely a customer for life! love it!</li>
            <li> Had difficulty locating a fragrance free gel deodorant at local stores. Yeah Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a gel antiperspirant with no fragrance. It comes out too easily so dont turn the dispenser until it oozes, because it will keep oozing!  I twist until the gel is just under the holes, then squeeze the dispenser to get just a bit out of the holes &amp; apply.  Takes some time to dry, so plan dressing accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best is NO WHITE STREAKS</li>
            <li> Works well. But I do not care for the unscented one.</li>
            <li> Nice but I just prefer Secret Clinical Strength</li>
            <li> My mom loves this clear gel!  No stains left on your clothing.</li>
            <li> Did NOT work as an anti persperant. Still as sweaty and gross as if I hadn&#x27;t put anything on.</li>
            <li> I WANTED UNSCENTED BECAUSE I DON&#x27;T LIKE ANY  FRAGRANCE MIXING WITH MY PERFUME.  IT WENT ON CLEAR AND IT STAYED CLEAR NO MARKS ON MY BLOUSES.  I DID NOT WEAR A BLACK BLOUSE YET BUT I DO TRUST THIS BRAND.  COME ON NOW DID YOU THINK SECRET WOMENS FAVORITE BRAND OF DEODORANT/ANTIPERSPERANT WOULD FAIL.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is fantastic.  I used to break out under my arms and found out it wasn&#x27;t anything more than the fragrance.  Since switching to Secret Unscented, no more problems. It works great.</li>
            <li> I love this particular antiperspirant/deodorant but I always have a hard time finding it in an unscented formula. I have very sensitive skin and i&#x27;m allergic/sensitive to many scents so unscented is a must for me.  Amazon.com came to my rescue offering this under their Subscribe and Save program. I get it shipped to my home free of charge and I get a 20% discount. What could be better?</li>
            <li> I received a  free &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; size or &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; size as others call it, through Bzzagent for test and review purposes. Have to say, it works great! It goes on clear, leaves no sticky residue on clothes and you feel fresh all day! Best part, not scent! Personally, I love the travel size as it fits in my toiletry bag I take along camping. I was using a solid up until receiving this and now will be switching to the gel as i prefer the no mark look ! Again, Secret has a great deodorant that protects from odor and lasts all day! Will be recommending to all my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with th likee product. It smells wonderful and clean, and it keeps me dry throughout the day. The only thing I don&#x27;t is that it&#x27;s hard to wach off.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great product! I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a clear and lasting deodorant!</li>
            <li> Worst deodorant ever! Never works, gel goes everywhere, lid falls off all the time. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of Secret Outlast Gel Deodorant by BzzAgent in return for a test of the product and review. I must say I was pleasantly surprised how it went on smooth with no streaking and dryed quickly. it does have a faint but pleasant scent that is not overpowering. It worked well even during my morning spin class and weekly softball games where other deodorants I have used in the past could not keep up with my active lifestyle. Secret Outlast Gel will now be a regular in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> Works really well - no wetness or odor even after a long busy day. Goes on clear and dries fast, no white gunk to get on clothes. A good price with Subscribe and Save discount.</li>
            <li> So I belong to a website that sends free products to try and this is one of them I recently received and liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this deodorant it went on smooth and loved the way it smelled.  I do admit I was a little surprised at the smell since it&#x27;s does say it is unscented so that is something to consider if you are looking for a deodorant without a scent.  Secret Outlast does have a scent, it&#x27;s pleasant but one might be upset if they go into it expecting it to be scentless.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think about this when I first got it. I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t hold up to being out in the hear. So the first day I tried it I loved the way it felt when I put it on . It went on smooth and covered easily. After a long day I was glad to see it worked and I stayed fresh and dry.</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant. The Active Fresh scent is light and as the name suggests fresh. I also really loved the gel, it was my first using a gel deodorant. It dried quickly and I didn&#x27;t need to worry about it getting on my tops. The odor control was pretty good, not the full 48 hours as it suggests, but much better than other deodorant I&#x27;ve used.  As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> works as expected and great price.</li>
            <li> As a member of one2one network, I received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. This product works just as it said it would, dry protection all day. It smells fresh and clean, and leaves you smelling fresh and clean too. In the past I haven&#x27;t been much of a fan of the gel deodorants, but this one dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky or wet under your arms. I&#x27;d definitely use this product in the future, and recommend it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I received this deodorant for free as part of my latest bzzkit. I was quite impressed with the deodorant. It stood up all day at work and still worked When I came home to hang out with my kids! And because it is a clear gel there were no white streaks. I am also impressed with the scent. It wasn&#x27;t overpowering like a lot of the other scents.</li>
            <li> Thought I would try an unscented deodorant this time around. Easy glide on no sticky feeling, looks like I&#x27;m going to be buying this again.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t bought secret products for quite awhile, but when giving the opportunity to try it for free from one2one network and clearlybetterchallenge.com how could i say no.  i&#x27;m glad i accepted the challenge.  so, there are no white marks and i feel fresh all day.  i got the active scent and am happy with the smell, its not overpowering and its pleasant.  i would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love this new deodorant with one exception.  I am not a fan of the scent.  I got to try it out for free thanks to Bzz Agent and I do love that way it works, how dry I stay, its non irritating and my tank tops are happier.  The scent is a little strong for me but it may only be because I am pregnant and my senses are all crazy sharp right now.</li>
            <li> I like the brand products of secret but I didn&#x27;t really enjoy this product much. It fell flat as far as performance wise. The deoderant seemed to dry out very quickly. But for the price it was totally worth it.</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. With that being said I tried the product and was pleasantly surprised with it. I really liked the formula compared to the old dove deodorant i was using. This product is a gel so it dried fairly quickly, left no residue and had good staying power. Although I did like the product I was not very fond of the scent i received which was active fresh. That would be my only complaint that I would have chosen another scent because it smelled to me like mens deodorant. Otherwise good product and when I finish it i will be purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant!  I have had sensitivities to deodorant my whole life.  I switched to this sensitive gel and my underarm reactions/sensitivities are completely gone.  This is gentle, won&#x27;t clog hair shafts and lasts a long time.  I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from secret just in time for my first trip of the season - to AZ of course and it was 101 degrees! Too hot but that didn&#x27;t phase Secret Outlast! No deoderant marks on my clothes and only one application needed to combat the AZ heat! A happy girl indeed!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using this deodorant as in the past Secret hasn&#x27;t been my go to brand, however I was pleasantly surprised! Applied the product after my morning shower and started my day, it is summer and currently about 100 degrees outside where I live and this kept me dry and odor free all day! This includes me dropping off kids at summer camp, running errands, and the gym! It did not leave any marks on my clothes and dried very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Love Secret Outlast!</li>
            <li> I received a free stick (can you call it a stick if it&#x27;s a gel?) from Secret and was eager to try the product out. I LOVE this product. I was previously using Degree because, as my girlfriend likes to laugh, I &amp;#34;sweat like a man.&amp;#34; I was pleasantly surprised when this product not only kept me dry, it also didn&#x27;t have an odor. There are a lot of scents that I can&#x27;t handle because they cause migraines, but this product is definitely on the OK list. What&#x27;s even better is the 48 hour protection. It&#x27;s great that I can put it on Friday morning and still be smelling fresh and clean on Saturday. Would I recommend this product to others? Absolutely! Would I steal it from my girlfriend if I ran out? You betcha! Secret, you&#x27;ve got a new friend in me!!</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was skeptical about the gel.  But I had the opportunity to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel for free thanks to BzzAgent and now my mind has been opened!  The gel dries quickly and clear without sticky residue.  I stay dry all day long without goopy stuff on my shirts or in my pits.  I smell great all day as well.  I don&#x27;t have to reapply after exercise.  I recommend giving it a try if you&#x27;ve been a solid deodorant player your whole life.  You might just become a gel person :).</li>
            <li> I received a promotional sample of Secret Outlast Unscented Women&#x27;s Clear Gel free of charge, and I was skeptical.  I&#x27;ve never met a gel deodorant that I liked - until now!  This product goes on clear and dries fast.  Everything you could want from a deodorant, right??  Right!  I am an active person and sweat regularly - this is a very effective antiperspirant that I will certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this deodorant for free from Bzzagent. I was not sure how I was going to like a gel as I have never used one before.  I was surprised to find it was not sticky as I put it on and was very happy with how it worked.  Loved that there is no white marks left on my dark clothes and I feel confident with wearing it.  No wetness or odor.  Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Why would anyone write a review on deodorant? Because this one really does what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;I got a free sample, and tried it only because I had it.  I&#x27;ve used Secret for years, but I never buy gel because it sounds sticky and messy.&lt;br /&gt;So I started using my free sample, and it goes on just like a solid -- no stickiness-- but better than than the solid because you can&#x27;t get white marks on your clothes.  The gel doesn&#x27;t stain.&lt;br /&gt;Here was the true test and where I am now sold on the Secret Outlast and will buy and use it from now on.  I had to take my son to the emergency room. We were there nearly 40 hours before he was admitted to the hospital. I was under the worst stress of my life and didn&#x27;t get a shower for 3 days.  I wore the same clothes the whole time.  Guess what -- the Secret Outlast kept me from smelling like I was wearing the same clothes for 3 days and hadn&#x27;t had a shower.  So if you are like me and think why do I need 48 hour protection -- well, you never know when it is going to come in handy. Now I only wish Secret Outlast made a toothpaste...</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast is easily the best deodorant on the market, 2 days protection, no white marks and it come in a wonderful variety of scents. #gotitfree #bzzagent</li>
            <li> What product. Easy on skin and leaves you fresh and ready to go for day no matter what you have planned. I&#x27;ve always tried solid deodorants and this was my first time trying gel deodorant. Now I&#x27;ve switched and really the results</li>
            <li> Comes off a lot easier than a solid deodorant. It works ok. It needs to be applied ever 6 hours or so.</li>
            <li> I was made fun of as a child for not having good deodorant so I know the value of a good product. I live in a very hot and humid city so my deodorant needs to work and I can tell you secret outlast works! Secret sent me this product to try for free and I switched to this brand lightning speed !</li>
            <li> I received this as sample from BzzAgent.  I enjoy that this deodorant goes on clear and it feels and smells great.  The one thing that is disappointing is this does not last all day, half-way through the day I start smelling.  So I have to reapply and that can be inconvenient.</li>
            <li> Love Secret!! Have been using it all of my life cuz it works great. This product has only gotten better by making it clear with the new Secret Outlast. Just when I thought it couldn&#x27;t get any better it actually did.</li>
            <li> I am one who needs to spend an arm and a leg for that Clinical strength deodorant. I cannot stand having to reapply constantly. I got the chance to try Secret Outlast for free, and I was excited!!! I really love the fact that it is a gel deodorant that doesn&#x27;t leave marks and dries clear. It also lasts a long time and actually works for me. It will save me tons of money in the future using Outlast instead of an expensive clinical strength deodorant. I would recommend it to anyone who needs long lasting protection and does not like to reapply throughout the day. #gotitfree</li>
            <li> I was given this deodorant to test out as a promotion and I must say that I am thoroughly impressed. Even through some of the hottest summer days of mowing and wheat harvest, it has withstood the smell proof test.</li>
            <li> Decided to order this Secret deodorant here just because the price is right and I can get on automatic shipment and never have to worry that I run out of deodorant.  Also saves me from a trip to the store.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years ... works well.</li>
            <li> lasts all day and doesnt irritate</li>
            <li> is okay.  a little heavy</li>
            <li> Off and on I have tried gel deodorants with little luck of it protecting me all day. I would have to constantly reapply. Also, I did not like the sticky feeling that gels gave me, this made me feel unclean. With that said you can understand the hesitance in trying anymore gel type deodorants. I tried this and was amazed that  this dried quickly. Usually, I would hold my arms up and literally fan it with the other hand, not with this. So I put it to the test for a few weeks. The first day or two, I stayed in the house and did normal everyday things and I maintained my freshness and protection as if I just applied it. I did not have to reapply nor did I have those dreaded white marks on any of my shirts. As good as this did, I decided to see if it worked under extreme pressure. I spent the day doing yard work, exercising, and even some outdoor yoga.Did I have to reapply? NO!  Did I smell like I been outside all day? Yes of course, but my under arms did not. However, I did accumulate moisture under my under arms that I do not experience with other deodorants when working in the yard. That was my only issue with this. Other than this, the updated formulas is a thousand times better than the original formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> I had the chance to try this product as a member of O2O Network. I actually really liked this. The turn dial at the bottom is mildly annoying because it&#x27;s a lot of effort to get that &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; noise, but the goop still comes up. The deodorant worked out really well. It wasn&#x27;t too messy. Just a little damp when I used it but it dried pretty quickly and didn&#x27;t get on my clothes. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell which I definitely like. I ended up breaking the top of it, somehow though and now I have to dig out the goop. Not fun! That was my fault though. Overall, great product and will likely by again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from the clearlybetterchallenge site.</li>
            <li> Yes it doesn&#x27;t leave a white mark like it says, but for me it doesn&#x27;t last 48 hours. It barely lasts half of my day. The smell is great, but I&#x27;m sweating and stinking by noon. I also don&#x27;t like it when I put it on after I shave, it burns.</li>
            <li> This Secret Clear Gel is amazing. It has great coverage that lasts, without leaving marks under my arms or on my clothes!!</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do.  Missed a day and still fine.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> THIS became my favorite after so many years compared to any other and I have used the clinical ones but, this wins. IT takes just a minute to dry and you don&#x27;t need much, it lasts me about two days even if I sweat which it takes a lot for me to sweat but, this wins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Secret user for many years.  When the opportunity came up to review new Secret Outlast I was wondering how they could improve it.  I made the sacrifice and skipped showering one day to test out the 48 hour timeframe.  I can say that Secret Outlast really does provide protection for two days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features I like are:&lt;br /&gt;1. It goes on clear; no possibility of white marks&lt;br /&gt;2. Just one click and you have enough Gel for each underarm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the Active Fresh scent but I generally use unscented.  I&#x27;ll replace my usual Secret product with the Unscented Secret Outlast from now on.</li>
            <li> Works Great! No sweat stains, smell fresh, and can change my shirt without leaving streak marks.</li>
            <li> Love that it is unscented, it does feel really wet going on, but dries really fast. Overall it is great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but I think I will stick with scented</li>
            <li> I live in South Carolina. It&#x27;s HOT in South Carolina. It&#x27;s humid and gross. I have had such trouble finding a deodorant that would work well for me and last throughout the day. I recently received a sample from Secret to test and review. I absolutely looooove this deodorant. I don&#x27;t usually have much luck with gels, but this doesnt leave you feeling sticky like some do. It goes on smooth and dries quickly. No annoying white marks rubbing off on clothes. The odor and wetness protection easily lasts over 24 hours, even when outside on the beach. Its awesome and I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I got to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel thanks to BzzAgent and Secret. It has a great smell, dries fast, doesn&#x27;t leave marks, and keeps you dry. I would recommend this to any ladies that struggle with keeping dry it really is a great product</li>
            <li> I think so far I have positives and a few negatives for the Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant. For negatives I would say it took several dozen turns just to get the gel to come up so I could use it when first opening it up, I actually began to think I got a bad one and there was nothing it it. When it did come up it was either to much or not enough making me thing I would always over use or never get enough and in the long run made me think I would go through it quicker. I am still deciding on the sent, while it was a bit over powering at first thinking wow I&#x27;m going to smell like a giant deo stick today it faded shortly after applying leaving me to so far positive that I have just a nice light fresh sent, just enough to make me feel fresh. As for it being a gel I feel may not last as long but we shell see...... I will update again :) Another positive is I am usually very sensitive when it comes to underarm products and so far I have had no issues, so that is GREAT! As for working under pressure, im still on the line as some days I feel i need to reapply. Do love love love the fact I don&#x27;t have to worry about any white marks on my clothes, which is a huge selling point for me!! #epic48 #Gotitfree!</li>
            <li> I sampled this courtesy of BzzAgent. The first thing I noticed is this completely clean scent smells almost exactly the same as the one I normally wear. It is really a clean scent, so they’ve named it aptly. When it comes to gels, I wish they dried a little faster. Having a wet feeling until the deodorant sets is not ideal. This one seemed to take about 10 minutes. To limit the wet feeling while I was performing other tasks, I tried to apply this as last-minute in the dressing process as possible. That helped a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does go on clear and will not stain your clothes. The 0.5oz sample lasted me a little over three weeks using it once or twice a day depending on outings. You do not need a second application in most cases, but I applied again on occasions I took a night-time shower after taking a day time shower. I do not usually shower twice a day, but I make exceptions on sweaty days or after swimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did keep me fresh most of the day. On particularly hot days, I noticed it does not control sweat as much as the clinical strength days. At the end of two of my theme park days, I did not smell as good as I would have with the clinical strength version either. I did not smell bad, but I did not smell good either. Even when I tour theme parks with my Secret Clinical Strength version, I smell good at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Keeps me fresh all day.</li>
            <li> Like that it&#x27;s not white, but in sweaty conditions, it fails for me.  It would have worked for me a couple of years ago, but it doesn&#x27;t work now (have to go back to clinical strength).</li>
            <li> I talked with my co-workers  Shondell, Machera and Erica to give them the results of day one. Secret outlast left  no white marks one clothes. I barely knew  I had it on. My under arms stayed dry all day long.  The smell lasts all day as well.  I was pleasantly surprised. I could still smell the deodorant at the end of my day. Of course I got the obvious question, would you buy Secret outlast, or are you just saying this stuff because you got a free sample to test out by being a bzzz agent. My response was as you all know I love to try new thing but when it come to my body if the product is not a good fit I would not hesitate to say so. I&#x27;m know for my strong opinions.  If I don&#x27;t like something you will know. I love Secret outlast clear gel. The way it makes my arms feel. I will continue to use my Secret oulast clear gel until it&#x27;s gone. I will give my final opinion when it&#x27;s all gone, but for know I give it 4 stars!</li>
            <li> I normally would never buy a gel deodorant (don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve EVER used gel before this), but I received this free to try, and I&#x27;m glad I did! I didn&#x27;t realize I needed a deodorant intervention until I used this stuff. I never have odor issues, but I sometimes have wetness halfway through the day- which I assumed was just life. I wore this for 24 hours without reapplication and had no odor or wetness! It dries very quickly, and I didn&#x27;t have any white marks on my clothing. Oh, and the scent (although &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34;) is great! It&#x27;s one of those products you want to keep using because the scent is so clean and fresh! I&#x27;m extremely impressed with Secret and this gel, and I will absolutely be purchasing this!</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try this product with my BzzAgent Campaign and Secret providing it for free. The scent is very clean but may be stronger than other deodorants. I tested this product on a hot summer day while running errands which included a lot of unloading and loading items from my car and walking to my apartment. I still felt dry and could not smell anything other than the scent of the deodorant. My most favorite thing about this product is no white streaks!</li>
            <li> I have been very impressed with Secret throughout my lifetime (age 64 now) and this stuff is the best so far.  No odor, no streaks, no sweat!</li>
            <li> I recently received this product as a tester for free from Secret and decided to give it a try. I usually use a sold deodorant and hate how they always seem to leave behind a white mess. I was excited to try a gel again, as I haven&#x27;t used a gel in many, many years. Yesterday I put the deodorant on in the morning before leaving for work, no white marks, so that was a good start. I didn&#x27;t like the sticky feel the gel left behind, but it seemed to go away after it dried. Sitting in an air conditioned office all day didn&#x27;t offer much to see how the product worked but throughout the day it seemed to be fine. After walking through downtown and then doing some light housework at home I noticed that my underarms again felt sticky and wet. I did not feel like it was keeping me dry at all, it was an uncomfortable feeling, like I had never put anything on in the first place accompanied by a sticky feeling. My day was no where near a 24 hour period so I&#x27;m not sure how this would add up if I had a longer day with a work out or any outside time during our hot summers. The scent wasn&#x27;t overpowering so that is also a plus, but I ended up tossing this product to the side and doubt I will use it again, especially during the summertime.</li>
            <li> The ad for this antiperspirant brags, &amp;#34;No white marks!&amp;#34; Well, no wonder.  There are no white marks, since almost no gel&lt;br /&gt;appeared. Ever. Directions tell us to Click once or twice, for the perfect amount of deodorizing gel to emerge. I faithfully Clicked,&lt;br /&gt;with no result. Then I clicked another twenty or thirty times. Same outcome. At last, in frustration, I gave the top of the&lt;br /&gt;dispenser a sharp rap, and a bit of gel appeared. Just a wee dab; not enough for anything except a mouse&#x27;s armpit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was an inexpensive Add-On purchase. Am I supposed to congratulate myself that only a few dollars were lost&lt;br /&gt;on a completely worthless, useless product that did nothing that it was supposed to do?</li>
            <li> Great consistency and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Got a chance to try this product for free via the ClearlyBetterChallenge through Secret &amp; I must say that I love it! The one I got is scented and though it&#x27;s a clear gel, it doesn&#x27;t take long to dry and it keeps me feeling fresh all day. It definitely keeps up with how hard I work. I would honestly recommend this to all my family and friends.</li>
            <li> It kept me feeling fresh and dry all day love secret it really kept the secret well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like this product.  I was looking for Secret clinical and when I found it, it was quite spendy so I decided to try this.  It makes my skin itch.</li>
            <li> Felt slimy when applied and the whole container was messy. I threw it out before I was even half way through the product.</li>
            <li> I have been a Secret user now for 34 years.  It&#x27;s a brand I trust and no matter what changes are made, it&#x27;s a product I can depend on. The Secret Outlast Women&#x27;s Clear Gel met my expectations also.  It does go on wet, but dries fairly quick.  I do wait to put a shirt on until dry.  As for coverage, 2 clicks of product under each arm is ample for me.  And it does protect me against wetness and odor.  Sometimes after shaving, I do experience a slight burning if I put this on right after.  But it goes away.</li>
            <li> i was given this product as part of a bzz agent review and i was skeptical because my past experience with gel deodorant was that it was cold and gooey, however this product surprised me. It is a bit gooey and then it dries relatively quickly. It last really well and left my shirt dry all day. I tend to sweat a lot and am active all day with 3 kiddos so it gets put to the test. Overall i&#x27;d say it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Invisible Solid keeps you dry, fearless and fresh all day long, and beyond. I got a fee sample from BzzAgent</li>
            <li> I was happy to get the chance to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel free from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;I have had some busy days lately, one of which included me walking around outside in the heat for most of the day. While it does take a little bit of time to dry it was worth the wait for me. I did not have to reapply deodorant throughout my day, which when you are busy can be annoying. overall i really liked this deodorant and the cost is right around the typical deodorant cost so it is worth giving a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i did receive this product as a free trial from secret and Bzzagent all opinions shared are my own.</li>
            <li> I am constantly in the need for an advanced odor protection deodorant and Secret Outlast Clear Gel has not disappointed.  On top of that, I&#x27;ve been able to go streak free as well!  Secret Outlast has kept me looking clean all summer.  #LifeHack #epic48 #gotitfree</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for about a week now and I was actually very pleasantly surprised at how good it is!  Years ago I tried one of Secret&#x27;s clear gel deodorants and didn&#x27;t care for it at all. I remember it being kinda sticky and took quite a while to dry after putting it on so when Secret offered to send me a free sample I wasn&#x27;t too excited about it, but figured why not since it had been years since I last tried their gel deodorant and I&#x27;m so happy that I did!!! The gel dries fast, doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky feel that I remember, it smells pretty good, leaves NO white marks, and most importantly it literally OUTLASTS my day!! Oh and it washes off good too! i hate it when a deodorant leaves a residue after I shower and this deodorant doesn&#x27;t do that. All in all I give this deodorant a huge two thumbs up and will definitely buy another when my free sample that Secret gave me for a promotion is all gone!!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product by Bzzagent and was asked to give my honest opinion. I would recommend this deodorant because it does provide 24hr protection. There are no white marks and the freshness lasts all day! I like the clear gel because there is no guessing when you run out it shows how much is left!</li>
            <li> I received my secret outlast clear gel from Bzzagent and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I have tried different types of deodorant through the years from the regular powdery stuff, sprays, and clear gels and none have left me feeling clean at the end of the day. With most of them they left a mark in my clothing and I still smelled sweaty at the end of the day which makes me feel nasty and dirty. With this clear gel it left no marks on my black shirt and I still smelled as fresh as I did when I put it on which for me is great I chase around 3 kids daily and am constantly cleaning so I sweat a lot and to find one that keeps the smelly armpit smell away is ok in my book. Thank you secret and thank you Bzzagent for this amazing product.</li>
            <li> I love secret outlast clear gel. Its especially great in the summer when you wear short sleeves or tank tops and don&#x27;t want to get the white deodorant on your clothes or worse get it clumped up under your arm. I love that it dries fast and stays strong all day long! No messy streaks is a definite plus! Thank you BzzAgent and Secret for letting me try my new favorite deodorant!</li>
            <li> I got a free sample from Secret and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. The Secret Outlast Clear Gel is amazing. When I applied the gel it wasn&#x27;t cold and I didn&#x27;t cringe like most gel deodorant. It lasted all day from getting dressed in the morning until I laid down that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a busy mom and it also being summer. I couldn&#x27;t have gotten this at a better time. I used this for 3 days for and I&#x27;m not missing my old deodorant. I had no white streaks. I even went swimming with my little ones and when I got out I didn&#x27;t feel the need to apply more. I will continue to wear this Outlast Clear Gel. I have referred many friends and family members to this product. I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I had nothing bad to say so i figured i would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for a deodorant to keep you dry and oder free this IS the product for you</li>
            <li> I have always tended to use men&#x27;s deodorant because the women&#x27;s never held up all day in my opinion. I also have very sensitive skin so many of the women&#x27;s scents are irritating. Lucky for me after testing this out it was great. I had no reactions and it lasted!&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com</li>
            <li> Unscented gel antiperspirant &amp; deoderant is often difficult to find.  This product provides absolutely great &amp;#34;silent&amp;#34; protection without leaving rings on clothes .</li>
            <li> For years I have been using Secret Powder Fresh deodorant. Yet, I was still faced with sweating or over powering odor from my daily routine on more stressful days. I had tried different powders of different brands, and I had tried the Secret clinical strength. It still did not work and left a strong smell of &amp;#34;my armpits need help&amp;#34;. Clinical strength came out a few years ago and after I tried it, I swore I would never try another &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; deodorant again. Until, I was offered to try Outlast Clear Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time trying it, I was skeptical because I thought it would be very similar to Clinical Strength. When I opened the deodorant, I was surprised to find, that it actually smelled pleasant. Still a bit strong, but more pleasant than other gel deodorants. When I applied the clear gel it started to dry immediately. I was concerned that it would leave a wet feeling, but no, not at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even took this a step further! I wanted to see how good of a job this wet gel would work on both smooth skin, and not so smooth skin! Armpit hair seems to be a thing for the ladies of 2015. So, I grew my armpit hair out for 35 days for the first time in my life to see how good this deodorant could work for me. With smooth skin, the gel dries quicker and definitely holds close to the 48 hours. However, after 35 days, I tried this deodorant again, and found that even though it is a wet gel, and feels like it is covering my entire armpit, I did notice the deodorant was less effective and held out about half the time of 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think about all of the deodorants I have tried to fight my sweat and odor and I would have to put this second to best. I would still prefer to use my normal secret powder fresh for my T-Shirt days. I would definitely use Outlast if I were wearing a tank top or a sleeveless dress. Outlast leaves NO markings at all! True to its word! The aroma of the deodorant however, is slightly overbearing for my regular T-shirt days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to say thank you to BzzAgent for the opportunity to try this product free of charge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to say thank you to BzzAgent for the opportunity to try this product free of charge!</li>
            <li> This is truly my hero in disguise or rather my armpits. I was in a gray tshirt and never had any armpit stains or pit stains. This product lives up to the 48 hour odor and wetness protection. I never smelled bad and I used the unscented formula. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other scented forms and continue to purchase Secret Outlast as my go-to deodorant. It never left any white marks either, makes it faster to leave out the door. You&#x27;ll be amazed by this product! #secretoutlast #epic48 #imabzzagent #gotitfree</li>
            <li> My new favorite! The name fits perfectly because it does outlast any other deodorant I&#x27;ve tried. After applying my underarms are immediately dry and stay dry all day long. No need to reapply! And I love the refreshing scent!</li>
            <li> I got to try this product for free through bzzagent. It works great, but if it&#x27;s too hot outside it does not work. I don&#x27;t usually sweat. This is still my go to deodorant! It works fine just as long as it&#x27;s not too hot outside.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel from BzzAgent for review purposes. I am very active and spend a large amount of time walking. I walk an average of 1-2 miles per day. I live in Texas and need something that can withstand the brutal Texas summer heat. With temperatures hovering around 100 degrees, I’ve had the opportunity to test this product in extreme heat conditions. This review is based upon my experiences over the course of several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Secret Outlast for several days and can honestly say that the product has lived up to most of the hype. Secret Outlast is advertised as a fast drying product without any residue that will provide wetness and odor protection for up to 48 hours. I applied the product and the gel dried quickly and did not leave a residue. On one of the days, I decided to go for a walk around 1:00PM for about 2 miles. After concluding my walk, I can report that while my body was drenched in sweat, my underarms were dry as can be with no odor. If only Outlast could be used on the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not been brave enough to test out the 48 hour claim since I can’t get myself to go without showering for 2 days but I woke up in the mornings without any odor from my underarms either. The product does seem to last at least overnight. I woke up and did the sniff test and was still smelling pretty fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I found the product to meet my expectations. I’ve tried many of the clinical deodorants which are much more expensive and this seems to do a better job for less money. My only caveat with this product was the smell. I typically prefer a floral or summery scent than the clean scent available for this product.</li>
            <li> FEELS PLEASANTLY NICE ON THE SKIN,LONG LASTING, DOES NOT FLAKES ,CUTE CONTAINER , WISH PRICE WILL BE LOWER.</li>
            <li> I must say that I love this product it really works for 24 hours. Love the fact that it goes on clear an leaves no residue.&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first since I haven&#x27;t always had the best luck with clear solids. However, this one dries almost instantly and dries clear with no residue. I definitely put this deodorant to the test the first day I wore it with a day spent volunteering outside and an evening working ushering in a theatre and at the end of the day I didn&#x27;t smell. With other brands I would have needed to reapply several times throughout the day. I like the clean scent of this product, too.&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> I am already a fan of the Secret brand so trying this new version wasn&#x27;t a stretch for me. This week I am leaving for a conference where I know no one and have never been so I will be putting Secret Outlast to the extensive test! I love that it is clear so it doesn&#x27;t mark up my clothing. Especially in situations where I feel I need extra coverage meaning use more deodorant! I also like the scent active fresh scent. It is pleasantly clean smelling but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> I am not really impressed by this deodorant at all. I can definitely tell I have some odor issues going on within just a few hours of wearing this product. So it definitely does not last 48 hours. It also leave a wet sticky feel once I apply it. This is one product that is just not making the mark for me. I will continue using other Secret product, just not this particular one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am trying the product for free with no obligation to review thanks to Secret.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is unique in that it actually does what it says it will! The gel goes on quickly, cleanly and not much is needed. Even after working out I did not have odor, and only a little sweat. I used sport fresh scent, and found it to be pleasant without overpowering. The deodorant did not irritate my skin in any way. Great product!&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I got this deodorant for free for a BzzAgent campaign. On that note... This deodorant is for those of us who have active lives and plain old regular deodorant wont do the trick. This goes on clear and dries super fast. I was very impressed. It was wet one second and dry before I even got my shirt on. I have two kids and they keep me on my toes. This is one of the only deodorants that can keep up. I am fearless when I put this on. No worries. I love it and will continue to use it. Once my sample runs out, I&#x27;m going to get me some more. I&#x27;m also going to get some for my daughter. I&#x27;m normally a solid girl, but this clear gel actually exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I have used regular &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; deodorant for a lot of my life. I hated having to wait to get dressed for fear that the deodorant would come off on my clothing. With Secret Outlast Gel the fear is gone. It goes on smooth with no mess. The only draw back is that it is a little cold when you first put it on, but worth getting used to, to make sure that I have clean clothing and can get dressed right away!  s a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical to try this product since I&#x27;ve been using Degree deodorant all of my life. I have tried other secret products in the past and they just didn&#x27;t work well for me. I&#x27;ve also never tried a gel before so I wasn&#x27;t for sure what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I was pretty satisfied with this product. It goes on clear and dries quickly which is a plus. it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothing like some other deodorants do. when first applied, It has a cold/wet feeling which was new to me. If it didn&#x27;t dry so quickly I wouldn&#x27;t have liked it. My only complaint about this product is that I don&#x27;t like the scent. It just smells too perfumey for me. The deodorant last me all day which was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product free from clearlybetterchallenge.com  as a member of One2One Network</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved this Secret Outlast Clear Gel.  It went on clear and stayed clear.  I didn&#x27;t have any white marks.  It also smelled great.  I love that I could smell it all day long, and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about any odor.  I also love that it says that it will last for 48 hours, although I will probably never know because I reapply daily.  All in all, I have to say it is another great product that I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this deodorant as a buzzagent. I am very skeptical of gel deoderants, haven&#x27;t used them in years due to the sticky gooey feeling. However, this was a nice change from my regular deoderant. No white streaks on shirts! Though I probably wouldn&#x27;t use this everyday, its definitely good with tank tops!</li>
            <li> This is easy to use to much, but I love that I don&#x27;t get white streaks on my clothing!</li>
            <li> Once again Secret has outdone itself..This is soon to be a favorite of mine!!! Have never been a big fan of the gel, but after I tried it I liked it. Drys fast and tends to last all day!!!</li>
            <li> Loving this stuff! it works great, goes on clear and dries clear and anything that gets on my shirt cleans off easily. I recieved this product from a BuzzAgent campaign and will totally buy it again</li>
            <li> This is a really awesome product , it keeps you dry i test it out over the heat wave during this summer and it holding up . No wierd white spots when i wear armless top i love it</li>
            <li> I was given this product for free from bzzagent, to write a review.  I love this deodorant.  It goes on, and dries quickly.  It has a lasting scent, and does not stain clothes.  I wear a lot of black, and this is great.  It has amazing sweat and odor protection.  Dosent stain my white clothes, and definately does not have that white build up like solid deodorants</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to have a chance to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel for free thanks to Secret and I have to say it&#x27;s definitely among the better deodorants on the market. No white lines to ruin your clothes anymore! It works at protecting you from the chance of embarrassment due to odors and unsightly white marks. Hands down a leader in it&#x27;s industry!</li>
            <li> It works great, goes on smooth, smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks!</li>
            <li> I love that this product goes on clear, with no white lines to worry about. I am sensitive to strong smells and while I can smell the scent of this, it does not bother me, I actually like it. It lasts all day and and is very pleasant to apply and use.&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> as a member of one2one network, i received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com and being that i am almost 50 years old, and have used many types of deodorant, i am so excited to say that the secret outlast cleargel i was sent actually did what it claims to do...though i doubted it completely! first of all i do not need something to work for 48 hours, as i do shower daily...but, i would love to have something work for the entire day that i am using it, between showers, and this did! i chose to do the real test when i took a day off of work to go on a field trip for my almost 5 year old granddaughter, knowing that my other 2 younger granddaughters would be there as well. first of all, the field trip starts with a 30 minute drive, with said children, then a good 25 minute wait before the zoo actually allows us inside..which any adult knows is complete torture when you have young ones. then there is the walking, carrying, etc. involved during the 2 hour zoo trip, and because the kids know of another closeby attraction, add another hour to said field trip.  after that there is the 30 minute drive home, as well as unpacking the vehicle of all of the items necessary for a comfortable field trip. after the grandchildren went back home with my daughter, i still had many hours left in the day to test the product....and i did.  my husband and i were working on digging and planting in our flower beds, and the cleanup involved afterwards, then getting dinner ready, eating, cleanup after that, as well as other preperations for the next day that take a couple more hours. so after getting up at 7 am, and applying the secret clearlast gel and finally getting ready to shower at 11pm, i was extremely happy to realize that i had not gotten wet under my arms, and there was no marks on my clothing!!!! i will definitely purchase this product!</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant. As a faithful Secret deodorant user, I received  a sample from BzzAgent.com. This product is consistent with the Secret line of products as it offers 48 hour odor protection, fends off armpit sweat and leaves me feeling clean and refreshed. I prefer gel deodorants because I do not like the chunky white sticks – they create stains and making for a painfully embarrassing experience when you left your arms – no one wants to see the white stuff!</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a fan of Secret for a long time, so when I was offered the chance to review this product I jumped at the chance. ALthough I prefer a solid deodorant over a gel, I do like this product. I spend a lot of time working out and this Secret, held up. As far as the wet feeling from the gel, it dries pretty quickly. It also held up to its name about being a clear deodorant. It didn&#x27;t leave any marks on clothing or me.</li>
            <li> Great product. Goes on clear and dries clear. No marks on shirt.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free promotional item and at first I really liked it, but after one really long day I found it did not work. I became self conscious and from then on I could tell it wasn&#x27;t working as well as I hoped. Gels just don&#x27;t work that great.</li>
            <li> Got this free to try from a bzz campaign. I love it and will buy more! Goes on clear, no stains, dries within seconds and last all day in Iowa&#x27;s hot humid weather! I love the smell too. Everything you need in a deodorant!</li>
            <li> I used this for a wedding I was in and it works, I would and have bought this again, the best thing is a little go&#x27;s a long way</li>
            <li> I like this because, first of all, it works great.  It is clear so it doesn&#x27;t mark up my shirt and I like that it comes unscented.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear and it keeps me dry, but not for 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a woman who sweats. I sweat on a normal day when I&#x27;m not being active and it&#x27;s not particularly hot. That&#x27;s just the way my body works. On top of that, I&#x27;m a runner, so I need a deodorant with a strong antiperspirant. I&#x27;ve never found anything which works for me 100%. Secret Outlast didn&#x27;t stand a chance of keeping me completely dry for an entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros for this are:&lt;br /&gt;1.  It&#x27;s a gel but it dries very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It does not leave marks on your clothes when you put them on (you must wait 30 seconds for it to dry!)&lt;br /&gt;3.  It feels good and it works  (even for me, for a while)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;1.  It doesn&#x27;t last 48 hours as an antiperspirant&lt;br /&gt;2.  I went through it twice as fast as my normal deodorant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for free in a BzzKit  After using it for the last couple of weeks, I have to say that I&#x27;m making the switch to Secret Outlast. It may not be strong enough to keep me dry for an entire day, but it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought I would enjoy this deodorant, and was excited to receive it as a product tester. Alas, it doesn&#x27;t last an entire day for me, and the scent isn&#x27;t very pleasant toward the end of the day. Also, using it straight out of the shower stings the pits!</li>
            <li> Goes on a little cold but dries quickly and clear. I received a sample through bzzagent to try, and i would definitely buy this product</li>
            <li> I got this product free via bzzagent. This product controlled my sweat and odor. When you first put it on, it feels a bit awkward but the name does not lie, it outlasts many deodorants. In the North Carolina 100 degree heat, I was very surprised how well this deodorant worked. I also have to wear suits in this hot weather for 9 hours each day and this is the deodorant I rely on. So much so, that I leave one in my office desk for morning freshness. I never have to reapply it. I like the product and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good deodorant.</li>
            <li> Smells great works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a FREE SAMPLE of Secret Outlast Clear Gel thanks to #SECRET and I have to say this is a great product. I love it and will continue to buy and use this!  It smells great, dries super fast, and lasts through my crazy days and nights as a stay at home mom and home based business owner!  Best part? NO WHITE MARKS!!! We all know how embarrassing those white marks can be, especially when we get all dolled up for a seldom date night, well no longer a problem now that I have this product!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample size of this deodorant from a buzz kit for being a bzzagent. I already like the secret brand, but I am just not big on these gel deodorants. I felt like this was still wet, even 10 minutes after I put it on. It did its job, I just am not a fan of the gooey feeling it leaves on my underarms also by the end of the day it was like little beads of this deodorant on my armpits. I am not thrilled with this but thank you secret for the free trial size sample.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter Becca tried out Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant on Thursday for cheer-leading practice. She is happy to report that it worked great! No white marks and strong protection! And the best part is we got to try it free from BzzAgent! #GotItFree #epic48</li>
            <li> I love that this deodorant has a 48 hour protection. I must admit some mornings get super hectic with 3 kids running around and I am the last one to get ready. Deoderant gets forgotten at least once a week. With this I do not have to worry I am protected from the last application.  I also love the clear gel.  There is NOTHING worse than white marks on that treasured summer time staple, the black tank top.</li>
            <li> BZZZZ! Sample That became my favorite! This has a unique and beautiful smell that does not change after sweating and does not leave white stripes on my clothes every time I change clothes that Day! You know what I mean, you get a nice shirt on, then get dolled up and change your mind. When you change your shirt even with the clear solids, it is WHITE, and that shirt is dirty no matter what now!!!! AHHH, it is such a pain. I love this new deodorant and the smell, keeps sweat from coming and getting all over your clothes, and good for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;I love that it goes on clear and is easy to use. It&#x27;s a must have for all women. It helps against odor as well, so it&#x27;s great for when you work out!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s affordable and the packaging is nice as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the thickness of the gel, it was just right and not too much like most gels I have used. It stayed in place and I am a frequent sweater and found that it was able to keep up with me. I think it&#x27;s great for me in the summer.</li>
            <li> A new favorite for me. I like having control of the amount issued from the top after a twist at the bottom. It did not start easily but once it came up, the flow didn&#x27;t dispense too freely but easy enough to control and get just enough for use without waste. I like that it applies clear and similar to gel but less heavy feel to it. I don&#x27;t know about lasting 48 hours but I will say it has a clean scent that will last through a busy day at least and maybe a hour work out. In any case my routine is shower and once a day use.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is great. Keeps your armpits smelling fresh all day and night. I only have to apply it once a day and does a wonderful job. The gel dries right when it becomes in contact with the skin. No marks or stains on skin or clothes. I got to try this thanks to BzzAgent. They sent me a sample size but now i will have to buy the full size.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is great. The smell is a bit strong at first, but it smells good and it really does last a long time(close to 48 hours). I also was able to try on clothes at the store and not worry about getting any white marks on them, like I do with my regular deodorant, which is reason enough for me to switch to Secret Outlast! I am so thankful to  Secret for allowing me to try a free sample of the product to bzz about.</li>
            <li> Secret is my favorite, no matter what scent.</li>
            <li> The product has a new formula (at least as of my Feb-2015 order).  The new formula is wetter and sticker :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient listed on this page (Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly) is no longer correct - it has been replaced with Aluminum Zirconium Octachlorohydrex Gly.  I don&#x27;t know why, but it is a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure that all of the 5-star reviews are accurate for the previous formula.  This is no longer the same product and should get a new name.  Before this product, I used Mitchum, until they made a similar change.  The search will go on...</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. I thought that this deoderant did exactly what it claimed - reduced underarm wetness! I tried it out a few times before writing this to make ssure my review was up to par. The only reason I gave it four stars was because it was wet for a minute or two after applying.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always excited to try a new deoderant. Secret&#x27;s new Outlast Clear Gel smelled great before I even opened it! It definitely kept me smelling fresh all day and not having to worry about white marks was a huge plus over Secret&#x27;s Clinical Strength deoderant that I&#x27;ve been using. However, the new Outlast Clear Gel did not do much to help wetness. If you have a problem with wetness, you may want to try something else.</li>
            <li> Works very well to help with odor protection. I can&#x27;t say how well it works beyond about 12 hours but up until 12 hours, it still worked very well. It went on clear and did not leave any residue at all. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample from bzzAgent to try out and review and I really like it ! It holds up and dies exactly what it said it would, the only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is I feel the product wouldn&#x27;t last as long vs a solid , it seems like you use more gel vs the solid .</li>
            <li> With five children I lead a pretty active life. I&#x27;m always on the go, running around, just grocery shopping is a complete workout. Then add in the North Carolina heat and humidity and it doesn&#x27;t take long for me to sweat through every deodorant and end up with underarm wetness. I was a little skeptical Secret Outlast would work... But now I&#x27;m excited I received this sample of outlast clear gel! Not only does it keep me dry, but it goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t get my clothes all yucky. Secret outlast is a keeper, that&#x27;s for sure!&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s new Outlast clear gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, without feeling sticky.  Works for a long time and seems to kick in when sweating or working hard.  Lasted longer than I expected, but I still needed to use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent I got was actually Active Fresh but I was not able to review that scent. Let me start by saying that even though I got my sample for free, I did stop using my normal deodorant in order to give this a fair review and my experience and opinion is 100% genuine. Also, I must say that I am a few years into menopause and I have found odor and wetness to be more of a problem since I started menopause. That being said...let me start with the pros. I was afraid there would be a problem with wetness being that this was a gel and I usually don&#x27;t use a gel deodorant. I found this to be a non issue! Big PLUS!! I was also worried about it being sticky and it wasn&#x27;t. It also seemed to dry quickly for me and did not require any extra drying time. I also love the active fresh scent. My con is a big one though - odor control. It conked out mid day on a normal, non stressed, non sweaty day. Not good. Thumbs down on odor control and that is a big need...so I will not be using any longer or repurchasing. Sorry Secret, not this time.</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am a huge fan of all secret products because they are well made and lasts a long time. so, i was super excited about trying out this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love this product because it lasts a long time. the smell is absolutely amazing. and i love the fact that it is clear, which is a great thing when i am wearing dark colors it wont show up on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a product i will be buying once my sample runs out!</li>
            <li> Switched from Dove to Secret Outlast thanks to BZZAGENT and I must say the difference is incredibly huge.. I walk every morning over a mile to my local train station and Dove never held up the way Secret did.. best thing about this one is that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong deodorant smell which I also like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same deodorant for 15 years because it was the only thing that worked for me. That was until I tried Secret outlast. It&#x27;s now my &amp;#34;new brand&amp;#34; of deodorant! As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> Our dermatologist highly recommends this for men and women. It literally illiminates under arm rashes and irritations. I build cabinets and do a lot of sweating. No odor and no rash. A great product. Gel, no fragrance, super!!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and I hate perfumed deodorant.  I also live in Arizona, so sweating can be quite an issue during the summer months.  This goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my clothes.  This works really well, and I haven&#x27;t broken out in hives.</li>
            <li> It really works (even if you skip a day).</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast as a free sample as part of my BzzAgent kit (#GotItFree). I switched away from Secret years ago because the formula that I loved and had used for years suddenly (but not so mysteriously) stopped performing once they released the Secret Clinical Strength for $8 a stick. I was pleased to see that for about $4 a stick, Secret Outlast worked really well and I may switch back. I can&#x27;t speak to whether or not it lasts a full 48 hours since I apply deodorant every morning but it worked well up until I showered the next day for sure.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of the Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant through BZZagent. My very first thought was Is there anything in this small bottle to test?  But this bottle contain a lot to test and made you satisfy or not, depends !! I love the scent I had received. Nothing fruity or overpowering. I was very glad about that. It advertises that for 48 &#x27;epic&#x27; hours I can be protected from odor AND wetness. Well I had to put that to the test. And yes proved itself. Really a long lasting Fragrance and protection. I don’t know why some people mentioned that it not last long? I love how nice and easy it went on. just glides on!  It didn&#x27;t feel sticky to me and there was no white residue at all. While I felt like the odor protection worked quite nice, every time I started to sweat I could smell the scent of the deodorant, Still I am not too much sweaty. I love the Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant because of the scent and the odor protection.I like to wait a minutes or two to be sure it&#x27;s dry but I&#x27;d probably be good before then.The scent is nice and fresh and not at all overwhelming. So far it has preformed super in all categories</li>
            <li> Secret is my favorite deodorant and outlasts any other brand I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a bunch of deodorants over the years, and previously settled on SpeedStick style white cake and Sure roll-ons that, over time, always resulted in a thick, clumpy build-up in my shirts, and an ever-present sticky coating on my pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So a few years ago, I stole some of my wife&#x27;s Secret gel, and haven&#x27;t looked back. It goes on clear and clean, doesn&#x27;t result in any cruddy residue buildup in my armpit hair, and it keeps me dry and odor-free. My wife pretty much agrees, though she she complains of gradual build-up if she doesn&#x27;t let this stuff dry for a few minutes before slipping into a shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get moderate BO when I sweat, and this product absolutely eliminates that problem for me short of when I&#x27;m really exerting myself and leaking sweat like a sieve.  Maybe that why Proctor &amp; Gamble dropped the &amp;#34;Strong enough for man; made for a woman&amp;#34; tag line? Works for me.</li>
            <li> I can hardly count the number of times in the past that I have twisted up a solid stick deodorant only to have the stick break off. My fault for twisting too far up, of course, but sometimes the stick was rather dry making the application process difficult. This gel is so much easier to use. Twist 3 or 4 times, apply the gel and put the cap back on. You don&#x27;t have to twist anything back down. The gel goes on smoothly and evenly and dries fast.  As an antiperspirant and deodorant, it works very well. The price is considerably less than stores, and unscented is a plus for me too.</li>
            <li> Secret deodorant is my favorite brand. This item arrived very quickly and was well packaged. The deodorant is great.  It&#x27;s the unscented gel deodorant and is very effective. Men really can use it also.</li>
            <li> you need to but this it work amazing stay fresh all day</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product I was lucky enough to be able to try for free through BzzAgent. I generally only use clinical strength deodorant because nothing else works. For everyday wear, this is my new go to product. I don&#x27;t have to worry about odor, stains or streaks on the hottest or most humid days. As long as I allow the clear gel to dry I have no problems with streaks on my clothes. I absolutely love this for everyday and will definitely purchase. #GotItFree</li>
            <li> I got a free sample from bzzagent in the mail. I was really amazed at how it works because it lasts up to 48 hours and protects from wetness due to sweat. It blocks bad odors for up to 48 hours which makes it different from other competiting brands</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I received this as a promotion, and all opinions are my own. I live in the hot, humid South, and need good protection. This is it! I put it on every night before bed (I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 weeks) and it works great! I never smell or sweat, and I work an on the go job and go to the gym 5 times a week. There are never any white marks on my clothes, and it dries quickly and not sticky. It has a light fresh smell, but once you put it on there is not that &amp;#34;deodorant smell.&amp;#34; The only thing I do not like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t dispense evenly; sometimes you need one click, and sometimes you need 3.</li>
            <li> Got the opportunity to try this product for free and I absolutely loved it. In the summer I sweat so much it is unbearable that I take at least 3 showers for the day and still not feel clean. Secret outlast has dropped my showers down to 2 and if I get too lazy just one. I haven&#x27;t had to try it straight for 48hrs just because I love being clean, but most I have tried don&#x27;t last more than 8 hrs. So hooray. I am dry, not white streaks and it smiles amazingly fresh. I will buy it as my go to deodorant.</li>
            <li> I tried Secret Outlast thanks to a free sample from Secret. I tried it after giving birth as many woman know your body experiences lots of changes in that first week after giving birth. In the past I has sweat a lot, but when I used the Secret Outlast I sweat considerably less and did not have BO. I did notice a light fresh scent.  This will definitely be my go to deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 days and I really really like it! I&#x27;m a huge Dove fan and never cheated with them till now when I got a free sample from BzzAgent. It&#x27;s been really really good... It&#x27;s clear as it say and when you put it on you have to wait for it to dry which is understanding. But today I went outside to wash my dog and sweated crazy!! Usually with Dove I can smell my self a little even after using it... a slight order smell which I thought was normal till I used this today. But with the Secret Outlast Clear Gel, I didn&#x27;t smell a slight order at all... I think this works better for me... everybody has different experience and this was mine :)</li>
            <li> Love the new secret it smells awesome and make me feel fresh from the time I get up till the time I go to sleep!</li>
            <li> At first I thought I would love this deodorant and I did for a few days then it stopped working at all.  I sweat right through it and get rubbed raw.  It has a nice smell but for me it really doesn&#x27;t work.  #gotitfree #bzzagent</li>
            <li> I love that this has no scent.  I am very sensitive to smells and I really dis-like deodorants where I smell myself all day.  I saw some reviews that stated when applied that it burned.  This can happen after shaving as it is a gel.  I have found that all gel deodorants will do this.</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast free to test from BzzAgent. I like Secret products and the Secret Outlast has both positives and negatives for me.  I love the scent, the protection is great and so far I don&#x27;t see white streaks (which I don&#x27;t think I would anyway with a clear gel).  The one thing I do not find (and I only use 1-2 clicks) is the promoted \\&quot;few seconds\\&quot; drying time...it takes at least 20-30 seconds!  Also, I am not a great fan of gel deodorants, so this is a personal negative for me.  Overall Secret Outlast lives up to the Secret name!</li>
            <li> I have about 15 different brands of deodorant at home, I live in the desert and its a daily necessity. I was hesitant to try another gel, because I have never been a fan of gel deodorants before. I have to say I was impressed. I was lucky enough to be given a sample from secret and im so glad they did. They have a new buyer in me. The gel dries super quick and I never have to reapply. I stay smelling good all day and I never have white marks on my tank tops. Great product, will buy again!</li>
            <li> I received this from bzzagent to review. Usually I am not a gel person but this one works fairly well for me. I am using the &amp;#34;completely clean&amp;#34; scent and I think it has a nice light scent. Doesn&#x27;t leave me 100% dry but I also didn&#x27;t reapply as much and I couldn&#x27;t notice an odor coming from me. I like that it is clear so no more white marks for me</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel deodorant from BzzAgent and have been using it for the past few days. The first day I used it, I noticed that it went on clear and left no whiteness on my armpits. The smell was light, but clean smelling. It seemed to absorb quickly into my skin and left no wet feeling or clumps. I did yard work that day and it was hot outside so I could really tell if it worked or not. I noticed that I did sweat on my armpits though the day, but there was no smell that came from them. I only smelled the light smell of the deodorant. I did not have any armpit stains on my clothes by the end of the day. I also did not have any crumbs or caking on my armpits from the deodorant. I like that it keeps my armpits looking clean and they look like there&#x27;s no deodorant on them. I only wish that the smell of the deodorant was stronger because I like to notice my deodorant smell without having to directly smell my armpits.</li>
            <li> This is the best deoderant out there today! It leaves no white marks and is clean,leaves you without an odor even if you are a heavy sweater like me!  I even asked for it for Christmas &#x27;cause I don&#x27;t want to ever run out! This is security for me! Even in Las Vegas!!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing , it does exactly as it says. It provides me with hours of protection and doesn&#x27;t leave behind any white marks which numerous deodorant have that I&#x27;ve used in the past. This definitely is one of my favorites and I take it along with me to gym sessions and when I&#x27;m out on the track field. I would definitely recommend this for people who need maximum protection !</li>
            <li> I am a reporter from Bzzagent and I recently tried this product and it was one of the best deodorants I have ever tried! This deodorant lasted the whole day while I was running and playing basketball and I did not sweat or smell like I normally can with other brands! I LOVE this deodorant and I have told 5 people about it and they all promised to try!</li>
            <li> I was given this product free to try by secret.  I would not recommend this product for someone with sensitive skin, and I would not use it when you are planning to wear any non cotton based clothing. I had an issue with it staining and it also caused my skin to break out if I used it after a shower. When I used it the morning after a shower I did not have an issue breaking out my skin but it is something to keep in mind, I didn&#x27;t think it was as effective after about 8 hours as well. If you dont have sensitive skin you may be ok but it is something to keep in mind.</li>
            <li> This was surprisingly better than I expected. It had a very nice smell that lingered well after application and I have not seen any stains on my clothes. For a gel it also dries pretty quickly. The only thing for me was that it didn&#x27;t live up to the 48 hour claim. But I sweat a lot and I think that makes a difference to me. I definitely think you should give it a try. I got a trial size as a promotion from the company</li>
            <li> I love that it last so long .also leaves no white makes on me or my clothes .Im also trying the product for free thanks to Secret.I highly recommend this to everyone !</li>
            <li> this works as described. cant say it is the best i have ever used but then again i cant say its the worst i have ever tried. it is clear and stays clear so i am very pleased with that part.  its nice not having dark clothes with white deodorant streaks on them after getting dressed.</li>
            <li> This deodorant provides excellent odor protection.  I love that it goes on clear.  No more white marks on my clothes!  It does go on wet, and takes a few minutes to dry, but it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky to me.  And the price here is phenomonal- almost half the price the drug store is charging!  And the unscented is great for people that are sensitive to most other deodorant scents.</li>
            <li> I have tried a million different products and Secret is the best antiperspirant on the market. Definitely should market to men not just women.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! It doesnt leave the white marks behind like most other brands, and for someone who is overweight and sweats a lot this keeps up with my body odor! I orginially gained this from a buzzagent campaign for free, but I will for sure continue buying this!&lt;br /&gt;#gotitfree</li>
            <li> I just received a sample from bzzzagent and I will only purchase secret outlast from now on. No white marks on my shirts, no uncomfortable sweat this really worked.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product FREE thanks to Secret &amp; BzzAgent!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the one I can currently using, the scent of this deodorant is more feminine. I like the gel version because it goes on clear and stays clear and I can actually smell the amazing scent all day without having to sniff my pits!</li>
            <li> I love the Clear gel. I live in Florida and as you know it get super hot. I like how the gel keeps me protected for 48 hours! What I love more is that it&#x27;s clear and dry fast! You never have to worry about a white mark again.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. I don&#x27;t have streaks on my uniform top and I don&#x27;t sweat even in this hot summer weather. I like the way it smells and so far my friends are enjoying it, as well. Good pricing and product.</li>
            <li> amazing deoderant i love the way it smells and it lasts almost half the day compared to other deoderants i love secret outlast deoderant &amp;#60;i recieved this item for free in return of an honest product review from bzzagent</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but I love it. Before I got it for free, thanks to Secret &amp; BzzAgent, I was previously using an invisible solid but I kept getting cysts in my underarm area &amp; the doctor throught it was due to my deodorant clogging my pores. They have been popping up once a week. For the past month that i&#x27;ve been using this, I haven&#x27;t had any painful cysts.  I&#x27;m not sweating/wet like I thought id be, it&#x27;s not sticky, it dries super fast and I don&#x27;t smell anything weird (like old deodorant) while i&#x27;m at the gym. I will be buying this going forward!</li>
            <li> I received my free BzzAgent sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel right before leaving on my family vacation. I don&#x27;t typically use clear gel deodorants, because I don&#x27;t like the way my skin feels wet/cold after applying it. I was impressed when the Secret Outlast dried very quickly on my skin! Over the course of my vacation I went to the beach several times, went on a few boat rides, and did a lot of walking on hot humid days. The Secret Outlast Clear Gel held up great!! I was thankful for the 48-hour odor and wetness protection!!! I also loved the fresh scent! This was the perfect deodorant for a busy mom on vacation! Thanks Secret for helping me outlast the heat! #GotItFree</li>
            <li> The first thing I did when I received Secret deodorant was to smell it, and omg it was amazing. i loved the smell and i couldnt wait to put it on, but it didnt last very long, i had to reapply this multiple times daily so i was pretty happy when i finally ran out. i had told everyone at a womens outreach program about the deodorant and had them smell it and see what they thought before i used it and tried to hear what they all thought about it, everyone seemed to think it smelled amazing even though a few thought it was very overpowering, they still seems to like the overall smell. glad i got to try this for free from bzzagent, now i dont have to waste my money on it later.</li>
            <li> My husband actually smells good when his Old Spice antiperspirant kicks in but I&#x27;ve never found a woman&#x27;s scent that I wanted to smell when the going gets hot.  No smell is better than &amp;#34;peaches&amp;#34; or someone&#x27;s idea of &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Secret is the golden brand. Its not messy and it last long. Outlast has been a good product and I definitely recommend it. Got this product for free for review.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product.  But after applying it stayed sticky for at least 3 hours.  Once it finally dried it worked great and kept me dry all day.  It also smelled great.  But the fact that it stayed sticky for so long I will not purchase.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I normally do not like gel deodorant,but so far I&#x27;m loving Secret Outlast Clear Gel. Last all day and night,no odor,no sweat and hasn&#x27;t ruined my clothes. #gotitfree #epic48</li>
            <li> I received a stick of this deodorant to try for free from BzzAgent. It is a really good product. I like it because it does exactly what it says it will do - keep you feeling clean and dry all day. It goes on clear and smells really fresh the whole time I had it on. Personally I do switch deodorants often and this one seems like a diamond in the rough. My only issue with it is that it has aluminum in it for the wetness protection. I am waiting for the day when that is thrown in the trash never to be used again on any armpits around the world. There has got to be a more natural ingredient that can be used for wetness control other than the aluminum. For anyone that has body odor or wetness issues I would recommend this product as long as you&#x27;re okay with the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant so much, I have been using the same basic Secret deodorant for as long as I can remember but for the first time in years I am so impressed that I am making the switch. Thanks to Bzz Agent and thanks to Secret for allowing me to try the product for free. It dries seconds after application and keeps you dry all day. I have always struggled with wet armpit stains and the past few days I have been able to wear whatever shirt I like without any worry. I highly recommend this product. Thanks again Secret for sending me the free sample!</li>
            <li> i love this deoderant i thought it work leave my shirt wet becuase it was gel and i have never tryed gel but it dries very fastand it does last all day</li>
            <li> I recently received a free sample of secret outlast clear gel thanks to secret! I have used gels in the past, and I was really disappointed. They left my underarms feeling wet and sticky, not to mention the embarrassing residue it left behind on my clothes. I figured I would give Secret outlast a try. I was shocked! It dried sooo quickly, and did not feel sticky at all. Best of all, not nasty residue was left behind. The odor protection and wetness control are awesome, and it lasts up to 48 hours. Doesn&#x27;t get better than that! This product changed my opinion about deodorant gels have change in a positive way thanks to Secret!!</li>
            <li> I have used this for the last week and I love it. It has a great scent and it made me feel fresh without the white residue left after putting it on. It was definitely something I will buy again down the road. Loved it! I received this deodorant free from bzzagent. Thank you bzzagent!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of deodorants and have never found one that lasted all day. I got this one for free to try out and I was so excited. I love the clear gel better than any other kind. It goes on great and smells amazing also. This deodorant lasts all day and I will never have to remember apply again finding my new deodorant.</li>
            <li> I love the clear see through stick.  I can see how much I have left and when I need to make a run to the store for more.  It smells amazingly great.  It smells fresh and clean and kinda reminds me of water with hints of flowers.  Maybe like after a April shower or a Rain forest.  I love it lasts or says it last for 48 hours.  It does go on wet.  If your cold oh my how its cold when you put it on your pits!  Brr!  It does take a minute or so to dry.  I don’t know if its me, my skin or what it is but it never really actually felt dry for a while.  Felt kinda like a fan blowing on your arm pits kinda but when it actually drys it feels sticky.  Not sticky sticky but when you raise your arms from your side you can feel your arms and your under arms sticking.  Its not to bad but to me I hate it.  I hate to feel sticky under there even if its just a little.  I love the way the smell lasts and lasts.  I don’t think the Gel in the stick would last long.  I’ve only used it about 3 times and its almost half way gone.  I only use two clicks each time I put it on.  Usually when I try new deodorants I usually get a really bad rash.  I haven’t developed one yet but I have had moments where it has been itchy.  I would like to try this deodorant in  the solid to see if I would get a rash and it would be less sticky?  I do love the smell of this deodorant and would consider switching brands if it didn’t give me a rash or it wasn’t sticky in the solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I received  this / these sample(s) to test for free /complimentary from One2One Network, *clearlybetterchallenge.com and Secret®. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> (I received Secret Outlast Clear Gel to test out and any opinions are 100% my own.) I have to wear clear gels because of how much I sweat, and my old clear gel no longer worked. Secret Outlast Clear Gel is working awesome so far and keeping me dry all day! Even with chasing around toddler twins all day! Wore it to the zoo the other day and stayed dry climbing all the hills which felt awesome - my legs however did not. ;) I love that this clear gel doesn&#x27;t feel all wet and goopy going on so I can get dressed right away. Overall, it&#x27;s looking Secret Outlast Clear Gel is going to keep me dry all Spring and Summer!</li>
            <li> Now that I am switching over to sleeveless dress and tops, it is nice to find a deodorant that not only dries clear, but keeps me smelling good all day long. I have sensitive skin and already enjoy Secret brand deodorants, but the new Outlast has kept me feeling fresher longer. I use it before my morning run and I feel confident enough in my protection that I don&#x27;t mind being stopped to talk with neighbors along my route. Overall I have been thrilled with my initial bottle and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a product sample free from clearlybetterchallenge.com  as a member of One2One Network, but all opinions and experiences are my own.</li>
            <li> It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt darken your clothes with oily stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt leave a waxy white buildup on your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; so you will want to let it dry some before getting dressed.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I will use; I think it&#x27;s better than better than Clinical Strength. I personally don&#x27;t like scented varieties, and I don&#x27;t think needs any scent masking. It dries clear and really helps control perspiration.</li>
            <li> Leaves no residue at all!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I love the entire Secret brand, but Outlast is the best. I work as a bartender in an outdoor bar...in Florida. So, I obviously need something that will hold up the entire night. This product does that every night for me. Also, it&#x27;s great to be able to slide my shirt on and not have to worry about the mess it will leave on my clothes. I got a free sample from bzzz campaign and I will now continue to buy.</li>
            <li> this product is one of the best deodorants I have tried in a long time. I have been using this products for the past 5 months and continue to love it. Goes on smooth and cool and keeps me dry all day long wether I&#x27;m sitting at the house or outside laying by the pool. I recieved my 1st sample as part of a promotion from the brand. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this as part of a Bzzcampaign, and I&#x27;m not totally sold on it.  Like other gels, it goes on and takes forever to dry so I was concerned about putting it on while I was in a hurry to get dressed.  However, once it was on, it seemed pretty effective.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d convert from my regular solid to this, but it did smell fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant is different than the traditional white deodorant.  It goes on clear and stays clear the whole day.  It takes a little bit of time to get out of the container the first time which can be annoying. I notice you need to keep the container standing straight up and down so that the gel comes out evenly.  Once you put it on you will notice it feels wet and cold and it takes about a minute to dry.  It can get on your clothes if you don’t let it dry first, but if does get on your clothes there are no white marks. It has a nice clean smell to it, similar to the smell of clean clothes coming out of the dryer.  It is not overpowering and you can hardly notice it is there.  When it is over 100 degrees outside this deodorant does it job of keeping you less wet than usual and you still smell great so you can still be out in public.  It even works after you have been getting in and out of the car, jumping in and out of rivers/pools, and working out.  I am very impressed by this deodorant and glad I try it as a promotion from Secret.</li>
            <li> I received this deodorant as a sample to try from buzzagent.  have tried clear deodorants in the past and was never happy. I felt that it never protected me the way a deodorant should.  I was skeptical when trying this clear deodorant.  I gave this product 3 stars because I didn&#x27;t feel that it had &amp;#34;48 hour&amp;#34; protection. However, It did hold up well in comparison to other clear deodorants I have tried in the past.  I would buy this product for when going to the beach or wearing tank tops or sleeveless tops.  Its nice not have that white &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34; residue that solid deodorants leave behind.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Secret I had an opportunity to try it free with BzzAgent. I really wanted to like this product. Unfortunately their wasn&#x27;t much Secret Outlast Clear deodorant in the sample i was provided, i only had enough to use for two days. So I couldn&#x27;t get the full effect of the product for a good review. For that reason I have to give it 3 stars. My family and I are very outdoors. We go crabbing, fishing, hunting, and camping every two weeks for a week at a time. For that reason  it is hard to find the right deodorant to substain me throughout all my activities. So when I was offered this campaign, I was excited to try this. Unfortunately when this came in, I couldn&#x27;t get the full effect to know whether  this would pass the test. The times I used it, I liked it. It came on smooth, i had no leftover residue like other brands. No white marks and It has a pleasant smell. It did actually last me throughout the day but I didn&#x27;t get to try this on our family outing. Therefore I don&#x27;t know if this holds true to what it claims. I will however get a full size of this deodorant and i will update my review later (when I can get the chance to experience the full effect of this product). Thanks BzzAgent and Secret for giving me the opportunity to review this product.</li>
            <li> Received this product free from Secret during a Bzzz Campaign....and my expectations were low. All gels I have tried before this were so sticky and never seemed to dry. This product was cold going on but dried quickly on application with no white marks and no need to reapply throughout the day. Would it work for 48 hours.. maybe, but as a nurse I reapply everyday (my patients appreciate it :P)  While I probably wont switch exclusively to this product, if it was on sale I would definately pick up a couple to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> I receive this product to try for free from Secret. I&#x27;m always on the look out for a great deodorant that doesn&#x27;t cost a lot. Secret Outlast exceeded my expectations. There was no white marks and it dried quickly. It keep me dry and fresh all day and gave me the confidence to do everything I needed. I haven&#x27;t felt the need to check for odor since using it. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this deoderant in my BzzAgent kit. They did not pay me for this review. I am writing it because I believe I can help save some people money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using secret clinical strength for a while because brands like BAN and Lady Mitchum were not enough to help cover my body odor for longer than half a day. When I received this stick in my kit, I was a little skeptical, but because I was out of clinical strength that day, this was my only option. I wore it out in 107 degree Texas heat while working on pavement. It was HOT! I was sweaty and gross. However, my under arms did not smell one bit!!! When I raised my arms to help fold a pop up tent, I smelled the deoderant, not BO. (It was the scented version of this one). I was thrilled that it worked this well!&lt;br /&gt;Now I can purchase this type for around $3-$4 a stick instead of spending $7 a stick on the clinical. Not only that, but this one comes with more oz and will last longer than the clinical. What I lvoe best is that this one will not stain your clothes like the Lady Mitchum brand does and it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> I received a free stick of Secret Outlast® Clear Gel from Bzzagent.com to product review. I always appreciate something I always need and love receiving it for free. I liked the deodorant and liked even more that it went on clear! I get frustrated having to clean off deodorant from my clothing after I put it on, and I feel like I need more deodorant afterwards. Secret Outlast® Clear Gel worked great, went on clear, and smelled great for 48 hours!</li>
            <li> LOVE this.  I tried to go natural; those products failed in ways that I couldn&#x27;t tolerate in my personal and professional life.  This one is holding STEADY.</li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of gel deodorant. It always felt sticky or wet and I just didn&#x27;t feel like it did anything. But shockingly, Secret Outlast Clear Gel felt great going on and actually provided amazing protection. I went into this campaign (I was given a free sample courtesy of Secret) thinking that I wouldn&#x27;t find anything great and I walked away a Secret believer.</li>
            <li> You will never need another deodorant again. This Clear Gel is everything in one. It lasts an entire day! I applied it once in the morning and after a long day at work and at the gym I was still smelling fresh when I went home. I&#x27;ve never liked gels before but this one doesn&#x27;t smear or wear off. It dries instantly and its like you&#x27;re wearing nothing. Such a great product! I was lucky enought to try this product for free so that made it so much better!</li>
            <li> I got this product for free as part of a bzzagent campaign and I love it! I love being able to put my deodorant at any point during my dressing routine in the morning.  No more white marks!  I never feel the need to reapply more deodorant throughout the day either.</li>
            <li> I am seriously amazed with this product. I received the one in the scent &amp;#34;ooh-la-lavender&amp;#34; from Secret through BzzAgent and I really enjoyed it. Both scented or unscented, the lasting power is beyond what I expected. The product does everything it claims. Keeps you dry all day and more, and keep you feeling (and smelling!) fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Careful after shaving: product contains alcohol. But drying time is very fast unlike other gel deodorants.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have had this product sent to me to try as part as a campaign with bzzagent. I&#x27;m always buying $11 deodorant and was glad to see that I don&#x27;t have to spend that much any more. Keeps me clean and dry.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a deodorant that can help me keep up with my active 5 year old girl a set of 3 year old twin boys and now a 4 month baby girl. I finally found it is Secret Outlast® Clear Gel. This deodorant has everything I was looking for. Goes on clear, doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on clothes, and keeps you smelling great thru the day. Thank you secret for letting me try this wonderful product for free. I will definitely being buying this for me in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I received a free sample from bzzagent aND I must say I&#x27;m sold. I lead a busy work/mommy life...even after a sweaty workout my armpits were fresh!</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of any gel deodorant so when I tried this, my hopes were not high. I was happy with the smell but, like other gels, it didnt feel good when applied and didnt seem to do the job of other deodorants. I would only recommend this clear gel to women that prefer gels. I was lucky enough to receive the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> I was recently in my sister&#x27;s wedding and brought my Secret Outlast Clear Gel (SOCG) that I received through BzzAgent. I&#x27;m strictly a Secret Clinical Strength Invisible Solid kinda gal, but I was pleasantly surprised by the SOCG.  I usually find gel deodorants to be sticky which this isn&#x27;t and not last very long which this did.  It was also great especially in this case because I didn&#x27;t have to worry about getting the typical deodorant stains on my dress. I felt confident wearing it for the wedding and shared how impressed with the product I was with the rest of the bridesmaids. In fact, one of them texted me to say she purchased it. This is a product I would buy and use again.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Secret and Buzz agent, I got to try the Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant for free! I was out all day and I still smell clean and fresh! I would give it 5 stars, except the deodorant did not keep my armpits completely dry. I was under the sun all day at a local theme park, so as long as I still smell good, a little sweat doesn&#x27;t bother me! The smell is great and didn&#x27;t leave any ugly white stains on my clothes! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Works awesomely well and after it dries it doesn&#x27;t transfer onto clothes.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product free from BzzAgent and Secret, but opinions are all my own. This deodorant is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried! It has wonderful staying power - it truly does last all day. It&#x27;s great at diminishing odor and wetness. I also really like that it applies clear - no more deodorant streaks on my clothes! This will be my new go-to deodorant.</li>
            <li> I recently had a chance to test this product thanks to a promotional brand from Secret and BzzAgent. the smell is wonderful, and it goes on clear. it is not sticky at all, which is a problem i have had with other brands.&lt;br /&gt;I sweat a lot. So it&#x27;s not uncommon for me to have wet armpits after being outside for just a short period of time. i have to reapply deodorant several times per day, or rely on my husbands deodorant for protection. Lately i have been having a problem with my shirts becoming discolored after using my husbands deodorant. it has been ruining my shirts.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had this problem with this brand of deodorant. It dries quickly. I feel like later in the afternoon that I may need to re apply if i go outside again, so i don&#x27;t think that it would last 48 hours with someone who sweats a lot like me.</li>
            <li> This was not the product for me. I had the opportunity to try this for free from BzzAgent. I did like the scent of it when i opened it up, vut thats about all I liked. I felt like it never dried, though it says its a quick dry formula. Completing everyday activities for a few hours, and the deoderizer was not longer doing its job.</li>
            <li> I was never a fan of gel deodorant.  Knowing what I know about Secret and how I trust the brand, I was excited to finally try a gel deodorant from a brand that I trusted.  I&#x27;ve been telling everyone about it and plan on adding it to my Amazon subscription.  It helps get me through my summer days with zumba and chasing around my daughter!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with the Secret Outlast Clear Gel (I was sent this product for free from BzzAgent to try out). I LOVE the formula - it drys super fast, and leaves absolutely no residue under the arm (or on your clothing). It&#x27;s also one of the longest lasting deodorants I&#x27;ve ever tried. I will be re-purchasing for sure!</li>
            <li> Secret outlast is the best deodorant ever it works all day long and don&#x27;t leave marks I would definitely recommend secret outlast to everyone I got mine for free from bzz agent</li>
            <li> I frequently had issues with my &amp;#34;invisible solid&amp;#34; leaving white marks on my clothes when I changed from my everyday clothes into tigher-fitting tops for working out. I was able to try Secret Outlast Clear Gel as part of BzzAgent, and I was impressed that it didn&#x27;t leave any white marks (or other marks from the clear gel) on my clothing. While I don&#x27;t think this product works quite as well for odor protection as clinical strength products, it&#x27;s better than the other non-clinical strength products I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone who needs to change clothes throughout the day and doesn&#x27;t want to chance getting unsightly white marks on her shirts.</li>
            <li> Well I received this deodorant for free as part of a promotion with the brand, and I must say I am quite impressed! Even with working out and all the running around I do, this deodorant stuck by me the whole way! I am usually nit a big fan if gel formulas because they tend to feel a little nasty, but with Secret it went on a bit wet and dried almost instantly! I love this formula....if my opinion matters at all I would definitely suggest buying some....I am CERTAIN you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for...an unscented gel that wasn&#x27;t too thin, and was actually UNSCENTED.</li>
            <li> I got this as a promotional product to try for free and I am in LOVE! I took this on a camping trip where I was hiking around all day and only went into town for showers every other day. This was the PERFECT opportunity to try out this product. It took a little while to dry, a little goes a long way, but so worth it to not have to worry! This was the first trip that I wasn&#x27;t concerned about my odor!</li>
            <li> I have always been ANTI gel deodorant because I didn&#x27;t like the way it felt when I put it on. Now I have 100% switched sides, this deodorant is AMAZING, yes its a little wet and cold when you put it on but that goes away quickly and leaves you feeling fresh. The best part is NO WHITE STREAKS!, I know there are a lot of brands that will claim no white streaks but this really doesn&#x27;t leave any, which is perfection. The feeling of freshness lasts all day, I don&#x27;t feel the need to apply again before going to the gym after work because I still feel dry and fresh, but don&#x27;t have the caked on deodorant that I usually get with the normal stick type. I have also noticed I don&#x27;t have any of the skin irritation I was getting with the typical deodorant either. I am thankful for BzzAgent and my free sample to give me a chance to change to a better product that I otherwise may have never tried.</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant, but it did make it seem like I was sweating more.  Other than that I really like it and really did feel fresh for a long time!  I received the product as part of a promotion for the brand.  Got it free from bzzagent!</li>
            <li> I was recently sent a full size sample of this product by BzzAgent to test out.  I have a lot of allergies and have to be fairly picky about what type of deodorants I buy for my family members.  Any deodorant I purchase has to be made of quality ingredients, work well and still be affordable. The Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Get deoderant really fit that requirement nicely.  Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel stick worked really well from the start.  I did not have the usual issue of having to warm up the stick to get it to come out smoothly (as I have had to with other similar products).  I found that the deodorant works so well that it held up even with the most vigorous workout. It has a light scent that is not overwhelming (although I would have preferred something that had no scent).  It also dries quickly on the skin and does not leave any marks on my clothing.  It did not cause me to have any skin irritations nor did it cause any other skin issues.  My dermatologist recommends that any deodorant be thoroughly washed off at the end of the day to allow the skin to breath which makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find that on really humid days (which we have in California) it did get a little sticky on the skin.  Since I have had that problem with other deodorants, I just did the usual very light dusting of a powder on top of the deodorant to keep that from happening.  The problem did not occur at any other time.  Despite that small issue, the deodorant itself worked and kept me fresh all day.  I would recommend buying this in the twin pack, since it is a better price per unit.</li>
            <li> I was asked to sample Secret Outlast in Completely Clean scented deodorant for free by the company and then write a review of my honest opinions.&lt;br /&gt;I am very picky about deodorants and rarely find that their claims to leave no residue or white marks to be completely unfounded! However, I was super pleasantly surprised that Secret Outlast Completely Cleans claims were completely true and stood up to the claim of ongoing freshness and no sweat or odor.&lt;br /&gt;Secret Outlast Completely Clean arrived at my door and I began to use it the very next morning following my shower!  Not once have I seen a white mark on any of my clothing this week and this leaves me extremely pleased with the product as well!! I have found that the scent of Secret Outlast Completely Clean is a super clean, crisp and refreshing scent and seems to last throughout the day..it&#x27;s not overpowering in any way but kinda perfect! It&#x27;s nothing you can easily smell from 10 feet away.&lt;br /&gt;It is rare that I can find a deodorant that I really like and frequently use a deodorant once or twice and throw it away! As I said before, I am very picky and found that Secret Outlast Completely Clean went on smooth, not sticky and stayed that way throughout my day.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the results of Secret Outlast Completely Clean and plan to use it as my absolute go to deodorant!  Secret Outlast Completely Clean deodorant makes me feel 100% sure during my extremely long work days!</li>
            <li> I had stopped using Secret years ago, I had just outgrown the strong sents added.  Will I received this as a promotional product through BzzAgent and wanted to give a review here.  The sent is nice and light, it goes on very easy and dries really fast even for a jell!  I didn&#x27;t give it 5stars as I&#x27;m not a fan of the jell, but that is the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it.  I will purchase the solid going forward. I work in a hot wherehouse and come home with my shirt dry, and without being smelly.  The product is well worth the cost, it works better than the Clintical strength I have tried.  I don&#x27;t feel you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Ever since we moved from Chicago to North Carolina, I&#x27;ve not only been sweating more, but also been showing it to the world. This is the first Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant that finally kept me dry... well for a couple of days. Secret Outlast didn&#x27;t outlast my mom perspiration. When I first put it on it felt a little wet and cool, but within seconds it dried and felt normal. Hate being out of the softball field and having these huge sweat marks under my arm pits. Totally embarrassing. Especially because I&#x27;m the coach. So far not white lines. But my right arm pit is showing wetness which is a bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I did receive this for free as a promotion from the Brand - Gillette as a BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve tried lots of Antiperspirants &amp; Deodorants and was very pleased with my first try (and day)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Smell, so far no white marks&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Didn&#x27;t keep me dry</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant it smells great and works hard when you work hard</li>
            <li> I got to try secret gel for free through bzzagent and it was a good product. I don&#x27;t normally like gel deodorants they usually leaving me feeling moist and not fully protected.  Secret however worked very well, it dried very fast and I didn&#x27;t notice any smell throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend secret to any one of my friends.</li>
            <li> I have tried Secret OutLast Deodorant and absolutely loved it!! Would highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I got this product for free for testing purposes from Bzzagent and Secret and I love this product! I have severe hot flashes with means a lot of sweat and odors. I have been using Secret Outlast for a few days now and it has worked great for me.</li>
            <li> SO FRESH AND DRY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this deodorant. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating, is only because it did dry fast at all like advertised. Which isn&#x27;t a big deal. But it should do what it says. Other then that I love it. The smell is nice! It definitely does its job. There is no need to reapply throughout the day. I literally walked 8 miles and still smelled fresh and didn&#x27;t have any wet marks on my shirt underarm. Normally I can&#x27;t use a clear get without having to reapply it several times. I have pretty strong &amp;#34;B.O.&amp;#34; . So I&#x27;m amazed it worked as good as it did. I&#x27;m definitely going to be using this and trying the lavender scent next. If you want to stay dry and smelling good without that chalky white stuff getting on your clothes. You just might want to try Secret Outlast completely clean and clear gel deodorant! #GotItForFree this is my honest unbiased opinion on my experience with this product.</li>
            <li> I tried this for free and have really liked it.  It gets me through a full work day, my kids soccer practice my run AND a yoga class.  Even after all that when I gave my kids a hug, my 8 year old said, &amp;#34;You smell good; did you just get out of the shower?&amp;#34;  My kids are brutally honest so that was a true test.  I will say that after using a dry solid for so many years it was an adjustment going to a clear gel.  I don&#x27;t like to feel any wetness under my arms.  At first I think I was using way too much product.  I have since learned that just one click of the dial provides great protection.</li>
            <li> This stuff works awesome! I love the clear gel factor, no more white on clothes (even the ones that go on clear, the white stays white on clothes). I was skeptical about 48 hour really lasting that long...IT DOES! I have never had a deodorant work so well. It has a light pleasant scent and goes on smooth (not sticky). I&#x27;m so excited to share this with other woman, it REALLY works and does what it says! I&#x27;d highly recommend this for those on the go, that need long-term protection, and no more white streaks on shirts!</li>
            <li> This antiperspirant is effective in keeping me dry and odor free.  The scent is minimal as opposed to the Mitchum&#x27;s Scent Free Gel.</li>
            <li> I got the Secret Outlast Clear Gel (Lavender) parcel from BzzAgent on Monday and I&#x27;ve been using it since then. I&#x27;m actually not a huge fan of using the gel ones because I&#x27;ve used one before that is very sticky and it takes so long to dry so I switched back to the solid one. When I first open the cap, the scent was already gushing out and it smelled so beautiful. It was a really nice soft sweet lavender scent. I started to twist the product up and I noticed that the dial at the bottom which is where you twist the gel up is really tight and it&#x27;s definitely tighter than the ones I&#x27;ve used before. I carefully twist just a little bit out and applied it to my underarm. I started cringing because it&#x27;s so cold and sticky but I just kept brushing it all around my armpit until I can feel that I&#x27;ve coated the entire area and surprisingly, it was almost completely dry. This clear gel deodorant dries really fast compared to the old one I used 5 years ago. I have to say... the application actually went quite... pleasant. It wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought it was and it was definitely cringe-worthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said before, I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 days already and it&#x27;s actually working really great because I haven&#x27;t notice any bad armpit odor. Also, I sweat easily whenever I get nervous or scared so I was quite surprised when I was thinking about the past 5 days&#x27; experience and I really didn&#x27;t smell bad for 5 days straight! That&#x27;s awesome right? Before I got this from BzzAgent I was actually doing a small review for a different product review company and I was testing Dove&#x27;s Go Sleeveless Beauty Finish 48h. The one by Dove didn&#x27;t work that well for me even though I favour solid over gel. It smells really good but it doesn&#x27;t provide me with 48 hours coverage. I think about 8 hours in I can already smell my armpit ordor. Now before Dove, I was actually using Nivea&#x27;s Stress Protect 48h and this one didn&#x27;t work that well either because first off, it&#x27;s super sticky since it&#x27;s a roll on in liquid form which takes much longer to dry, and second, it only provides me with up to 12 hours of coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secret&#x27;s Outlast Clear Gel is definitely a win for me because it provides me with over 24 hours coverage. I didn&#x27;t get any allergic reaction to it and the gel dries really fast. One thing I am worried about is that I hope this deodorant will work as good in the summer since I am testing this product in the winter. Thank you Secret and BzzAgent for another awesome product for me to review! It definitely K.O.-ed all the other deodorants I have used in the pass!</li>
            <li> Loved Secret Outlast it provides 48 hour protection with absolutely no white streaks. Secret Outlast allowed me to work and play hard without worring about sweat and odors. Shauntina Goodman</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I got a free one from BzzAgent and have purchased another one already.  I have a fairly physical job and remaining dry throughout the day is important to me.  With this there is no issue!  I can even go for  walk after work with out any body odor issues.  I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best product ever. I will never use another. This has not only helped me with odor &amp; wetness but also my self confidence!</li>
            <li> I got this product for free as a trial from BzzAgent. I was thoroghly impressed with this product in comparison to my former product (Lady Speed Stick), though I am still getting a slight irritation from this it is not nearly as intense as previous. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this clear gel deodorant! BzzAgent sent me a free trial and it was the first time I&#x27;d tried it. I used to have to keep deodorant in my purse to reapply, but not with this clear gel! It smells great and keeps me dry.</li>
            <li> Goes on clear and dries quickly.  Does not stain your clothing and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Secret Outlast because it works! I got this for free through BzzAgent so I could review the product as part of a promotion through the brand. I&#x27;m already loyal to the Secret brand but was happy to review a gel, since I normally use the stick. There are NO awful white marks, and if  you let it dry properly then you will have NO gel streaks on your clothes either. It dries very quickly. The unscented version is great because there is no perfume or flower smell to deal with. It controls both odor and sweat.  I had a very positive experience while using this product this week and I&#x27;ll be switching to the gels now.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample to try from Bzzagent.com.  I tried it and was impressed that it took very little to cover my underarm area and dried almost instantly. It controlled my wetness and odor better than my regular brand.  BUT, the real test was my husband. He&#x27;s a hardworking guy than can really sweat. He put his regular deodorant under one arm and the Secret Outlast under the other. He felt strange about a &amp;#34;woman&#x27;s&amp;#34; deodorant, but since it was unscented, he didn&#x27;t mind so much. He went to work and at the end of the day, we did the &amp;#34;Sniff&amp;#34; test. I didn&#x27;t know which arm was which, but one clearly smelled much better than the other. It turned out - yep, that was the underarm with the Secret!</li>
            <li> I got this for free and loved it. It feels a little sticky at first but dries quickly. I just went on a long hike this weekend and it kept me dry the entire time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus of the gel is that you never have to worry about snapping off the top of stick. Which has happened before to me because i accidentally dropped it and when I turned it up piece broke off. So no wasted deodorant!! Which is always a plus!</li>
            <li> I have become completely immune to other anti-perspirants. No white crap. They never have this odorless version at the bartell&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Clear Gel does as it promises; 48hrs protection, Clear swipe, Instant drying time, Unscented, ....the ONLY CON was that I couldn&#x27;t get the darned gel out of the bottle/ applicator ...it was stuck. The dial wouldn&#x27;t budge when turned one way and when turned the other way, it just wound it up until it couldn&#x27;t move anymore (all the while, nothing came out). There were no directions or arrows indicating which way to turn...not that that would have helped in my case.&lt;br /&gt;My only BIG con is the fact that I couldn&#x27;t get access to the gel due to a perhaps defective applicator. The dial wouldn&#x27;t move one way, I tried turning it the opposite way and it just kept turning until it reached a tension too tight to move.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I got it to &#x27;give&#x27; ...in one big SPLOCH ( that&#x27;s the sound and only word I can use to describe it). I couldn&#x27;t apply such a huge glob of it on my underarms (enough for 50 pairs of pits) and it would take hours to dry, if at all and that would be the Pitts!&lt;br /&gt;In the end it finally worked - don&#x27;t know how of why but I was happy I could try it!&lt;br /&gt;#Gotitfree</li>
            <li> I got Secret Outlast for free from BzzAgent. I used this product for 2 weeks. Although it kept me very dry while being outside in 100degree weather, I could not stand the smell after it had been on me for an hour or two. Strong smells really bother me. I want the protection of a great antiperspirant but I do not want to smell myself all day.</li>
            <li> Thanks to secret and Bzzagents I was able to try this clear get deodorant. I have not been happy with my solid deodorants that leave marks and also do not seem to last long. Trying the clear gel opened my eyes, its clear and does no leave marks. The other key point is that it seems to last all day, even on the hottest, more humid of days. All I can say is if you are looking to try new deodorant, I would recommend giving this a try, it will be worth it. I will not be using any other deodorant again.</li>
            <li> I used to apply all kinds of deodorants but almost all of them were either ruin my dress with white marks or ruins my perfume with their fragrance. I used to be nervous in parties because I felt bad when I sweat a lots. Besides, it is sad to buy a dress and lose it after just one or a couple times because of deodorant&#x27;s white marks and bad smell because of sweat. It would better to find a perfect clear gel deodorant to save cloths and also smell perfect. Recently, I received a completely different deodorant which keeps me fresh for whole day and it doesn&#x27;t remain any white mark on the cloths because it is clear gel and most of all, it is odorless. I found Secret Outlast® Clear Gel which is a unique deodorant in many stores and online easily. So, it is easy accessible and affordable too.  #GotItFree&lt;br /&gt;*************  I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. *************</li>
            <li> I live in a climate that&#x27;s hot all year round, even our &amp;#34;winters&amp;#34; hold up in the 70 degree area, so deoderant is a must have for me. I was fortunate to be given a sample to try by secret and I can honestly say I love it. It goes on easy, dries quick, and I smell fresh all day. I wear a lot of tank tops and this one doesn&#x27;t leave white marks!! I&#x27;ve tried many other brands, and this one beats them all!</li>
            <li> I was given a trial of this deodorant. I was a little skeptical at first because although I love the scents available in Secret products however the deodorant has never been able to keep up with me. I lead an active lifestyle and don&#x27;t want something to mask the scent. I want it prevented in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;This product delivered. I had no moisture for quite a while after using this product. I will say however, that I did apply the next day out of habit.</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample to review. I have been using this deodorant for the past several weeks and I must say that it&#x27;s good. My clothes are no longer stained with deodorant stains and my armpits smell good. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t know if I will be purchasing this deodorant once I am done with it. I did some research on the active ingredient that helps with perspiration — is a type of metal (aluminum). In this day and age, everyone is trying to be more health conscious and I am not an exception. The leading cause of breast cancer is actually from antiperspirant. The body needs to “sweat” out the toxins through your sweat glands. When your body is clogged up with chemicals, it cannot effectively “detox”. When these chemicals are absorbed into our bodies, it may cause a change in our DNA, which in turn makes cells into cancerous cells. This is ingredient is used on a lot of deodorant and it would be great there is a holistic alternative for this!</li>
            <li> Seriously, if you are looking for a nondudely smelling deodorant that won&#x27;t leave gross white bits in your underarm hair, this is the best choice. The bottle lasts the longest, and it works the best to prevent wetness.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel complimentary for testing purposes from Bzzagent.com. I have been using it for several weeks now and putting it through its paces. Let me state for the record, that Secret is the only brand of deodorant that I have been using for the past 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;As far as 48 hour odor protection and no white mark residue, this product does live up to its claims. Perhaps I have an unusual body chemistry, but for me, I find I do have to apply it the next day, or I will experience perspiration under my arms. It also does not evaporate immediately on my arm pits either. This is why I have always stuck to the white solids . In conclusion, I think it is a quality product, just not for me. I will however continue to use Secret deodorant until the day I pass this earth.</li>
            <li> Its okay, but not for every arm pit.  I prefer solid, but I like that I can put on black and not have deodorant on my clothing.  I call this a plus.  It did take my body a couple of weeks to get use to this deodorant.  At  first it did not hold.  I have heard of deodorants having an adjustment period.  I don&#x27;t care much for that in a deodorant.  I don&#x27;t have weeks to adjust to one.  I didn&#x27;t break out.  I did like that their were no stains on my white shirts, no marks on my darker clothes, and you don&#x27;t feel wet or sticky under the arms like one would imagine.  For me it is just okay. Not great and not bad!    I got this free to try as a Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I have always been a soft solid deodorant person, but recently was able to try Secret Outlast for free via Bzzagent.  I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;ll never go back to the soft solid.  Secret outlast goes on easy, dries fast and smells great.  I doesn&#x27;t cake up or leave those ugly white marks on clothing or bedding.  It washes off easily with that sticky feeling some deodorants leave behind.</li>
            <li> Overall, I felt this product provided great protection at a reasonable price. I&#x27;m not a big fan of gels, but I liked how fast this one dried. I felt that it would protect my clothes from the dreaded white mark. When I compared the price of this product to my regular product it was about the same price. Overall I think it is a great deal, especially when you want to make sure you don&#x27;t have any white marks on your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample to try, all opinions are 100% mine.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this on a regular basis and we order as needed</li>
            <li> Best. Truly Clear. Much better than the white bars that they say goes on clear but actually steaks on dark clothes.</li>
            <li> This is an easy to use and high performing deoderant. It really does protect from odor and wetness all day long. Upon first application I thought the scent was going to be too strong for me but as soon as the formula dries down the scent pretty much disapates and I am left with pure odor and wetness protection instead of a scent to mask any nastiness. I have been using the sample for a few weeks and the product itself seems to last so you are getting more bang for your buck when compared to tradition stick deoderant. Finally, I wear a lot of black clothing and again the product lives up the it&#x27;s claim of no marks left on clothing. All in all this is a great product that covers all your bases. Thank you to bzzAgent for sending this campaign my way. I was able to discover a great new product!</li>
            <li> It contains aluminum, which is said to be cancer-causing, and has a bunch of other toxic ingredients in it.  The fact that these ingredients are found in breast cancer patients&#x27; tissues makes me stay FAR AWAY.</li>
            <li> I like this product and have been using it for quite some time. Price offer is reasonable, and expiry date on product is valid for a year and six months from now, this is a plus as oppose to othe purchased products where products last for 2-3 months from delivery date.</li>
            <li> I got this when I ran out of my secret outlast unscented solid deodorant because of the great reviews. I&#x27;ll be switching back to the solid - this just doesn&#x27;t seem to keep the odor at bay as well, and I feel like I have to keep reapplying. It runs through quicker as well. The one plus is that it doesn&#x27;t leave any markings on clothing.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is amazing! I use to use the Lady Speed Stick Fusion 24/7 deodorant before my first kid and it just stopped working for me! I switched to the regular powder scent Secret Deodorant and it&#x27;s great but this one is even better! It really last and smells amazing! I went to the water park and was chasing my kids around and it still is going strong! No white residue or nothing! I&#x27;m a happy camper! Thanks Secret and Bzzagent! I would have never tried the clear gel if it weren&#x27;t for you guys! Got to test it out for free! ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hot-natured gal prone to sweat, and I&#x27;m also very active. I need a strong, long-lasting deodorant to keep up with my fast-paced, on-the-go lifestyle. In the past I&#x27;ve shied away from gel formulas because they felt wet and sticky, and didn&#x27;t last long. I don&#x27;t have time to reapply deodorant in the middle of the day! So I&#x27;ve stuck with stick formulas, dealing with white marks and cakey residue they left on my shirts and dresses because I thought they protected me better than their clear gel counterparts. Ladies and gentlemen, I&#x27;ve been proven wrong!  I put the Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant through the ringer. I applied it at night and didn&#x27;t reapply in the morning when I proceeded with my normal routine: 30 minute walk outside, 30 minute strength workout, and at the end of both sweat sessions I was completely dry and smelling great. I couldn&#x27;t believe. After my shower I reapplied and even after one of the hottest days in July, my underarms stayed dry and smelling fresh (well, more like perfume, but better than the alternative.)  This gel formula dries quickly, stays all day, and smells quite strong, but I like the perfume-y smell. My husband hasn&#x27;t noticed it, so I think it&#x27;s quite tame as far as scents go. And I love that I can put it on without worrying about ruining an outfit with unsightly white streaks or residue on my sleeveless tops. I&#x27;m going to replace my stick deodorant with the Secret Outlast Clear Gel from now on.  One minor note (not really a critique): as a frequent traveler, I prefer to  travel lightly and minimize my liquids and gels for going through TSA, so I&#x27;m going to have to leave this one at home when I&#x27;m traveling my air. Not a big deal, but something you might want to consider!  *I was able to try this product for free from Secret in exchange for my honest review*</li>
            <li> I was given this product to test by BzzAgent and I used the same deodorant for YEARS!  I was worried that it would be sticky and messy.  After using the product for about a week I can say that I am pleasantly surprised!  When you first put on the deodorant it is wet but dries quickly and it doesn&#x27;t leave any white messy residue like you might thing and I smelled fresh all day!  YAY!  I would definitely purchase this item again!</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant</li>
            <li> I was giving the secret out last clear gel 48hour protection from bzzagent free for  a campaign to try and review. And wow secret you made a believer not to mention a customer out of me. This clear gel smells fresh and great when you pull off the safety tap next you twist till you hear it click and the clear gel comes up in a perfect amount. Then apply the  clear gel no mess no white residue . I just loved the fact it didn&#x27;t leave white mess also how great it smelled. If your like me and you dont like  buying a deodorant that fails and don&#x27;t last . With this product I put it to the test I went camping and the harder I did outdoor activities I noticed I was still dry and fresh all day. Even to the next day I was still fresh when I took a shower that next afternoon . I just love this product . Also I&#x27;d like to say for you women who have had hysterectomies or going threw the change or just women who sweat alot this product works even threw my hot flashes and night sweats . I defiantly will be buying this deodorant. I just love it its my new favorite product. And did I mention it affordable???? Wow what a product it works and isn&#x27;t hard on the pocket its a win, win . So next time you go to pick up a deodorant remember its ok to have a secret. Secret outlast gel that is ..</li>
            <li> Keeps me smelling fresh all day.  No white residue left behind.</li>
            <li> I swart and smell when I use this stuff. I won&#x27;t buy this agin and neither should you if you want a deodorant that really works.</li>
            <li> I had gotten some of this at the store in the winter and liked the clear gel.  But when the warmer days came I found that the odor protection was horrid.  I switched back to the degree and the odor went away.  I only give it a one star because I don&#x27;t sweat so much so it may be good sweat protection.  I threw the rest away ad am going back to degree.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find the Secret Unscented.  It&#x27;s hard to find!  I like the unscented because I always wear perfume and I don&#x27;t like the scents to mingle.....deodorant scents are nasty.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It kept me dry from early morning after my shower to the next day!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this deodorant. I have always had issues finding the right deodorant. I got a sample of this product from BzzAgent for free and i was a bit skeptical. All I wanted was a deodorant that could keep me dry and odor free for at least half the day. Secret outlast far surpassed that. With 3 kids, I&#x27;m always on the go and never know where I&#x27;m going to end up, so it&#x27;s nice to know that pit stains and underarm odor are one less worry. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received this deodorant from BzzAgent for free. I&#x27;ve only ever used solid deodorant before so I was excited to give gel deodorant a try. I really like d that it does not take long to dry as that was my major concern with gel deodorants. I also really liked the scent, not too overwhelming. Here in Texas the weather has been super hot and my deodorant lasted through out the day. :)</li>
            <li> I live in the oh so lovely New York City... If any of you know anything about New York city, it&#x27;s that the summers are generally pretty hot and humi. Lest we not forget how dreadful the subways are. I can not express how many times I felt the need to reapply my deodorant and feel sad that it wasn&#x27;t working, at all. Perhaps if I lived in another state or country that had better air circulation during these summer months I would be better off, but I am not so lucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a part of BzzAgent, and when they invited me to try out a small sample of Secret outlast, thanks to Secret... I admit I kind of shrugged and just figured it would be like the rest of them. See, I work as a Medical assistant in a busy doctor&#x27;s office and this also means I have to run around from room to room and often get insanely overheated. Cue the first day I used this... 90 degrees out, muggy... the air looked sort of like the silent hill movie (very foggy, creepy-like)... of course the subway car had no air on... Oh dear.&lt;br /&gt;I get to work and feel horrible, but YET my armpits were fine. I&#x27;ve used this every day for a week now and have to say there is a noticeable difference in this for me, even compared to other Secret Products that weren&#x27;t working well for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve ever used lasts all day no white spots on my tank top I&#x27;m in love with it lasts all day and I swear a lot in the summer</li>
            <li> this one still smells lovely when I am getting ready for bed. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great deodorant. I usually use stick But this was even better. Says on all day doesn&#x27;t get marks on clothes loving it. Got this item free for a product review</li>
            <li> Secret outlast clear gel deodorant is a very nice product. It keeps me dry all day long and even though it&#x27;s unscented it smells good. It actually became the house hold deodorant. I got this item free from bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I am a mother of 4 kids and a wife.I am always on the go between appointments,baseball games,school events and paying bills.I have tried for years to find a deodorant that could cure my needs.I have tried spray ons,roll-on,solid and gel that would either not last,leave marks or stain my shirts.When I joined BzzAgent I started recieving products then I recieved Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant for free and so glad they sent it cause it meets all my needs 48 hour protection,no white marks,full comfort and no stains on my shirts.</li>
            <li> Always use this Brand. Purchased at an UNBELIEVABLY Low Price!!</li>
            <li> I purchased Secret Outlast Clear Gel Unscented Antiperspirant and Deodorant because I was looking for a antiperspirant/deodorant that wouldn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothes.  This product is clear and leaves little to no marks!  It also works very well for what it&#x27;s intended.... I remain pretty dry and odorless for a decent amount of time!  Overall, I&#x27;m pleased and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Good unscented deodorant. Hard to find in the stores. I am glad that I can easily add this deodorant to one of my other orders.</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel free to review and it is now my new favorite deodorant. It has amazing 48-hour odor protection and leaves no white marks.  I am really surprised by how quickly it dries. As well as the fact that it doesn&#x27;t stay sticky or gooey. I highly recommend this product. It had withstood 2 hour workouts at the gym.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Finally a deodorant that says doesnt stain the clothing and actually doesnt stain the clothing.  I recieved this as a promotion from the brand and will sure be buying it in the near future.</li>
            <li> Got this to review from secret and I must say that it&#x27;s awesome. I am a new mom, so the fact that I can put this on after my shower, let it dry (super important or it&#x27;ll come off a little), and I am good to go for an entire day. It&#x27;s one less thing to worry about considering I spend the whole day taking care of my 4 month old and don&#x27;t get to spend much time on myself. It does get a little sticky after awhile if I am super active, but it&#x27;s not often since it&#x27;s getting cold out around here. The fact that this is unscented too is nice because the little one is sensitive to strong scents. I highly recommend this, especially for new moms! I am going to try to convince my husband to try it too.</li>
            <li> I tried Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant a bit skeptical of what I was going to experience. I don&#x27;t usually even wear deodorant. I don&#x27;t participate in any activities that produce a lot of sweat, and I just naturally don&#x27;t tend to have an odor. However, it being the middle of summer, I figured it was the best time to be trying some out in case I needed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was that I seemed to have a defective stick that didn&#x27;t want to expel any of the gel out the top even after relentlessly turning the crank. Eventually some came spitting out and I was able to apply it. It felt so incredibly disgusting when it touched my skin. Very cold and wet, it was so uncomfortable. After flailing around like a maniac with my arms up for a good 5 minutes, it was finally dry enough for me to put on a shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I can credit Secret with is that I did not end up with white marks on my clothing or my skin. It (much to my surprise) even remained clear with a mild amount of perspiration mixed in. However, as they were advertising odor AND wetness protection, I have to say they missed their mark on the wetness portion. As for odor, I never smelled anything particularly foul coming from me, so I assumed it worked out. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m somewhat desensitized to the scent of the actual deodorant or if it just doesn&#x27;t smell that strongly, but I didn&#x27;t ever catch a pleasant aroma, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall just makes the cut as another average deodorant with nothing super fantastic to note. They did make their promise on it being a truly clear deodorant, but if it&#x27;s clear yet ineffective in every other way, I don&#x27;t see much point in buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product for free as a promotional item through BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This stuff is awesome.  I was skeptical at first since I haven&#x27;t used a clear gel since Jr High school and usually any brand other than Dove makes my arm pits break out in an unattractive and uncomfortable rash but since Bzz Agent let me try it for free I figured I&#x27;d at least give it a chance.  Man am I glad I did!  This stuff is awesome!  First, it does not irritate my super sensitive skin (which is a big priority for me).  Second, no marks even if you put a black tank top on immediately after applying it, or if you put it on while wearing a black tank.  I have never had it leave any marks which is amazing to me.  Third, this stuff is tough!  I used it for a run in 95 degree heat while pushing my double jogger and while wearing black, and my pit were the only thing not sweaty and stinky when I was done!  I&#x27;ve used it at the beach and even after getting wet it still holds up and works great.  This stuff has now become my new favorite deodorant!</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clear Gel is the best thing to hit the market in ages. I would run to the stores and get some today. Moms, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant it&#x27;s refreshing and has a great scent. Keeps me nice and dry all day long. I will definitely purchase this again. It is now my go to deodorant!i received this product free from bzz agent</li>
            <li> I was so happy to get this product free from BzzAgent to test it out and review!  I love it and it keeps me dry and smelling good most of the day.  I don&#x27;t think it is as powerful as the clinical strength that Secret makes, but it is still pretty amazing.  I&#x27;ll stick to clinical for working out hard and the Outlast for normal days.</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with excessive sweating and odor. This deodorant solved those problems! I was a firm believer in the clinical strength however the price of that is just outrageous! This does the trick! Love it! I received a FREE sample from BzzAgent thanks to Secret and will continue to purchase the product.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast come in clear gel formula, doesn&#x27;t live white marks. Antiperspirant deodorant protect 48 hours from sweat and odor. Has pleasant light fragrance. Keep me fresh and clean even in very busy days. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my underarms after shaving. Got it free from BzzAgeny Campaigne.</li>
            <li> This deodorant lived up to its claims.  Absolutely no white marks and a true 48 hour protection.  Chasing after a toddler, getting in and out of the pool, and running around showing houses, it&#x27;s not hard for me to work up a sweat.  I never once had any wetness while using Secret Outlast.  Definitely excited to keep using this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a free deodorant to try from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I absolutley love the Secret Outlast gel, I got this free in a campain from bzzagent. I put the secret on as soon as i got it in the mail, it works so much better than you could ever imagine. The 48 hour dryness and odor protection is no joke. I havent once had to reapply deoderant during my 12 hour shifts. No odor no wetness just dry and solid protection. Secret rocks!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because after having my son 4 years ago, I haven&#x27;t been able to find a deodorant that works until I finally tried this out. Being from Florida its hot year round. I even dread the Winter months because that means long sleeves that I always sweat in. I signed up for Bzzagent about two years ago and they sent me a trial size of this product to try for free about a month ago. After using it for just one day I was impressed. After a few weeks I was hooked. I finally found something that works for me. It goes on dry and clear so it leaves no messy white marks on your skin or clothes. This deodorant even lasts up to 48 hours with sweat protection. It&#x27;s definitely a must for everyone especially if you&#x27;re in the warmer climates. I&#x27;ve recommended this product to several friends and relatives that are now using this. This is the only deodorant l will be purchasing from here on out.</li>
            <li> I used this as soon as I got my free sample from Secret through Bzzagent. Right away I could feel the difference and smell the difference.  When playing with my children outside I did not have to worry having to  about change my shirt from being to active from the body odor smell.</li>
            <li> Received a trial size for this for free to review. I had the completely clean scent- which smelled great. I am more of a natural products person, so I would not normally go pick this up from the store. BUT, seeing that I am doing a review, I will put that aside and list the things that are great about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It really DOES keep my armpits dry and clean and after the 3rd day, I stopped giving myself the &amp;#34;sniff test&amp;#34; to see how well it was working because never one time did I feel that it wasn&#x27;t holding up.&lt;br /&gt;2. I don&#x27;t like the feeling of gels... but this one dried quickly and it did not feel gross.&lt;br /&gt;3. Compared to Secret&#x27;s other products, this one contains 16% aluminum something or other rather than 19% in some of their other products. This is GOOD news for the consumer because the aluminum is a cause of cancer. (yuck). The fact that the amount is lowered and it works better than the products with higher amounts is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;4. I tested the &amp;#34;48-hour&amp;#34; protection.... it did work. Now, I was not exercising or becoming sweaty during these two days. If you shower every day then you would need to put it on every day... since you are washing it off every day. But when I had a morning meeting and chose to shower later in the day, I had no fear about stinky armpits.&lt;br /&gt;5. Even though I am a natural products person, I might buy a small size of this for my purse or car or travel kit. It did work really great!</li>
            <li> I do not have the time, nor do I want to wait 10 minutes for the Secret Outlast to dry completely before I can dress.  I put the Secret Outlast on today, then waited 2 or 3 minutes and had to get dressed.  It was still very wet, and then my blouse had a mark and was stuck to my skin for a short time.  No thank you.  After it dried I had no issues and the mark dried completely as well (no stain on the blouse), there was no particular smell and the product worked as promised.  If it would dry faster upon application I would buy this all the time.  I was one of the people that received the product to try for free so I really wanted to like it.  If only it would dry faster....</li>
            <li> Great.  Received from Bzzagent.  No white/no sweat/no odor</li>
            <li> This is another great product from Secret. I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars but I&#x27;m more of a solid fan. If you prefer gel and I scented then this is for you!</li>
            <li> Works great, goes on clean and doesn&#x27;t ruin clothes</li>
            <li> I was given a free sample of this product from Buzz and it is an awesome product it dries fast goes on clear and definitely outlast any deodorant I have tried. I accidentally dropped this product on my floor and the whole top shattered which was a little disappointing because now I can not use up the rest. But I would definitely recommend this product for its protection factor!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!  Even better than the clinical strength version! No streaks, great smell!</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant! It goes one clean and is not sticky or gooey. It also lasts all day and keep me from sweating through my clothes.</li>
            <li> I received this deodorant free from Secret, and I must say I was very skeptical about \\&quot;gel\\&quot; deodorant.  I had used some several years back and hated it.  However, when I received this in the mail, and used it, I was surprised.  I had gone to the fair, and being in low 80s, I usually sweat a lot, but this new deodorant kept me dry and works great.  Even being about and about today in the 80s again, my shirt is dry.  I am usually a heavy sweater so I am shocked at how well it works.  It goes on easy and dries up super quick and doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue on my close like the bar deodorant does (which I&#x27;d same company and says black dress approved but I still get white marks with their bar.). So I will be switching to gel and continue using that to help me stay dry, especially during the summer.</li>
            <li> Finally, something that works!  It dries fast, lasts all day and beyond, and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my shirt.  Makes my life easier, for sure, and worth a repeat buy.  I got to try this free from BzzAgent, and it won&#x27;t be a wrench to have to buy it when I finish this container.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is awesome! I received it from a BzzAgent campaign~ I love the fact that it&#x27;s a gel and I no longer have to worry about it breaking! my deodorant in the past always broke much sooner than it should have wasting too much product. The smell is very light &amp; nice and this is the first deodorant i&#x27;ve used that actually controls my under arm sweat, and I haven&#x27;t noticed sweat stains on my shirts &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Love love love secret outlast! Got a free sample as a bzzagent but I used long before the bzz kit arrived! I recommend it to everyone! It smells great, it leaves no white marks, and it works for a loooong time!</li>
            <li> I got this deodorant free for review. I was sceptical at the beginning but once I used it, I was amazed. The smell ist decent. I felt confident all day long. I could wear my black shirt without having white spots. Love it!</li>
            <li> First off, I gotta say, Secret Outlast Clear Gel in Completely Clean smells AMAZING. Love that. It&#x27;s still very hot here in Florida and I spent the day shopping, A lot. Lifting and toting things around all day. I stayed very dry and smelled fresh. Also to my surprise, there were no white marks on my black dress. YaY. I am a heavy sweater and have been buying the very expensive &#x27;Clinical&#x27; deodorants but now I am switching to the Secret Outlast! A definite must try. I will be buying again and again.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! No white marks on my favorite black too. Thank you secret for letting try and review your product through Bzz Agent</li>
            <li> Note:  I was able to try this product as part of a BzzAgent sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was apprehensive.  I&#x27;m not a fan of gel deodorants for a few reasons:  They&#x27;re cold - especially in the winter, they take a while to not feel wet - slowing me down when I&#x27;m rushing to get out the door in the morning, and the biggest one - in my past experience they just didn&#x27;t work as well at preventing wetness and odor as stick deodorants.  I guess there is also the craziness that I never feel like I know how many clicks I need to get the right amount for each arm without clicking too much out of the tube and feeling like a slimy mess for 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give Secret Outlast the ultimate test, using for the first time when I was leaving to run my first 5k.  Keeping in mind that it is mid-fall and cooler here (50s) I didn&#x27;t expect to be super sweaty, but I do work up a sweat when out running.  I noticed no smell and definitely kept the sweating under my arms to a minimum - a consistent performance with my typical product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, there remains a bit of a dry time, but it didn&#x27;t seem as bad as I remembered it to be.  It is cool/chilly - that is to be expected.  Maybe a good selection in the summer, but I don&#x27;t see myself using a gel through the winter months.  They say you need only one click, but I used two for each arm, it just doesn&#x27;t seem like enough deodorant with one click to even get it the whole way across your armpit skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice they have a lavender scented version as well, which I would prefer over the unscented, lavender is my favorite and one that is not offered by my normal deodorant brand.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this to review and was not expecting much.  Secret is what my mom used to wear, with rather dismal results.  But when I came I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised.  It has a slight fragrance, nothing too strong and it won&#x27;t overpower your perfume the way that some deodorant fragrances will.  It does control the smell from perspiration and I don&#x27;t seem to sweat, although to be fair I&#x27;ve only used this in the fall and winter so not certain how it would hold up to the heat of summer.  It does dry clear however you want to be sure not to get it on your clothes like other deodorants, or it will show on your shirt.  My only real complaint is the same as any other deodorant in this style of container -- settling between uses causes the product to not dispense the same the first time versus the second.  So the first pit needs two clicks to have enough gel and the second pit only needs one.  All in all, this is not replacing my current deodorant simply because I don&#x27;t know how it will perform in the summer, but I am reserving judgement until I know for certain.</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast Clear Gel to try in a recent campaign on Bzzagent!  I was already a big fan of Secret Deodorant having used their Clinical Strength formula for the past several years.  I was looking to make the switch to a deodorant that wouldn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothing and was as effective as the one I was using.  I found exactly what I was looking for!!. This product is clear and leaves little to no marks! It also works very well for what it&#x27;s intended.... I remain pretty dry and odorless for a long period of time!  Several weeks ago, in a huge hurry to get out the door, I actually forgot to apply my deodorant.  I was amazed that the Secret Outlast kept me protected even into this next day.  I&#x27;ve officially made the switch to Secret Outlast!</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast Clear Gel to try in a recent campaign on BzzagentI have never used secret deodorant before, but this one really surprised me. I was worried that the gel would be sticky and uncomfortable.However, not only was it not sticky but it left no white marks!! Another thing I really liked about it was that it lasted! Im a nurse that works 12 hour shifts and I need a deodorant I can count on, this met that challenge!! I also like that it drys quickly, so you can put your shirt on right after.</li>
            <li> I was thoroughly impressed with Secret outlast!! Sometimes the gel deodorants can be rather messy and this was not at all!  I received this up all of product free as a promotion from the brand.  With that said, since I used the first one I have bought two more since.  I work out on a daily basis, and this deodorant lasts for the long haul, through my workout and after when I am running around and can&#x27;t freshen up quite yet.  I am thoroughly happy with the product and will never switch again.  The smell is light and pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really outlast, but it is unscented.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast is my favorite deodorant.  It is so versatile, I can use it for a romantic evening or when working out.  No matter what I am doing this deodorant works.  I hate deodorants that have scents.  First I am allergic to many different perfumes, second I can&#x27;t stand many perfumes and lastly I would hate to make someone have a severe allergic reaction just because I am vain...so this deodorant works for my lifestyle.  Many of the other women&#x27;s deodorants reek of perfume, especially when you sweat, you become a perfume factory.  It&#x27;s all most impossible to find a deodorant that is unscented.&lt;br /&gt;The clear gel doesn&#x27;t leave marks on your clothing, so I never have to worry about that.  It is fast drying but you still need to allow a little time for drying before you put your clothing on.  After working out I have noticed that is works really well, and several of my friends asked me to, so I shared my new secret with them.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant. I got to try this for free through BzzAgent and I can honestly say it does exactly what it says..it protects and there isn&#x27;t any white residue.</li>
            <li> This is the first gel deodorant that I&#x27;ve used and I loved it. It dries really fast and left no deodorant stains on my shirt. While I&#x27;ve only used this product in the cooler months, I have used other Secret products and they work really well.</li>
            <li> Finally a deodorant that keeps me dry all day.. love the gel and the way it doesn&#x27;t ruin my clothes</li>
            <li> I was able to test this product as a Bzzagent.&lt;br /&gt;The gel has a nice fresh scent, although it&#x27;s overpowering right after applying. It feels cool and refreshing and caused no burning sensation on my skin when I applied it right after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Here are the downsides: The first application didn&#x27;t last very long (where is the odor protection?) and I had to apply the gel twice. So remember to take the deodorant with you if you&#x27;re out and about!&lt;br /&gt;A day later I wore a black, sleeveless dress. An hour after the application I noticed that the gel felt rather sticky on my skin (where is the dry and fresh feel?). Then the absolute No no happened: The gel turned flaky and left WHITE stains on my black dress. I was very disappointed!</li>
            <li> One of the best products I have ever tried. It goes on clear, has a great scent and it works fantastically!! I did receive this sample as a free product from BzzAgent, and i am glad i did! This is one of the best products on the market. It lasts all day and does a remarkable job at keeping you dry and smelling fresh!</li>
            <li> Love! I used a clinical strength before trying this and the Secret Outlast is BETTER than the clinical deodorant!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a free sample to try but the comments are my own true opinions of the product.</li>
            <li> Great! Works all day and no mess!</li>
            <li> received a sample as a bzzagent.  I am sold.  I love that I am able to see how much is left and not left guessing as to when I will run out. Thank you to the see thru plastic.  I love the quick to dry gel which will not leave white marks.  and it stops this woman&#x27;s hormonal mid age sweat.  I no longer perspire daintily and stress sweat is not a pretty odor.  This masks it and deals with the unpleasantness of getting old.  Better than the clinical versions I have been spending twice the money on!</li>
            <li> I switched to the Secret brand a few couple of years ago when my other deodorant stopped working. It was a white solid roll up and I was happy with it, however, it was a daily use deodorant. I was offered to try this Secret Outlast 48 hour deodorant as a Bzz Agent. I usually would not choose a gel type, due to the residue and &amp;#34;wetness&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve felt with those types deodorants. The Secret Outlast really surprised me! It goes on easy and dries very quickly, leaving no residue or that &#x27;wet feeling&#x27; behind. It does work 48 hours and is cheaper than the &#x27;clinical strength&#x27; deodorants. I would recommend this for everyone, except those who want a deodorant that is aluminum free.</li>
            <li> I really love Secret Outlast Clear Gel.  I like that you do not get a sticky feeling with this product.  Every gel that I have tried before always felt sticky when I first put it on.  This product almost has a silky feeling when you put it on.  Plus it does not leave a buildup on my clothes when I first put it on.  I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> The best antiperspirant I ever had. Does the job perfectly, last all day long.</li>
            <li> I recieved a free sample to try thru one on one network and I did enjoy the fact that it didnt leave white marks, but it did not provide 48 hours of protection though. I love the secret brand and will continue to buy the products, they smell great and do provide protection just not 48 hours worth!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  It lasts all day and smells really good.  My only (very slight) complaint is that it&#x27;s a little harsh on my sensitive skin, but the benefits are worth it.</li>
            <li> **I received the product free from clearlybetterchallenge.com as a member of One2One Network**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am someone who is generally skeptical of new deodorants because I have had so many problems with them in the past. In addition to the problems I have had in the past I was worried about the fact that this one is a gel.  I have sensation problems where certain things give me the shivers.  This gel is cool to the touch and makes me squirm for the first few moments after applying it, but it quickly dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it states that the product is unscented it isn&#x27;t actually 100% unscented.  I prefer unscented because scents can irritate my nose, but this one quickly dissipates and does not bother me.  This is defiantly my new favorite deodorant and I love that I can easily buy it off of amazon!</li>
            <li> Since I was a teen, Secret has been my go-to deodorant. A must have for summer. As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> I loved the performace of this product!  I worked hard in the garden one day and it worked perfect.  I was a little worried about using a gel but  I didn&#x27;t even notice it all.  The plus for me will be no white marks on my clothes.  Finding another outfit is never fun.  I will definetly be buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> I have tried a ton of deodorants. I mean a ton! I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding one that I really like. My needs are simple; I need to not stink while sweating and not have visible white marks on my clothes from my deodorant. Apparently this was too much to ask in the past. So I was a bit skeptical when I heard of the new Secret Outlast clear gel. But I thought I ought to at least give it a chance, eh? Boy am I glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on clear and clean just like it says it will. It has a very faint scent, but it just smells fresh. But when I sweat I don&#x27;t have a scent if I put on my Secret Outlast. The B.O. has been banished. I absolutely love it! Definitely my new deodorant of choice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. I have been using the Secret outlast clear gel deodorant since I received it last week. Through a tough work week and busy home life, it worked just great. I am not a big fan of gel products but, it went on smooth and dried quickly. It also did not leave ant white streaks as advertised .</li>
            <li> *As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. However, I am expressing my true opinions in this review.*&lt;br /&gt;I have never used Secret deodorant before receiving this sample, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I had always assumed all deodorants are basically the same. How can one provide better protection or last longer than other. After a couple days of using Secret Outlast though, I changed my mind! I loved the way it made me smell, which is kind of weird, I know, but I just smelled so fresh... and it lasted overnight!</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. i would totally recommend this to anyone, the gel goes on smoothly and dries quickly, it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on your clothes and the odor protection definately outlasts any other deodorants i&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. I  was excited to try secret outlast clear gel so and I am so happy I did it goes on clear dries very quickly and does not stain your clothing.</li>
            <li> As an active mom and wife I need a deodorant that works. And this gets the job done. I could tell it was working while I was working out and I definitely recommend it to my friends! The smell is great but not overbearing like other deodorants can be. And it really protected me from stinking while sweating.    As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> This product definitely is out-standing and out-lasting! If you have an odor problem you have to try it out. I am not a fan of clear/wet products, but this one does not leave that icky feeling in your armpits. And the smell is wonderful. You do not smell your body odor for a long time. I loved it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the Secret Outlast clean and clear gel its works a lot better than the other brands that I am use to.  I notice that it goes on clear and dries pretty fast leaving no white spots on your clothing. It also keeps me well protected longer than the other deodorant I use to use. Thank you BzzAgent for allowing me to try this product. I it is now a must have at my house.</li>
            <li> I got this Deodorant Clear Gel for free as a promotion from &amp;#34;Secret&amp;#34;. I have been using this product for a while now and I just somply love it! Our fall here has brought us temps in the upper 80&#x27;s - if you want to use a fragrance free aSend CLEAR gel deodorant that will not leave you hanging, use Secret Outlast. I is easy to use, dries fast and lasts long! I can highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotion from Secret and as a person with sensitive skin I had my doubts but I will never use another deodorant again!  It dries fast, lasts all day, and doesn&#x27;t break me out!</li>
            <li> The purpose of anti-perspiration is.....? This product goes on wet and stays sticky all day. I think the company just wanted to save money. I&#x27;ve used secret for years and will continue if I can find the invisible solid.</li>
            <li> I love Secret Outlast, it drys fast, keeps me smelling and feeling clean as well as not leaving white marks. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;#GotItFree</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this product and I LOVE it!  I have tried clear gels in the past and they never seemed to work, but this one is awesome! Not only did I not break a sweat when wearing my warmest shirt to work, I now don&#x27;t have to worry about those pesky mystery white marks that always seem to emerge when I&#x27;m presenting in a meeting or talking to a client.  I&#x27;m so happy to have found this product, I&#x27;m a fan for life now!</li>
            <li> I got this product apart of a promotion and I love it. It dries quickly and there is no wetness. I love it.. Good for active people.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant/antiperspirant so far in my life.  I&#x27;m male and have always hated men&#x27;s deodorant due to the awful smell (the \\&quot;Axe revolution\\&quot; in men&#x27;s products is just AWFUL) -- it&#x27;s impossible to find a men&#x27;s product that&#x27;s unscented, works *and* won&#x27;t leave white marks on clothing.  I experimented with \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants and NONE of them worked (I bought every kind I could find over several years).  I even tried DYI stuff using instructions found online.  Nothing worked.  Finally I started experimenting with women&#x27;s deodorants, and this one is perfect -- the clear gel, unscented works great and doesn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes.  It does have a very faint smell, but it&#x27;s the faintest and most tolerable I&#x27;ve found to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT I have found that I NEED TO LET IT DRY before getting dressed, and I would suggest you do the same.  Put it on (a little goes a long way) and, shirtless, brush your teeth or do your hair or something that raises your arms just a little for a minute or so.  It doesn&#x27;t take long but it&#x27;s totally worth it.  You could also, ahem, go #2 and let it dry whilst sitting down.  That way none of the product will come off onto your clothing, and hence it will work better cause it&#x27;s actually ON your skin doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to start getting this through Amazon&#x27;s subscribe &amp; save!</li>
            <li> from my mother who i got it for she so loved it and it refreshing smell and how well it protected her throughout her day.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like gel deodorant, but this one dries quickly and it really works.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I have been able to find recently that does not leave a smell that is unpleasant.  It also does not leave a mess on clothing.</li>
            <li> Do not get me wrong, this is a decent deodorant. It actually is clear, which is rare from deodorants that purport to be clear. My issue with this deodorant is that it does not last through much activity. The deodorant also does not last for very many &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34;. most of my deodorants last for several months, but this one runs out rather fast, which is one of the issues with the &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; deodorants. I wish there were more invisible solids available, but until then I will keep this around for when I am wearing sleeveless on a night out.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this formula! This deoderant does not clash with any other scents you may want to wear! I find the formula gentle and effective! I hope you keep making this one because I have a difficult time finding something I can use on sensitive skin that really works! I am a very active person and my normal deodorant wasn&#x27;t working so when I finally ran out I decided to give this one a go AND OMG IT WORKS SOOOOOOOOOO GOOD NEVER STOP MAKING IT PLEASE! I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant and I wouldn&#x27;t consider changing.  Gives long lasting protection whether working out or just going about my typical busy working mom day.  This smell is also great!</li>
            <li> I got asked to try this out as part of BzzAgent promotion.  I was delighted with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my fresh and dry all day long on a buys hospital unit.  No complaints about the scent (work in a scent free environment, so was a bit leery of trying it).  No stains on my navy uniforms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A win, win, all around.</li>
            <li> I tried Secret as part of a campaign thru BZZAgent and I have tried many brands and types in the past years.  I usually use solid and hate when it breaks off.  I have not liked gel in the past, but this quick drying has worked great.</li>
            <li> I am a bzzagent and recently received the Secret Outlast Clear Gel Antiperspirant to try.  I am one of those people who buys the same type of deodorant every time, and was actually a little weary about a gel as I had tried one several years ago and didn&#x27;t care for it but I was extremely pleased with this new antiperspirant.  My concern was the gel feeling wet or sticky after applying, but I was pleasantly surprised at how fast it dried and it did not feel sticky at all.  The smell is nice and the protection is great for every day work and life.  I will definitely buy this product for myself.</li>
            <li> As a BzzAgent I recieved this product to test. I LOVE it! It works great as an antiperspirant and deodorant but the best part is......no marks! I can wear black with no problem and I can even try on clothes in a store without worry!</li>
            <li> This works very well. I used it before I went exercising and afterwards I was still smelling fresh. The only thing that I am not wild about and the reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it contains aluminum, which is said to be a possible cause for breast cancer. Other than that, it works just as well as it claims. It doesn&#x27;t take much for it to do its job. I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite deodorant!! Effective and  does what it says!! I began using this as a teen im now in my thirties and till still using this product passing the torch down to my teen girl happy to say she really enjoys this along will all of secrets products.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast may be my new go-to antiperspirant! I have tried everything on the market that claims it will meet my needs. I generally use clinical formulas, but holy cow are they expensive! After a couple of days using Secret Outlast, I am thrilled! No having to reapply every few hours, and no white marks on my black running clothes! My wedding day is fast approaching, and I am so glad that my dress will not be covered in a white streaky mess. My Secret ;) for my wedding came to me in the nick of time in an awesome FREE BzzKit.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I got it free from Bzzagent to try! It is my favorite deodorant now! I have to admit I am a very sweaty person and  this deodorant keeps me dry and odor free all day! Doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothes, and I love to wear black tops! And I like the fact  that the container allows you to dispense just the amount you want to use. Just perfect!</li>
            <li> I must admit I was skeptical of this deodorant.  I&#x27;ve used clear gel deodorants before and they didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With one click I had at least 24 hour protection!  It takes a couple minutes for the gel to dry but once it dries you are all set. It surprisingly dried much faster than I expected. The gel dries clear so no white residue on my clothes or in my pits.  I usually have a hard time finding a deodorant that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used one click for each arm.  I wouldn&#x27;t use more than two it would be a lot of gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received this deodorant for free to try and give my feedback.</li>
            <li> I received this deodorant free to try through buzz agent as part of a manufactures promotion. This deodorant is incredible! It dries quicker than any gel I&#x27;ve ever tried. It smells fantastic all day. I wore a black sleeveless shirt and it didn&#x27;t leave any residue. No matter how much I sweated it kept me dry. I have told everybody that they have to try this. It&#x27;s the only kind I use now.</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant to try from BzzAgent. It was the &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; scent. I really loved it! I tend to be in a hurry most mornings, so I was surprised that dried quickly (literally within seconds)! It also did not leave any white marks &amp; it smelled fantastic! It provides 48 hour protection because it&#x27;s PH minimizes odor-causing bacteria. It kept me fresh &amp; clean all day! My older son gave it a try as well (and this boy sweats a lot), and he was amazed that it worked so well on him! Fantastic product, go give it a try!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! No white streaks on my shirts and no sweat stains. No matter what I am doing from work to karate class I can always count on staying dry and streal free. And I got it free with BzzAgent</li>
            <li> This deodorant/antiperspirant works well, but it goes on so wet, I have to wait a long time before I can get dressed.  I wanted to try a gel, but I like the dry stick much better.</li>
            <li> I am a tried and true Secret Antiperspirant user and have been for years.  I was sent this Secret Outlast Gel as a trial from the Secret company and BzzAgent.  I thought, well I love the products anyway so whats new with this one.  This one is a quick drying gel that goes on completely clear and won&#x27;t leave white marks on your clothing.  A big plus.  It is really frustrating when you put on a top and look in the mirror and have the deodorant marks on it. Secret Outlast leaves no marks at all....ever.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Keeps me dry all day long in the Florida heat. I recommend it highly. thanks to Bzzagent I got to try this product for free</li>
            <li> Just get over the initial wetness when it goes on and you&#x27;ll love the all dryness you&#x27;ll receive.  The clean fresh scent lifts your spirits while you stay dry.  Highly recommend this product.  I&#x27;ve only used the Clean fresh scent, not the unscented or floral one.</li>
            <li> I have always used Secret deodorant in the past and I must say this is one of the best products on the market. The brand of deodorant I received and tested is the Secret Outlast “Completely Clean”. “Completely Clean” does what it is projected to do in the allotted time of 48 hours and beyond it provides protection and leaves you feeling fresh and clean. The product has a series of holes on the top and a twist mechanism at the bottom to dispense the gel and a see-thru sleek dispenser that allows the user to know how much they have left. All I used was one twist or one click of the gel and applied under each arm, the product is light and cool on the skin. I did not need that much to experiment with the product from previous use of Secret deodorant products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I. 7:00 a.m.: Daily workout, 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;II. 7:30 a.m.: Showered then applied&lt;br /&gt;III. 8:00 a.m. Took children to school&lt;br /&gt;IV. 9:00 a.m. Commenced daily household chores&lt;br /&gt;V. 1:00 p.m. Went to work ( Commutations Technician, does not include strenuous work)&lt;br /&gt;VI. 9:15 p.m. Returned home&lt;br /&gt;VII. 9:45 p.m. Showered&lt;br /&gt;VIII. 11:00 p.m. BEDTIME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the Day 2, I continued my regular schedule without applying the Secret Outlast “Completely Clean”. The deodorant provided protection for those two days without failure. As a security measure and in order to save myself from embarrassment, I brought along the deodorant with me just in case I had to use it; I did not. Upon completing this trial, I also checked the underarms of my clothing to make sure that there were no deodorant marks left from the “Completely Clean”, there were no marks. On Day 3 I continued my regular schedule applying “Completely Clean”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up the use of the product, I can conclude that it indeed leaves you fresh and clean and protects the full 48 hours. It allows the user to have confidence that this product will protect them from excessive sweating and order. Youwill be able to raise your hands high, hug, and be in close proximity of others without worrying if they could smell a musty order coming from your body, without anyone questioning your daily hygiene routine. I think I can love this product and I will definitely use this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I tried this deoderant I received for free and really like it!  It keeps me dry all day long, dries quickly and does not leave those annoying marks on your clothes!</li>
            <li> I got to try this deodorant for free as part of a promotion. I was not too excited at the opportunity because I cannot find a deodorant that I like. I decided to give it a go. I normally have three deodorants on hand as I cannot find one that I love. This deodorant meets the mark. First of all, it does not leave any marks. Second, it does not leave any gummy residue on my skin after a few hours of wear. Third, it controls odor for a very long time. I am a convert.</li>
            <li> great deodorant leaves you clean and fresh smelling for 48 hours I received it from as a promotion  from  secret</li>
            <li> I always use Secret Solid deoderants, but wanted to try this new Secret Outlast Gel...I am personally not a fan of the feeling of the gel for the first seconds it is on...however it does dry instantly and works great and lasts all day....especially since i am spending my days in PreK running around after kids all day!!  I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast the smell is amazing and I&#x27;m dry morning till night with no worries. Over the holidays I went to many parties and family functions. Although the stress was high at times, I never had to worry about any older or wetness because yes secret outlast clear gel is amazing and works so well. No worries when I wear my secret outlast clear gel. I was amazed at how well this product works in you will be too if you give it a try. #gotitfree  I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand and love it so very much!</li>
            <li> This product of Secret is aces with my daughter. It only took this Dad 22 years to find something she liked haha. Seriously, she LOVES this product without question. A+++++</li>
            <li> I received the this product as part of a promotion from the brand and I Love it! Especially when you love wearing dark clothing. Has great odor and clothing protection. Goes on smooth and the smell is just amazing. I surely recommend! It also gives you a 48 hour protection!</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast, was super light after applying, was a little cold at first when applying, dried super fast. It left me feeling dry with no sticky feeling even after 48 hours of testing this product it still left me dry with no discomfort of sweating, as well leaving no trace on my clothing whatsoever.  I will indeed purchase this Deodorant in the future, two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I am a convert.  I received my Secret Outlast as a product review for BzzAgent.  I used to use Dove invisible solid.  From the first time I used this new product I was hooked.  I have sensitive skin and this went on smooth no stinging, and dried very quickly with no visible residue.  Love that it keeps me dry all day, even in stressful situations.</li>
            <li> I loathe white marks left from deodorant. Over the years, I&#x27;ve had to throw away some of my most beloved shirts/dresses because of a build up of white marks that could not be cleaned. But I&#x27;ve always felt that clear gels don&#x27;t work as well as white antiperspirants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried Secret Outlast Completely Clean clear gel deodorant. Not only is it completely invisible, but it works very well as an antiperspirant. I work with kids, so I am constantly moving throughout the day. Secret Outlast works throughout the day without the need for reapplication. Plus, I never have to throw out my favorite clothes for white mark stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that I got it for free through BzzAgent.com!</li>
            <li> Great new product - Will be sure to purchase and use again! Does not leave unwanted marks on clothing and dries super fast!</li>
            <li> It smells great! and I love the fact that there really is no white residue left on your clothes</li>
            <li> Unscented, and clear. Works well.</li>
            <li> I received this deodorant from bzzagent.com, to use and spread word of mouth advertisement.  At first I really liked the deodorant but after a few days, the deodorant started guming up in my arm pits.  The protection was good, the scent was fabulous and I loved the fact there wasn&#x27;t any white residue on my clothes; however,  I do not think I would buy this deodorant because of the guming effect  but you might have a different experience.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and now have it delivered through my Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a great deodorant, but I was extremely allergic to this and I have never had any allergic reaction to a deodorant before. I am fine with any secret products except outlast. Just beware if you have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great deodorant, lasts a long time, doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, but leaves a fresh and smooth feel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Secret deodorant girl for a long time. I usually use the solid but was excited to try the completely clean clear gel. I&#x27;ve used gels a long time ago but have never been crazy about them because they took a long time to dry and stung after applying to freshly shaved pits. I tried this the other day and the first thing I noticed was how nice it smelled. I usually go for the floral/fruity scents because I feel like &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scents always smelled like baby powder. This doesn&#x27;t! It really smelled like you are fresh out of the shower...clean! I put it on and realized I just shaved but to my surprise there was no stinging, none! It only needed one click and it covered the whole area. I was going to wait to let it dry but by the time I grabbed my lotion I was dry..I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly it dried. I even touched it before I put my shirt on to make sure it wasn&#x27;t wet and it was dry and felt smooth. It&#x27;s been a few hours and still no wetness and my pits feel soft. I will definitely be converting to this! It&#x27;s awesome!  * I did receive this product for free for an *honest* review, it has no way changed my opinion*</li>
            <li> Great deodorant. Provides 24 hour plus protection. I washed it off after 24 hours I&#x27;m confident that it would last longer. Fresh scent. No skin reactions. No white marks on clothing. Reasonably priced. I would recommend this product to anyone. It&#x27;s better than aerosol, solid and roll on type deodorants. Doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling wet or sticky. I received a free sample from Bzzagent my opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I have used secret and its ok for easy days but I don&#x27;t feel its long lasting for tough workouts or being in the sun all day</li>
            <li> I received a sample size of this deodorant for free as part of a bzzagent campaign to review. I usually use secret clinical and have always been very happy with it. I was not expecting this to hold up to the protection I feel I get from the clinical deodorant and with good reason since it&#x27;s true. Within 4 hours I felt like I had to reapply. I&#x27;m really not impressed with this formula but would recommend the secret clinical deodorant.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best deodorant on the market right now. Being a bzzagent i got this free to try and fell in love.  Great for people who work out alot, fight the humidity and just every day people. Don&#x27;t be turned off that it is gel. It does dry fast and does not leave a sticky wet feeling under your pits. It smells great and easy turn click to use. Highly recommended! Give it  a try!</li>
            <li> I have reactive this product to try for free from Secreat and I have love it. It&#x27;s not like othere gel The order that I have tried love that the sun dries out within minutes and it doesn&#x27;t leave you the sticky feeling that mostly others do pause and gives you a refreshing sensation in the aroma lost long especially since I&#x27;m really active doing CrossFit this is like really great</li>
            <li> It does work sometimes for me in regards to not sweating through my shirts, some days it works better than others. I just need something that I can count on all the time.</li>
            <li> I received this deodorant from buzz campaign from Secret. I was originally not impressed with any other clear gels I have tried. This one however, was a very good product for me. Although it does not do the specified wetness protection, hence the four stars, it does not leave white marks. I live in the desert so, having wetness protection would have been a big bonus for me. It does smell good, and lasts far longer than any other products I have tried. This product does everything it has promised except for wetness protection.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this from Bzzagent and Secret for a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I was most excited about when trying this product was the lack of white marks. I&#x27;m sure everyone knows how frustrating they can be. To put it to the test, I put the deodorant on first and then put my black tank top on. No white marks! I honestly think this is the first deodorant I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t leave them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;outlast&amp;#34; other deodorants. When I was just sitting around in an air conditioned house, it worked out fine. If you are mildly active, it&#x27;s ok. If you are in the hot sun for hours, nope. It works horribly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The first couple of days I tried it, I was inside in the AC, not very active. I worked reasonably well. I did feel like it wore away quickly, but that could just be me being paranoid. After a few days I was outside in the hot sun for small amounts of time. Playing with the kids, gardening. Nothing to strenuous. I definitely felt I had to apply it a couple of times. Then we went camping for a weekend. No AC. 90+ degree heat and horrible humidity. It did not work. Luckily, I brought  back up deodorant. Which, oddly enough was a different secret deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; All in all, if you are in a position where you really don&#x27;t sweat, this may be the deodorant for you. If you are more concerned with how your clothing looks and you typically don&#x27;t have to worry about protection, this would be perfect for you. If you plan on sweating a lot, this is not what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast is the most effective odor protection is have used so far. I work in the hot sun six days a week and have tried a lot of brands in hopes to not feel completely gross by the end of each day. I have not had any problems with this besides applying after shaving which may burn if you have any cuts or nicks from a newer razor. However, that small problem has not kept me from using this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff! All the scented deodorant tended to give me BO even if I wasn&#x27;t sweating...this alleviated all odor!</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a about 15 days now, I love it!! Finally an underarm deo that will keep the sweat away! I sweat profusely, I have tried a number of products but none worked and most of them darkened my underarms. The Secret outlast gel works great! Perfumes generally causes skin rashes on me, so the unscented option works great for me!! It lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Secret and Bzzagent I was able to try this product for free and I have to say I was very impressed! I have tried a lot of gel deodorants and they always left me feeling wet and my skin irritated, with the outlast clear gel I had no issues at all. As soon as I applied it the product dried right away and also it left NO white marks on my shirts. From now on I will be buying this deodorant. It is a great product and am very happy with it.  #LifeHack</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast unscented clear gel deodorant is great! I&#x27;ve been using a solid, but this deoderant does not get on your clothes! I love the scent and it works for 48 hours! No white marks, quick drying, and great smell. I am a park ranger, and I live and work in South Louisiana. This stuff keeps me from smelling swampy, even though I work in one! Also, I got it free for being a BzzAgent.  I have tried it, and I fully recommend it!</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand through www.bzzagent.com.  It keeps me dry all day and smells great!  Only downfall I&#x27;ve found is that it feels cold when I put it on after the shower on cold days.</li>
            <li> Works great at preventing wetness.  I&#x27;ve tried various clinical strength deodorants, and I was never satisfied -- I was always left with wet marks under my arms either through heat or sweat.  This formula works for me, and my arms have been dry. The gel goes on easily, dries fast, and doesn&#x27;t leave any marks. Really it&#x27;s all you could ask for in a deodorant.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.  I tested the product as part of Bzzz marketing campaign, and I&#x27;m glad that I did.  It&#x27;ll be my go-to deodorant from now on.</li>
            <li> It is great.  I can&#x27;t  use anything else except  secret clear gel unscented  due to allergic reaction to every other deodorant</li>
            <li> Wow! This gives up to 48 hours of protection. Even though it goes on wet leaves no marks on clothing. It dries quick and has no harsh scents. I #GotItFree to review it but I will be buying it from now on.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast really works.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have purchased deodorant hoping it performs as advertised.  I wear a lot of black and I really hate how most deodorant leaves white marks on my clothes.  No matter how many say they won&#x27;t, they always do.  Well FINALLY I found one that really does what it claims and does not leave marks.  It works great against odor too, which is just as important.  I will be sticking with Secret Outlast from now on.</li>
            <li> After having tried pretty much every deodorant on the market, including the clinical ones, Secret&#x27;s Outlast Clear Gel in Unscented is a godsend. Even though I am not too active most of the time, I would find myself feeling not so fresh by the end of the day. A click of the Outlast under each armpit in the morning is all I needed. I let it dry for a minute before getting dressed, and if it&#x27;s humid I blast each pit with the cool air setting from my hairdryer. Works all day, and does not get on my clothes at all. No white marks, no gunk on my clothes, nothing. I got a free sample and coupons as a Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I got it free with Buzz Agent. I love the clear gel.</li>
            <li> my fav deodorant, no white powder to mess my tees, just keeps me dry and odor-free. you win</li>
            <li> This goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind when it dries. It truly is unscented.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this Free though my Bzzagent Campaign.  At 1st I was not sure because it was a gel.  But I got it put it on and loved it.  I sell Scentsy at events and was out in the heat and sun for a whole weekend.  I used this and it was clear like nothing was there and it lasted both days.  I woke up late the 2nd day so no time to re apply and thank god it was still working lol.  Love Love Love this product.  I deff found a new deodorant to use.  Been using ever since.  Great for the women who are always on the run.</li>
            <li> As someone who has 3 or 4 rotating deodorants at any given time, this one is always one of them. Works really well without drying skin.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase secret outlast clear gel deodorant instead  of  my usual go to  clear stick brand of deodorant.  I was so impressed by the odor  protection and wetness control that i experienced from the sample that i received via bzzagent.com  while in the Bahamas that I  bought the full sized bottle.  I&#x27;m not sure about the 48 hour odor protection claim but. ..who goes that long between showering anyway. .Even if circumstances have it. .why would anyone expect to go more than a day without reapplying deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I  was skeptical because I&#x27;m just to invisible solids and when i used the product in the past i hated that wet feeling. I got over it after a while and realized that This is a great product because :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO white marks.  Even with invisible solids you still get white marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy application,  I only need to turn the dial once or twice to dispense the product.  If i dispense too much then i just reverse the direction and the product returns to the contains  (if you didn&#x27;t disperse too much )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, i like it. I may not have totally replaced my go to brand but secret will definitely be added in .</li>
            <li> Great but sometimes it oozes out a bit on its own.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant from BzzAgent, and used it every day for about for two weeks. It worked just as well as the solid deodorant that I used to use (even in the hot Georgia summer!), and left no marks on my cloths, so I think I&#x27;m ready to switch!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t worry much about marks using this deodorant, and it&#x27;s pretty scentless. if i sweat a lot though it wears off kinda quickly.</li>
            <li> I order this one all the time...goes on clear and stays put without leaving a residue on dark clothing. Clean yet not overpowering fragrance and does not compete with my perfume...My FAV!</li>
            <li> Works great and took advantage of amazon coupon clipping, so I got a great deal as well!</li>
            <li> It works, I like the gel, however it definitely cannot be described as \\&quot;unscented\\&quot;.  After noticing it had the aroma of a man&#x27;s cologne, I looked at the ingredients which state a masking fragrance. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.  I&#x27;m disappointed, to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;When I wear a scent, I wish it to be my own perfume, not some arbitrary scent from my underarm deodorant.</li>
            <li> Should have read description more carefully. I don&#x27;t like the wet gel. I prefer the solid version. Works ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the product and it smells great and the freshness lasts a long time. There is no white marks on my clothes, fresh scent, and worth the wait. BzzAgent is the best for letting me try this product for the first time.. BzzAgent has the best ways of letting people sample products without having to buy it! BzzAgent is the best!</li>
            <li> i recieved a trial size of this amazing deodorant from bzzagent and i love it! there is no residue and it dries very quickly, best of all it last all day.</li>
            <li> Works for the first 4 - 6 hours, but can&#x27;t quite make it to the 10-hour mark on a stressful day. Alas!</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant.  It goes on easily, dries quickly and leaves no white marks.  And it works!</li>
            <li> Yay no more white marks on my black work shirts</li>
            <li> I love Secret deodorant. It is the only brand I like to use. BUT,  my mother is allergic to all fragrances, so I like having this on hand so she won&#x27;t be affected by the smell. (otherwise I use the great smells that I feel like cover any sweat smell!)  I love that amazon will ship it to my door for a great price!</li>
            <li> Love the clear gel! IT LASTS!</li>
            <li> I am a bzzagent and had the opportunity to try Secret Outlast Clear gel as a free sample. I do use Secret deodorants but this one will not be purchased again. I live in the most southern part of Alabama and it&#x27;s always humid and hot. There were no marks on any of the clothing I wore on the days I tried this out.  The wetness was not a big issue, I honestly don&#x27;t have that much of a problem there but the odor was an issue. The first day I tried it I just went to two grocery stores, walmart and the dollar tree, I was gone about 2 hours. When I got home I did the sniff check because i was pretty certain I had smelled myself in the store when I had reached for an item but surely it couldn&#x27;t be me, not so soon after applying. But sure enough it was.  I gave it another try the next day during the evening time and had the same thing. Two hours later, just normal behavior no working out or being outdoors for long and I smelled like I had not put on deoderant at all. Thank you bzzagent and Secret for letting me try this product. I truely wanted it to work but it&#x27;s just not the product for me.</li>
            <li> WORST PACKAGING EVER you have to take a knife and hit it and cut it and bang on it and finally you get it open and the deodorant spills every where AWFUL PACKAGING product might be good but no one ever finds out bk they can&#x27;t open the container. THIS HAPPENED TO ME twice out of three times buying it, AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL</li>
            <li> I had the pleasure to review Secret Outlast Clear Gel deodorant thanks to Secret and bzzagent. It goes on clear, the fragrance is great (no deodorant should smell like baby powder, very appreciative that this one absolutely does NOT) and it lasts for 48 hours, maybe even longer but I refused to push it to that point. I did decide to test its longevity. I applied the deodorant on Sunday, went on about my day, showered, slept, woke up Monday and did not apply deodorant purposefully just to see if the claim was legit. It has been hot as balls and I must say, by the end of the day was shocked that I did not smell of death. I am pleasantly pleased.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand trying the product for free thanks to Secret.The best antiperspirant/deodorant for sweating and odor, especially stress sweat, and I&#x27;ve tried many. I can apply this one day, and if I shower and forget to apply it the next day it feels like it&#x27;s still working - it&#x27;s that strong. It says to apply the night before but I always shower and apply in the morning. I worry about applying such a strong chemical to my skin but it does work so I will stick with it for now.</li>
            <li> The best deodorant out there. Even though it is lot all natural, it is not all that bad for you.</li>
            <li> GREAT PROTECTION NO HEAVY SCENT</li>
            <li> Didnt like it smelled aweful and made my skin itch</li>
            <li> Product leaves no residue, has no odor and does the job.</li>
            <li> I made this purchase because i&#x27;ve recently switched to Secret&#x27;s PH balanced invisible solid late last year. That product works great so when I saw a coupon for this Outlast clear gel, I figured it&#x27;d be great too. I was wrong. I only used it twice and haven&#x27;t tried it since. I could notice a smell after only a couple hours of work, and finally compared the labels to see what the difference was: the Ph balanced has aluminum zirconium trichlorohydrex gly 18% as the main ingredient, while outlast uses aluminum zirconium octachlorohydrex gly 16%. Not sure what the exact difference is between the two aluminums, but I do know the Ph one lasts much longer and actually does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> love the scent and price is great</li>
            <li> I have used gels in the past and they always seems to leave my arm pits sticky and my clothing wet. I hated everything about them so when I joined the Buzz Agent campaign for the secret outlast I decided that I would have an open mind. I am really glad that I did because I was impressed that the scent was not over powering, I had no sticky feeling, my clothes did not have any traces of the gel. I was a happy girl! I would recommend this to anyone that is looking to try something that actually does what is says.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff very good use is a lot! Love the protection it gives you!</li>
            <li> Ilove this deodorant. It lasted all day from me running around town in the sweltering heat. Yes i sweated a little bit but at the end of the day I was still fresh. This is going to be a new deodorant in my household! I was able to try Secret Outlast through #bzzagent for free for my HONEST opinion.</li>
            <li> I received this lovely product after getting it as part of a Bzzkit from Bzzagent.  Like many of you, I&#x27;ve used many different types of deodorant in my day.  I like that this product does exactly as advertised.  It goes on smooth, clear and lasts.  I wore this to work in a hospital and even on a day it was 95 to help someone move.  At the end of those days, taking my shirt off to get in the shower, I could smell the scent from the deodorant, not sweat.  I even put it to the true test on a stretch of five days off work.  I got up, took a shower, put this on and then skipped the shower the next day.  It works.  I continued without nasty underarm sweating and no odor.  When I showered the following day, I still could smell the product.  This stuff works. Even better, I wear a lot of black so it was nice not seeing white streaks on my clothes. I&#x27;m rating 4 stars though because my only criticism I can offer is a big deal for me, it feels damp when it goes on as most gels tend to do and I had to let it dry before putting clothes on because that feeling makes me crazy and it&#x27;s more a personal quirk than criticism.  I just don&#x27;t like feeling wet under there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying this product for free thanks to Secret through a Bzzz campaign.  I was a little leery about trying this product as the idea of goo under my arms wasn&#x27;t sounding very helpful to me.  Thankfully, I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised!  This product has worked just as well as my other stick deodorant. Although it says unscented, there is a slight fragrance to it albeit very slight and not at all noticeable once it dries.&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint about this product is the residue it leaves.  Maybe I&#x27;m putting too much on but it&#x27;s very hard to wash off and leave residue on my clothes.  Many of my summer shirts now have residue on the inside armpits that refuse to wash off.  You can&#x27;t see it from the outside but I hate knowing it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I&#x27;m a fan of this product.  For the price on Amazon, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I received this product as part of the BzzAgent campaign, actually I was somewhat skeptical about trying a new deoderant. I love Secret but have always used the invisible solid. I have a very busy, active job and lately, I had noticed my deoderant was not holding up its end of the bargain by the end of the day and I needed to reapply. I figured this was an awesome time to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first use, I was impressed with the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel deoderant. It went on clear and I didn&#x27;t worry about streaks on my black shirt. Putting it on, it did feel a little different than the solid that I normally use...it was more wet (for lack of a better term), but it dried very quickly and I didn&#x27;t feel like I was wearing anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day I wore this deoderant, I had a 14 hour day at work that was extremely busy. I was constantly on the move. It wasn&#x27;t until I got in my car to head home that I remembered the new deoderant that I had put on that day. Of course I did what any normal person would do...I sniffed my armpit. I was amazed that the deoderant had held up all day. The Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel doesn&#x27;t have a strong sent, but it smells clean...I could still smell that clean scent at the end of the day. It definitely holds up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second test was the day that I forgot to put deoderant on in the morning. It wasn&#x27;t until I got to work that I remembered. I was about to reach for the stick that I keep in my desk, but I thought that I would see if the deoderant really held up (I had taken a shower the night before and applied deoderant afterwards) for multiple days. While I don&#x27;t plan to forget deoderant regularly, it was nice to know that this would hold up for a really long time and keep me smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> I will never buy another deodorant  but this again!  Not only did it not feel sticky or leave disgusting white marks, but it actually works  all day long!  I&#x27;ve never had another deodorant  actually do all 3 of those things until this one! Thank you Secret for letting me try this for free! I&#x27;ve purchased a full size stick  before the sample was even gone!</li>
            <li> I was able to try this deodorant free from Secret, and I&#x27;ve got to say I love this deodorant! It smells great and it left my armpits feeling silky smooth! The only issue that I had with it, was that I had to keep reapplying it throughout the day. It&#x27;s not really 48 hour protection.</li>
            <li> Love the way this goes on....not sticky afterwards although you do have to wait a minute or two for the stickiness to go away.  Works as it should at least no one has complained about any odors on me.....I&#x27;m sure  my husband would.  I would recommend if you have a sensitivity to fragrance like I do.</li>
            <li> no white marks, goes on clear, lasts all day. what more could a girl ask for? I love secret outlast deodorant.</li>
            <li> Received a free sample for a review and wasn&#x27;t really expected much from it. I&#x27;m usually not a fan of gel deodorants but this one was quick to dry and left no marks on my clothing. It also helped me not break a sweat in 90 degree weather and truly does last 48 hours, which is great if you&#x27;re an on the go mom and don&#x27;t have time to keep reapplying. I highly recommend this product! #gotitfree #secretoutlast #bzzkit</li>
            <li> This stuff REALLY works for 48 hours.  You know when you need to skip the shower, but you&#x27;ve been working hard and then that &amp;#34;stink&amp;#34; creeps in the next day....you smell.... Well, stink no more.  This stuff works and keeps on working even the next day.  I recently moved and the movers packed the shower curtain...even with all the activities you do when moving (packing, lifting, sweating, cleaning, sweating) this deo really controlled my BO.  Thanks.  Although I may have looked a bit like a crazy lady during the process, at least I didn&#x27;t smell like one!</li>
            <li> BzzAgent sent me a sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel Antiperspirant / Deodorant to sample and review. Secret claims this deodorant dries quickly, leaves no white marks and lasts for 48 hours. How well does it live up to the claim?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that Secret Outlast goes on wet but dries quickly. I haven&#x27;t noticed any white marks so that part of the claim seems true. I also agree it is highly effective as an antiperspirant. I am not sure I whether it lasts a full 48 hours as I generally shower at least once a day (sometimes twice). I did find the deodorant effective for at least 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any downsides? I don&#x27;t like the initial scent on application, but as it dries that the scent is no longer noticeable to me. Also, if I apply after shaving, I find it stings a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I feel Secret Outlast is good value for money. I only need a tiny amount for effective all day odor protection. It is also effective and seems to live up to most of the product claims.</li>
            <li> This is a great deodorant it keeps my underarms dry and not stinky after a full busy day and for a full 48 hours without white marks on my clothes :) my only complaint is I wish it dried just a tag faster :) I did get my sample from a bzz campaign #gotitfree</li>
            <li> I got this product to test from secret,  although I don&#x27;t know if it lasts 48 hours (I can&#x27;t go that long without showering), this stuff seems to do a pretty bang up job of lasting all day! I gave it the black dress test and it PASSED! Kind of feels weird going on because it&#x27;s gel and it&#x27;s COLD but over all I really like it and I will be buying it again</li>
            <li> Normally I use a solid stick deodorant, I decided to try this out in hopes of escaping the white marks on my clothing, plus I received  it for free to Try from secret through bzzagent!. It works and it dries fast, which was one of the main things I was worried about. The scent is a nice clean scent, nothing too overpowering. The other great thing about Secret deodorant is that it is affordable and very easy to find coupons for.</li>
            <li> The deodorant is good, but not great. The wetness protection and lack of white marks is a huge plus. I did not get 48 hour odor protection, maybe 10 hours. I should disclaim that I normally have to use the extra odor protection deodorant, if I applied twice a day I think it would be okay. If you wear a regular strength deodorant you should be good and I think it&#x27;s great for teens.</li>
            <li> I usually prefer a solid deodorant and feel that gel versions leave a sticky residue but Secret Outlast Gel dried quickly and felt smooth. It did a great job of odor protection and no white marks on my clothes. I would recommend this deodorant, I was given this product free to try and review.</li>
            <li> I received a free stick of this deodorant as a promotion from Secret, so I tried it! It&#x27;s sticky, like all of the gel deodorants I&#x27;ve ever tried, but unlike the others, the 48 hour claim sure seems to be true! I even wake up the next morning smelling fresh without need to reapply! I will keep using this brand... just wish it wasn&#x27;t so sticky feeling!!</li>
            <li> It really does give 48 hour protection. It also doesn&#x27;t show white marks. I used it with my favorite LBD and went dancing. No white marks on my dress and it stood up to an evening of dancing. I received my Secret Outlast via a promotion with Secret.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find at the local stores for some reason. The lady of the house likes the unscented deodorant, so it makes her happy!</li>
            <li> I had high hope for Secret Outlast Clear Gel, and after receiving it in a FREE BzzKit, was anxious to give it a try. I am a high school biology teacher, and spend several hours each day on my feet in front of my students and in the lab. I typically use men&#x27;s clear solid for dryness and odor protection (I don&#x27;t love the scent, but it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that keeps me dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the way the clear gel went on. It was smooth, and the curve of the applicator is perfectly sized for my underarms (maybe I&#x27;m just too used to using the guys&#x27; one!). The gel dries incredibly fast--in fact, it was dry before I even had my outfit for the day assembled. Because it dries so quickly, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about clothing stains or streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the scent, and could smell it throughout the day as I became more active.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I have with the gel, is that it did not keep me dry. I had those cold, tacky underams and a wet shirt by the end of the day. Sadly, it looks like this gel just isn&#x27;t strong enough for me.</li>
            <li> This is a good product that has not let me down yet. It goes on pretty wet, but has never stained my clothes. Even after a day at the office and then a gym workout the formula has kept me smelling fresh. I was lucky enough to get a free sample of this product, but I may continue using it even after the sample runs out.</li>
            <li> Product as stated. Wonderful. I Love that it has no scent.</li>
            <li> Works great, no white marks, the unscented is great for my allergies.</li>
            <li> Great Price! Thanks again!</li>
