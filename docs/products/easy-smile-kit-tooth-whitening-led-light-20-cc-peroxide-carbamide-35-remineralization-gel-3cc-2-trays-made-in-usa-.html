            <li>Happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I retired them (the whitener, not my gums) to Davie Jones locker and bought a great 10% product that I have reviewed separately.</li>
            <li>This package was great for the price.</li>
            <li>Great purchase.</li>
            <li>(Order more when purchasing!!)</li>
            <li>I have used many whitening kits and this one is GREAT!  </li>
            <li>They will form a perfect fit for you.</li>
            <li>Good add-on, and</li>
            <li>I wanted to try the mineral stuff which mine didn&#x27;t come with, so good starter for that too.</li>
            <li>saying how good you look.</li>
            <li>I followed all the instructions, and everything was good until I got some on my gums..</li>
            <li>product didnt work trays melt after 3sec would not recommend as good business</li>
            <li>good instructions.</li>
            <li>The trays are good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use and timely from start to finish of the process you get very good results.</li>
            <li>A great deal for sure.</li>
            <li>one day VERY SATISFIED came on time but</li>
            <li>I think the peroxide stuff is real strong.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S AN AMAZING DEAL, prize wise and effective wise.</li>
            <li>Great product does exactly what it says!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty impressed given the price.</li>
            <li>I will diffently be buying more tubes of gel..and mouth trays!</li>
            <li>I will be using the light tonight!!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>This product has me speechless but smiling more than ever!</li>
            <li>so easy to use, great instructions</li>
            <li>The light in combination with the gel works great and my teeth were noticeably even whiter after just one or two times.</li>
            <li>I had to use this for about a week straight before I noticed any difference, but I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t know how to get it to work effectively without the demise of my gums in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once completing the mold have scissors handy so you can cut off the holding tabs.</li>
            <li>They kind of suck</li>
            <li>then use scissors to trim the excess plastic off the tops, but turned out nice.  </li>
            <li>You can press your lips with your fingers to aid the process but the suction you create will be the most effective.</li>
            <li>it is strong so if u put it  on ur gums it will burn but that means it is a very potent bleaching agent...</li>
            <li>My teeth still aren&#x27;t perfect, but far better than they were.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and is made very well!</li>
            <li>Whitened my teeth for sure.</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow the instruction</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t really satisfied with the brightness of my teeth</li>
            <li>and im glad I did.</li>
            <li>just figured they could use alittle more of a sparkly shine to them</li>
            <li>Hope someone finds this helpful :)</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>You will love this, you just have to have the determination to put up with blanching</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for sure.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I recommend ordering more mouth guards.  </li>
            <li>Ok I agree with alot of the reviews do not get this on your gums</li>
            <li>Ok</li>
            <li>This stuff is potent.</li>
            <li>Using it on consecutive days makes the whitening more even on your teeth.</li>
            <li>Make sure your trays are cut to minimize gum coverage.</li>
            <li>I must keep using to give a better review.</li>
            <li>This is a great kit at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>but if you follow directions they work ok.  </li>
            <li>The trays aren&#x27;t amazing fit</li>
            <li>Do not leave in water for more than 4-5 seconds of they</li>
            <li>I almost made that mistake but was able to salvage it.  </li>
            <li>but it did make my teeth look slightly better.</li>
            <li>Ok product not all that</li>
            <li>Could have been much more appealing to the market.</li>
            <li>TRUST ME but ready great product and cheap lots of people pay $100 for this</li>
            <li>Great vendor, item very complete.</li>
            <li>Once you are satisfied with the mold take a fine point sharpee and trace the outline of your teeth on it.</li>
            <li>Now I feel more confident and love showing off my bright new smile!</li>
            <li>Now I feel more confident and love showing off my bright new smile!</li>
            <li>The only downsides was the incredible tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li>While I had cut the top tray to fit the grooves between my teeth</li>
            <li>Best $11 Ive spent in years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to use and works.</li>
            <li>Every thing after that was easy, and yes the stuff did burn abit if you get some on your gums, but just cowboy up and deal with it.</li>
            <li>It was really  easy to use.  </li>
            <li>That one will run out very quickly compared to the bleaching gel.</li>
            <li>An easy fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is ridiculously strong.</li>
            <li>At 35% it is not so strong that your gums burn</li>
            <li>but Its just to strong for me.</li>
            <li>The peroxide is really strong..</li>
            <li>But pain is beauty, right?! :)</li>
            <li>The whitening gel works fine</li>
            <li>Remineralization gel works fine too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>just fine and</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the Easy Smile product</li>
            <li>Did everything the instructions said, used the light for 10 minutes and after that, I couldn&#x27;t get it to turn on.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the light, though.</li>
            <li>I put the tray in over the top/bottom as I finished each, put in the light and let it sit while I took a shower or cleaned the house (about 20-30 minutes).</li>
            <li>And I say this because the remineralizing gel is important.</li>
            <li>you have to take off the battery pack on the light and remove the plastic tab from the battery for it to work.  </li>
            <li>The light works.  </li>
            <li>The light works well, just remove the film and turn the batteries around.</li>
            <li>I heated and formed my top tray about 6 times until I got it right at around 10 seconds of heating.</li>
            <li>do much I had to stop for a while because of gum damage!!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited I forgot and had those tabs hanging out of my mouth the first time I did the treatment!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It would better to ask the dentist to make the trays and just buy the whitening gel which is not expensive.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and I noticed a difference right away, after using it with the light on for fifteen minutes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend a better &#x27;set&#x27; or picking out your own individual pieces.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering 2 more, my mom and brother REALLY want one too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll probably last me a good year</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick, couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out once I got it in the mail.</li>
            <li>Glad I found this product and I will definitely order more once I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li>I was in sports my whole life so getting the trays right wasn&#x27;t an issue plus I love to whiten my teeth</li>
            <li>but it started burning the very first 10 seconds I put it on.</li>
            <li>Used for the first time tonight, instructions and process was easy just hoping for positive results!</li>
            <li>The instructions are pretty easy to understand, and I was able to make some educated guesses at things that weren&#x27;t totally clear.  </li>
            <li>White strips are more money but are definitely safer and much more effective.</li>
            <li>or so I try not to use it too much because it is really strong stuff.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it claims!</li>
            <li>*UPDATE: Seller did send me a new light free of charge.</li>
            <li>I wish I can replace the light though thanks.</li>
            <li>And that is how I&#x27;ve been using it, every two or three days to brighten up my smile.</li>
            <li>Still worth the money..</li>
            <li>this product isnt worth buying.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to leave this product on as my gums are sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Its fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, remove the batteries from the LED thing, and use it for something useful...</li>
            <li>It is a hassle but worth it.</li>
            <li>it is worth the shot.  </li>
            <li>I had honestly convinced myself that my teeth would never again be white.  </li>
            <li>Also when you warm up the little trays be sure to follow directions exact.</li>
            <li>sugesting, use every other day, it&#x27;s very powerful, but, works amazing.</li>
            <li>Other than that it was all good.</li>
            <li>On the other hand there is some substance to the gum burning but this can be avoided fairly easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(1-2 seconds) until you get it right.</li>
            <li>My only problem is that I cant find a happy medium where more than half of my front teeth are covered with gel because over the course of 30 minutes</li>
            <li>The only concern is that you must read the instruction strictly on how to use this solution because it is very strong and it does and will burn and irritate your gum.</li>
            <li>Ive always kind of envied the people I know with bright white teeth and was a little self conscious of my own but couldnt afford to have them professionally whitened.</li>
            <li>There are more potent concentrations from the same company, but I already have sensitive teeth and don&#x27;t want to risk damaging them while making them pretty.</li>
            <li>so if you dont get it right the first time scrap it and try again in 48 hours, you have PLENTY.</li>
            <li>I would definitely repurchase this without hesitation and its very cheap compared to dental work at the office.</li>
            <li>plus will be too hot to put in mouth..</li>
            <li>You do have to put it in somewhat hot or it doesnt work well...</li>
            <li>(If you over boil like I did on the first one you can still get it to work and can boil again..</li>
            <li>Just wish it has more remineralization gel I ran out by the third time I used it!</li>
            <li>So I ordered it a couple months early for a birthday gift and the person who I gave It to told me the Led light didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>and I could see a real improvement!</li>
            <li>I recommend jus dipping it into the hot water</li>
            <li>This is exactly like getting a zoom treatment but without the hardening gel to protect the gums.</li>
            <li>I have used the kit 4 times now unfortunately not consecutive days</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>After the first whitening treatment, you WILL see results.</li>
            <li>Gums were pretty discolored and they appeared recessed and almost deteriorated between my teeth.</li>
            <li>Dip 1 tray at a time into the water first for 4-5 seconds, then place it into your mouth and suck until it forms around your teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of whitening kits from drugstores and using them for a whole week didn&#x27;t do what one session of this stuff did!</li>
            <li>I have always wanted a really drastic brighter smile</li>
            <li>sure enough I didn&#x27;t need to spend over $100.</li>
            <li>In terms of effectiveness of this solution, I would rate 10/10 because it basically revolved several coats of coffee stains in my teeth over many years.</li>
            <li>I will review again after a few weeks to see if I have good results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with what this little package offers for the price.  </li>
            <li>Whenever I whiten my teeth on my own, I always get comments from other people.</li>
            <li>so it was more flat.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and gave it a five star rating based on its quick and real results.  </li>
            <li>Really whitens teeth dramatically just after the first application.  </li>
            <li>This was pretty fast shipping for a customer that lives all the way in Canada.</li>
            <li>but it is strong enough to see a change.  </li>
            <li>they are soo un conforable and dificult to shape.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it is too strong for m gums I only tried it for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Best $11 Ive spent in years.ght white teeth and was a little self conscious of my own but couldnt afford to have them professionally whitened.</li>
            <li>I would recommend and certainly re-purchase.</li>
            <li>Large amount of product too.</li>
            <li>Its a fine line between getting enough coverage and getting burnt.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much for $11.  </li>
            <li>if you use too much, it will irritate your gums.</li>
            <li>Really works ordered twice.</li>
            <li>The product is very steong</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use too much gel and have had the trays on up to 15-20 minutes with no burn at all.  </li>
            <li>Applied the mold and turned the blue light on.</li>
            <li>This teeth whitening kit really works.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>i should receive a light and trays that actually work</li>
            <li>The remineralization (not a real word) gel is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>but the pain its just too much :/&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you see bubbles forming on the bottom of the pot its ready to go.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>REALLY doesnt take much of this stuff.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do nothing</li>
            <li>Works very well to whiten teeth, it does however make them sensituve</li>
            <li>It arrived fast and it also had instructions.</li>
            <li>It worked very well.</li>
            <li>Had no idea what the blue light was for.  </li>
            <li>Not just the traditional drug store strips but also many vials of bleach from the dentist as well as a professional whitening that cost me $130 which was supposedly a &amp;#34;deal.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>good product, slow shipping from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is the most critical step so take your time and get it right, you only have to do it once.</li>
            <li>I will never waste money again on anything else!!!</li>
            <li>I had higher expectations from it from reviews I had read previously but nonetheless I am quite satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Shine the blue light, and wala-- white smile.-- brush again, and then remineralize!  </li>
            <li>my teeth were like TV magic white after the first time, and blinding by the second treatment.  </li>
            <li>mine were about the same thickness as the original tray when completed, no thinning.</li>
            <li>for the $$ the packaging and the instructions (which where copied from a copy machine) where just down right cheap.  </li>
            <li>Less is more.</li>
            <li>Teeth were super white for the wedding.</li>
            <li>is worth it, and it works really good,just becareful not to leave it on so long less time is ok</li>
            <li>I wish it would&#x27;ve came with more than the 1 set of mouth guards because mine were a little messed up when I did mine.  </li>
            <li>Easy to do and unlike other people</li>
            <li>It could have been that i was doing it wrong though lol</li>
            <li>Makes me so upset because my only option is to mail it back for a refund when what i really want is a light that works.</li>
            <li>WOW really do the job .</li>
            <li>I was going to suffer for wanting a white smile.  </li>
            <li>I had some success with white strips</li>
            <li>I had some success with white strips</li>
            <li>was rip a paper towel or napkin and fold it over so its kind of thick.</li>
            <li>I burned mine a little on my first application and it looked pretty gnarly right after I removed the trays.</li>
            <li>You can both see it lightening your gums when its burning them and you definitely know it doesn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li>I had to buy a new set of them</li>
            <li>I followed all directions and even went and bought new batteries.</li>
            <li>Here is what I did: used a tissue to dry off my teeth, then applied with my fingertip directly to my teeth making sure to get enough to cover each tooth.</li>
            <li>They light was cheap and poorly made and the mouthpieces are of dubious quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying a much less strong gel online soon since I can&#x27;t use this one.</li>
            <li>At first I had a little sensitivity but it quickly went away.</li>
            <li>This is to be expected since the concentration of carbamide peroxide is so high and results come so quickly.</li>
            <li>directions are easy to follow and there is plenty to last a long time, can tell a difference in a week of use</li>
            <li>My teeth whitened dramatically in the first use and I could only leave the stuff on for about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>but they were costly, short lived, and I wasnt exactly amazed by the results.</li>
            <li>But in my first 2 sessions with this stuff my teeth got VERY white.</li>
            <li>but they were costly, short lived, and I wasnt exactly amazed by the results.</li>
            <li>But in my first 2 sessions with this stuff my teeth got VERY white.</li>
            <li>I tried many products from drugstores and not many of them</li>
            <li>Again I got results with the light, a slight burning which I took as my cue to stop.(duh)</li>
            <li>Easy but messy.</li>
            <li>It was as expected - product came quickly,</li>
            <li>I never thought I could achieve a pure white color.</li>
            <li>I did have a time trying ti get the light to come on the little mouth unit.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the trays were difficult to mold, but after they are formed it works great.</li>
            <li>I will update and give 5 stars if they don&#x27;t give me any trouble about replacing the light.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>This was garbage the it made my teeth really sensitive and notice of whitening</li>
            <li>Product give you a professional quality dental whitening.</li>
            <li>I bought it and and it does what it says you cant use it too often because for me it makes my teeth sensitive</li>
            <li>NATURALLY--</li>
            <li>atleast 2-3 times per day, whiten, and if your teeth get sensitive</li>
            <li>Very well actually.</li>
            <li>Wow the kit works.</li>
            <li>I left the bottom tray trimmed straight across which</li>
            <li>You want the tray to be soft and malleable so it creates a well defined mold of your teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only done one session for 30 minutes and my teeth lightened by 1 whole shade (comparing shades to the tooth color chart that is included)</li>
            <li>I used it once so far</li>
            <li>I use my old trays that I had fitted by my dentist office.</li>
            <li>This did not hurt my sensitive teeth either.</li>
            <li>Everything you need to really whiten your teeth by several shades.</li>
            <li>Had everyone at work the next day complimenting my smile especially the girls.</li>
            <li>while shining the light (it activates the peroxide) -- I have no idea if that&#x27;s too long or not long enough, but that&#x27;s what I do--FYI</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the kit for 3 days in a row, and my teeth are noticeably whiter than they started out (some staining, but pretty white).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caused a little sensitivity the first time, but nothing major.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are super white and I have a lot left that will last for months!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unless you have tried this before, I would definitely suggest trying out a LESSER STRENGTH first before jumping on the 35% bus.</li>
            <li>But the basic process is mold your trays by dipping them in hot water, brush your teeth with regular toothpaste, put a line of peroxide in the mold and put them on your teeth.</li>
            <li>its natural DON&#x27;T WORRY in an hour they will be back to normal.</li>
            <li>and it took two weeks to get the same level of white of my teeth after the first week (as I don&#x27;t drink coffee or smoke)</li>
            <li>You should have each individual tooth highly visible in the completed mold.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t adjust fine the trays, it was difficult to do it, the blue led light is just a toy I don&#x27;t see difference when use it.</li>
            <li>Experiment with how much to use and how long to leave it on until you get it</li>
            <li>Not sure how well the whitening gel works or not since the light NEVER worked.</li>
            <li>My gums did not return to normal until 3-4 weeks later.</li>
            <li>But this started going away almost immediately and was perfectly normal by the next day.</li>
            <li>After reading all the review, I think slow and easy is the way to go.</li>
            <li>The kit will last a very long time as it doesn&#x27;t take very much gel for each of the whitening treatments.</li>
            <li>If you cant see it like me, there is a small piece of clear tape on the opposite side of the battery in the mouth unit that has to be peeled off for the light to come on.</li>
            <li>I have used Professional whitening products before and this one simply didn&#x27;t do the job!</li>
            <li>/&gt;To make the proper molds heat a pot of water to near boiling.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve barely used 1mL of the 20mL of peroxide</li>
            <li>Only used it twice so far.  </li>
            <li>The tooth trays take a little bit of work to get them just right</li>
            <li>After going through a few boxes of Crest Professional Whitestrips over about a year I felt like my whiteness peaked and they weren&#x27;t really doing anything anymore</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t overload the tray, a thin line in the bottom of the tray is more than enough.</li>
            <li>They turned white like others have experienced, after only a couple painful minutes in my mouth.</li>
            <li>very well priced unlike the super expensive dentists or brand name strips</li>
            <li>They will shrink to a little nothing ball of rubber if you leave it in hot water to long.</li>
            <li>The directions were extremely clear also the disclaimer that the company is not responsible for any damage.</li>

            <li> but I have seen great improvement.  </li>
            <li> Happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I retired them (the whitener, not my gums) to Davie Jones locker and bought a great 10% product that I have reviewed separately.</li>
            <li> This package was great for the price.</li>
            <li> Great purchase.</li>
            <li> (Order more when purchasing!!)</li>
            <li> I have used many whitening kits and this one is GREAT!  </li>
            <li> They will form a perfect fit for you.</li>
            <li> Good add-on, and</li>
            <li> I wanted to try the mineral stuff which mine didn&#x27;t come with, so good starter for that too.</li>
            <li> saying how good you look.</li>
            <li> I followed all the instructions, and everything was good until I got some on my gums..</li>
            <li> product didnt work trays melt after 3sec would not recommend as good business</li>
            <li> good instructions.</li>
            <li> The trays are good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use and timely from start to finish of the process you get very good results.</li>
            <li> A great deal for sure.</li>
            <li> one day VERY SATISFIED came on time but</li>
            <li> I think the peroxide stuff is real strong.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S AN AMAZING DEAL, prize wise and effective wise.</li>
            <li> Great product does exactly what it says!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed given the price.</li>
            <li> I will diffently be buying more tubes of gel..and mouth trays!</li>
            <li> I will be using the light tonight!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> This product has me speechless but smiling more than ever!</li>
            <li> so easy to use, great instructions</li>
            <li> The light in combination with the gel works great and my teeth were noticeably even whiter after just one or two times.</li>
            <li> I had to use this for about a week straight before I noticed any difference, but I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t know how to get it to work effectively without the demise of my gums in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once completing the mold have scissors handy so you can cut off the holding tabs.</li>
            <li> They kind of suck</li>
            <li> then use scissors to trim the excess plastic off the tops, but turned out nice.  </li>
            <li> You can press your lips with your fingers to aid the process but the suction you create will be the most effective.</li>
            <li> it is strong so if u put it  on ur gums it will burn but that means it is a very potent bleaching agent...</li>
            <li> My teeth still aren&#x27;t perfect, but far better than they were.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and is made very well!</li>
            <li> Whitened my teeth for sure.</li>
            <li> Be sure to follow the instruction</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really satisfied with the brightness of my teeth</li>
            <li> and im glad I did.</li>
            <li> just figured they could use alittle more of a sparkly shine to them</li>
            <li> Hope someone finds this helpful :)</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> You will love this, you just have to have the determination to put up with blanching</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know for sure.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I recommend ordering more mouth guards.  </li>
            <li> Ok I agree with alot of the reviews do not get this on your gums</li>
            <li> Ok</li>
            <li> This stuff is potent.</li>
            <li> Using it on consecutive days makes the whitening more even on your teeth.</li>
            <li> Make sure your trays are cut to minimize gum coverage.</li>
            <li> I must keep using to give a better review.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> but if you follow directions they work ok.  </li>
            <li> The trays aren&#x27;t amazing fit</li>
            <li> Do not leave in water for more than 4-5 seconds of they</li>
            <li> I almost made that mistake but was able to salvage it.  </li>
            <li> but it did make my teeth look slightly better.</li>
            <li> Ok product not all that</li>
            <li> Could have been much more appealing to the market.</li>
            <li> TRUST ME but ready great product and cheap lots of people pay $100 for this</li>
            <li> Great vendor, item very complete.</li>
            <li> Once you are satisfied with the mold take a fine point sharpee and trace the outline of your teeth on it.</li>
            <li> Now I feel more confident and love showing off my bright new smile!</li>
            <li> Now I feel more confident and love showing off my bright new smile!</li>
            <li> The only downsides was the incredible tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> While I had cut the top tray to fit the grooves between my teeth</li>
            <li> Best $11 Ive spent in years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to use and works.</li>
            <li> Every thing after that was easy, and yes the stuff did burn abit if you get some on your gums, but just cowboy up and deal with it.</li>
            <li> It was really  easy to use.  </li>
            <li> That one will run out very quickly compared to the bleaching gel.</li>
            <li> An easy fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is ridiculously strong.</li>
            <li> At 35% it is not so strong that your gums burn</li>
            <li> but Its just to strong for me.</li>
            <li> The peroxide is really strong..</li>
            <li> But pain is beauty, right?! :)</li>
            <li> The whitening gel works fine</li>
            <li> Remineralization gel works fine too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> just fine and</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the Easy Smile product</li>
            <li> Did everything the instructions said, used the light for 10 minutes and after that, I couldn&#x27;t get it to turn on.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the light, though.</li>
            <li> I put the tray in over the top/bottom as I finished each, put in the light and let it sit while I took a shower or cleaned the house (about 20-30 minutes).</li>
            <li> And I say this because the remineralizing gel is important.</li>
            <li> you have to take off the battery pack on the light and remove the plastic tab from the battery for it to work.  </li>
            <li> The light works.  </li>
            <li> The light works well, just remove the film and turn the batteries around.</li>
            <li> I heated and formed my top tray about 6 times until I got it right at around 10 seconds of heating.</li>
            <li> do much I had to stop for a while because of gum damage!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited I forgot and had those tabs hanging out of my mouth the first time I did the treatment!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It would better to ask the dentist to make the trays and just buy the whitening gel which is not expensive.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and I noticed a difference right away, after using it with the light on for fifteen minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend a better &#x27;set&#x27; or picking out your own individual pieces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering 2 more, my mom and brother REALLY want one too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll probably last me a good year</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick, couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out once I got it in the mail.</li>
            <li> Glad I found this product and I will definitely order more once I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> I was in sports my whole life so getting the trays right wasn&#x27;t an issue plus I love to whiten my teeth</li>
            <li> but it started burning the very first 10 seconds I put it on.</li>
            <li> Used for the first time tonight, instructions and process was easy just hoping for positive results!</li>
            <li> The instructions are pretty easy to understand, and I was able to make some educated guesses at things that weren&#x27;t totally clear.  </li>
            <li> White strips are more money but are definitely safer and much more effective.</li>
            <li> or so I try not to use it too much because it is really strong stuff.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it claims!</li>
            <li> *UPDATE: Seller did send me a new light free of charge.</li>
            <li> I wish I can replace the light though thanks.</li>
            <li> And that is how I&#x27;ve been using it, every two or three days to brighten up my smile.</li>
            <li> Still worth the money..</li>
            <li> this product isnt worth buying.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to leave this product on as my gums are sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Its fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, remove the batteries from the LED thing, and use it for something useful...</li>
            <li> It is a hassle but worth it.</li>
            <li> it is worth the shot.  </li>
            <li> I had honestly convinced myself that my teeth would never again be white.  </li>
            <li> Also when you warm up the little trays be sure to follow directions exact.</li>
            <li> sugesting, use every other day, it&#x27;s very powerful, but, works amazing.</li>
            <li> Other than that it was all good.</li>
            <li> On the other hand there is some substance to the gum burning but this can be avoided fairly easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (1-2 seconds) until you get it right.</li>
            <li> My only problem is that I cant find a happy medium where more than half of my front teeth are covered with gel because over the course of 30 minutes</li>
            <li> The only concern is that you must read the instruction strictly on how to use this solution because it is very strong and it does and will burn and irritate your gum.</li>
            <li> Ive always kind of envied the people I know with bright white teeth and was a little self conscious of my own but couldnt afford to have them professionally whitened.</li>
            <li> There are more potent concentrations from the same company, but I already have sensitive teeth and don&#x27;t want to risk damaging them while making them pretty.</li>
            <li> so if you dont get it right the first time scrap it and try again in 48 hours, you have PLENTY.</li>
            <li> I would definitely repurchase this without hesitation and its very cheap compared to dental work at the office.</li>
            <li> plus will be too hot to put in mouth..</li>
            <li> You do have to put it in somewhat hot or it doesnt work well...</li>
            <li> (If you over boil like I did on the first one you can still get it to work and can boil again..</li>
            <li> Just wish it has more remineralization gel I ran out by the third time I used it!</li>
            <li> So I ordered it a couple months early for a birthday gift and the person who I gave It to told me the Led light didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> and I could see a real improvement!</li>
            <li> I recommend jus dipping it into the hot water</li>
            <li> This is exactly like getting a zoom treatment but without the hardening gel to protect the gums.</li>
            <li> I have used the kit 4 times now unfortunately not consecutive days</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> After the first whitening treatment, you WILL see results.</li>
            <li> Gums were pretty discolored and they appeared recessed and almost deteriorated between my teeth.</li>
            <li> Dip 1 tray at a time into the water first for 4-5 seconds, then place it into your mouth and suck until it forms around your teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of whitening kits from drugstores and using them for a whole week didn&#x27;t do what one session of this stuff did!</li>
            <li> I have always wanted a really drastic brighter smile</li>
            <li> sure enough I didn&#x27;t need to spend over $100.</li>
            <li> In terms of effectiveness of this solution, I would rate 10/10 because it basically revolved several coats of coffee stains in my teeth over many years.</li>
            <li> I will review again after a few weeks to see if I have good results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with what this little package offers for the price.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I whiten my teeth on my own, I always get comments from other people.</li>
            <li> so it was more flat.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and gave it a five star rating based on its quick and real results.  </li>
            <li> Really whitens teeth dramatically just after the first application.  </li>
            <li> This was pretty fast shipping for a customer that lives all the way in Canada.</li>
            <li> but it is strong enough to see a change.  </li>
            <li> they are soo un conforable and dificult to shape.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it is too strong for m gums I only tried it for 5 minutes</li>
            <li> Best $11 Ive spent in years.ght white teeth and was a little self conscious of my own but couldnt afford to have them professionally whitened.</li>
            <li> I would recommend and certainly re-purchase.</li>
            <li> Large amount of product too.</li>
            <li> Its a fine line between getting enough coverage and getting burnt.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much for $11.  </li>
            <li> if you use too much, it will irritate your gums.</li>
            <li> Really works ordered twice.</li>
            <li> The product is very steong</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use too much gel and have had the trays on up to 15-20 minutes with no burn at all.  </li>
            <li> Applied the mold and turned the blue light on.</li>
            <li> This teeth whitening kit really works.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> i should receive a light and trays that actually work</li>
            <li> The remineralization (not a real word) gel is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> but the pain its just too much :/&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you see bubbles forming on the bottom of the pot its ready to go.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> REALLY doesnt take much of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do nothing</li>
            <li> Works very well to whiten teeth, it does however make them sensituve</li>
            <li> It arrived fast and it also had instructions.</li>
            <li> It worked very well.</li>
            <li> Had no idea what the blue light was for.  </li>
            <li> Not just the traditional drug store strips but also many vials of bleach from the dentist as well as a professional whitening that cost me $130 which was supposedly a &amp;#34;deal.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> good product, slow shipping from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the most critical step so take your time and get it right, you only have to do it once.</li>
            <li> I will never waste money again on anything else!!!</li>
            <li> I had higher expectations from it from reviews I had read previously but nonetheless I am quite satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Shine the blue light, and wala-- white smile.-- brush again, and then remineralize!  </li>
            <li> my teeth were like TV magic white after the first time, and blinding by the second treatment.  </li>
            <li> mine were about the same thickness as the original tray when completed, no thinning.</li>
            <li> for the $$ the packaging and the instructions (which where copied from a copy machine) where just down right cheap.  </li>
            <li> Less is more.</li>
            <li> Teeth were super white for the wedding.</li>
            <li> is worth it, and it works really good,just becareful not to leave it on so long less time is ok</li>
            <li> I wish it would&#x27;ve came with more than the 1 set of mouth guards because mine were a little messed up when I did mine.  </li>
            <li> Easy to do and unlike other people</li>
            <li> It could have been that i was doing it wrong though lol</li>
            <li> Makes me so upset because my only option is to mail it back for a refund when what i really want is a light that works.</li>
            <li> WOW really do the job .</li>
            <li> I was going to suffer for wanting a white smile.  </li>
            <li> I had some success with white strips</li>
            <li> I had some success with white strips</li>
            <li> was rip a paper towel or napkin and fold it over so its kind of thick.</li>
            <li> I burned mine a little on my first application and it looked pretty gnarly right after I removed the trays.</li>
            <li> You can both see it lightening your gums when its burning them and you definitely know it doesn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a new set of them</li>
            <li> I followed all directions and even went and bought new batteries.</li>
            <li> Here is what I did: used a tissue to dry off my teeth, then applied with my fingertip directly to my teeth making sure to get enough to cover each tooth.</li>
            <li> They light was cheap and poorly made and the mouthpieces are of dubious quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying a much less strong gel online soon since I can&#x27;t use this one.</li>
            <li> At first I had a little sensitivity but it quickly went away.</li>
            <li> This is to be expected since the concentration of carbamide peroxide is so high and results come so quickly.</li>
            <li> directions are easy to follow and there is plenty to last a long time, can tell a difference in a week of use</li>
            <li> My teeth whitened dramatically in the first use and I could only leave the stuff on for about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> but they were costly, short lived, and I wasnt exactly amazed by the results.</li>
            <li> But in my first 2 sessions with this stuff my teeth got VERY white.</li>
            <li> but they were costly, short lived, and I wasnt exactly amazed by the results.</li>
            <li> But in my first 2 sessions with this stuff my teeth got VERY white.</li>
            <li> I tried many products from drugstores and not many of them</li>
            <li> Again I got results with the light, a slight burning which I took as my cue to stop.(duh)</li>
            <li> Easy but messy.</li>
            <li> It was as expected - product came quickly,</li>
            <li> I never thought I could achieve a pure white color.</li>
            <li> I did have a time trying ti get the light to come on the little mouth unit.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the trays were difficult to mold, but after they are formed it works great.</li>
            <li> I will update and give 5 stars if they don&#x27;t give me any trouble about replacing the light.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> This was garbage the it made my teeth really sensitive and notice of whitening</li>
            <li> Product give you a professional quality dental whitening.</li>
            <li> I bought it and and it does what it says you cant use it too often because for me it makes my teeth sensitive</li>
            <li> NATURALLY--</li>
            <li> atleast 2-3 times per day, whiten, and if your teeth get sensitive</li>
            <li> Very well actually.</li>
            <li> Wow the kit works.</li>
            <li> I left the bottom tray trimmed straight across which</li>
            <li> You want the tray to be soft and malleable so it creates a well defined mold of your teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only done one session for 30 minutes and my teeth lightened by 1 whole shade (comparing shades to the tooth color chart that is included)</li>
            <li> I used it once so far</li>
            <li> I use my old trays that I had fitted by my dentist office.</li>
            <li> This did not hurt my sensitive teeth either.</li>
            <li> Everything you need to really whiten your teeth by several shades.</li>
            <li> Had everyone at work the next day complimenting my smile especially the girls.</li>
            <li> while shining the light (it activates the peroxide) -- I have no idea if that&#x27;s too long or not long enough, but that&#x27;s what I do--FYI</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the kit for 3 days in a row, and my teeth are noticeably whiter than they started out (some staining, but pretty white).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caused a little sensitivity the first time, but nothing major.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are super white and I have a lot left that will last for months!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless you have tried this before, I would definitely suggest trying out a LESSER STRENGTH first before jumping on the 35% bus.</li>
            <li> But the basic process is mold your trays by dipping them in hot water, brush your teeth with regular toothpaste, put a line of peroxide in the mold and put them on your teeth.</li>
            <li> its natural DON&#x27;T WORRY in an hour they will be back to normal.</li>
            <li> and it took two weeks to get the same level of white of my teeth after the first week (as I don&#x27;t drink coffee or smoke)</li>
            <li> You should have each individual tooth highly visible in the completed mold.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t adjust fine the trays, it was difficult to do it, the blue led light is just a toy I don&#x27;t see difference when use it.</li>
            <li> Experiment with how much to use and how long to leave it on until you get it</li>
            <li> Not sure how well the whitening gel works or not since the light NEVER worked.</li>
            <li> My gums did not return to normal until 3-4 weeks later.</li>
            <li> But this started going away almost immediately and was perfectly normal by the next day.</li>
            <li> After reading all the review, I think slow and easy is the way to go.</li>
            <li> The kit will last a very long time as it doesn&#x27;t take very much gel for each of the whitening treatments.</li>
            <li> If you cant see it like me, there is a small piece of clear tape on the opposite side of the battery in the mouth unit that has to be peeled off for the light to come on.</li>
            <li> I have used Professional whitening products before and this one simply didn&#x27;t do the job!</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make the proper molds heat a pot of water to near boiling.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve barely used 1mL of the 20mL of peroxide</li>
            <li> Only used it twice so far.  </li>
            <li> The tooth trays take a little bit of work to get them just right</li>
            <li> After going through a few boxes of Crest Professional Whitestrips over about a year I felt like my whiteness peaked and they weren&#x27;t really doing anything anymore</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t overload the tray, a thin line in the bottom of the tray is more than enough.</li>
            <li> They turned white like others have experienced, after only a couple painful minutes in my mouth.</li>
            <li> very well priced unlike the super expensive dentists or brand name strips</li>
            <li> They will shrink to a little nothing ball of rubber if you leave it in hot water to long.</li>
            <li> The directions were extremely clear also the disclaimer that the company is not responsible for any damage.</li>
            <li> but the tray was hard to mold the right way....</li>
            <li> Not sure that little light did anything.</li>
            <li> I cut the tray down like 5 times total to get it just right, and it just takes A LITTLE gel.</li>
            <li> Its normal to feel a little tingle from the stuff.</li>
            <li> In fact my teeth are LESS sensitive after this!</li>
            <li> First, give yourself at least 3 hours with no food after whitening.</li>
            <li> Naturally your saliva gets into the molds the longer its in your mouth, this cuts down on the amount</li>
            <li> I bought new batteries hoping it came with dead ones</li>
            <li> It works, but the results don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> The gel had a nice lemon taste that was not so bad.</li>
            <li> this thing is messy, the stuff burned my mouth, just go get it professionally done or just get whitening strips</li>
            <li> After whitening I put the gel in my tray and on for atleast 20 minutes/ as long as you can stand it, then don&#x27;t rinse.  </li>
            <li> How long should you use the mouth trays?</li>
            <li> I have noticed my teeth becoming a few shades whiter over the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> It is a little annoying holding the trays in your mouth for so long but you cannot beat the price great results....</li>
            <li> Be very careful when molding the trays as this will effect your results if not properly molded.</li>
            <li> seriously those trays shrink really fast</li>
            <li> It is extraordinarily difficult to mold these to fit tight enough to have an effect.</li>
            <li> They usually think I had had it professionally done.</li>
            <li> used the gel in the tanning bed and it leaves the little white specs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> would rather have strips, find it hard to hold this light and not get tired.</li>
            <li> So I was a little hesitant to purchase this kit (or any of the similar kits on amazon) due to the fact that despite the overwhelmingly positive reviews there was still a fair amount of negative reviews stating that either the product burned/ damaged their gums horribly or that it didnt work at all.</li>
            <li> just be careful not to get it on your gums.</li>
            <li> Be careful with the gel, if any of it touches your gums and sits for a bit it will burn them and make the swell up.</li>
            <li> I dont use it everyday but enough to get results.</li>
            <li> I do notice that I have to be careful not to get the whitener on my lip when applying or it burns like a mother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been slightly obsessed with whitening my teeth and have gone through a ton of products to get a glow in the dark smile.  </li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure yet because I messed up the molding trays trying to get them to mold properly on my teeth,  </li>
            <li> As other reviews have said, the mouth pieces that come with this are JUNK.</li>
            <li> it only takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> then bit your impression into the plastic, but if you heat it just a few seconds too long the plastic shrinks up to almost nothing and becomes useless.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The mouth tray is pretty useless.</li>
            <li> I think I am starting to notice a difference in my teeth color, not sure.  </li>
            <li> I use it extremely sparingly after</li>
            <li> And it wont literally burn pieces of your gums off as some other reviewer stated.</li>
            <li> So, be very careful when boiling the trays...</li>
            <li> When making your mold BITE DOWN</li>
            <li> Also lay down relax</li>
            <li> ..bite down..</li>
            <li> and  I received in 1 week&#x27;s time maybe less.</li>
            <li> In office whitening costs alot and to be honest, for all the negative reviews saying that their gums got burnt horribly and turned white.</li>
            <li> the little blister went away and I tried it again two days after that.</li>
            <li> And for so little money.  </li>
            <li> Then I would trim a little at a time.  </li>
            <li> Also little sensitivity  noted.  </li>
            <li> Every day they get a little whiter.</li>
            <li> This is crazy strong, and my gums are not happy.</li>
            <li> I hate to think how much money I&#x27;ve spent over the past years trying to get my teeth white.  </li>
            <li> maybe a few hours?</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago to whiten my teeth for my wedding.</li>
            <li> Used it a few times and did notice immediate results</li>
            <li> 20 minutes after, my teeth began and continued to ache for a few days.</li>
            <li> I used it for a few days in a row (until my gums couldn&#x27;t handle the bleach) and my teeth were about 8 shades whiter.</li>
            <li> I have used the strips and they always killed my teeth.</li>
            <li> Also be very careful to not get on your gums as it will make then very painful and slightly blister, or at least kill the top few layers of tissue and make them hurt.</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s very strong and burns my gums real bad.</li>
            <li> I wish I could stand it a little bit because I did notice a small change in the color with 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical on using over the counter teeth whiting, but this really really works.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> I got badly burnt in office but it goes away fast</li>
            <li> After 5 seconds it is shriveled up and not able to be used.</li>
            <li> Also no matter how small of an amount I put in the guards, it leaked out onto my gums with NONE of it seeming to stay on my teeth.</li>
            <li> The whitening gel itself is no better than one you could buy at walmart.</li>
            <li> I have REALLY sensitive teeth, cold, sugar, heat, it all makes me want to punch someone in the face from pain.</li>
            <li> Then applied a small dab of the whitening gel on each tooth impression in the mold.</li>
            <li> What I found that helps with preventing overflow is to take a small paint brush</li>
            <li> First of all I hate the trays....</li>
            <li> and after I inject a smidge in each tooth I brush it on so its thin and wont spread unpredictably like does when its in globs.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a hard time getting it out of the tube.  </li>
            <li> but it was hard to me to take it out of the syringe.</li>
            <li> ..had a little bit on my gums behind my front teeth and it burned the skin..</li>
            <li> so I could at least use the product.</li>
            <li> My teeth are at least four shades whiter.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased molded trays and teeth whitening from my dentist previously for years with no problems!!!.</li>
            <li> That was a little scary.</li>
            <li> This bad boy made my gums feel like I had recently sandpapered them.  </li>
            <li> Keep the cap on and pace yourself because daily use can be painful</li>
            <li> It is just really hard to understand the directions!</li>
            <li> My teeth were never really that bad</li>
            <li> I hate it,burns my gums, but my teeth have stayed white</li>
            <li> making my teeth look worse than they did before.</li>
            <li> bu then became afraid it would whiten unevenly.</li>
            <li> After all these years all they gave me was an expensive toothpaste that didn&#x27;t work--</li>
            <li> That can be frightening but it goes away.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it works.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who says that the product doesnt work is lying and their review should be removed for being blatant nonsense.</li>
            <li> However, if you overheat the tray it will shrivel and warp and be useless so increase heating gradually</li>
            <li> printed very poorly</li>
            <li> I used it once and am afraid to get it on mi gums.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I&#x27;ve found that all of these kits have bulky trays which are nearly impossible to sleep with.</li>
            <li> My stains were from tea and weren&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> grrrr  </li>
            <li> One use and BAM there goes at least two years of a nasty habit leaving a nasty stain.</li>
            <li> which makes me hate my dentist.</li>
            <li> Annoying, yes, but the product does work.  </li>
            <li> Very painful on my gums.</li>
            <li> The gel burned my gums really terribly.</li>
            <li> The trays themselves are horrible, I followed directions and the trays do not mold to your mouth/teeth as they should.</li>
            <li> Also, the paste/gel tastes awful</li>
            <li> This product was horrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I hate it,burns my gums, but my teeth have stayed white</li>
            <li> I used it 1 time and i can tell you it works! i rather spend my money on this is worth it, and it works really good,just becareful not to leave it on so long less time is ok</li>
            <li> This is a great product and is made very well! Great price too, I would definitely reccomend this to anyone. It is just really hard to understand the directions!</li>
            <li> I used this product as directed and it didn&#x27;t hold up to it&#x27;s promises.  I have used Professional whitening products before and this one simply didn&#x27;t do the job!</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick, couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out once I got it in the mail. Did everything the instructions said, used the light for 10 minutes and after that, I couldn&#x27;t get it to turn on. I bought new batteries hoping it came with dead ones but it still doesn&#x27;t work. I contacted the seller today. I will update and give 5 stars if they don&#x27;t give me any trouble about replacing the light.  ***UPDATE: Seller did send me a new light free of charge. Thank you!***</li>
            <li> Whitened my teeth for sure. I had higher expectations from it from reviews I had read previously but nonetheless I am quite satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> The gel works great but the trays are garbage. I just threw them away. I have sensitive teeth and this gel didn&#x27;t hurt at all. Use it like 1 hr 3 x a week for the best results.</li>
            <li> The teeth are whiter and the fluoride treatment helps with the tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and I noticed a difference right away, after using it with the light on for fifteen minutes.  The second time was two days later and it burned my gum between my front teeth. the little blister went away and I tried it again two days after that. Again I got results with the light, a slight burning which I took as my cue to stop.(duh) And that is how I&#x27;ve been using it, every two or three days to brighten up my smile. Just have to watch that I don&#x27;t get it on my gums.</li>
            <li> It actually works too! just be careful not to get it on your gums. Best to paint it on with brush or Q-tip. Not sure that little light did anything. My lights battery died or it died after about a week. Same results without it I notice. Still worth the money.. Also when you warm up the little trays be sure to follow directions exact. They will shrink to a little nothing ball of rubber if you leave it in hot water to long. plus will be too hot to put in mouth.. You do have to put it in somewhat hot or it doesnt work well... Once in close mouth, bite snug but not through the rubber and suck. They will form a perfect fit for you. (If you over boil like I did on the first one you can still get it to work and can boil again.. Another tip would be to put cotton along you gums. its a pain but will keep saliva out of your trays.</li>
            <li> this thing is messy, the stuff burned my mouth, just go get it professionally done or just get whitening strips</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 4 times nothing yet but I did burn my gums. Be careful!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much for $11.  It comes as advertised with everything in the kit.  The instructions are pretty easy to understand, and I was able to make some educated guesses at things that weren&#x27;t totally clear.  I&#x27;ve used the kit for 3 days in a row, and my teeth are noticeably whiter than they started out (some staining, but pretty white).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caused a little sensitivity the first time, but nothing major.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this product--I&#x27;m pretty impressed given the price.</li>
            <li> I bought a larger kit for myself and my husband wanted to use one, so I bought him a starter type kit since I figured we could share the gel and just reorder that when needed. I don&#x27;t think my husband has tried this yet, but it&#x27;s the same as mine and I like mine a lot. Good add-on, and I wanted to try the mineral stuff which mine didn&#x27;t come with, so good starter for that too.</li>
            <li> it started stingy like others had said. do not waste your money. look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Worked great for me! I didn&#x27;t use the light, though.</li>
            <li> I think i like this product... i&#x27;m not sure yet because I messed up the molding trays trying to get them to mold properly on my teeth,  I had to buy a new set of them and I am still waiting for them to come in the mail.  So, be very careful when boiling the trays... literally only have 3 seconds.</li>
            <li> Great product does exactly what it says!!! Just wish it has more remineralization gel I ran out by the third time I used it! (Order more when purchasing!!)</li>
            <li> As other reviews have said, the mouth pieces that come with this are JUNK. The directions say to leave it in the boiling water I believe for 5 seconds? After 5 seconds it is shriveled up and not able to be used. I purchased some mouth guards from walmart so I could at least use the product. This stuff is ridiculously strong. It burned my gums until they were tender and completely white, you definitely cannot leave it in for the recommended time. Also no matter how small of an amount I put in the guards, it leaked out onto my gums with NONE of it seeming to stay on my teeth. What did stay in the guards only whitened tiny spots here and there making my teeth look worse than they did before. Definitely do not recommend purchasing this product. White strips are more money but are definitely safer and much more effective.</li>
            <li> This was garbage the it made my teeth really sensitive and notice of whitening</li>
            <li> This product works well and is definitely cheaper than purchasing whitening products from the dentist. it only takes a small amount. if you use too much, it will irritate your gums. Whenever I whiten my teeth on my own, I always get comments from other people. They usually think I had had it professionally done. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> well it worked and made my teeth whiter but the tray was hard to mold the right way.... It could have been that i was doing it wrong though lol</li>
            <li> Awesome! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the trays were difficult to mold, but after they are formed it works great. Good price! My boyfriend loves my white teeth too.</li>
            <li> Product give you a professional quality dental whitening. Be sure to follow the instruction exactly.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and works.</li>
            <li> It works, but the results don&#x27;t last very long. maybe a few hours? If you want white teeth constantly you&#x27;ll need to use this daily.</li>
            <li> My teeth are super white and I have a lot left that will last for months!! I will be ordering again once I run out!!!</li>
            <li> it is strong so if u put it  on ur gums it will burn but that means it is a very potent bleaching agent...come with alot so i would recomnd! very well priced unlike the super expensive dentists or brand name strips</li>
            <li> Really works ordered twice.</li>
            <li> The gel burned my gums really terribly. They turned white like others have experienced, after only a couple painful minutes in my mouth. I&#x27;ll be buying a much less strong gel online soon since I can&#x27;t use this one.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really satisfied with the brightness of my teeth so I figured id give this a try and im glad I did. My teeth were never really that bad just figured they could use alittle more of a sparkly shine to them and this definitly did the trick. Mouth peice was abit of a pain to get formed to your teeth, but after a couple of trys I got it worked out. Every thing after that was easy, and yes the stuff did burn abit if you get some on your gums, but just cowboy up and deal with it. After all theres no progress without struggle and after 30 minutes or so you&#x27;ll be lookin smiling at yourself in the mirror saying how good you look. Had everyone at work the next day complimenting my smile especially the girls. So overall this stuff is gold!!</li>
            <li> Be careful with the gel, if any of it touches your gums and sits for a bit it will burn them and make the swell up. And also the trays that it comes with instruct you to heat them a bit on water then bit your impression into the plastic, but if you heat it just a few seconds too long the plastic shrinks up to almost nothing and becomes useless.&lt;br /&gt;I used the gel in the tanning bed and it leaves the little white specs.&lt;br /&gt;overall this product isnt worth buying.</li>
            <li> The trays themselves are horrible, I followed directions and the trays do not mold to your mouth/teeth as they should. The whitening gel itself is no better than one you could buy at walmart.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago to whiten my teeth for my wedding. The product is very steong and I noticeably tell a difference. I dont use it everyday but enough to get results. Be very careful when molding the trays as this will effect your results if not properly molded.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do but takes some effort on your part and you must have the time to use it as decribed.</li>
            <li> So I ordered it a couple months early for a birthday gift and the person who I gave It to told me the Led light didn&#x27;t work so she hasn&#x27;t used or tried the product yet but the shipping came in excellent condition I wish I can replace the light though thanks.</li>
            <li> I have used many whitening kits and this one is GREAT!  And for so little money.  A great deal for sure.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Really whitens teeth dramatically just after the first application.  Save yourself some money and get this product.</li>
            <li> I will never waste money again on anything else!!! I love this whitening system!!!!!!! Easy to do and unlike other people ihad no burning sensation.</li>
            <li> I had to use this for about a week straight before I noticed any difference, but I am very happy with it. No gum sensitivity either. Here is what I did: used a tissue to dry off my teeth, then applied with my fingertip directly to my teeth making sure to get enough to cover each tooth. I put the tray in over the top/bottom as I finished each, put in the light and let it sit while I took a shower or cleaned the house (about 20-30 minutes). I then spit it out (along with a ton of drool from having it in my mouth), and rinsed with water before brushing my teeth. Haven&#x27;t even needed to use the blue gel that came with it. I do notice that I have to be careful not to get the whitener on my lip when applying or it burns like a mother. For the price it&#x27;s hard to beat. My stains were from tea and weren&#x27;t bad. My teeth still aren&#x27;t perfect, but far better than they were. I&#x27;d say this product lived up to my expectations</li>
            <li> Works great!  Trays take a bit of effort to shape &amp; trim.  Be patient and you&#x27;ll have no problems.  I would heat and shape, then do it again and again until they were perfect.  Then I would trim a little at a time.  I don&#x27;t use too much gel and have had the trays on up to 15-20 minutes with no burn at all.  After reading all the review, I think slow and easy is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I thought I was well versed in whitening.. but I was mistaken. This is crazy strong, and my gums are not happy. I followed all the instructions, and everything was good until I got some on my gums.. trust me you know the second it makes contact. I cut the tray down like 5 times total to get it just right, and it just takes A LITTLE gel. My only problem is that I cant find a happy medium where more than half of my front teeth are covered with gel because over the course of 30 minutes (if I use enough to cover them all) it will get on my gums. Not covering all of the tooth leads to not all of the tooth getting bleached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont want to give this a had review because it does actually work and whiten.. I just don&#x27;t know how to get it to work effectively without the demise of my gums in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you have tried this before, I would definitely suggest trying out a LESSER STRENGTH first before jumping on the 35% bus. Hope someone finds this helpful :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evan</li>
            <li> I bought it and and it does what it says you cant use it too often because for me it makes my teeth sensitive but it does make my teeth white. Im happy with it. I did have a time trying ti get the light to come on the little mouth unit. If you cant see it like me, there is a small piece of clear tape on the opposite side of the battery in the mouth unit that has to be peeled off for the light to come on. Other than that it was all good.</li>
            <li> UPDATED REVIEW: I&#x27;ve never whitened my teeth before. I have REALLY sensitive teeth, cold, sugar, heat, it all makes me want to punch someone in the face from pain. So I got this product knowing I was going to suffer for wanting a white smile.  I didn&#x27;t. In fact my teeth are LESS sensitive after this! I think it&#x27;s the generalizing gel-- which makes me hate my dentist. After all these years all they gave me was an expensive toothpaste that didn&#x27;t work-- grrrr  Back to the review, I of course did my research before purchasing this so I will share the things that worked great for me: But the basic process is mold your trays by dipping them in hot water, brush your teeth with regular toothpaste, put a line of peroxide in the mold and put them on your teeth. Shine the blue light, and wala-- white smile.-- brush again, and then remineralize!  So my tips/how I did it:  First, give yourself at least 3 hours with no food after whitening. And I say this because the remineralizing gel is important. Night time is best so you can sleep with it on. After whitening I put the gel in my tray and on for atleast 20 minutes/ as long as you can stand it, then don&#x27;t rinse.  SECOND. When making your mold BITE DOWN NATURALLY-- otherwise your jaw will be sore after the treatment. Once completing the mold have scissors handy so you can cut off the holding tabs. I was so excited I forgot and had those tabs hanging out of my mouth the first time I did the treatment!!  THIRD. Less is more. Don&#x27;t overload the tray, a thin line in the bottom of the tray is more than enough. remember if you don&#x27;t get the desired results you can always do another treatment the next day. FYI my teeth were like TV magic white after the first time, and blinding by the second treatment.  something I also found was rip a paper towel or napkin and fold it over so its kind of thick. Once you have both trays in, stick the napkin inside your lip above the tray on your gums. Naturally your saliva gets into the molds the longer its in your mouth, this cuts down on the amount so your teeth get longer with the peroxide, and it doesn&#x27;t fill out and gush onto your gums. so NO burns!  I leave the trays is for 30-35 minutes while shining the light (it activates the peroxide) -- I have no idea if that&#x27;s too long or not long enough, but that&#x27;s what I do--FYI you have to take off the battery pack on the light and remove the plastic tab from the battery for it to work.  LAST THING-- sometimes this stuff can get on the part of gums between your teeth and turn them white. its natural DON&#x27;T WORRY in an hour they will be back to normal. don&#x27;t scrub them or hurt yourself. leave them alone.  I&#x27;m ordering 2 more, my mom and brother REALLY want one too. and my cousin got one-- they should have a referral program lol.  **EDIT** So my mother is a smoker (yuck) and also drinks coffee, so I ordered these for her and it took two weeks to get the same level of white of my teeth after the first week (as I don&#x27;t drink coffee or smoke) so depending on the state of your teeth your results could take awhile but I promise this works. Brush your teeth atleast 2-3 times per day, whiten, and if your teeth get sensitive wait 2-3 days before whitening again.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It was so simple for me to apply this. Although I would recommend just brushing on with qtip. The mouth tray is pretty useless. My teeth show the quality and effectiveness</li>
            <li> Awesome I got great results</li>
            <li> This product works! Very well actually. In office whitening costs alot and to be honest, for all the negative reviews saying that their gums got burnt horribly and turned white. Its called blanching, its guaranteed to happen with all led tooth whitening systems, especially in office. I got badly burnt in office but it goes away fast, so don&#x27;t expect that to be different. You will love this, you just have to have the determination to put up with blanching</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a hard time getting it out of the tube.  The product does work so have no fear in that department</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to leave this product on as my gums are sensitive.  However I managed to keep it on for 15 minutes and I could see a real improvement! I would recommend and certainly re-purchase.</li>
            <li> I have purchased molded trays and teeth whitening from my dentist previously for years with no problems!!!. Not this product. I read some reviews on this product so I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I molded the trays as directed. Then applied a small dab of the whitening gel on each tooth impression in the mold. Applied the mold and turned the blue light on. Within a minute I felt burning, I took the trays out instantly! My gums had turned white by my teeth. I&#x27;ve used whitening trays for years and have never had this happen. If not resolved by the morning I will be seeing my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Worst. Whitening. Kit. Ever.</li>
            <li> It worked so well. I will diffently be buying more tubes of gel..and mouth trays! How long should you use the mouth trays?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. It was as expected - product came quickly, was as described and after one use my boyfriend already saw changes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for jus one day VERY SATISFIED came on time but seriously those trays shrink really fast I recommend jus dipping it into the hot water don&#x27;t let it sit....TRUST ME but ready great product and cheap lots of people pay $100 for this</li>
            <li> would rather have strips, find it hard to hold this light and not get tired. so I will not try again</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wast your time with this setup. Get the one where you make the molds and send them in and get the custom made ones back in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;Griff</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know for sure. Used it a few times and did notice immediate results bu then became afraid it would whiten unevenly. It may or may not, I don&#x27;t know since I got worried about that. Also be very careful to not get on your gums as it will make then very painful and slightly blister, or at least kill the top few layers of tissue and make them hurt.</li>
            <li> Whitens well but does burn if touches gums. Its a fine line between getting enough coverage and getting burnt. And when I say burn it causes tiny blisters on the gums. This is exactly like getting a zoom treatment but without the hardening gel to protect the gums. If he offered that it would be 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I think the peroxide stuff is real strong. And it does work just don&#x27;t get it on your gums cause it will burn.</li>
            <li> directions are easy to follow and there is plenty to last a long time, can tell a difference in a week of use</li>
            <li> Very painful on my gums. I used it once and am afraid to get it on mi gums. Can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It does exactly what it claims! The remineralizing solution worked wonders on the sensitivity of my teeth!</li>
            <li> The kit instructions overrate the quality of the tray. It is extraordinarily difficult to mold these to fit tight enough to have an effect. Additionally, I&#x27;ve found that all of these kits have bulky trays which are nearly impossible to sleep with.</li>
            <li> I think I am starting to notice a difference in my teeth color, not sure.  I wish it would&#x27;ve came with more than the 1 set of mouth guards because mine were a little messed up when I did mine.  I recommend ordering more mouth guards.  Also, the paste/gel tastes awful so be prepared for that!  But pain is beauty, right?! :)</li>
            <li> I used this product once a week for 6 weeks before the big day. Teeth were super white for the wedding. Bride approved. About to make my second order of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars because of the LED thing. The LED is not going to do anything for you, its a gimmick. But if you want to walk around the house with a blue LED in your mouth while dancing to electronic music, then go ahead. Its fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, remove the batteries from the LED thing, and use it for something useful...like  your watch, alarm clock, led reading lamp...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been slightly obsessed with whitening my teeth and have gone through a ton of products to get a glow in the dark smile.  After going through a few boxes of Crest Professional Whitestrips over about a year I felt like my whiteness peaked and they weren&#x27;t really doing anything anymore so I shopped around and decided to give this product a try. The light in combination with the gel works great and my teeth were noticeably even whiter after just one or two times. Glad I found this product and I will definitely order more once I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> This teeth whitening kit really works.  It got my teeth about 5 shades whiter.  It was really  easy to use.  Also little sensitivity  noted.  Would defiantly  recommend  this kit.</li>
            <li> Ok I agree with alot of the reviews do not get this on your gums ouch. I use it extremely sparingly after 2 uses I see a diiference. Wow the kit works. I was in sports my whole life so getting the trays right wasn&#x27;t an issue plus I love to whiten my teeth do much I had to stop for a while because of gum damage!!! I can only whiten once every 9 months. I picked this because of the lower peroxide. It still is dentist strength though. I found doing 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night work best to deter teeth sensitivity and gum irritation. Also brushing the gel off after trays come out help. This does not deter the Outcome!! Also I had white gums for about 5 minutes after tray came out. That can be frightening but it goes away. The directions were extremely clear also the disclaimer that the company is not responsible for any damage. That was a little scary. Ok so if u get this on ur gums wipe with q tip immediately!! Also trim the trays to were u r just getting ur teeth. I just did that. It is a hassle but worth it. Also use sparingly. I could feel those peroxide bubbles going to work!! So as an ex teeth bleachaholic please take my advice do 15 min. In morning 15 before bed. Tonight before bed I am trying the remin gel. Also lay down relax so u r not drooling everywhere. I will be using the light tonight!! Happy whitening just don&#x27;t get on gums!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I smoke and have for a 7 years. I never thought I could achieve a pure white color. One use and BAM there goes at least two years of a nasty habit leaving a nasty stain. This product has me speechless but smiling more than ever! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> maybe i dont know use this products but for mi was not functional i dont like but for it another persons maybe works</li>
            <li> Great vendor, item very complete. Excellent price.  Fast shipping</li>
            <li> product didnt work trays melt after 3sec would not recommend as good business i should receive a light and trays that actually work</li>
            <li> Product Works, It came with no instructions. After several email exchanges I finally got EVERYTHING I paid for, a hassle, yes. Annoying, yes, but the product does work.  You have to use it every day to see results.  LED light unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Works really great my teeth got a lot whiter than they were</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times as directed and still see no difference plus it&#x27;s very strong and burns my gums real bad. Might work for others but def not for me, won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> This stuff is potent. I can see a definite whitening after one use. Using it on consecutive days makes the whitening more even on your teeth. Make sure your trays are cut to minimize gum coverage. This stuff burns like the dickens. The remineralization (not a real word) gel is phenomenal. No sensitivity when I use it after bleach at night. I sleep with my trays in and the mineral gel overnight. But extra mineral gel tubes! That one will run out very quickly compared to the bleaching gel. There are more potent concentrations from the same company, but I already have sensitive teeth and don&#x27;t want to risk damaging them while making them pretty.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast. Everything was there. I can&#x27;t say I have noticed any change to my teeth. At first I had a little sensitivity but it quickly went away. I must keep using to give a better review.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t adjust fine the trays, it was difficult to do it, the blue led light is just a toy I don&#x27;t see difference when use it. The whitening gel works fine but it was hard to me to take it out of the syringe. Remineralization gel works fine too.&lt;br /&gt;It would better to ask the dentist to make the trays and just buy the whitening gel which is not expensive.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit at a reasonable price.  At 35% it is not so strong that your gums burn but it is strong enough to see a change.  I have used the kit 4 times now unfortunately not consecutive days but I have seen great improvement.  I was skeptical but it works.  I would say after 2 treatments it was noticeable.  Every day they get a little whiter. Only concern is the trays.  They kind of suck but if you follow directions they work ok.  The trays aren&#x27;t amazing fit but they work for what is needed.  Do not leave in water for more than 4-5 seconds of they will shrink to nothing.  I almost made that mistake but was able to salvage it.  For $12 to whiten your teeth it is worth the shot.  Happy with this product.</li>
            <li> First of all I hate the trays.... they are soo un conforable and dificult to shape.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it is too strong for m gums I only tried it for 5 minutes but it started burning the very first 10 seconds I put it on. I did notice it whiten my teeth a bit but the pain its just too much :/&lt;br /&gt;I tried it a second time but I could not keep it 15 seconds It was buring horibly. I wish I could stand it a little bit because I did notice a small change in the color with 5 minutes but Its just to strong for me. I guess I will look for something else.</li>
            <li> just put this in your cart and get it.  so easy to use, great instructions, works after the 1st use.  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Easy but messy. Keep the cap on and pace yourself because daily use can be painful</li>
            <li> Simply put, this kit works. I have noticed my teeth becoming a few shades whiter over the past few weeks. The kit will last a very long time as it doesn&#x27;t take very much gel for each of the whitening treatments. The only downsides was the incredible tooth sensitivity. After the first whitening treatment, you WILL see results. However, do not be tempted to treat them again in the same night. 20 minutes after, my teeth began and continued to ache for a few days. This is to be expected since the concentration of carbamide peroxide is so high and results come so quickly.</li>
            <li> This bad boy made my gums feel like I had recently sandpapered them.  I retired them (the whitener, not my gums) to Davie Jones locker and bought a great 10% product that I have reviewed separately.</li>
            <li> This product was horrible.  The product burned my gums and made them white.  My gums did not return to normal until 3-4 weeks later.</li>
            <li> I did not receive instructions. I cannot use!</li>
            <li> -I used this product as directed and it burned a piece of my gum off...literally. I contacted the seller in an attempt to resolve the issue and was blamed for what happened to me. The seller said he/she will refund only if the product is unsealed. I&#x27;m no genius...... but I think I&#x27;d have to use the product in order to have this reaction.???***???</li>
            <li> So I was a little hesitant to purchase this kit (or any of the similar kits on amazon) due to the fact that despite the overwhelmingly positive reviews there was still a fair amount of negative reviews stating that either the product burned/ damaged their gums horribly or that it didnt work at all. If you&#x27;re like me and read a lot of reviews in order to find the best product than rest assured that this is a great one. My teeth whitened dramatically in the first use and I could only leave the stuff on for about 3 minutes. Anyone who says that the product doesnt work is lying and their review should be removed for being blatant nonsense. On the other hand there is some substance to the gum burning but this can be avoided fairly easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff WILL burn your gums if its left to sit on them pressed between the mold. This wont happen instantly or without you knowing (it will sting quite a bit if not applied properly). And it wont literally burn pieces of your gums off as some other reviewer stated. I burned mine a little on my first application and it looked pretty gnarly right after I removed the trays. Gums were pretty discolored and they appeared recessed and almost deteriorated between my teeth. But this started going away almost immediately and was perfectly normal by the next day. It only happened on my bottom gums and taught me a valuable lesson, THIS STUFF WILL ONLY WORK IF YOUR TRAYS ARE WELL FORMED AND CUT TO THE SHAPE OF YOUR TEETH. While I had cut the top tray to fit the grooves between my teeth I left the bottom tray trimmed straight across which caused the product to be held against the points of my gums and burned. An easy fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make the proper molds heat a pot of water to near boiling. When you see bubbles forming on the bottom of the pot its ready to go. Dip 1 tray at a time into the water first for 4-5 seconds, then place it into your mouth and suck until it forms around your teeth. You can press your lips with your fingers to aid the process but the suction you create will be the most effective. This process can be repeated (and should be) until you find the correct amount of time to heat your trays. You want the tray to be soft and malleable so it creates a well defined mold of your teeth. However, if you overheat the tray it will shrivel and warp and be useless so increase heating gradually (1-2 seconds) until you get it right. This is the most critical step so take your time and get it right, you only have to do it once. I heated and formed my top tray about 6 times until I got it right at around 10 seconds of heating. You should have each individual tooth highly visible in the completed mold. Once you are satisfied with the mold take a fine point sharpee and trace the outline of your teeth on it. This will help you when your trimming it. I used a pair of 3 inch scissors which cut the material just fine and mine were about the same thickness as the original tray when completed, no thinning. I found it easier to cut when I splayed the mold out with my thumbs so it was more flat. Once you have a trimmed mold wash any remaining ink off and you&#x27;re ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It REALLY doesnt take much of this stuff. I&#x27;ve done 5 sessions now and I&#x27;ve barely used 1mL of the 20mL of peroxide the kit comes with. At this rate I have enough for 100 sessions so if you dont get it right the first time scrap it and try again in 48 hours, you have PLENTY. What I found that helps with preventing overflow is to take a small paint brush and after I inject a smidge in each tooth I brush it on so its thin and wont spread unpredictably like does when its in globs. Its normal to feel a little tingle from the stuff. You can both see it lightening your gums when its burning them and you definitely know it doesn&#x27;t feel right. Experiment with how much to use and how long to leave it on until you get it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldnt be happier with this product. Ive always kind of envied the people I know with bright white teeth and was a little self conscious of my own but couldnt afford to have them professionally whitened. I had some success with white strips but they were costly, short lived, and I wasnt exactly amazed by the results. And 5+ years of using whitening tooth paste had zero results. But in my first 2 sessions with this stuff my teeth got VERY white. Years of coffee, tea, and whatever else stains were gone in minutes. Now I feel more confident and love showing off my bright new smile! Best $11 Ive spent in years.ght white teeth and was a little self conscious of my own but couldnt afford to have them professionally whitened.

            <li> Just got it in and tried it out immediately. I&#x27;ve only done one session for 30 minutes and my teeth lightened by 1 whole shade (comparing shades to the tooth color chart that is included) I&#x27;ve used a lot of whitening kits from drugstores and using them for a whole week didn&#x27;t do what one session of this stuff did! Buy it now!!</li>
            <li> I drink lots of tea so my teeth are on the darker side, this seems to have done the trick, they are white again... big smile:-D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with what this little package offers for the price.  The tooth trays take a little bit of work to get them just right.. had to boil water..bite down..then use scissors to trim the excess plastic off the tops, but turned out nice.  The peroxide is really strong..I used it once so far..had a little bit on my gums behind my front teeth and it burned the skin..The light works.  The paper that you see with the different shades of white to measure your progress..that thing is garbage, I thew it away..printed very poorly and I couldn&#x27;t tell which shade my teeth are.  Overall.. I give it 4 stars..</li>
            <li> I hate to think how much money I&#x27;ve spent over the past years trying to get my teeth white.  Not just the traditional drug store strips but also many vials of bleach from the dentist as well as a professional whitening that cost me $130 which was supposedly a &amp;#34;deal.&amp;#34;  I have used this product two times since I got it, one time for about 15 minutes and a second time for about 10 minutes.  My teeth are at least four shades whiter.  I had honestly convinced myself that my teeth would never again be white.  But they are!  I highly recommend this product and gave it a five star rating based on its quick and real results.  Buy it!  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This package was great for the price. I used it for a few days in a row (until my gums couldn&#x27;t handle the bleach) and my teeth were about 8 shades whiter.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted a really drastic brighter smile I tried many products from drugstores and not many of them did the trick. Finally I found an office that did whitening and they explained that they use the chemical Carbamide peroxide so I decided to check here and sure enough I didn&#x27;t need to spend over $100. I bought this a while back I still have A LOT left It&#x27;ll probably last me a good year or so I try not to use it too much because it is really strong stuff. Also I recommend buying some gause because you don&#x27;t want saliva going into your trays while you&#x27;re whitening.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the Easy Smile product it&#x27;s easy to use and timely from start to finish of the process you get very good results.</li>
            <li> Seems to be just like the dr. office stuff that I got years ago. I use my old trays that I had fitted by my dentist office.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well the whitening gel works or not since the light NEVER worked. I followed all directions and even went and bought new batteries. Nothing! Makes me so upset because my only option is to mail it back for a refund when what i really want is a light that works.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do nothing, I see no difference at all</li>
            <li> This was pretty fast shipping for a customer that lives all the way in Canada.I ordered on the 1st of February and  I received in 1 week&#x27;s time maybe less. In terms of effectiveness of this solution, I would rate 10/10 because it basically revolved several coats of coffee stains in my teeth over many years. The only concern is that you must read the instruction strictly on how to use this solution because it is very strong and it does and will burn and irritate your gum. I would definitely repurchase this without hesitation and its very cheap compared to dental work at the office. IT&#x27;S AN AMAZING DEAL, prize wise and effective wise.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell.  Only used it twice so far.  No tooth sensitivity.  Easy to use.  good instructions. I will review again after a few weeks to see if I have good results.</li>
            <li> Not the best whitening product I have ever used but it did make my teeth look slightly better. I would do some research before buying this.</li>
            <li> WOW really do the job . Lightened my teeth two shades. And my daughters three. This did not hurt my sensitive teeth either. I have used the strips and they always killed my teeth. I did not use the trays, I just do not like them. I painted it on each tooth. The light works well, just remove the film and turn the batteries around. Large amount of product too. Will def order again!</li>
            <li> Works very well to whiten teeth, it does however make them sensituve</li>
            <li> Ok product not all that</li>
            <li> This was not a designed grouping, just disparate elements thrown into an envelope. They light was cheap and poorly made and the mouthpieces are of dubious quality. I&#x27;d recommend a better &#x27;set&#x27; or picking out your own individual pieces.</li>
            <li> good product, slow shipping from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great purchase. It arrived fast and it also had instructions. It worked very well. I was very happy with product.</li>
            <li> It is a little annoying holding the trays in your mouth for so long but you cannot beat the price great results....</li>
            <li> Had no idea what the blue light was for.  Not on instructions COPY...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Felt for the $$ the packaging and the instructions (which where copied from a copy machine) where just down right cheap.  Could have been much more appealing to the market.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical on using over the counter teeth whiting, but this really really works.&lt;br /&gt;A sugesting, use every other day, it&#x27;s very powerful, but, works amazing. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Used for the first time tonight, instructions and process was easy just hoping for positive results! The gel had a nice lemon taste that was not so bad.</li>
            <li> Everything you need to really whiten your teeth by several shades. The trays are good. Remineralization gel is also included with this kit.</li>
