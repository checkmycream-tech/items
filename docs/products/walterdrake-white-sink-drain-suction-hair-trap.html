    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It works wonderful....</li>
            <li>The drain cover works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>This sits perfectly over the tub stopper and catches all of the hair before it goes into the plumbing!</li>
            <li>Love it!!!</li>
            <li>I ordered this because it sounded like a great idea.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work out so great.</li>
            <li>It is a good product but doesn&#x27;t stick to tubs with non slip surfaces.</li>
            <li>This works great by catching the hair around it and still letting all the soap drain through.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of catching the hair but the suction cups don&#x27;t work as well as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li>I think this product would be amazing if you can get it to suction.  </li>
            <li>THE HOLE OF THE TUB.IT&#x27;S VERY EASY TO USE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the kind that fit inside the drain and they just get clogged up.</li>
            <li>The product looks great on paper but doesn&#x27;t really deliver in reality.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean and catches all the hair.</li>
            <li>the cups off to make it fit more closely to the floor - didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li>whole thing is very cheaply made!</li>
            <li>It says it will fit all tubs. .</li>
            <li>So easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s cheap and it does catch the hair</li>
            <li>It looks so pretty too!</li>
            <li>Not even worth bothering to return it, easier to just take the loss and toss it in the garbage.</li>
            <li>Maybe it would work in the flat kind of drain?</li>
            <li>Has suction cups that won&#x27;t stick to the tub floor, and if they did, it would still leave a small gap for the hairs to happily slide past.&lt;br /&gt;Cut</li>
            <li>I cannot express my happyness for this drainer after so much frustration with the others!</li>
            <li>At first I thought this trap wasn&#x27;t going to work, but then It did..</li>
            <li>This cheap plastic thing is huge and hard to clean.</li>
            <li>However, I suspect it will not do this for most buyers (and it&#x27;s so cheap and small</li>
            <li>The suction cups that are geared to hold the product in place don&#x27;t stick very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It might work better for very long hair, but not short hair.</li>
            <li>bathtub is very old and refinished in a ceramic-type finisher.  </li>
            <li>The openings are too far apart.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that the suction cups on the outer edges don&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li>But overall I don&#x27;t think the suction cups are really needed for it to work.</li>
            <li>was not large enough to fit over the drain</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, for kitchen sink use, the openings were too large to catch most of the debris I was trying to catch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The suction cups barely stick to anything.</li>
            <li>I never imagine so much hair was going down our drains.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Has suction cups that won&#x27;t stick to the tub floor, and if they did, it would still leave a small gap for the hairs to happily slide past.&lt;br /&gt;Cut the cups off to make it fit more closely to the floor - didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Too small for standard pup-up drains as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a waste.  I would NOT recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> The suction cups did not work and it caught no hair whatsoever and rather floated away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole thing is very cheaply made!</li>
            <li> Works well. The company will pester you for a review so here it is. Don&#x27;t be so desperate Miles Kimball Company. Its a shower drain people arent comparing cars or something with these reviews- relax.</li>
            <li> This cheap plastic thing is huge and hard to clean. It is also not very sturdy. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it sounded like a great idea. The suction cups would attach to the bathtub so hair wouldn&#x27;t get under the hair trap. The problem is, the suction cups do not stick. They weigh the trap down a little, but that&#x27;s about it. Hair still gets under the trap all the time. I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> First off, wrong size.. very thin and flimsy.  It says it will fit all tubs. . Not true.. beware of size!</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S STOP SOME OF THE HAIR FROM GOING THOUGHT THE HOLE OF THE TUB.IT&#x27;S VERY EASY TO USE YOU WOULD LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> We have a drain that pops up so I needed something quite concave.  The suction cups don&#x27;t stick, as others have said, but for us the raised drain keeps it in place.  Very easy to clean and catches all the hair.</li>
            <li> Suction cups stopped working</li>
            <li> This was money wasted! This trap did not stick to any surface. The holes are too wide to trap any hair. NO ONE SHOULD EVER ORDER THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! After buying several different brands this one was the winner!!! This not only catches the hair but also let&#x27;s water still go through. The three different brands before this one were too small or would act like a strainer until hair fell in and would clog (defeating the purpose). I needed something that would drain but also catch any hair. This one did so!!! I cannot express my happyness for this drainer after so much frustration with the others!</li>
            <li> Does not attach to all tubs</li>
            <li> Did not work at all. Just threw it away.</li>
            <li> The openings are too far apart. Does not catch anything going down the drain. It might work better for very long hair, but not short hair.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this trap wasn&#x27;t going to work, but then It did..you have to soak up the spot with water first then push in the cups a few times and it stuck well for me! It looks so pretty too!</li>
            <li> I think this product would be amazing if you can get it to suction.  I could not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bathtub is very old and refinished in a ceramic-type finisher.  There is metal around the drain.  However, no matter how hard I tried, I could not get this to suction, which basically made it useless.  I also tried it in my kitchen sink, which is all metal.  It would not suction there either, so I tried to use it upside down.  Unfortunately, for kitchen sink use, the openings were too large to catch most of the debris I was trying to catch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get it to stick, I think you will like it.  However, I suspect it will not do this for most buyers (and it&#x27;s so cheap and small, it&#x27;s annoying to have to go through the motions to return it).  So, buyer beware.</li>
            <li> It does trap hairs.  Loads of hair was in my hair trap and have mercy I never imagine so much hair was going down our drains.  No wonder I had clog troubles.  I think this trapper will help.  The only thing is that the suction cups on the outer edges don&#x27;t really work.  But overall I don&#x27;t think the suction cups are really needed for it to work.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stick to the tub.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my needs. I thought it would stick but it keeps coming up. I also thought it would work for my drain that has a sticking up stopper but it doesn&#x27;t catch anything. Maybe it would work in the flat kind of drain?</li>
            <li> It is a good product but doesn&#x27;t stick to tubs with non slip surfaces.</li>
            <li> It works wonderful....I had a hard time finding one locally, so I when I did a search, thankfully, I found one.</li>
            <li> After cleaning out the clogged up drain and gagging. I decided to find a drain strainer and came across this one. It works fantastically. I&#x27;ve tried the kind that fit inside the drain and they just get clogged up. And are disgusting to clean. This works great by catching the hair around it and still letting all the soap drain through. You just then remove the hair from around it. So easy to use and clean. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s flimsy and poorly made.The suction cups barely stick to anything. Not even worth bothering to return it, easier to just take the loss and toss it in the garbage. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this to anyone.</li>
            <li> was not large enough to fit over the drain</li>
            <li> The product looks great on paper but doesn&#x27;t really deliver in reality. The suction cups that are geared to hold the product in place don&#x27;t stick very well.</li>
            <li> This little gadget catches the hair that would have eventually clogged the drain. I would recommend it to anyone who needs to prevent hair clogs in bathtubs.</li>
            <li> It works okay but it has a terrible odor.</li>
            <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t always stay in place, but does catch a lot of my daughters long hair and keeps it from going down the drain.  Not having to deal with a slow drain as often.</li>
            <li> The dome shape in the middle is not high enough and it&#x27;s not fitting completely. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work out so great. The suction cups didn&#x27;t suction to anything thus not preventing hair from clogging my drain. I ended up just throwing it away.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on the pop up drain in my tub. Didn&#x27;t suction to the bottom of the tub. A waste of a few bucks.</li>
            <li> The drain cover works perfectly.  We have had trouble with hair going down the bathtub drain for quite some time.  This sits perfectly over the tub stopper and catches all of the hair before it goes into the plumbing!</li>
            <li> This product was bought on a recommendation and it is not doing the job.  Still having to snake the drain.  Not catching hair well at all.</li>
            <li> I never see any hair around it when the shower drains. I used draino but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the problem.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of catching the hair but the suction cups don&#x27;t work as well as I would have hoped. But it&#x27;s cheap and it does catch the hair and that&#x27;s why i got it.</li>
