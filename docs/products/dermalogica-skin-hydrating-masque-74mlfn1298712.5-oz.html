    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I travel a bit and find this is the best way to replinish moisture after I&#x27;ve landed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gel, so also has a wonderful cooling effect.  </li>
            <li>ahhh great!</li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>Very happy to spend my money on something that is going to work instead of wasting money on product after product that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Sealed bottle, great deal.</li>
            <li>Great product and will continue to use this for life</li>
            <li>so I thought it would be good.</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it does, but its amazing.</li>
            <li>and it is nice as it is a gel.</li>
            <li>You can literally go off and do your own thing..</li>
            <li>Clean scent, great high-quality ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Love Love Love!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now more of a thicker, creamy texture.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I love these products.  </li>
            <li>I love Dermalogica products and am so excited to see Amazon is carrying the line....</li>
            <li>and for me even helped to diminish fine lines from dehydration.</li>
            <li>I tried this when I lived in Phoenix as a free gift at a hair salon.  </li>
            <li>Like most other Dermatologica products this hydrating mask is great.</li>
            <li>Great product, really leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I did it the first time by accident because I forgot it was on my face!  </li>
            <li>I use the whole line and have seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Using this product every morning after I wake up and before my shower makes my skin look hydrated and I look fresh no matter what I did the night before.  </li>
            <li>Just got this and used it right away.</li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t have dry skin, it effectively hydrates your skin.</li>
            <li>but why mess with a really good thing?</li>
            <li>When I first purchased this product I found that it worked to give my skin a radiant boost.  </li>
            <li>This mask does exactly what it says-</li>
            <li>I thought I had found a bottle of the old formula which was fantastic.</li>
            <li>Sadly, it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s original clear gel form!</li>
            <li>I put them on right before I go to sleep while I am reading books then wash it off when I am ready to go to sleep..</li>
            <li>Previously, this Dermalogica masque was amazing.</li>
            <li>so much easier than finding them in stores.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!    </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>it hydrates really well</li>
            <li>Also receieved it very timely with no issues.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really like the way it makes my face feel after use.  </li>
            <li>Exelent product, thanks</li>
            <li>I found that this product didn&#x27;t make much of a difference for those particular concerns.</li>
            <li>The product has the same name and appearance on the outside, but is no longer the gel that I love.</li>
            <li>It gives your skin a deep drink while the regular moisturizer gives you a top up &amp; some protection.  </li>
            <li>This company is high up there.</li>
            <li>I skim a fine film of this on my damp skin, wait 30 secs til it sinks in, then moisturize.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep this product for travel, but my DIY home mask (oatmeal, lemon &amp; raw honey) leaves my skin much smoother, softer and better hydrated than this Dermalogica product.</li>
            <li>sad that Dermalogica changed what was a great item.</li>
            <li>After I used it for 2 months, the next analysis showed that I started to develop new, fresh skin!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I purchased this product hoping it would work for my very very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It was a clear gel that absorbed into the skin well and left it feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I am back in Mobile, Alabama now, and with the high, high humidity here, I dont have the dryness I did in Zona</li>
            <li>Especially for older skin!</li>
            <li>Based on the reveiws and the rep, I was hoping that the item I ordered on Amazon was the old formula.</li>
            <li>Anyone who likes this product and can find the old one, should count their blessings to have found it.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin was after applying this.</li>
            <li>Your skin is amazingly soft after using this masque.</li>
            <li>And not heavy on your face.</li>
            <li>but this product is still used just not everyday.  </li>
            <li>This masque is so hydrating and feels so natural.</li>
            <li>I bought the new one and returned it at local store.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use (I like Lisa Eldridge&#x27;s idea of using this for facial hydration on flights and in other dry environments).</li>
            <li>However, each time I used this product I developed a rash on my face next morning, so I had to throw this product away after three uses.</li>
            <li>Many people on the website not happy.</li>
            <li>mask works as a treat, absolutely fantastic, very thin smell, very cooling on the face</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear gel that you apply and wash off when its dry.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Cooling even in winter with the dry homes with the heat on.</li>
            <li> The air was dry</li>
            <li> My skin was so dried out from the winter I scheduled an extensive facial and ordered this to help maintain moisture afterwards.</li>
            <li> Within the first few minutes I could feel my skin getting hot, I rinsed it off and my whole face looked like it had bad sunburn!</li>
            <li> Then came the Polar Vortex...</li>
            <li> Update: Still love the Dermalogica brand but frustrated to find that the formula has changed.</li>
            <li> less, less often and actually look up all the things we use : deodrants, makeups, soap, shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to use a cold gel eye mask from the fridge after a late night, but now I use this clear masque all over my face and neck</li>
            <li> I also use it during plane trips because the cabin air sucks all the moisture out of my face and the gel keeps the moisture on my face.</li>
            <li> extreme winter cold and wind chills that severely dried and dehydrated my skin.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend for someone who&#x27;s looking for a hydrating masque (not the oil base masque)..</li>
            <li> I am addicted to how it feels afterwards...</li>
            <li> The new one is horrible as they changed the formula.</li>
            <li> Sad to lower my rating from 5 to 3 stars.</li>
            <li> so really disappointed with the masque!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love Love Love! Shrinks pores and softens skin. I sometimes leave it on over nigh.</li>
            <li> Like most other Dermatologica products this hydrating mask is great. It&#x27;s a clear gel that you apply and wash off when its dry. Even if you don&#x27;t have dry skin, it effectively hydrates your skin. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this product I found that it worked to give my skin a radiant boost.  Then came the Polar Vortex...extreme winter cold and wind chills that severely dried and dehydrated my skin.  I found that this product didn&#x27;t make much of a difference for those particular concerns.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping it would work for my very very sensitive skin. It did not sting when applied so I thought it would be good. However, each time I used this product I developed a rash on my face next morning, so I had to throw this product away after three uses.</li>
            <li> I love Dermalogica products and am so excited to see Amazon is carrying the line....so much easier than finding them in stores. This is one of my favorites.  I travel a bit and find this is the best way to replinish moisture after I&#x27;ve landed.  I also use this mask on a weekly basis, especially for the under-eye area.  It&#x27;s a gel, so also has a wonderful cooling effect.  Clean scent, great high-quality ingredients.  Highly recommended!    Update: Still love the Dermalogica brand but frustrated to find that the formula has changed. The product has the same name and appearance on the outside, but is no longer the gel that I love. It&#x27;s now more of a thicker, creamy texture. It works okay but why mess with a really good thing? I won&#x27;t buy it again. Sad to lower my rating from 5 to 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I was advised to use this mask after a skin analysis showed that I had a dry skin. After I used it for 2 months, the next analysis showed that I started to develop new, fresh skin!&lt;br /&gt;This mask works as a treat, absolutely fantastic, very thin smell, very cooling on the face and you can walk around the house, without scaring your husband with the mask on, since it is transparent. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This mask does exactly what it says- it hydrates really well and for me even helped to diminish fine lines from dehydration. I use it 3 times a week!</li>
            <li> Nothing special. It is easy to use (I like Lisa Eldridge&#x27;s idea of using this for facial hydration on flights and in other dry environments). I have oily skin, but I still like to do a moisturizing mask 2x&#x27;s/week. I&#x27;ll keep this product for travel, but my DIY home mask (oatmeal, lemon &amp; raw honey) leaves my skin much smoother, softer and better hydrated than this Dermalogica product.</li>
            <li> I have such dehydrated skin. This moisturizes well. My skin just drinks it up. After rinsing...ahhh great! Would repurchase again</li>
            <li> I have used this and it is nice as it is a gel. Cooling even in winter with the dry homes with the heat on. But and this is a big caution... look at Environmental Working Group { EWG } for the ratings of products from foods to our cosmetics. The scores go from O-8 in regards toxicity, cancer danger, etc. This company is high up there. So I use less, less often and actually look up all the things we use : deodrants, makeups, soap, shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yes I  have had all 3 kinds of skin cancer and act accordingly and think all of us can act with Prevention in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nancy</li>
            <li> I use this every day under my regular moisturizer - Intensive Moisture balance.  My beautician in the UK advised this.  I skim a fine film of this on my damp skin, wait 30 secs til it sinks in, then moisturize.  It gives your skin a deep drink while the regular moisturizer gives you a top up &amp; some protection.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> I thought I had found a bottle of the old formula which was fantastic. The new one is horrible as they changed the formula. I bought the new one and returned it at local store. Based on the reveiws and the rep, I was hoping that the item I ordered on Amazon was the old formula. Sadly, it&#x27;s not. Anyone who likes this product and can find the old one, should count their blessings to have found it.&lt;br /&gt;Very sad that Dermalogica changed what was a great item. Many people on the website not happy.</li>
            <li> Within the first few minutes I could feel my skin getting hot, I rinsed it off and my whole face looked like it had bad sunburn! I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so really disappointed with the masque!</li>
            <li> My skin was so dried out from the winter I scheduled an extensive facial and ordered this to help maintain moisture afterwards. I actually starting using this before my appointment and it took away the dryness after one use. I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin was after applying this. Very happy to spend my money on something that is going to work instead of wasting money on product after product that doesn&#x27;t work. Also receieved it very timely with no issues.</li>
            <li> Just got this and used it right away. Sealed bottle, great deal. My skin drank this up. Perfect for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> love it! highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Your skin is amazingly soft after using this masque. And not heavy on your face. Especially for older skin! I use the whole line and have seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Previously, this Dermalogica masque was amazing. It was a clear gel that absorbed into the skin well and left it feeling soft. The product has since changed. I received a mask that was the consistency of snot, not at all it&#x27;s original clear gel form! It was milky yellow. When I tried to wash it off my face after 15 minutes, it left a greasy film on my skin. I had to go back and use another facial cleanser to wash the greasy feeling off my face. This mask is no longer what it used to be and I will definitely not buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I tried this when I lived in Phoenix as a free gift at a hair salon.  The air was dry and I used this religiusly to keep my face hydrated.  I am back in Mobile, Alabama now, and with the high, high humidity here, I dont have the dryness I did in Zona but this product is still used just not everyday.  When I use it, I do not wash it off as instructed.  It does not make a thick,sticky mask on my face and can be left in place.  I did it the first time by accident because I forgot it was on my face!  Great product and will continue to use this for life</li>
            <li> It did not seem to hydrate my skin for longer than the initial day of application.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because of Lisa Elderidge&#x27;s recommendation and it truly hydrates your skin.. I am addicted to how it feels afterwards... I put them on right before I go to sleep while I am reading books then wash it off when I am ready to go to sleep.. My skin still feels so hydrated next morning.. It does lock the moistures on your face... It&#x27;s not greasy, sticky, nor have color.. You can literally go off and do your own thing.. No one could tell you have the masque on - which is a plus for me like Lisa said...  Highly recommend for someone who&#x27;s looking for a hydrating masque (not the oil base masque)..</li>
            <li> Using this product every morning after I wake up and before my shower makes my skin look hydrated and I look fresh no matter what I did the night before.  I used to use a cold gel eye mask from the fridge after a late night, but now I use this clear masque all over my face and neck and I look refreshed as if I went to a spa last night instead of a club.  I don&#x27;t know what it does, but its amazing.</li>
            <li> I love these products.  This masque is so hydrating and feels so natural.</li>
            <li> Great product, really leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Really like the way it makes my face feel after use.  Just  have to remember to use it twice  a week.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product every morning for the last 4 years. I put it on every morning before I wash my face. I also use it during plane trips because the cabin air sucks all the moisture out of my face and the gel keeps the moisture on my face. I also like the non-sticky feel.</li>
            <li> Exelent product, thanks</li>
