            <li>don&#x27;t buy, it&#x27;s not as awesome as it appears on the commercials...</li>
            <li>Otherwise may have been very good</li>
            <li>so this product is very good at keeping me home and doing it myself without spending the money.</li>
            <li>great.  </li>

            <li>Product came on time shipper was great.</li>
            <li>Great for touch-ups in between visits to the beauty salon.  </li>
            <li>They work great and they don&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>works great on eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not so great with peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>works just as good as the $200 ones............</li>
            <li>my mom loved this item, would buy again.</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>Love these hair remover, great invention.</li>
            <li>More accessories than the others and very nice design and color selection for the product.  </li>
            <li>I liked the way it worked</li>
            <li>I liked it, but after using about 5 times, it broke and had to return for a refund.  </li>
            <li>it DOES trim, but not to an effective length.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and the light is a great feature.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the hair remover works fine, however I wouldn&#x27;t know since I never received a working one!  </li>
            <li>this hair trimmer works perfect for the final touches on hair cuts around all the edges.  </li>
            <li>I am sure I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>But it is a lot better than having the hair removed at the Beauty salon by a hair dresser with the wax.  </li>
            <li>The product was just okay</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect to be able to trip your arm pits with it.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I should have known better to get one of these.</li>
            <li>When I applied more pressure, the blade broke off.</li>
            <li>the design also allows for easy cleaning of any hair build up inside the trimmer</li>
            <li>This was purchased for SWMBO, and it does the job fine.  </li>
            <li>Including the light which some have said didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>but the light works everytime</li>
            <li>Fantastic alternative to blades or chemicals (ew).  </li>
            <li>The one I had prior to this (diiferent brand) was great.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and it has a light on it now.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply built.</li>
            <li>She likes the fact this has a light.</li>
            <li>This is a very handy product to get rid of any facial hair you may have.  </li>
            <li>I like this and find it very useful to trim up areas on my body that I don&#x27;t feel like waxing or tweezing.</li>
            <li>worth it……..!</li>
            <li>so you get a clean cut every time.</li>
            <li>The Finishing Touch Facial hair remover is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little item, that everyone should have.  </li>
            <li>Great for after menopause and those little mustashes.</li>
            <li>The light is very helpful.</li>
            <li>deff worth getting.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>I do not find this useful at all.</li>
            <li>IT JUST COMES RIGHT OFF</li>
            <li>You may use it every day, or only in emergencies, but it is very handy for the quick elimination of facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Not only is the light a nice feature,the little motor is more powerful than the others I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>I ALSO USED IT TO TRIM MY SON&#x27;S BACK HAIR NECK LINE WORKED GREAT ON COARSE HAIR</li>
            <li>Light weight and good for minor trimming, wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this product for larger jobs.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think the hot wax is that sanitary.</li>
            <li>This is better than having my upper lip waxed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying these since I first saw them.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT FOR FACIAL HAIR.  </li>
            <li>Broke on first use.  </li>
            <li>I used this about half dozen times and it&#x27;s worked great so far.</li>
            <li>This product don´t remove easily the facial hair.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, works perfectly fine, use it almost daily and have not even had to replace the battery.</li>
            <li>VERY WELL.</li>
            <li>Too much bother returning them.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone with light colored facial hair and beards they want to keep trimmed up!</li>
            <li>really like how it works and have 2 of them-  just in case.  </li>
            <li>It did not remove hair very well.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very feminine with an amethyst-looking glass jewel at the end of the case cover.  </li>
            <li>this product makes a lot noise and to tell you the truth i dont even know if it gets the job done unless you have some very bushy eyebrows.</li>
            <li>The last one she bought did not have the light.  </li>
            <li>Only criticism so far is when sliding the top cap off, the bottom shaft seems to come off too but</li>
            <li>quickly snaps/sides back into place.</li>
            <li>Does not work as well as an older model.</li>
            <li>I bought this replacing an older version that broke.</li>
            <li>Once you put the AAA battery in and push the little bar to start, it begins to make a buzzing sound and is ready to \\&quot;shave.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>tried putting in a new battery with no luck</li>
            <li>Other than that it comes with a top that closes it and extra accessories.</li>
            <li>SECOND ONE - FIRST LASTED 2 YEARS.  </li>
            <li>I have a different brand that does not have as much power.  </li>
            <li>I used this for eyebrows and unnecessary hair on my face and in my back of my head when I cut my hair, works good</li>
            <li>Will only turn on and run for about 45 seconds...not enough time to do much with it...</li>
            <li>Seems to need new batteries too frequently - and I&#x27;m never sure when I first turn it on that it will COME on?</li>
            <li>It worked about a week, and it did remove facial hair pretty well, but the area where the blade is, broke for no particular reason.  </li>
            <li>IT BARELY GETS IT OFF.</li>
            <li>This is actually a minature razor and a replacement for an old one, but still working.  </li>
            <li>I barely use it cuz it sometimes hurt.</li>
            <li>I thought they were the same product as they looked similar, however this one is much less precise and only picks up dark hair</li>

            <li> I thought they were the same product as they looked similar, however this one is much less precise and only picks up dark hair</li>
            <li> Hardly did its job in the first place.  </li>
            <li> This really works for the small areas I needed to use it.  </li>
            <li> i tried it on my eyebrows, and the hair is so coarse there that the product barely even did anything at all, other than made it harder for me to pluck the tiny obvious black hairs after the fact.</li>
            <li> I have been tweezing chin hairs for a long time</li>
            <li> used it on my upper lip, and it trimmed the hair down to an-almost visible length (not obvious with bunch of foundation on).</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick upper lip hair, and this still didn&#x27;t get all of it, hardly any at all.</li>
            <li> It is much safer than using a small a small scissor.</li>
            <li> ...just have to keep going over the same spot a few times before you see results.</li>
            <li> and they never fit back together.  </li>
            <li> It did not remove the hair from my upper lip and it would shut off after a few seconds of use</li>
            <li> I  expected other thing, this product doesn´t cover my expectations.</li>
            <li> however, i had to repeat the process not more than 2 or 3 days later.</li>
            <li> It does not cut close and it is not very smooth on your skin.</li>
            <li> Piece of Junk….it broke in less that a month…….not</li>
            <li> , it gets those little hairs on your lip.</li>
            <li> This little &#x27;thingy&#x27; doesn&#x27;t grip the hairs like a razor blade does.  </li>
            <li> They are plastic and after a few years, the continued vibration may wear on the plastic case and break.  </li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It happens often to me with small items and I&#x27;ve usually tossed the wrapping before I try them out</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it helps</li>
            <li> It is inadiquate to say the least.</li>
            <li> at least for me.</li>
            <li> It is not a barber shop, but for very small areas it does the job.</li>
            <li> POOR PURCHASE</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work sad to say.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> great.  works just as good as the $200 ones............</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, works perfectly fine, use it almost daily and have not even had to replace the battery. deff worth getting.</li>
            <li> I used this about half dozen times and it&#x27;s worked great so far. Including the light which some have said didn&#x27;t work. Lots of power too.  I have a different brand that does not have as much power.  Only criticism so far is when sliding the top cap off, the bottom shaft seems to come off too but quickly snaps/sides back into place.</li>
            <li> This works on and off. You have to play around with it before it starts running but the light works everytime</li>
            <li> Finishing Touch works great, it gets those little hairs on your lip. I will buy it again. Product came on time shipper was great.</li>
            <li> this hair trimmer works perfect for the final touches on hair cuts around all the edges.  I have used it multiple times on my hair and haven&#x27;t had any issues with it yet.  the design also allows for easy cleaning of any hair build up inside the trimmer so you get a clean cut every time.</li>
            <li> I used this for eyebrows and unnecessary hair on my face and in my back of my head when I cut my hair, works good</li>
            <li> THIS DOES NOT WORK THE WAY THEY ADVERTISE IT. I BOUGHT TWO AND NEITHER ONE WORK VERY WELL. THEY MAKE IT LOOK LIKE IT JUST COMES RIGHT OFF AND IF YOU ARE WANTING IT FOR CHIN HAIR IT BARELY GETS IT OFF. YOU STILL HAVE STUBBLES AND HAVE TO USE IT EVERY TWO DAYS. POOR PURCHASE</li>
            <li> This product don´t remove easily the facial hair. I  expected other thing, this product doesn´t cover my expectations. I dont like it</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as an older model.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and the light is a great feature. I am sure I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love these hair remover, great invention. I have been tweezing chin hairs for a long time now I just use my finishing touch.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for SWMBO, and it does the job fine.  Great for touch-ups in between visits to the beauty salon.  The jury is out on the longevity of the product, but it is still functioning after a year.</li>
            <li> Product works okay...just have to keep going over the same spot a few times before you see results. Other than that it comes with a top that closes it and extra accessories.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work sad to say.  It happens often to me with small items and I&#x27;ve usually tossed the wrapping before I try them out so they just hang around in the way until I toss them out.  Too much bother returning them.</li>
            <li> The Finishing Touch Facial hair remover is pretty good.  Like the way it bends, but it doesn&#x27;t remove the tiny hairs above the lips....I have to go over and over and still some remain.  But it is a lot better than having the hair removed at the Beauty salon by a hair dresser with the wax.  .I don&#x27;t think the hot wax is that sanitary.</li>
            <li> This product works.  It is not a barber shop, but for very small areas it does the job. It is much safer than using a small a small scissor.</li>
            <li> I tried this at a friends. I liked the way it worked and she said that she had had this product for years and it still  worked the same as when she bought it. I hope I get the longevity that she did.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! It broke within a week of purchasing. Hardly did its job in the first place.  Would rate 0 stars if I could !</li>
            <li> This is better than having my upper lip waxed. I can use it as often as I need to do do it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work according to the ad.  This little &#x27;thingy&#x27; doesn&#x27;t grip the hairs like a razor blade does.  It is inadiquate to say the least.</li>
            <li> Piece of Junk….it broke in less that a month…….not worth it……..!</li>
            <li> Not only is the light a nice feature,the little motor is more powerful than the others I&#x27;ve owned. It&#x27;s a great product and my husband has been looking for one for his gotee! I recommend this to anyone with light colored facial hair and beards they want to keep trimmed up!</li>
            <li> This is truly a piece of junk. Fell apart before I could use it once. Came in pieces in the box and they never fit back together.  To the garbage!!!</li>
            <li> I liked it, but after using about 5 times, it broke and had to return for a refund.  Otherwise may have been very good</li>
            <li> The product was just okay I would rather go get a waxing I do not feel it did  a thorough job</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these since I first saw them.  They work great and they don&#x27;t hurt.  Fantastic alternative to blades or chemicals (ew).  Keep in mind though, it is a FACIAL HAIR remover.  Don&#x27;t expect to be able to trip your arm pits with it.&lt;br /&gt;Also works great on eyebrows.  I always get compliments on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a facial hair remover, this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t very impressed with this product.  Product pulls hair at times which hurts depending which area your using the product.  Light weight and good for minor trimming, wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this product for larger jobs.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to friends...</li>
            <li> This is a very handy product to get rid of any facial hair you may have.  It does Not grow in thicker or faster-  quite the contrary for me.&lt;br /&gt;I really like how it works and have 2 of them-  just in case.  They are plastic and after a few years, the continued vibration may wear on the plastic case and break.  But it&#x27;s worth it-  just get another.</li>
            <li> I should have known better to get one of these. I had one years ago, but I figured they had improved by now. I have pretty thick upper lip hair, and this still didn&#x27;t get all of it, hardly any at all. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this replacing an older version that broke. I thought they were the same product as they looked similar, however this one is much less precise and only picks up dark hair it&#x27;s not so great with peach fuzz. You also have to repeatedly go over the same spot in order to get anything with the blades</li>
            <li> It did not remove hair very well. When I applied more pressure, the blade broke off. I do not find this useful at all.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  The one I had prior to this (diiferent brand) was great.  This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is a great little item, that everyone should have.  You may use it every day, or only in emergencies, but it is very handy for the quick elimination of facial hair.  The light is very helpful.</li>
            <li> my mom loved this item, would buy again.</li>
            <li> More accessories than the others and very nice design and color selection for the product.  the additional combs give it that extra option of length and grooming option.</li>
            <li> Will only turn on and run for about 45 seconds...not enough time to do much with it...tried putting in a new battery with no luck</li>
            <li> This is actually a minature razor and a replacement for an old one, but still working.  Once you put the AAA battery in and push the little bar to start, it begins to make a buzzing sound and is ready to \\&quot;shave.\\&quot;  It really works.  It&#x27;s very feminine with an amethyst-looking glass jewel at the end of the case cover.  Oh, and it has a light on it now.  I&#x27;m not sure how it helps but - there it is.</li>
            <li> Seems to need new batteries too frequently - and I&#x27;m never sure when I first turn it on that it will COME on?</li>
            <li> I am not one for going to the salon to have someone wax my eyebrows or lips so this product is very good at keeping me home and doing it myself without spending the money.</li>
            <li> It did not remove the hair from my upper lip and it would shut off after a few seconds of use</li>
            <li> I like this and find it very useful to trim up areas on my body that I don&#x27;t feel like waxing or tweezing.</li>
            <li> This Item does not work , will not remove the hair I used it and the hair was still there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the hair remover works fine, however I wouldn&#x27;t know since I never received a working one!  If you want to try it out for yourself, do yourself a favor, order from a different company!</li>
            <li> this product makes a lot noise and to tell you the truth i dont even know if it gets the job done unless you have some very bushy eyebrows.I barely use it cuz it sometimes hurt.So i would not recommend it.Sorry.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT FOR FACIAL HAIR.  MY SECOND ONE - FIRST LASTED 2 YEARS.  I ALSO USED IT TO TRIM MY SON&#x27;S BACK HAIR NECK LINE WORKED GREAT ON COARSE HAIR</li>
            <li> Item is very very fragile.  Broke on first use.  Cheaply built. Ended up just tossing it in the trash. DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> It does not cut close and it is not very smooth on your skin. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used this about once a week and it does the job , the only thing I don&#x27;t know is how to get replacement blade heads</li>
            <li> It worked about a week, and it did remove facial hair pretty well, but the area where the blade is, broke for no particular reason.  It was a waste of money.  Not made well.</li>
            <li> Wife uses this and loves it.  The last one she bought did not have the light.  She likes the fact this has a light.</li>
            <li> This really works for the small areas I needed to use it.  I don&#x27;t get any rash from using it.  Works good.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  Great for after menopause and those little mustashes.</li>
            <li> used it on my upper lip, and it trimmed the hair down to an-almost visible length (not obvious with bunch of foundation on). however, i had to repeat the process not more than 2 or 3 days later. i tried it on my eyebrows, and the hair is so coarse there that the product barely even did anything at all, other than made it harder for me to pluck the tiny obvious black hairs after the fact. don&#x27;t buy, it&#x27;s not as awesome as it appears on the commercials...it DOES trim, but not to an effective length. at least for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 and 1 did not work at all. I would like to return it but have not heard anything.....</li>
