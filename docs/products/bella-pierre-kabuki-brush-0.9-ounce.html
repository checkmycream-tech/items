            <li>at one of my favorite discount stores</li>

            <li>Love this brush, you will too.</li>

            <li>For Real!!!</li>
            <li>I like this blusher i use for blush and bellapierre tge mineral loose foudation powder , its really good :)</li>
            <li>I must say I like my old one better, but it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft a nice looking.</li>
            <li>This brush feels like a heavenly cloud on your face and really distributes the foundation evenly and lightly.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>This is my first Kabuki Brush I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li>I use it with my BP mineral foundation and it helps to give me more coverage than a regular powder brush.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Would absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li>When I first bought this brand the salesgirl encouraged me to buy a kabuki brush too, but I had a powder brush at home and didn&#x27;t think I really needed this brush.</li>
            <li>Extra soft, great amount of coverage with my loose mineral powder.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t help but think it must, therefore, be much easier on my skin, as well.</li>
            <li>Also, I want to mention, the seller of this product is very dedicated to customer satisfaction, so</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I had used bare minerals mineral makeup for several years and accumulated many of their makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>Oh, I just wash out the brush with anything handsoap or shower gel and water and rinse with water and wrap in a paper towel to dry and this brush works the same (great) the next day.</li>
            <li>The brush I had was from Urban Decay, and although it worked okay, it was not nearly as soft and large as the bristle head on this brush.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this brush is you are a user of mineral foundation.</li>
            <li>The vegan brush is high quality &amp; the price is way below retail.</li>
            <li>Definitely well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Mine was free as part of a kit, but, I would not hesitate to purchase it (or other BP brushes) if needed, particularly at this price, which is a bargain compared to the price on the BP web site.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s short and compact, easy for packing, using, and actually works well.  </li>
            <li>I am new to Bella Pierre products.</li>
            <li>Upon comparing the BP brush to my bare minerals brush, the BP brush is MUCH softer to the touch.</li>
            <li>It first started shedding then later</li>
            <li>I have been very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the makeup and the kabuki brush that came with the kit.</li>
            <li>it broke and then finally the whole brush came apart.</li>
            <li>So soft on my skin</li>
            <li>The brush is so soft against your skin, when used to apply the mineral powder makeup, it distributes the makeup evenly.  </li>
            <li>make up was getting old.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the makeup or the brush, but I seem to achieve a softer, smoother, lighter and more even coverage than I had with the bare minerals.</li>
            <li>I bought this item a few years ago from a beauty supply brick &amp; mortar for more than double the price.</li>
            <li>However, somewhere along the way, I began experiencing irritation when using bare minerals products.</li>
            <li>Note that I also tried it with my packed mineral powder and it barely gets any on--</li>
            <li>, I tried to blow dry it on high heat and burnt the bristles</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brushes but really noticed the difference in application with this one.  </li>
            <li>When that brush finally got really old I threw it out and saw this brush on amazon for only 10 bucks</li>

            <li> This is my first Kabuki Brush I&#x27;ve purchased and I&#x27;m sooo glad I did. I use it with my BP mineral foundation and it helps to give me more coverage than a regular powder brush. It&#x27;s super soft a nice looking. Seems like it&#x27;s good quality. Would highly recommend this brush is you are a user of mineral foundation.</li>
            <li> I am new to Bella Pierre products. I had used bare minerals mineral makeup for several years and accumulated many of their makeup brushes. However, somewhere along the way, I began experiencing irritation when using bare minerals products. I stopped using them, but (given the IMHO somewhat exorbitant cost of makeup brushes) couldn&#x27;t bring myself to discard my collection of brushes. I recently stumbled upon a BP mineral makeup starter kit for less than $10 (yay!) at one of my favorite discount stores and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I have been very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the makeup and the kabuki brush that came with the kit. The BP brush does an excellent job of picking up, storing and applying the mineral makeup. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the makeup or the brush, but I seem to achieve a softer, smoother, lighter and more even coverage than I had with the bare minerals. Upon comparing the BP brush to my bare minerals brush, the BP brush is MUCH softer to the touch. I can&#x27;t help but think it must, therefore, be much easier on my skin, as well. I plan to gradually replace my existing brush collection with BP brushes. I anticipate this brush would compare favorably to any competitor&#x27;s product and recommend it without reservation. Mine was free as part of a kit, but, I would not hesitate to purchase it (or other BP brushes) if needed, particularly at this price, which is a bargain compared to the price on the BP web site. I hope this review helps. All the best!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the article</li>
            <li> This helps apply  the Bella Pierre mineral make up great--went to make up counter at mall  several months ago was not good experience--They were like &amp;#34;I can color match you; but I doubt that we keep your color in stock.&amp;#34; So I was like what?  The people at the mall were so terrible and rude for no real good reason-- I figured that I was better off just picking some make up online .  Did a long search and this European mineral make up and brush were/are perfect. Using them now after a chemical peel  and it goes on smooth after the moisturizer --just swivel and pat --and also used before the peel-- Was planning the peel before started using make up. This stuff is great. I Have been trying to match my color for years . For Real!!! The way it looked on line was the way it looked when I got it ---Great!!!! OMG Oh, I just wash out the brush with anything handsoap or shower gel and water and rinse with water and wrap in a paper towel to dry and this brush works the same (great) the next day.</li>
            <li> If I could give this brush zero stars then I would. I have had this brush less then a month and it has fallen apart. It first started shedding then later it broke and then finally the whole brush came apart. For the price it&#x27;s not worth it.  I can find something cheaper that&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using goat hair brushes and found this synthetic one. So soft on my skin and it allows the makeup to go on easily and smooth. No shedding like my other brushes either.</li>
            <li> The brush is so soft against your skin, when used to apply the mineral powder makeup, it distributes the makeup evenly.  I&#x27;ve tried other brushes but really noticed the difference in application with this one.  Also, I want to mention, the seller of this product is very dedicated to customer satisfaction, so if you decided to buy from this seller, know that you&#x27;re in good hands.</li>
            <li> Love love this brush!! Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Very soft and great for mineral powder makeup.  I replaced previous brush that I wore out.  Love this brush, you will too.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use to every single day when I am putting on my loose foundation and it covers evenly! Would absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  It&#x27;s short and compact, easy for packing, using, and actually works well.  I must have in your makeup collection. Try all the Bella products.  Haven&#x27;t found one I didn&#x27;t like!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sherry</li>
            <li> I like this blusher i use for blush and bellapierre tge mineral loose foudation powder , its really good :)</li>
            <li> Extra soft, great amount of coverage with my loose mineral powder.  It applies evenly and not too heavy.  Note that I also tried it with my packed mineral powder and it barely gets any on--so very light coverage.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Bella Pierre&#x27;s mineral foundation for awhile now and I really love it! When I first bought this brand the salesgirl encouraged me to buy a kabuki brush too, but I had a powder brush at home and didn&#x27;t think I really needed this brush. The brush I had was from Urban Decay, and although it worked okay, it was not nearly as soft and large as the bristle head on this brush.

            <li> Love it - tiny and perfect for travel - love the quality and volume of this brush - highly recommend for the price and quality!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!  Brush is as described...just wish it came with carrying case.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Bought it  for the one I used for mineral make up was getting old.  I must say I like my old one better, but it&#x27;s okay.  I kept it.</li>
            <li> Picks up enough foundation. Great coverage. I don&#x27;t regret purchasing it. But please don&#x27;t do what I did, I tried to blow dry it on high heat and burnt the bristles lol But I ordered another one.</li>
