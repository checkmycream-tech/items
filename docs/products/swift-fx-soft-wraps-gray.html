            <li> It is too small and really does not help.  </li>
            <li> These are a soft appearing cloth but short and narrow.  </li>
            <li> Also makes it harder to adjust your bottom straps in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> If you have need of thin cushions these are worth a try.  </li>
            <li> Like having a second set of wraps while cleaning other set.</li>
            <li> Will use this for future purchase of other products.  </li>
            <li> poor fit and very little comfort.</li>
            <li> not all what i expected</li>
            <li> Cheaper than ordering through my sleep center too.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t stay in place and never fit properly.  </li>
            <li> The fabric for the wraps is too thin to make much of a difference, so you still end up with the strap marks like before.  </li>
            <li> These are thin as CPAP straps go - not as much padding as the SnuggleStraps or PAD</li>
            <li> Helps to keep the headgear from slipping upward and keeps the marks made from the straps to a minimum.  </li>
            <li> but it was easier to buy these and a few other items all in one transaction.  </li>
            <li> It is a very thin single-ply microfiber cloth, and does nothing to stop the straps from leaving marks that are still visible when you put the mask back on the next night.</li>
            <li> The straps that go around the ear are too flexible and it does not hold the pillows in nose unless it is really tight.</li>
            <li> it has no padding to stop a crease on your face if the strap is tight.</li>
            <li> Seem like they may be a bit longer than the originals, but that could just be that mine shrunk a little over time.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I cut up an only baby washcloth (really thin) and wrapped the strap, then used the Swift wrap to wrap around it and hold it in place.  </li>
            <li> WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS JUNK</li>
            <li> A few people at work had said something to me about line on my face; after I explained I wore a mask for C-PAP they understood.  </li>
            <li> They are a little small for my headgear.</li>
            <li> I hated those lines on my cheeks, and imagined that as the years went on, the lines would take longer and longer to bounce back to normal.  </li>
            <li> this is a very poorly made (probably in china) piece of total</li>
            <li> I still have the impression of the straps on my face for at least two hours every day.</li>
            <li> NO MORE LINES!</li>
            <li> They were not as bad and did not last for hours.  </li>
            <li> I put them on the straps of my CPAP mask - after two nights they swiveled up and was worse than having the straps by themselves.  </li>
            <li> based on my experience, if thin is in, try Swift FX.  </li>
            <li> I was getting terrible lines on my face from my mask, but these really help to eliminate them.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I still have lines on my face even when using them :(</li>
            <li> The plastic velcro connections on my CPAP mask were cutting in to the tops of my ears and very painful.  </li>
            <li> Also the covers for the wach side are annoying.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good addition to have when the others wear out.</li>
            <li> I know you can buy these at any cpap store but it was easier to buy these and a few other items all in one transaction.  Plus there the same quality and brand that I use.</li>
            <li> Great deal since many of the medical supply companies won&#x27;t sell the soft wraps without selling you the CPAP headgear.  These are OEM and are exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> These work as designed. Fit is good and they definitely prevent the mask from sticking to my face. I would recommend these to a friend.</li>
            <li> Resmed has created a system for Sleep Apnea sufferers that can truly extend ones life.  Most people give up on Cpap use. This nose pillow head gear is as close to being free during sleep as one can ever be.</li>
            <li> Have been using cpap machine since April. Like having a second set of wraps while cleaning other set. Meets expectations.</li>
            <li> Bought this hoping it would help with the red marks on my face.  It is too small and really does not help.  Also makes it harder to adjust your bottom straps in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> It really helped prevent skin irritation from the nasal pillows!  I use it every night now.</li>
            <li> These are perfect replacements for the wraps on your mask.  They are very comfortable and prevent chaffing from your straps.</li>
            <li> I put them on the straps of my CPAP mask - after two nights they swiveled up and was worse than having the straps by themselves.  They do not cushion the straps or make the straps more comfortable to wear.  I will not recommend this product for anyone with CPAP face mask straps.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> poor fit and very little comfort. not all what i expected</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with this product. But I cannot tolerate anything in my nose and didn&#x27;t know that until I tried these</li>
            <li> Very soft to the face, brings comfort and can be washed.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to ever one who has a Swift FX Resmed head gear.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with products and how informative with the ease of ordering on-line thru Internet.  Will use this for future purchase of other products.  Keep up the good customer service &amp; simple ordering AMAZON !</li>
            <li> These fit my Resmed mask perfectly and are comparable to the ones that came with the original mask. Cheaper than ordering through my sleep center too.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of time and money.  These pads are a good idea, but just didn&#x27;t work on my mask.  Just didn&#x27;t stay in place and never fit properly.  Possibily someone else with a different mask setup will have better results, but it was a dud for me.</li>
            <li> Great idea...poor execution.  The fabric for the wraps is too thin to make much of a difference, so you still end up with the strap marks like before.  HOWEVER, I cut up an only baby washcloth (really thin) and wrapped the strap, then used the Swift wrap to wrap around it and hold it in place.  My fix worked perfectly.  So, if Swift would just make these a little thicker they would be great.</li>
            <li> this is a very poorly made (probably in china) piece of total ****.&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS JUNK</li>
            <li> The straps that go around the ear are too flexible and it does not hold the pillows in nose unless it is really tight. Also the covers for the wach side are annoying.</li>
            <li> They are a little small for my headgear.</li>
            <li> Love the swift fx product.</li>
            <li> These are very helpful.  The plastic velcro connections on my CPAP mask were cutting in to the tops of my ears and very painful.  These have pretty much eliminated that.</li>
            <li> I thought these were wider than they are.  These are the same ones that come with the cpap mask.  I thought they would be better but they were the same.  I still have lines on my face even when using them :(</li>
            <li> all I can say is save your MONEY. what a joke, the only good part was it came in good time.&lt;br /&gt;This Item would be over priced at the Dollar store.</li>
            <li> Straps work just as advertised like the originals. Seem like they may be a bit longer than the originals, but that could just be that mine shrunk a little over time. Would get 5 stars if they were a bit thicker.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know the head gear we bought came with a set, but its nice to have an extra when you are cleaning the other. Soft and easy to put on.</li>
            <li> These are thin as CPAP straps go - not as much padding as the SnuggleStraps or PAD A CHEEKS.  If you have need of thin cushions these are worth a try.  I prefer a mix of these, SnuggleStraps, and PAD A CHEEKS for different parts of the headgear.  Some better for cheeks, some better for necks, etc. etc.  For really thin pads, these are as good as I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For thicker pads, SnuggleStraps work well.  Last time I looked they were $13.95/pr @Amazon w/free shipping.  For an even thicker pad, I like PAD A CHEEK @ $30 for two pairs (upper and lower strap covers). IMHO the PAD A CHEEK are most effective when you want a lot of padding (P-A-C covers have a foam-like core and a soft velour-type \\&quot;micro fleece\\&quot; cover. While the SnuggleStraps have velcro seams to close around the straps, the P-A-C comes with a metal tool that you use to \\&quot;thread\\&quot; the strap through the P-A-C. I&#x27;ve found the P-A-C to be more effective at avoiding facial printing.  Last time I ordered PAD A CHEEKs, they weren&#x27;t available on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So based on my experience, if thin is in, try Swift FX.  For medium padding, consider Snuggle Straps.  For maximum thickness and comfort, tconsider  PAD A CHEEK.  All are good products for what they are.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that these would take away my lines.  The lines are still there, but they do disappear faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use these strap covers as a back-up and hope they help with those strap lines that I used to wake up with in the morning. I have a CPAP machine and have to have the pressure up to 12, so that the mask has to fit tightly or else the air escapes when it gets to full power and wakes me up.  I hated those lines on my cheeks, and imagined that as the years went on, the lines would take longer and longer to bounce back to normal.  The best t hing I&#x27;ve used so far is a light STARTER hooded sweatshirt. 60% cotton and 40% polyester, with 100% polyester in the hood.  Walmart carries them.  NO MORE LINES! The hood is a great cushion for the straps. I&#x27;ve only used it in the winter so far for the last 4 months, but plan to keep the temperature the same in the summer with air conditioning so I can keep wearing my hood.  Yay!</li>
            <li> These covers are worth every penny.  A few people at work had said something to me about line on my face; after I explained I wore a mask for C-PAP they understood.  I checked online to see if there was a solution and found these and could not be happier.  Not only do the keep the lines off of my face it&#x27;s make the mask more comfortable to wear especially for stomach sleeping.</li>
            <li> Covers are gray.  Now have a spare set and able to trade out the pink set of covers that came with original mask (Swift for Her).</li>
            <li> I really wanted for this to work. ...it didn&#x27;t. I still have the impression of the straps on my face for at least two hours every day. I think i&#x27;m going to get some thick material and some Velcro strips and make my own.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom&#x27;s BiPAP. Did not open inner package.  These are a soft appearing cloth but short and narrow.  Get fleece ones-come slightly longer and fit easily over the straps of headgear.</li>
            <li> Product arrived exactly as described, original Resmed wraps. Great addition to the FX mask, prevents any red marks from the headgear.</li>
            <li> Mu husband was very happy to have an extra set so he doesn&#x27;t have to be sure that his &amp;#34;one set&amp;#34; is washed and dried before bedtime.  These are the same as the ones that came with his machine.</li>
            <li> I still have strap lines on my face. Product is not substantial enough. It needs to be constructed of heavier material.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a cover only. it has no padding to stop a crease on your face if the strap is tight. Not the best for that but a good cover you can wash</li>
            <li> This make the headgear straps much more comfortable. Helps to keep the headgear from slipping upward and keeps the marks made from the straps to a minimum.  Not necessary to have but makes it much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive!!!!!</li>
            <li> The did exactly as I anticipated, protect&lt;br /&gt;my face from the mask straps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m grateful to the companies who provide cpap supplies at an affordable price. These are exactly like the ones that came with my unit and they were delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really stop those morning after impressions. They are better than nothing. But, what the heck - a hot shower a n couple of hours later it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> I was getting terrible lines on my face from my mask, but these really help to eliminate them. I am glad I tried them.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and it&#x27;s what I was looking for</li>
            <li> The CPAP mask still leaves marks on my face.</li>
            <li> Too tiny to be of any use, and has no padding whatsoever.  It is a very thin single-ply microfiber cloth, and does nothing to stop the straps from leaving marks that are still visible when you put the mask back on the next night.</li>
            <li> These wraps work and work really well.  No facial creases in the morning.  They are a simple idea that take care of the problem.</li>
            <li> Still woke up with marks on my face. They were not as bad and did not last for hours.  Had hoped that this product would be my solution to my problem. Still looking for a better product.</li>
