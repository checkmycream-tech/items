            <li>It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

            <li>I am happy that I bought this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good price compared to&lt;br</li>
            <li>She said a good concealer and some blush is all you need.  </li>
            <li>I put this under my eyes, dab it in and I am good to go all day.  </li>
            <li>Gotta love amazon!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Glad I did!</li>
            <li>Salley&#x27;s used to sell these but not any more.  </li>
            <li>seller was fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased when I&#x27;m done using it at the look I&#x27;ve achieved.</li>
            <li>I love love love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It will be my permanent concealer unless I come across something better, and I am not looking.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff......</li>
            <li>; Matching powder foundation is okay on top of it.</li>
            <li>It gives a matte finish and blends easily.</li>
            <li>Hands down best under eye concealer.</li>
            <li>It blends nicely, stays on all day, and provides a nice universal tone.</li>
            <li>I have tried many foundations and have very large pores on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li>I bought this concealer because it had so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>this stuff wipes right off and does not conceal even a pimple !</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good about this.</li>
            <li>Good enough to cover a scar.</li>
            <li>it covers great and is waterproof, so it doesn&#x27;t crease like other products.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;light\\&quot; isn&#x27;t as light as I thought it would be and doesn&#x27;t cover my circles very well.</li>
            <li>I will try ordering one more time in the hopes that I can get a hold of the same lighter shade I originally purchased.</li>
            <li>She was right.</li>
            <li>I use it to cover a small scar on my face and can honestly say it works better than Dermablend.</li>
            <li>, this is the real deal baby!</li>
            <li>Nothing fancy about it, but it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>needed a concealer that would hold up during those hot sweaty summer days</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>The fact that it blends so easily with or with out makeup or powder and is waterproof only adds to it&#x27;s greatness!</li>
            <li>It definitely does the job however the smell of it smells of a strong odor of space from home Depot or paint primer.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and oily skin</li>
            <li>Its simple, easy and blends very well.</li>
            <li>&quot; that doesn&#x27;t really work for me..</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I bought this</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my Mom, who at age 72, is VERY embarrassed by her age spots.  </li>
            <li>I am 51 years old &amp; have tried many different cover ups over the years.</li>
            <li>I love the concealer but can&#x27;t seem to be able to get the product that I ordered - very frustrating.</li>
            <li>I have a couple brown spots -- like a small, really dark freckle, not a larger more spread age spot -- on my fair skin on my face.</li>
            <li>so I live by this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Nothing better but use it regularly layer and throw all your other stuff out</li>
            <li>but none of them can do the magic that this little stick does!!</li>
            <li>If anyone can get their hands on this magical little stick, BUY IT!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 21 years old</li>
            <li>but I should have because it completely took me by surprise on how well it worked.</li>
            <li>Also, I am sensitive to some cosmetic products (scent, oiliness, etc.), and this one does not bother me a bit.</li>
            <li>Like how it covers the &amp;#34;freckles.&amp;#34; However, have to be careful with powder blush on top of it, because the powder adheres and actually makes what is covered obvious.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product</li>
            <li>I have never able to find a concealer to hide them, so I was really excited when I read the reviews for this stuff.</li>
            <li>No other concealer compares.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had dark circles my whole</li>
            <li>This is the only concealer I&#x27;ve found that is dense enough to do a decent job on seriously dark undereye circles.</li>

            <li> I dabbed a little on, smoothed it in, did my usual brush of a light mineral makeup and it blended well.</li>
            <li> and I wish more people knew of my little secret.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s, I just barely dab it in the soft skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li> My esthetician advised me a long time ago to stop wearing foundation.  </li>
            <li> It also goes a long way, so  lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have issues with hormonal skin... oily AND dry patches, so I always set this with mineral powder (faerie organics)to keep it from landing in the wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s actually still too dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of disappointed that I paid $13 for a \\&quot;miracle\\</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that despite ordering the lightest shade both times, the product I received the 2nd time was noticeably darker.</li>
            <li> I always have a difficult time finding the right color (either white-out or orange).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it works miracles, but like I said, it&#x27;s thick enough that at least it does a decent job.</li>
            <li> Also that one little tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> other products like this one.</li>
            <li> While its too dark to use under my eyes it still works well to even the skin tone on other parts of my face.</li>
            <li> If you get up close, you can see a little bit but not much at all.   </li>
            <li> I got the lightest color and it is still to dark for my skin..</li>
            <li> If you are trying to hide dark circles, this product covers so thoroughly and DOES NOT fade throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have medium/tan skin, so I ordered the \\&quot;light\\&quot; (as it was recommended to order a shade lighter than your skin for dark circles)</li>
            <li> She has had a couple of strokes and has limited hand mobility, so I dab a small amount on each spot and blend.  </li>
            <li> It provides enough coverage to sort out the nightmare under my eyes (circles so bad that I look like a victim of domestic violence),yet blends well.</li>
            <li> I have a skin disorder that has the underneath of my one eye very dark</li>
            <li> I also have broken capallaries that this totally covers.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money i have a purplish scar on my forehead from skin cancer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s recently become difficult to find.</li>
            <li> and whenever I get photographed, usually the photographer gets rid of them in the photo.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but was highly disappointed instead.</li>
            <li> it is getting very hard to find it.</li>
            <li> and I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>

            <li> Nothing better but use it regularly layer and throw all your other stuff out so you won&#x27;t be tempted to use garbage anymore, this is the real deal baby!</li>
            <li> Salley&#x27;s used to sell these but not any more.  Now I can buy these only on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Used this product for years, and it tends to do the trick!</li>
            <li> I got the lightest color and it is still to dark for my skin.. Looks almost orange on my face. I had high hopes for this product, but was highly disappointed instead.</li>
            <li> I found this years ago at a CVS and was so bummed when I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore.  Gotta love amazon!  I have a skin disorder that has the underneath of my one eye very dark so I live by this stuff.  It&#x27;s think but doesn&#x27;t feel gross and it&#x27;s not runny like the cream stuff that never stays on.  I hope they never stop making this stuff!</li>
            <li> I found this product on Amazon after Walgreen&#x27;s discontinued stocking it. I use it to cover a small scar on my face and can honestly say it works better than Dermablend. It gives a matte finish and blends easily. It&#x27;s also great for covering freckles or age spots. I hope they keep making this item as it works beautifully at a great price!</li>
            <li> This is  the best cover up ever made &amp; it is getting very hard to find it. I am 51 years old &amp; have tried many different cover ups over the years. seller was fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have worked in retail for 10 years and around some of the best make-up artist but none of them can do the magic that this little stick does!! I have some acne scars and occasional break outs but with this product no one knows but me. The fact that it blends so easily with or with out makeup or powder and is waterproof only adds to it&#x27;s greatness! This is truly the best concealer out there and I wish more people knew of my little secret.</li>
            <li> I have tried many foundations and have very large pores on my nose and cheeks. Heredity I guess. I also have broken capallaries that this totally covers. I use this instead of foundation. It&#x27;s almost like a putty to fill the pores and doesn&#x27;t break out my skin. I&#x27;m pleased when I&#x27;m done using it at the look I&#x27;ve achieved. Since I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s, I just barely dab it in the soft skin under my eyes. Can&#x27;t say enough good about this.</li>
            <li> I always have a difficult time finding the right color (either white-out or orange). This is wonderful on my pinky-fair skin tone. It provides enough coverage to sort out the nightmare under my eyes (circles so bad that I look like a victim of domestic violence),yet blends well. I have issues with hormonal skin... oily AND dry patches, so I always set this with mineral powder (faerie organics)to keep it from landing in the wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought this concealer because it had so many positive reviews.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything that everyone claims it does.  I have sun spots or age spots, and even with two coats it still does not conceal them.  I had such high hopes for this product and I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Good enough to cover a scar. I am happy that I bought this&lt;br /&gt;product. I will buy again. It&#x27;s a good price compared to&lt;br /&gt;many other products like this one.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have tried to order this product and been shipped a different item. I love the concealer but can&#x27;t seem to be able to get the product that I ordered - very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff. I have never found anything to work so well. It blends nicely, stays on all day, and provides a nice universal tone. It also lasts forever. My only complaint is that despite ordering the lightest shade both times, the product I received the 2nd time was noticeably darker. While its too dark to use under my eyes it still works well to even the skin tone on other parts of my face. I will try ordering one more time in the hopes that I can get a hold of the same lighter shade I originally purchased.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6 years now. My esthetician advised me a long time ago to stop wearing foundation.  She said a good concealer and some blush is all you need.  She was right. I put this under my eyes, dab it in and I am good to go all day.  I have large pores and oily skin and this is the best concealer I have ever used.  DL</li>
            <li> This is the BEST CONCEALER OUT THERE. If you are trying to hide dark circles, this product covers so thoroughly and DOES NOT fade throughout the day. After Harmon and Rite Aid discontinued selling it years ago, I&#x27;ve tried over a dozen high-priced concealers, as well as lower-end makeup brand concealers, and this product is THE ONE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for YEARS. It&#x27;s recently become difficult to find. It blends well and stays put. Nothing fancy about it, but it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> needed a concealer that would hold up during those hot sweaty summer days-this is it-works great-I definitely would buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21 years old and I&#x27;ve had dark circles my whole life-- they&#x27;re heriditary. I have never able to find a concealer to hide them, so I was really excited when I read the reviews for this stuff. I have medium/tan skin, so I ordered the \\&quot;light\\&quot; (as it was recommended to order a shade lighter than your skin for dark circles) and it&#x27;s actually still too dark. The \\&quot;light\\&quot; isn&#x27;t as light as I thought it would be and doesn&#x27;t cover my circles very well. I&#x27;m kind of disappointed that I paid $13 for a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; that doesn&#x27;t really work for me..</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I bought this but I should have because it completely took me by surprise on how well it worked. Its simple, easy and blends very well. It will be my permanent concealer unless I come across something better, and I am not looking.</li>
            <li> Hands down best under eye concealer. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s been discontinued but I can never find it! If anyone can get their hands on this magical little stick, BUY IT!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff......it covers great and is waterproof, so it doesn&#x27;t crease like other products.  It also goes a long way, so  lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I hope that they keep selling it! No other concealer compares. I would recommend to anyone! Buy it!</li>
            <li> I have a couple brown spots -- like a small, really dark freckle, not a larger more spread age spot -- on my fair skin on my face. Had them forever and whenever I get photographed, usually the photographer gets rid of them in the photo. I thought it was time I cover them before the next photography session ;)  It worked beautifully! I dabbed a little on, smoothed it in, did my usual brush of a light mineral makeup and it blended well. If you get up close, you can see a little bit but not much at all.   Plus, it&#x27;s cruelty-free which is why I finally took the plunge and bought it. Glad I did!</li>
            <li> This is the only concealer I&#x27;ve found that is dense enough to do a decent job on seriously dark undereye circles. I can&#x27;t say that it works miracles, but like I said, it&#x27;s thick enough that at least it does a decent job. I hope they keep making it. Also, I am sensitive to some cosmetic products (scent, oiliness, etc.), and this one does not bother me a bit. Also that one little tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It definitely does the job however the smell of it smells of a strong odor of space from home Depot or paint primer. I wish it was water proof.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my Mom, who at age 72, is VERY embarrassed by her age spots.  She has had a couple of strokes and has limited hand mobility, so I dab a small amount on each spot and blend.  The makeup is virtually undetectable.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money i have a purplish scar on my forehead from skin cancer this stuff wipes right off and does not conceal even a pimple ! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Like how it covers the &amp;#34;freckles.&amp;#34; However, have to be careful with powder blush on top of it, because the powder adheres and actually makes what is covered obvious. So I put it around whatever I have &amp;#34;covered up.&amp;#34; Matching powder foundation is okay on top of it.</li>
            <li> Awesome concealer!  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
