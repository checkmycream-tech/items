            <li>I would say that this is a great shampoo for the price, but its actually an awesome shampoo for any price point.  </li>

            <li>It cleans well and smells so good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this shampoo as it is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line:  If you want a good reliable no-frills shampoo this is it.  </li>
            <li>A great value for shampoo in a scent my kids love.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very happy to smell like a coconut after my showers, i really like this body wash a lot.</li>
            <li>I love the price and the fact it leaves my hair shiny and does a good job.</li>
            <li>This shampoo lathers good, smells good, gets your hair clean.  </li>
            <li>This Shampoo smells great and does what Shampoo is supposed to do, clean and moisturize.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that my hair wasn&#x27;t quite as shiny and healthy looking as it used to be (although I cannot definitively blame the shampoo for that).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what most of the stuff is.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I went with coconut because I&#x27;ve heard that helps keep lice off hair..not sure, but why not try that scent, because it goes away after the shower.</li>
            <li>I love the way this shampoo smells.</li>
            <li>I have used this many times before</li>
            <li>and I can order from Walmart online and and get twice as much or more for the money.</li>
            <li>I have used this product many times</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>the smell of some sort of pineapple fruit drink is overwhelming...</li>
            <li>my hair starts feeling progressively more healthy.  </li>
            <li>and I think Suave did a nice job with making the coconut smell sweet but not overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a great job of cleaning their hair, and along with the conditioner leaves hair soft and untangled.</li>
            <li>Not an amazing product by any means, but good enough for me!</li>
            <li>I get the cheapest decent shampoo for my husband and this fits the bill and smells amazing, which is more important for me than it is for him.</li>
            <li>This conditioning shampoo does a great job of giving me extra conditioning in winter without creating buildup.  </li>
            <li>My kids love this scent, and we got through lots of suave products because they are economical.</li>
            <li>But hey, they usually smell good and they&#x27;re good in a pinch.  </li>
            <li>It does get it clean.  </li>
            <li>Gets you clean, smells like coconut.</li>
            <li>sweet scent</li>
            <li>It will not make your hair super shiny, grow longer, or repair split ends.  </li>
            <li>and I have a mildly oily scalp.  </li>
            <li>The coconut aroma is mild.  </li>
            <li>and I would still say it was worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cheap (walmart $1.50 for 30oz), easy to obtain, and sold in bulk, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair if diluted (never tried it full</li>
            <li>bottom line is that this is cheap shampoo, with a decent scent, but probably not something that should be used on hair that you care about.  </li>
            <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say my hair borders on the oily side, and I use the shampoo and the matching conditioner on the tips of my hair and it always comes out clean and manageable and ready for whatever styling I want.  </li>
            <li>It cleans well, smells nice, and can be stretched.</li>
            <li>It does a good job cleaning my thick hair and rinses clean.</li>
            <li>I was first attracted by</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, exactly as described.</li>
            <li>, this is an ammonia based shampoo, so if you color your hair, it will most likely fade your color.  </li>
            <li>This is how I view suave shampoo, it&#x27;s good for everyday pull your hair up in a pony tail use, or for kids.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re inexpensive, clean well, and don&#x27;t make your hair look greasy inside of a day like many other brands.  </li>
            <li>shampoo smells good, but its not overwhelming, and your hair doesn&#x27;t really retain the smell after you have shampooed, so if you are looking to smell like the tropics all day, this will probably disappoint</li>
            <li>and I realize that spending a lot of money on hair products really does not make your hair look like a movie star.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t color, perm or use much heat on my hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seeing as how I really like the scent, I&#x27;d probably continue to buy it again and again and again.</li>
            <li>It cleans very well</li>
            <li>It is also priced very well.</li>
            <li>This has harsh ingredients, but it proves worthwhile to use if diluted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet and definitely smells of coconut.  </li>
            <li>Splurge for a little bit better.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo makes my hair so soft, I really like it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been noticing quite a few more split ends than normal.  </li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;tropical&amp;#34; definitely dominates the &amp;#34;coconut.&amp;#34; I was expecting coconut with a hint of something else, and got almost no coconut scent and a powerful candy fruit smell instead, hence the rating.</li>
            <li>But, if you have fairly normal to oily hair like me I have never had a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it came time then to buy some new shampoo,</li>
            <li>(I haven&#x27;t developed any odd rashes, noticed my hair to be any more dry/oily or any other real changes)</li>
            <li>compare to a lot of natural brands.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely cannot get enough of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sadly though, i thought that &amp;#34;tropical coconut&amp;#34; would have the same good smell of the &amp;#34;coconut&amp;#34; suave shampoo that i&#x27;ve used for years - it doesn&#x27;t really have a smell at all.  </li>
            <li>The coconut scent is long lasting and smells true to the stated label.</li>
            <li>So far I have no regrets.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised about how well the Suave shampoo cleaned my hair and left it shiny.</li>
            <li>I have been a sucker over the years and spent more on hair products than I should.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of shampoos in my day, from cheap drug store buys, to the high end drug store buys, to the expensive salon stuff, and for some reason, I always come back to this.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Not natural at all.</li>
            <li> And since this shampoo lasted me two and a half months (being used on hair that&#x27;s to the middle of my back)</li>
            <li> It could also dry your scalp if you have issues with dandruff.  </li>

            <li> With ingredients like Ammonium Laureth Sulfate and Cocamid MEA, I&#x27;m not really sure that this is shampoo or rocket fuel.  </li>
            <li> I love the product - but the price was outrageous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lazy day shampoo that should be used, when you don&#x27;t want to use the $10 bottle of shampoo.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t make up for the terrible harsh chemicals inside, not good at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sad to see this is no longer offered in the Subscribe and Save store.</li>
            <li> But I hate wasting stuff</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This Shampoo smells great and does what Shampoo is supposed to do, clean and moisturize.  Somehow, I always seem to think of the Caribbean or Hawaii whenever I use this Shampoo.  I was first attracted by \\&quot;Tropical Coconut\\&quot; and the price.  So far I have no regrets.</li>
            <li> I have been a sucker over the years and spent more on hair products than I should. Well, I have wised up and I realize that spending a lot of money on hair products really does not make your hair look like a movie star.  I will not be a victim of marketing again.  This shampoo lathers good, smells good, gets your hair clean.  It will not make your hair super shiny, grow longer, or repair split ends.  NEITHER WILL ANY OF THE OTHERS.  Wake up people. Now you know.</li>
            <li> The only thing this is is a bargain. But it doesn&#x27;t make up for the terrible harsh chemicals inside, not good at all.</li>
            <li> Suave is one of the cheaper shampoos out there.  But hey, they usually smell good and they&#x27;re good in a pinch.  Especially considering that a bottle lasts awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tropical Coconut smells good.  It&#x27;s sweet and definitely smells of coconut.  I guess the tropical comes from the fact that it is coconut, because I don&#x27;t sense any other \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; in this mix.  No pineapple or anything.  And it clings to your hair, so hours after taking your shower, you can still smell the coconut.  So it is a bit strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effects on hair are debatable.  It does get it clean.  But it also dries hair out a little bit and I&#x27;ve been noticing quite a few more split ends than normal.  And since this shampoo lasted me two and a half months (being used on hair that&#x27;s to the middle of my back) that&#x27;s a long time to be torturing your hair.  But I hate wasting stuff so I stuck it through.  I also noticed that my hair wasn&#x27;t quite as shiny and healthy looking as it used to be (although I cannot definitively blame the shampoo for that).  Still, it makes me nervous about using it again.  It does lather up quite well compare to a lot of natural brands.  Bubbly and foamy white lather that only takes about a nickel sized drop to generate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really sure how this shampoo is considered natural.  There&#x27;s a long list of unpronounceable ingredients and only a few of those are actually natural that I can tell.  It just isn&#x27;t something that should be continually used on your scalp in my opinion.  Splurge for a little bit better.  With ingredients like Ammonium Laureth Sulfate and Cocamid MEA, I&#x27;m not really sure that this is shampoo or rocket fuel.  I don&#x27;t know what most of the stuff is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this is cheap shampoo, with a decent scent, but probably not something that should be used on hair that you care about.  I recommend avoiding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review by M. Reynard 2013</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my kids- bye bye baby shampoo &amp; start usng big boy shampoo. And I went with coconut because I&#x27;ve heard that helps keep lice off hair..not sure, but why not try that scent, because it goes away after the shower.</li>
            <li> Um, it&#x27;s suave. Gets you clean, smells like coconut. Arrived quickly, exactly as described. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I love the way this shampoo smells. It does a good job cleaning my thick hair and rinses clean. SMELLS SO GOOD. Great price on amazon.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair so soft, I really like it. I will probably look for this the next time I need shampoo.</li>
            <li> This has harsh ingredients, but it proves worthwhile to use if diluted. I use this product diluted with water in a smaller portion bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I use it focused on my scalp. It cleans well, smells nice, and can be stretched. It&#x27;s super cheap (walmart $1.50 for 30oz), easy to obtain, and sold in bulk, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair if diluted (never tried it full strength).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water (Aqua), Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamide MEA, Ammonium Chloride, Glycol Distearate, Fragrance, Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose, Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Citric Acid, Ammonium Xylenesulfonate, Propylene Glycol, Tocopheryl Acetate [Vitamin E Acetate], Isopropyl Palmitate, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Silk Amino Acids, Honey,, PPG-9, Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Fruit Extract</li>
            <li> Suave Naturals Shampoo, Tropical Coconut - 22.5oz. .. I have used this many times before and I have always loved the fragrant scent</li>
            <li> i do.  they&#x27;re inexpensive, clean well, and don&#x27;t make your hair look greasy inside of a day like many other brands.  sadly though, i thought that &amp;#34;tropical coconut&amp;#34; would have the same good smell of the &amp;#34;coconut&amp;#34; suave shampoo that i&#x27;ve used for years - it doesn&#x27;t really have a smell at all.  suave, where&#x27;s my coconut?  nonetheless, with the product at this price, i can&#x27;t say no.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t color, perm or use much heat on my hair and I have a mildly oily scalp.  I am allergic to sodium benzoate, which is not in this product.  This conditioning shampoo does a great job of giving me extra conditioning in winter without creating buildup.  The coconut aroma is mild.  I&#x27;m very sad to see this is no longer offered in the Subscribe and Save store.</li>
            <li> I get the cheapest decent shampoo for my husband and this fits the bill and smells amazing, which is more important for me than it is for him.</li>
            <li> I love the product - but the price was outrageous. I thought I was getting 2 bottles for $6.75 which would have been comparable to Walmart. I thought I was ordering 4 bottles but only 2 arrived and the cost was $13.50. Way over-priced! There are other suppliers that charge a lot less and I can order from Walmart online and and get twice as much or more for the money. It was my fault, I didn&#x27;t look close enough at the product description - but I won&#x27;t do that again.</li>
            <li> Does the job without being overpriced.  Pleasant coconut smell.  Not an amazing product by any means, but good enough for me!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very happy to smell like a coconut after my showers, i really like this body wash a lot. sweet scent</li>
            <li> Suave Naturals Shampoo, Tropical Coconut - 22.5oz. I have used this product many times and I love it. It cleans well and smells so good. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the taste of coconut. It&#x27;s stringy and weird and I&#x27;ve never found it appealing. That said, I love the smell of artificial coconut. Absolutely cannot get enough of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came time then to buy some new shampoo, wouldn&#x27;t you know, I bought the coconut smell because that&#x27;s what I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo seemingly works (I haven&#x27;t developed any odd rashes, noticed my hair to be any more dry/oily or any other real changes) and I think Suave did a nice job with making the coconut smell sweet but not overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing as how I really like the scent, I&#x27;d probably continue to buy it again and again and again.</li>
            <li> This is how I view suave shampoo, it&#x27;s good for everyday pull your hair up in a pony tail use, or for kids. The coconut scent is long lasting and smells true to the stated label. But the suave naturals is not a product you should use if you expect style quality results in hair. It&#x27;s a lazy day shampoo that should be used, when you don&#x27;t want to use the $10 bottle of shampoo. My kids love this scent, and we got through lots of suave products because they are economical.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo. It cleans very well and I love the smell. It reminds me of a tropical beach. It is also priced very well.</li>
            <li> A great value for shampoo in a scent my kids love. It does a great job of cleaning their hair, and along with the conditioner leaves hair soft and untangled. I&#x27;ve heard the scent has an added benefit of repelling lice. With 3 kids in school, lice is a constant concern.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of shampoo over the years and wasted a lot of money.  I love the price and the fact it leaves my hair shiny and does a good job.</li>
            <li> the smell of some sort of pineapple fruit drink is overwhelming... the &amp;#34;tropical&amp;#34; definitely dominates the &amp;#34;coconut.&amp;#34; I was expecting coconut with a hint of something else, and got almost no coconut scent and a powerful candy fruit smell instead, hence the rating.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been trimming expenses and re-adjusting our family budget so I&#x27;ve been trying lower cost products. I purchased a bottle of Suave Naturals Tropical Coconut shampoo at a local low-cost department store to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised about how well the Suave shampoo cleaned my hair and left it shiny. Also, the shampoo was thick and I only needed a small amount to wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this shampoo as it is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I would say that this is a great shampoo for the price, but its actually an awesome shampoo for any price point.  This shampoo could be $7 and I would still say it was worth the price.  I have used a lot of shampoos in my day, from cheap drug store buys, to the high end drug store buys, to the expensive salon stuff, and for some reason, I always come back to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo smells good, but its not overwhelming, and your hair doesn&#x27;t really retain the smell after you have shampooed, so if you are looking to smell like the tropics all day, this will probably disappoint you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say my hair borders on the oily side, and I use the shampoo and the matching conditioner on the tips of my hair and it always comes out clean and manageable and ready for whatever styling I want.  Its no frills and thats the way I like it.  I also feel like after a month or two of using it my hair starts feeling progressively more healthy.  Its even been almost 3 months since my last haircut and I dont see any split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note, this is an ammonia based shampoo, so if you color your hair, it will most likely fade your color.  It could also dry your scalp if you have issues with dandruff.  But, if you have fairly normal to oily hair like me I have never had a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  If you want a good reliable no-frills shampoo this is it.  If you put a ton of styling product in your hair, this will give you a great base to work off of.  If you are looking to save money, this is a must buy (assuming you aren&#x27;t coloring your hair).</li>
