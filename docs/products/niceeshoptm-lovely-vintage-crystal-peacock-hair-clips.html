            <li>Very nice for the price.</li>
            <li>It was beautiful and eye catching.</li>
            <li>so when I put it up this makes my hair look good</li>
            <li>They are perfect to dress up hair for special occasions.</li>
            <li>This item is very pretty, nice color and material, I am very happy with it, I recomended it.</li>
            <li>but I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>Nice comb for dressing up your hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product : very pretty, great craftsmanship.</li>
            <li>Lovely Vintage Jewelry has nice hair pins I would recommend you give these a try</li>
            <li>Not bad, but not that good either.</li>
            <li>Beads very light in color.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have purchased more.</li>
            <li>but i wish it did its job better</li>
            <li>However, one side of the butterfly top was not secured to the pin when received.</li>
            <li>Overall everything about this product and seller is great.</li>
            <li>but it is beautiful, heavy, and top of the line hair comb.</li>
            <li>Such a great hair clip, very pretty.  </li>
            <li>This hair comb was so beautiful,Iwant wear this to some special occasions sometime.</li>
            <li>Looks as expected however, doesn&#x27;t do a great job of staying in my hair.</li>
            <li>This hair comb is so pretty!</li>
            <li>Very beautiful but to heavy for my fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Beautiful product at an unbelievable price.</li>
            <li>They just slide right out onto the floor.  </li>
            <li>Not as pretty as shown.</li>
            <li>The only con is that the comb can slide out of your hair easily if you turn your head quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller : I would order from this seller again.</li>
            <li>fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I would tell anyone who wants a comb to put in your hair for a night out</li>
            <li>I do think it is easily repaired with a little super glue though.</li>
            <li>They deserve a high star rating for that reason alone.  </li>
            <li>It is large enough to cover the largest bun.</li>
            <li>Packaged a little cheaply in just a plastic</li>
            <li>It is very pretty, however it was missing one of the stones.</li>
            <li>I really like these combs and wish that they would work in my hair, but unfortunately I have fine hair, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super heavy (which do cheap hair accessories I have bought are).</li>

            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> Must have hair that is on the thick side to hold product in place because it is quite large and heavy.</li>
            <li> the second one was missing a part that dangles from the hair pin.</li>
            <li> Grandgirlie loves butterflies and the extra long prongs held it in her thick curly hair for her dance recital.</li>
            <li> I love the look of them, but unfortunately they are not made for thin hair.  </li>
            <li> this thing is WAY too heavy to hold any hair up or back - I have really long and thick hair and it was too heavy for even MY hair!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> very heavy.</li>
            <li> Not happy it broke as soon as I took it out of the package.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that I cannot use them.  </li>

            <li> Smaller than I thought</li>
            <li> This hair comb was a big hit with the people that I gave them to as a gift. If you want  a gift for all ages, this is one that you should give. It was beautiful and eye catching. I wish I would have purchased more.</li>
            <li> This hair comb is so pretty! It&#x27;s made well. It&#x27;s not super heavy (which do cheap hair accessories I have bought are). It looks great in my hair and all 4 of my daughter&#x27;s. I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> Very nice for the price.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful but to heavy for my fine blonde hair. fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Looks as expected however, doesn&#x27;t do a great job of staying in my hair. Beautiful, but i wish it did its job better</li>
            <li> I bought a variety of Barrettes  with this Seller and this one is also beautiful. I haven&#x27;t use it yet but I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> This hair comb was so beautiful,Iwant wear this to some special occasions sometime.</li>
            <li> Not as pretty as shown. Beads very light in color. Not well made.</li>
            <li> Grandgirlie loves butterflies and the extra long prongs held it in her thick curly hair for her dance recital.</li>
            <li> This item is very pretty, nice color and material, I am very happy with it, I recomended it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> It is very pretty, however it was missing one of the stones.</li>
            <li> The color is a bit lighter then here but it is beautiful, heavy, and top of the line hair comb. I would tell anyone who wants a comb to put in your hair for a night out this is it. It is large enough to cover the largest bun. Lol. This is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but not that good either. A stone had fallen out in the package and it was not the color I ordered. The quality of the hair comb was only so so.</li>
            <li> Such a great hair clip, very pretty.  I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> very heavy. Ornaments fell.</li>
            <li> Shipping/packaging : Arrived on time. Packaged a little cheaply in just a plastic envelope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product : very pretty, great craftsmanship. I receive compliments every time I wear it. Must have hair that is on the thick side to hold product in place because it is quite large and heavy. The only con is that the comb can slide out of your hair easily if you turn your head quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller : I would order from this seller again. Beautiful product at an unbelievable price.</li>
            <li> These are very beautiful hair combs.  I love the look of them, but unfortunately they are not made for thin hair.  I cannot keep them in my hair as I don&#x27;t have enough thickness to hold them in. Every time I put them in my hair, they fall out.  They just slide right out onto the floor.  I really like these combs and wish that they would work in my hair, but unfortunately I have fine hair, so I was disappointed that I cannot use them.  I keep them because they are very beautiful.  They deserve a high star rating for that reason alone.  I took a star away because I can only look at them.</li>
            <li> Nice comb for dressing up your hair</li>
            <li> this thing is WAY too heavy to hold any hair up or back - I have really long and thick hair and it was too heavy for even MY hair! It&#x27;s pretty, but pretty much useless. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> was damaged when I received it. both edges of the flower had damaged</li>
            <li> Not happy it broke as soon as I took it out of the package. I will not be ordering nieceshop anymore this was the second hair pin I ordered from them and the second one was missing a part that dangles from the hair pin. Lovely Vintage Jewelry has nice hair pins I would recommend you give these a try I think you will like them.</li>
            <li> Some of the prettiest purples I have seen in a pin and much larger than I thought it would be. However, one side of the butterfly top was not secured to the pin when received. I do think it is easily repaired with a little super glue though.</li>
            <li> I have long hair so when I put it up this makes my hair look good</li>
            <li> Overall everything about this product and seller is great.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these beautiful combs which are embellished with purple stones.  They are perfect to dress up hair for special occasions.</li>
