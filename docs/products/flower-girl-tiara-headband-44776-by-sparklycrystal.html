            <li>so I was happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This was a great addition to the flower girl dresses in my brothers wedding.</li>
            <li>Should work out great.</li>
            <li>Very nice quality tiara,</li>
            <li>and if all goes well, I am sure it will be perfect for the intended use.  </li>
            <li>The good thing about this product is that it is kinda bendy...</li>
            <li>A good value.</li>
            <li>It came in a good box.</li>
            <li>They looked gorgeous in them, and the girls were thrilled to get them.</li>
            <li>They all looked adorable!  </li>
            <li>I bought two tiaras from Hobby Street and this one had a beautifully finished headband with smooth metal throughout.  </li>
            <li>The price was great, it is very pretty</li>
            <li>If you are buying this for your daughter or a child it might be a good fit.</li>
            <li>Very cheap and not well made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure.  </li>
            <li>We really liked how we could shape them to fit the girls heads.</li>
            <li>Glad I found them.</li>
            <li>It is cute.</li>
            <li>She was excited about the sparkles, but the rest of us were thrilled that it was a good quality headband that held up well and fit her comfortably.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty tiara with nice finishing touches.  </li>
            <li>This would work fine in a wedding.  </li>
            <li>The width is also perfect for little kids - noticeable sparkle without looking like Toddlers in Tiaras.  </li>
            <li>I was worried that this wouldn&#x27;t fit my daughter.</li>
            <li>which means we could manipulate the metal to fit both the oldest (9) and youngest (5) flowergirls.</li>
            <li>IF it fit my daughter, I would have given this a 5-star rating.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous headband....adjusted to my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s hairstyle as a flower girl and</li>
            <li>I am quite excited to see how it works out.</li>
            <li>Would also look nice and fit an adult sized head as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty but almost too flexible.</li>
            <li>Once receiving the headband it was indeed to big, however since this is a metal headband I was able to bend it to fit.</li>
            <li>My favorite came from another company website and was substantially more expensive so for the price this one is quite nice.</li>
            <li>The price and shipping was reasonable and quick.</li>
            <li>This product is very pretty but honestly is very flimsy.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>This is my second favorite out of the three that I selected from the web.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad she had it because it definitely worked out, but it just looked like she had on someone else&#x27;s tiara.</li>
            <li>I saw many other similar products that were selling for a lot more than this one</li>
            <li>Very fragile and bends easily.</li>
            <li>My daughter is 5, but she has a slightly large head (don&#x27;t judge me) and this tiara still looked like a halo on her.  </li>
            <li>but they are very bendy.</li>
            <li>It came fast.</li>
            <li>Better for a teen or an adult.</li>
            <li>They are also nice and sparkly-perfect for little girls!</li>
            <li>The shap is good but the quality is not good when i want to put on it on my hear easly broke realy</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The tiaras are light weight and slightly bendable</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant at first, but it is really pretty and compliments the dress well without being overbearing.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 2 of these tiaras for my twin 4 year old flower girls.</li>
            <li>so they will fit the girls and not be to heavy.</li>
            <li>I would say that it fits an adult, not a child.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 5 year old flower girl.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely a little bendy like other reviewers mentioned, which is helpful to fit to different sized heads without it being too tight, but also comes in handy if a little one is playing around with it - it won&#x27;t break, and is easy to bend back into shape to wear again.  </li>
            <li>It came a bit big and loose, but looks a bit bendy, so I am hoping we can bend it up to create the right size without breaking it.  </li>
            <li>Just the right size for a little girl.</li>
            <li>Its very pretty I must say but its too big for a little girl.</li>
            <li>I have to agree with the other reviewers, this tiara is quite large.  </li>
            <li>but I would say that it is a little large for a child.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little hard to keep in my 6-yr old daughters fine hair.  </li>

            <li> GIven that it goes on a little girls head, it could not withstand any of the wear.</li>
            <li> Did not fit that well.</li>
            <li> But sitting in my drawer for a few months it started to tarnish without even being worn.  </li>

            <li> Utterly disappointing.</li>

            <li> I bought the headband for my daughter who is a flowergirl in a wedding this summer.  I was a little hesitant at first, but it is really pretty and compliments the dress well without being overbearing.  It will add a bit of sparkle to her hair and look incredible I&#x27;m sure.  It came a bit big and loose, but looks a bit bendy, so I am hoping we can bend it up to create the right size without breaking it.  The price was great, it is very pretty and if all goes well, I am sure it will be perfect for the intended use.  I am quite excited to see how it works out.</li>
            <li> I bought the tiara headband for my daughters 1st Communion. Quality of the tiara is beautiful. The price and shipping was reasonable and quick. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I had FIVE flowergirls and bought them each one of these to wear in the wedding.  They all looked adorable!  The good thing about this product is that it is kinda bendy... which means we could manipulate the metal to fit both the oldest (9) and youngest (5) flowergirls. I saw many other similar products that were selling for a lot more than this one so I was happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This was a great addition to the flower girl dresses in my brothers wedding. We really liked how we could shape them to fit the girls heads.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality tiara, but I would say that it is a little large for a child. I was in the market for child-size tiara&#x27;s so purchased this one. I would say that it fits an adult, not a child. It can be carefully \\&quot;bent\\&quot; so that it is tighter. Other than that, it&#x27;s a medium quality (middle of the road, not too cheap, not too expensive). This would work fine in a wedding.  It does not have the little \\&quot;combs\\&quot; on the ends, so it&#x27;s a little hard to keep in my 6-yr old daughters fine hair.  A good value. IF it fit my daughter, I would have given this a 5-star rating.</li>
            <li> We got two of these for the flower girls in our daughter&#x27;s wedding. They looked gorgeous in them, and the girls were thrilled to get them.</li>
            <li> So I took this out of the wrapper to wrap this for my flower girl for my wedding on Sunday, and it literally fell apart in my hands. Very cheap and not well made. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Very pretty tiara with nice finishing touches.  I bought two tiaras from Hobby Street and this one had a beautifully finished headband with smooth metal throughout.  The other was really poorly finished with rough metal ends that I needed to file and finish off with clear nail polish.  This one is beautiful.  It sparkles and feel substantial.  This is my second favorite out of the three that I selected from the web.  My favorite came from another company website and was substantially more expensive so for the price this one is quite nice.</li>
            <li> Utterly disappointing. Very fragile and bends easily. GIven that it goes on a little girls head, it could not withstand any of the wear.</li>
            <li> I ordered this tiara for the flower girl in my wedding and was very pleased!  It arrived promptly, and it was beautiful!  I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Its very pretty I must say but its too big for a little girl. Did not fit that well. When I tried to squeeze it in it broke a bit! Its a bit fragile.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous headband....adjusted to my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s hairstyle as a flower girl and no pins were used to hold it in place.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty but almost too flexible. I&#x27;m on the fence as to whether I would order again.</li>
            <li> Quality of tiara was beautiful and looked perfect on my daughter in her pageant.  Although adjustable was slightly to big, had to use bobby pins to stabilize.  Would be helpful to make slightly smaller size of younger girls.</li>
            <li> The shap is good but the quality is not good when i want to put on it on my hear easly broke realy i am so upset due to this when  i spent my money</li>
            <li> Our flower girls are 4 and 2. The headbands are a little big for their heads but they are very bendy. Should work out great.</li>
            <li> These were beautiful on the flower girls at the wedding. Just the right size for a little girl. Glad I found them.</li>
            <li> It is cute. It is shinny. It came fast. It came in a good box. It looks perfect and just like the picture on the website.</li>
            <li> Better for a teen or an adult. It is pretty.  But sitting in my drawer for a few months it started to tarnish without even being worn.  Had to throw it out.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5 year old flower girl.  She was excited about the sparkles, but the rest of us were thrilled that it was a good quality headband that held up well and fit her comfortably.  It is definitely a little bendy like other reviewers mentioned, which is helpful to fit to different sized heads without it being too tight, but also comes in handy if a little one is playing around with it - it won&#x27;t break, and is easy to bend back into shape to wear again.

            <li> This product is very pretty but honestly is very flimsy. The size of it make me think that it is ment for a childs head. I wish I knew this before purchasing the product. If you are buying this for your daughter or a child it might be a good fit.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re actually very beautiful. serve their purpose for the two flower girls in my sister&#x27;s wedding.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the other reviewers, this tiara is quite large.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for a small child.  My daughter is 5, but she has a slightly large head (don&#x27;t judge me) and this tiara still looked like a halo on her.  I&#x27;m glad she had it because it definitely worked out, but it just looked like she had on someone else&#x27;s tiara.</li>
