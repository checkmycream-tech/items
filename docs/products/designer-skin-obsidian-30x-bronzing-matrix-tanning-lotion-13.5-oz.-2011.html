            <li>With this lotion I get a nice color with no redness.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling nice.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells nice and doesn&#x27;t stain your hands like some broonzers do.</li>
            <li>tan was a nice bronze color after just one session with Obsidian.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even need to use that much, also I have used many lotions that smell delicious before applying then make you smell like burnt popcorn afterwards.</li>
            <li>While I LOVE Luminary, I found that Obsidian gave me a nice tanning boost.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many tanning lotions and this is one of my favorites   </li>
            <li>I love the tingle in this lotion and the citrusy orange scent you gain from it.</li>
            <li>I love Obsidian and haven&#x27;t found anything like it.</li>
            <li>It continues to give me a more deeper and richer tan each time that I use it.  </li>
            <li>i have nothing more to say.</li>
            <li>sure beats the prices in the tanning salons.</li>
            <li>This product was absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li>This lotion works great, smells good and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>Wow - great value compared to in store purchase.</li>
            <li>It works fantastic, I love the outcome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned and tend to get red easily.</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviews in that this product gets VERY warm!!!!!  </li>
            <li>But, it still smelt OK just not my favorite (Luminary wins out for me in this department.)  </li>
            <li>its my first tanning lotion.it has kind of girly smell but seems to work well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten color as quickly as that before!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not to smelly (smells like a light peaches and cream?)</li>
            <li>would like to add that this seller was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>got here really fast as always, awesome product!!!!always a pleasure buying from you...looking forward to purchasing next bottle soon, thank you</li>
            <li>It does not warm at all, but I am still very happy with it.</li>
            <li>the warming sensation is light and comes in waves, but never gets too hot.  </li>
            <li>Her favorite lotion, smells nice, gives her a dark radiant tan</li>
            <li>Obsidian leaves a filmy, gross layer on top of my skin as if it isn&#x27;t soaking in that continues to peel off throughout the day (YUCK!).</li>
            <li>Its worth the money</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and has a little warm feeling and it seems to be just what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>One word of advice when applying to the face avoid your eye area and make sure to wash your hands, burns your eyes like no other and also wherever applied will tan.</li>
            <li>Product arrived faster than expected and is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of different lotions and this would be one of my top choices.</li>
            <li>First off, the product came sealed in plastic that looked like it had be done unprofessionally.</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more next tanning season (pre-vacation).</li>
            <li>It compares with Luminary on how soft and smooth that it leaves the skin after application.  </li>
            <li>I just love how now my tan is such a deep and rich color, with no negative effects.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad bottle or if this is one of those situations you always here about where the bottle has been tampered with, but whatever it was, this is not the product I hear so many great reviews about nor</li>
            <li>Also say that this is a \\&quot;warming\\&quot; lotion, not so much.</li>
            <li>this lotion goes on really well and is very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise it doesnt do much.  </li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>Not convinced it is the real deal...</li>
            <li>I really like that about Obsidian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very even tanning experience.  </li>
            <li>It works great as long as you have a good tan base to start with.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>

            <li> good bronzer gets a little tingly but not much made me dark dark in two visits</li>
            <li> It only lasted for me (warming action) about an hour (maybe less)  </li>
            <li> Also, I have used Luminary (a product by the same company) in the past and it left my skin feeling silky and soft.</li>
            <li> I think it may be a good product for building a base tan, but not for maintaining.</li>
            <li> I switched from Luminary to Obsidian, my tan actually ended up fading a little bit.</li>
            <li> On the down side they gave some sample lotion with it which had opened in the shipping process</li>
            <li> I started with Designer Skin products when I started indoor tanning (Black 20x) and now moved up to this product.  </li>
            <li> so I have little to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I have never used tanning lotion in the past however</li>
            <li> It was night and day over my past tanning lotions.  </li>
            <li> i use this almost exclusively on my legs, which are very hard for me to tan.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work and leaves an awful smell after using it...like mildew!  </li>
            <li> AWFUL...</li>
            <li> Nothing uncomfortable!!!!  </li>

            <li> this tanning lotion is amazing...great bronzer. I bought a sample at the salon to see if it worked well, I came out bronze and had to buy a bottle. Its worth the money</li>
            <li> Loved this product, the smell is great does not give you that tanning bed smell so you can use it on your lunch hour and it not be too obvious. It does not warm at all, but I am still very happy with it.</li>

            <li> Love the lotion! Came all sealed up in the plastic and everything. On the down side they gave some sample lotion with it which had opened in the shipping process I&#x27;m guessing but it was all over my bottle which made me so thankful it was still sealed.</li>
            <li> It works fantastic, I love the outcome. I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of this item and I thank you!!</li>

            <li> Not convinced it is the real deal...it doesn&#x27;t work and leaves an awful smell after using it...like mildew!  I asked for a refund and never recieved one! AWFUL...WILL NEVER BUY PRODUCT AGAIN ON AMAZON!</li>
            <li> This lotion works great, smells good and lasts a long time! If you&#x27;re looking to get a good tan, try this one out.</li>
            <li> First off, the product came sealed in plastic that looked like it had be done unprofessionally. I opened and used it thinking it probably got messed up in shipping. However, when I use the product, I never feel the warming sensation that the product claims to produce. Also, I have used Luminary (a product by the same company) in the past and it left my skin feeling silky and soft. Obsidian leaves a filmy, gross layer on top of my skin as if it isn&#x27;t soaking in that continues to peel off throughout the day (YUCK!). I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad bottle or if this is one of those situations you always here about where the bottle has been tampered with, but whatever it was, this is not the product I hear so many great reviews about nor does it feel like something produced by designer skin!</li>
            <li> Always looking for good lotions and i have used this 3 times and can honestly say I can see the difference.  It goes on easy and has a little warm feeling and it seems to be just what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> I started with Designer Skin products when I started indoor tanning (Black 20x) and now moved up to this product.  I just love how now my tan is such a deep and rich color, with no negative effects.  It also leaves my skin well moisturized and when I leave the tanning salon, the wonderful smell is still there.  It continues to give me a more deeper and richer tan each time that I use it.  I have bought several bottles and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> It is the way to go!!!!  Great bronzing lotion; no offensive smell; outstanding price.  Will be purchasing more next tanning season (pre-vacation).</li>
            <li> its my first tanning lotion.it has kind of girly smell but seems to work well. i have nothing more to say.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve had.  I highly recommend it.  It was night and day over my past tanning lotions.  I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion and have use it for 2 years!  It makes your tan darker and it leaves a lotion after you tan.&lt;br /&gt;Happy tanning</li>
            <li> I was impressed with this product. I have been using DS Luminary for some time now and felt it was time for a change.  While I LOVE Luminary, I found that Obsidian gave me a nice tanning boost.  It compares with Luminary on how soft and smooth that it leaves the skin after application.  I agree with the other reviews in that this product gets VERY warm!!!!!  It only lasted for me (warming action) about an hour (maybe less)  Nothing uncomfortable!!!!  I would describe the smell of Obsidian as \\&quot;grapefruity\\&quot; which I wasn&#x27;t that fond of.  But, it still smelt OK just not my favorite (Luminary wins out for me in this department.)  There is no after tan smell at all.  I really like that about Obsidian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tan was a nice bronze color after just one session with Obsidian.  No gold or yellow hue. My hands did not stain and there was no streaking at all.  Very even tanning experience.  I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to add that this seller was fantastic.  I received my product in 48 hours and packing was great (bottle was sealed.)  No complaints with this seller!  Buying here sure beats the prices in the tanning salons.</li>
            <li> This product was absolutely fantastic! I&#x27;ve never gotten color as quickly as that before! I would suggest it to anyone!</li>
