            <li>Super good brush.  </li>
            <li>but this one is much more gentle and is great for getting out tangles.</li>
            <li>I have a favorite paddle brush, so I decided to try this one for our pool bag.</li>
            <li>We love this brush, and I will be ordering another</li>
            <li>I read reviews about how this brush works better than any people had ever tried before</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how much I enjoyed it...</li>
            <li>I have never been more pleased with a hairbrush.</li>
            <li>Also, it makes my hair so smooth!</li>
            <li>This brush is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>EXACTLY what I was expecting, this brush is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I was told to order this brush by a salesperson at a famous beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>and I love this hairbrush.</li>
            <li>It seems to magically dissolve tangles.</li>
            <li>WASNT SURE ABOUT THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>All my friends and family love it</li>
            <li>I am very happy I did as it will be my only hair brush going forward.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now my favorite brush.</li>
            <li>Great brush...makes my hair so soft and smooth love it adds shine to my hairs also love it!</li>
            <li>that Amazon makes returns so easy.</li>
            <li>I bought a few more for fellow tangle sufferers and they were impressed.</li>
            <li>so it is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and gets the tangles out so easily.</li>
            <li>My friend recommended this brush to me as I have fine hair that tangles easily...</li>
            <li>a 2nd one and it seemed to work beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I have really fine hair</li>
            <li>its keep wig hair smooth and clean and easy to bursh again and again and again.</li>
            <li>It just feels so smooth and leaves my hair silky.</li>
            <li>She wants to get one of her own.</li>
            <li>B DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>I can even use it while blowdrying my hair if I make sure that the bristles dont get too hot and melt.</li>
            <li>Now I never have to clean out this brush</li>
            <li>Works great on dry hair too!</li>
            <li>Does not tug or get tangled in wet hair and feels great on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I use the cool setting on my dryer if I use it</li>
            <li>I really hope the company finds a way to make it better</li>
            <li>I love it so much &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>The rumors are true</li>
            <li>It did a great job in detangling her hair with very minimal hair loss.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s by far the best I&#x27;ve found out of other competing brushes...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was really excited by the other reviews and glad it works for most.  </li>
            <li>to my waist to be exact!</li>
            <li>This brush rarely pulls at her hair and can get out any knot with ease.</li>
            <li>Now when I brush my hair, I spray Argan oil on the brush and it glides right through my hair with no tangles.</li>
            <li>I like to use it in the shower when I have conditioner in my hair and the tangles fall right out.</li>
            <li>RIGHT</li>
            <li>Wet or dry works just perfect.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair out really long for a while now, and have been moderately successful however every time I would brush my hair (with my old brush)</li>
            <li>The price is super economic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely painless and easy.</li>
            <li>cause Id be willing to give it a send chance</li>
            <li>The first two mornings I used it with &#x27;out of bed hair&#x27;</li>
            <li>Now that my hair falls almost to my lower back, I&#x27;ve started having a problem losing a lot more hair than I would like to tangle battles.</li>
            <li>I am hoping that it is durable and holds up for a while, but I&#x27;m definitely buying more in case</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use extra conditioner to be able to comb his hair anymore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent hours untangling my own hair-</li>
            <li>To my surprise, this brush is actually made of magic.</li>
            <li>Really does work!</li>
            <li>First brush that didn&#x27;t hurt my hair.  </li>
            <li>Super gentle brush, I really like this.</li>
            <li>We gave this brush a try and, while I&#x27;m not exactly sure why it works so much better than any brush we&#x27;ve ever tried, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>so I love that this brush came with vents in the back to keep it from retaining too much water.</li>
            <li>Well, on the first try, WITHOUT sprays or serums IT REALLY WORKED.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>then a large tooth detangler comb</li>
            <li>It is a large paddle brush so it covers lots of hair.  </li>
            <li>Never had a brush that my wet hair likes better than this one.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to them...</li>
            <li>how much easier/ faster it made blow drying my hair in the morning.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy.</li>
            <li>My baby boy had really curly hair and this comb is a lifesaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the wide toothed combs and many brushes.</li>
            <li>For some reason the oval shaped Wet Brushes work much better than this paddle brush.</li>
            <li>This has been a very reliable brush.</li>
            <li>Whoever designed this brush is absolutely brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That being said, this brush is able to get through the tangles of my wet curly hair with zero problems.</li>
            <li>Does not pull so much hair out.  </li>
            <li>This really helps &amp; no tangles.</li>
            <li>This brush really does work</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price since it&#x27;s cheaper than the original price on the actual site and worth the same!</li>
            <li>i have long hair that gets tangled easily esp after a shower.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it works better than others as it looks like all the other paddle brushes on the market</li>
            <li>I ordered two more, one for her sis and the other for my sis.</li>
            <li>Love this brush and wouldn&#x27;t use any other one.</li>
            <li>and she loves it more than any other brush</li>
            <li>These work best in DRY hair or half dry hair.</li>
            <li>Then I use my bass s shape bamboo  brush mostly for scalp invigoration.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good trying to brush through my thick 4a/4b type hair but not well enough to get to the roots for my hair type.</li>
            <li>I highly endorse this product.  </li>
            <li>This brush has saved my headaches and I highly recommend if you have knots issues, tangles, etc.</li>
            <li>not as gentle as the original wet brush&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
            <li>When you get it you would think &amp;#34;this thing will never work&amp;#34; but WOW!!  </li>
            <li>Myself and my 8 year old have long fine hair.</li>
            <li>I found wet or dry, your head will be glad you purchased this brush!  </li>
            <li>It seems just like a normal paddle brush that I used to use</li>
            <li>It has a normal handle</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft.</li>
            <li>both mine and her were very soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>the bristles aren&#x27;t as stiff as the ones on my old paddle brush - def more flexible.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used it daily for exactly a year now</li>
            <li>Only con is the horrid off gassing when I first bought it.</li>
            <li>Wow wish I always used this brush!</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have long, fine hair that is constantly tangled.</li>
            <li>My hair is just the toughest hair - wavy- curly and fine, breaks so easily and knots even worse!</li>
            <li>I love this for my hair and my daughters thin, fine, long hair.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not super effective on wet hair.</li>
            <li>It is a good brush for wet hair, but only for the bottom half of hair.  </li>
            <li>, however, I did completely clear out a spot for it to prevent this.</li>
            <li>I love that this wet brush can brush wet hair without damaging it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a week now and there are hairs in the brush but not even close to the amount there would be in my old brush.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t even explain how soft it makes my hair.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair feeing soft.</li>
            <li>There used to be so much matted hair in my brushes on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>My old brush would just tug at my knots and It would take me awhile to get them out.</li>
            <li>We tried it on my young daughter and she loves it too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost miraculous - apply this brush lightly to your towel dried air and the tangles just fall away.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, curly hair so brushing my hair has been out of the question for a very long time due to breakage.</li>
            <li>I am very stoked about this brush and would recommend it to anyone with medium to long hair.</li>
            <li>What used to take a long time and sometimes reduced my daughter to tears can now be accomplished in under a minute with no pain, no stuck bristles, no forcing our way through the knots--</li>
            <li>I love my oval wet brushes from the same company and use the &amp;#34;Lil&#x27; Wet Brush&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have fine thin straight hair</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a reasonable brush on dry hair.</li>
            <li>Everyone must own especially little girls!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This worked for everyone...long thick hair to my niece&#x27;s fine blond curls.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old hates to have her curly hair brushed.</li>
            <li>This brush barely pulls out hair, if any at all.</li>
            <li>this is the first brush i&#x27;ve used that actually doesn&#x27;t snag and pull out a bunch of hair when my hair is still wet from shower.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased The wet round head brush a while back, it worked ok, but</li>
            <li>I took a star down because the bristols will melt if you put a hot blow dryer on them for a period of time.</li>
            <li>would def rec this brush to anyone that needs a brush that gently detangles - would be great for kids (maybe the regular size brush) who hate getting their hair brushed because of the pulling etc.</li>
            <li>First thing&#x27;s first, I have very long, thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li>This brush brushes right past tangles with ease.</li>

            <li> Super good brush.  </li>
            <li> but this one is much more gentle and is great for getting out tangles.</li>
            <li> I have a favorite paddle brush, so I decided to try this one for our pool bag.</li>
            <li> We love this brush, and I will be ordering another</li>
            <li> I read reviews about how this brush works better than any people had ever tried before</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how much I enjoyed it...</li>
            <li> I have never been more pleased with a hairbrush.</li>
            <li> Also, it makes my hair so smooth!</li>
            <li> This brush is fabulous!  </li>
            <li> EXACTLY what I was expecting, this brush is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  </li>
            <li> I was told to order this brush by a salesperson at a famous beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> and I love this hairbrush.</li>
            <li> It seems to magically dissolve tangles.</li>
            <li> WASNT SURE ABOUT THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> All my friends and family love it</li>
            <li> I am very happy I did as it will be my only hair brush going forward.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now my favorite brush.</li>
            <li> Great brush...makes my hair so soft and smooth love it adds shine to my hairs also love it!</li>
            <li> that Amazon makes returns so easy.</li>
            <li> I bought a few more for fellow tangle sufferers and they were impressed.</li>
            <li> so it is easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and gets the tangles out so easily.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this brush to me as I have fine hair that tangles easily...</li>
            <li> a 2nd one and it seemed to work beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I have really fine hair</li>
            <li> its keep wig hair smooth and clean and easy to bursh again and again and again.</li>
            <li> It just feels so smooth and leaves my hair silky.</li>
            <li> She wants to get one of her own.</li>
            <li> B DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> I can even use it while blowdrying my hair if I make sure that the bristles dont get too hot and melt.</li>
            <li> Now I never have to clean out this brush</li>
            <li> Works great on dry hair too!</li>
            <li> Does not tug or get tangled in wet hair and feels great on the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I use the cool setting on my dryer if I use it</li>
            <li> I really hope the company finds a way to make it better</li>
            <li> I love it so much &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> The rumors are true</li>
            <li> It did a great job in detangling her hair with very minimal hair loss.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s by far the best I&#x27;ve found out of other competing brushes...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was really excited by the other reviews and glad it works for most.  </li>
            <li> to my waist to be exact!</li>
            <li> This brush rarely pulls at her hair and can get out any knot with ease.</li>
            <li> Now when I brush my hair, I spray Argan oil on the brush and it glides right through my hair with no tangles.</li>
            <li> I like to use it in the shower when I have conditioner in my hair and the tangles fall right out.</li>
            <li> RIGHT</li>
            <li> Wet or dry works just perfect.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair out really long for a while now, and have been moderately successful however every time I would brush my hair (with my old brush)</li>
            <li> The price is super economic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely painless and easy.</li>
            <li> cause Id be willing to give it a send chance</li>
            <li> The first two mornings I used it with &#x27;out of bed hair&#x27;</li>
            <li> Now that my hair falls almost to my lower back, I&#x27;ve started having a problem losing a lot more hair than I would like to tangle battles.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that it is durable and holds up for a while, but I&#x27;m definitely buying more in case</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use extra conditioner to be able to comb his hair anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hours untangling my own hair-</li>
            <li> To my surprise, this brush is actually made of magic.</li>
            <li> Really does work!</li>
            <li> First brush that didn&#x27;t hurt my hair.  </li>
            <li> Super gentle brush, I really like this.</li>
            <li> We gave this brush a try and, while I&#x27;m not exactly sure why it works so much better than any brush we&#x27;ve ever tried, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li> so I love that this brush came with vents in the back to keep it from retaining too much water.</li>
            <li> Well, on the first try, WITHOUT sprays or serums IT REALLY WORKED.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> then a large tooth detangler comb</li>
            <li> It is a large paddle brush so it covers lots of hair.  </li>
            <li> Never had a brush that my wet hair likes better than this one.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to them...</li>
            <li> how much easier/ faster it made blow drying my hair in the morning.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy.</li>
            <li> My baby boy had really curly hair and this comb is a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the wide toothed combs and many brushes.</li>
            <li> For some reason the oval shaped Wet Brushes work much better than this paddle brush.</li>
            <li> This has been a very reliable brush.</li>
            <li> Whoever designed this brush is absolutely brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That being said, this brush is able to get through the tangles of my wet curly hair with zero problems.</li>
            <li> Does not pull so much hair out.  </li>
            <li> This really helps &amp; no tangles.</li>
            <li> This brush really does work</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the price since it&#x27;s cheaper than the original price on the actual site and worth the same!</li>
            <li> i have long hair that gets tangled easily esp after a shower.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it works better than others as it looks like all the other paddle brushes on the market</li>
            <li> I ordered two more, one for her sis and the other for my sis.</li>
            <li> Love this brush and wouldn&#x27;t use any other one.</li>
            <li> and she loves it more than any other brush</li>
            <li> These work best in DRY hair or half dry hair.</li>
            <li> Then I use my bass s shape bamboo  brush mostly for scalp invigoration.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good trying to brush through my thick 4a/4b type hair but not well enough to get to the roots for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I highly endorse this product.  </li>
            <li> This brush has saved my headaches and I highly recommend if you have knots issues, tangles, etc.</li>
            <li> not as gentle as the original wet brush&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
            <li> When you get it you would think &amp;#34;this thing will never work&amp;#34; but WOW!!  </li>
            <li> Myself and my 8 year old have long fine hair.</li>
            <li> I found wet or dry, your head will be glad you purchased this brush!  </li>
            <li> It seems just like a normal paddle brush that I used to use</li>
            <li> It has a normal handle</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft.</li>
            <li> both mine and her were very soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> the bristles aren&#x27;t as stiff as the ones on my old paddle brush - def more flexible.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used it daily for exactly a year now</li>
            <li> Only con is the horrid off gassing when I first bought it.</li>
            <li> Wow wish I always used this brush!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have long, fine hair that is constantly tangled.</li>
            <li> My hair is just the toughest hair - wavy- curly and fine, breaks so easily and knots even worse!</li>
            <li> I love this for my hair and my daughters thin, fine, long hair.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not super effective on wet hair.</li>
            <li> It is a good brush for wet hair, but only for the bottom half of hair.  </li>
            <li> , however, I did completely clear out a spot for it to prevent this.</li>
            <li> I love that this wet brush can brush wet hair without damaging it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a week now and there are hairs in the brush but not even close to the amount there would be in my old brush.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t even explain how soft it makes my hair.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair feeing soft.</li>
            <li> There used to be so much matted hair in my brushes on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> My old brush would just tug at my knots and It would take me awhile to get them out.</li>
            <li> We tried it on my young daughter and she loves it too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost miraculous - apply this brush lightly to your towel dried air and the tangles just fall away.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair so brushing my hair has been out of the question for a very long time due to breakage.</li>
            <li> I am very stoked about this brush and would recommend it to anyone with medium to long hair.</li>
            <li> What used to take a long time and sometimes reduced my daughter to tears can now be accomplished in under a minute with no pain, no stuck bristles, no forcing our way through the knots--</li>
            <li> I love my oval wet brushes from the same company and use the &amp;#34;Lil&#x27; Wet Brush&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have fine thin straight hair</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a reasonable brush on dry hair.</li>
            <li> Everyone must own especially little girls!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This worked for everyone...long thick hair to my niece&#x27;s fine blond curls.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old hates to have her curly hair brushed.</li>
            <li> This brush barely pulls out hair, if any at all.</li>
            <li> this is the first brush i&#x27;ve used that actually doesn&#x27;t snag and pull out a bunch of hair when my hair is still wet from shower.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased The wet round head brush a while back, it worked ok, but</li>
            <li> I took a star down because the bristols will melt if you put a hot blow dryer on them for a period of time.</li>
            <li> would def rec this brush to anyone that needs a brush that gently detangles - would be great for kids (maybe the regular size brush) who hate getting their hair brushed because of the pulling etc.</li>
            <li> First thing&#x27;s first, I have very long, thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li> This brush brushes right past tangles with ease.</li>
            <li> Really works on my long hair, wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I can barely comb my hair when they are dry.</li>
            <li> The bristles are extremely flexible, but will go back to natural form if the bristles get bent or smashed.</li>
            <li> The first one arrived with the outer rows of the bristles pushed down and out due to the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure if it would work when I received it, because it looked like any normal brush.</li>
            <li> I bought The Wet Brush squirt and Metallics purple brush, for myself and my poor niece that shares in the same fine, tangly hair type.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a well made brush that will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The Wet Brush&amp;#34; seems to be more expensive.</li>
            <li> The description of this brush states it is &amp;#34;The Wet Brush&amp;#34; but the actual brush only says &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The wet brush detangles wet hair like no other brush</li>
            <li> I have three daughters with LONG hair, and my hair is also long....</li>
            <li> It works especially well on wet hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have long hair</li>
            <li> I could actually brush my hair while it was wet and not damage it.</li>
            <li> It is the ONLY brush that I use now on wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> or you can use it on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Bristles melted and bent when I tried to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is down to her hips and its such a pain to brush her hair.</li>
            <li> The bristles along the entire bottom half of the brush had sunk into their holes...</li>
            <li> No hair is splitting, or pulling when I brush through either wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I have long and damaged hair due to bleaching.</li>
            <li> Glides through wet hair or dry!</li>
            <li> Its not a normal brush!</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was that the bristle was a little bent</li>
            <li> It can not touch my scalp when hair are wet in the shower.  </li>
            <li> You can get &amp;#34;the wet brush&amp;#34; at target, I believe.</li>
            <li> I doubted this would go through my wet tangles...</li>
            <li> I always used sprays, serums and leave-in conditioners to lessen the pain and hair loss from getting the tangles out of my wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have been in tears trying to comb my wet hair before.</li>
            <li> Wet hair, no problem.  </li>
            <li> I got the wet comb and this wet brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wet brush.</li>
            <li> they also purchased the wet brush.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go through wet hair when brush is pushed along the head because the bristles are too flexible.  </li>
            <li> The Wet Brush has been a hair brushing saver.</li>
            <li> then i read the reviews and expected it to be an alright brush for the price.</li>
            <li> No snags with wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have a long curly hair and very thin so get tangle very easily, i get tired of using brushes from target etc.</li>
            <li> Several of the bristles have fallen out and almost half of the others are bent or pushed down.</li>
            <li> Since using this brush my hair, ( I am a black female), which is kinky and hard to comb at times, is actually growing.</li>
            <li> It slides through your hair as if nothing is there and leaves my hair without frizz unlike every other brush I have tried.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other brush.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine bringing any other brush into my life-</li>
            <li> I am not sure if that makes an actual difference, but it appears to in looking at other products.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why this works so differently, bu it glides thru my hair.</li>
            <li> I also tried brushing my little sisters hair , which is always a giant rats nest, and usually she cries and freaks out</li>
            <li> Made my hair silkier and smoother and looks less damged now because it dosnt rip out my hair.</li>
            <li> I lose much less hair to brushing, and removing tangles doesn&#x27;t feel like a losing battle anymore.</li>
            <li> I still like it because it gets through my hair with less pain</li>
            <li> It was supposed to be black.</li>
            <li> and I typically avoid brushing it at all costs.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair that has a slight wave to it.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair</li>
            <li> little niece and daughter up at the lake house for a girls&#x27; weekend.  </li>
            <li> I looked at other detangling brushes but they were small and had no handles.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money here.</li>
            <li> and I have really thick hair and this brush eases through wet hair with pulling or tearing.  </li>
            <li> Its not an everyday brush.</li>
            <li> They caused my crying daughter to stop crying</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and it brushes it without any problem, rats too!  </li>
            <li> No more crying.</li>
            <li> I got a couple of them, small and round for my daughter</li>
            <li> Somehow it has decreased my blow dry time as  well.</li>
            <li> While ALL the other brushes I have ever use cause tears, this one doesn&#x27;t!!!</li>
            <li> No more ripping apart stubborn knots and no more guilt and worry over resulting split ends.</li>
            <li> It feels really soft in your hair and gets all of your knots out without tugging and pulling your hair which I desperate needed.</li>
            <li> No more fighting no more tears...</li>
            <li> to blow-dry it with :/</li>
            <li> I have several expensive brushes but this brush has become my stand by now</li>
            <li> cause there is hardly any hair in it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so hard to get through.  </li>
            <li> I thought the way she was raving about it, it had to at least help ease my tangle troubles.</li>
            <li> I have thick and curly/wavy</li>
            <li> hair- no more pain!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as I have always had extremely tangled hair and have to use tons of conditioner to get knots out.</li>
            <li> This, to me, is a little annoying because I like ALL of my hair brushed.  </li>
            <li> it also worked on my 4 year old niece, who hate to get her hair washed because it tangled and pulled.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I have very very thick curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my daughter who has thin, damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this in an effort to grow my thin, brittle hair longer without abusing it.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Which was kinda weird when I got it.</li>
            <li> No bristles have fallen out or twisted and bent at all.</li>
            <li> wondering where I&#x27;ve gone wrong?</li>
            <li> (My 8-yr-old is awful about brushing her hair, but insists on keeping it long.)</li>
            <li> I was shocked this brush worked so well and still am confused as to how.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disappointing that I can&#x27;t hang it, but not a deal breaker.  </li>
            <li> I used to hate washing my hair for the fear of the post shower brush session.</li>
            <li> a very bad industrial plastic smell</li>
            <li> Seriously, it&#x27;s insane.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I LOVE this brush! I bought one for myself and all my family members and they love it too! It seems just like a normal paddle brush that I used to use but this one is much more gentle and is great for getting out tangles. It is the ONLY brush that I use now on wet and dry hair. I can even use it while blowdrying my hair if I make sure that the bristles dont get too hot and melt.</li>
            <li> Great brush...makes my hair so soft and smooth love it adds shine to my hairs also love it!</li>
            <li> Super good brush.  Does not tug or get tangled in wet hair and feels great on the scalp.  Never had a brush that my wet hair likes better than this one.  It seems to be a well made brush that will last a long time.  Would buy this brush again.</li>
            <li> Myself and my 8 year old have long fine hair. We both swim 3x a week and needed something that is not damaging . I had purchased The wet round head brush a while back, it worked ok, but not that well. I have a favorite paddle brush, so I decided to try this one for our pool bag. We love this brush, and I will be ordering another so I can have my own. I took a star down because the bristols will melt if you put a hot blow dryer on them for a period of time. I use the cool setting on my dryer if I use it and it does great, just takes longer obviously.</li>
            <li> Made my hair silkier and smoother and looks less damged now because it dosnt rip out my hair. Recommend it.</li>
            <li> best detangling brush I have owned, makes it a painless process.</li>
            <li> I read reviews about how this brush works better than any people had ever tried before but I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to them... I just wanted my own brush as my hair is getting longer. I received the brush today and was literally blown away. It is crazy but this brush is one of a kind. It slides through your hair as if nothing is there and leaves my hair without frizz unlike every other brush I have tried. I don&#x27;t know why it works better than others as it looks like all the other paddle brushes on the market but this is definitely the brush to buy.</li>
            <li> The first one arrived with the outer rows of the bristles pushed down and out due to the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got a 2nd one and it seemed to work beautifully.  Once I was done brushing my hair without any pulling I looked at the brush and all the bristles were bent in every direction.  I guess it didn&#x27;t pull since the bristles weren&#x27;t even going through my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited by the other reviews and glad it works for most.  I&#x27;m still hunting for the answer to the great brush debate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that Amazon makes returns so easy.</li>
            <li> Does what it says amazing really love it:)</li>
            <li> I can barely comb my hair when they are dry. It can not touch my scalp when hair are wet in the shower.  Otherwise, they are well made, gental and flexible.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this brush to me as I have fine hair that tangles easily... I read the reviews and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I was instantly amazed by how well it worked and how much easier/ faster it made blow drying my hair in the morning. I never looked forward to doing my hair in the morning that&#x27;s how much I enjoyed it... However... A while after using it I noticed it wasn&#x27;t brushing as well. The bristles along the entire bottom half of the brush had sunk into their holes... I found myself pulling the bristles up every 2 seconds... It was a great brush at first and it&#x27;s by far the best I&#x27;ve found out of other competing brushes... I really hope the company finds a way to make it better cause Id be willing to give it a send chance</li>
            <li> My 3 year old hates to have her curly hair brushed. This brush rarely pulls at her hair and can get out any knot with ease. She never complains and never runs from this brush. It isn&#x27;t for scalp stimulation, solely for tangles. Get it</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my daughter who has thin, damaged hair.  It did a great job in detangling her hair with very minimal hair loss. I ordered two more, one for her sis and the other for my sis.</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair and before I got this, after swimming I would be breaking tiny knots out of my hair.  Now when I brush my hair, I spray Argan oil on the brush and it glides right through my hair with no tangles. This is the most excited I have ever been about a brush!!</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best hairbrush ever. I have never been more pleased with a hairbrush. It is like magic!</li>
            <li> OH. MY. GOD. This brush is AMAZING. I will never use any other brush. I have fine thin straight hair and I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair out really long for a while now, and have been moderately successful however every time I would brush my hair (with my old brush) I was pulling out tons of hair from the ROOT, which impedes the growing process. This brush barely pulls out hair, if any at all. The first two mornings I used it with &#x27;out of bed hair&#x27; it pulled NO hairs out. It&#x27;s been a week now and there are hairs in the brush but not even close to the amount there would be in my old brush. Also, it makes my hair so smooth! I don&#x27;t know if the bristles are infused with something but I can&#x27;t even explain how soft it makes my hair. The bristles are extremely flexible, but will go back to natural form if the bristles get bent or smashed. I am very stoked about this brush and would recommend it to anyone with medium to long hair. (:</li>
            <li> Fave brush ever!!!!!! Doesn&#x27;t pull out your hair!!! ❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair so brushing my hair has been out of the question for a very long time due to breakage. The most I&#x27;d been doing was finger combing in the shower, which works great when my hair is about shoulder length. Now that my hair falls almost to my lower back, I&#x27;ve started having a problem losing a lot more hair than I would like to tangle battles. I talked to my stylist about it and she suggested this brush. It works great. I lose much less hair to brushing, and removing tangles doesn&#x27;t feel like a losing battle anymore. No more ripping apart stubborn knots and no more guilt and worry over resulting split ends. I still don&#x27;t brush my hair outside of the shower so I love that this brush came with vents in the back to keep it from retaining too much water. The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is the handle didn&#x27;t have a hole as displayed. No matter where I store it in my shower, there&#x27;s always something causing some bristles to bend. It&#x27;s disappointing that I can&#x27;t hang it, but not a deal breaker.  UPDATE: It&#x27;s five months after having bought this product. Several of the bristles have fallen out and almost half of the others are bent or pushed down. I had mentioned that wherever I place it in my shower, the bristles bend, however, I did completely clear out a spot for it to prevent this. Don&#x27;t mistake that for the reason it&#x27;s falling apart; that&#x27;s happening just from brushing. Product does not last and, as it turns out, is a knock off. You can get &amp;#34;the wet brush&amp;#34; at target, I believe. Don&#x27;t waste your money here.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush. I love that this wet brush can brush wet hair without damaging it. I&#x27;ll always buy this brush again and again.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good trying to brush through my thick 4a/4b type hair but not well enough to get to the roots for my hair type. I still like it because it gets through my hair with less pain then a large tooth detangler comb so it is a keeper on my list.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush, makes my hair softer after brushing.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy. It couldn&#x27;t get thru my hair! Even after lots of Leave-in conditioner it couldn&#x27;t do the job. Sorry</li>
            <li> This is a great brush.... But they didn&#x27;t tell me that the brush would be blue. It was supposed to be black. Which was kinda weird when I got it. 😔</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have long, fine hair that is constantly tangled. Our stylist suggested this brush for us after we shared with her our hair brushing horror stories. (My 8-yr-old is awful about brushing her hair, but insists on keeping it long.) We gave this brush a try and, while I&#x27;m not exactly sure why it works so much better than any brush we&#x27;ve ever tried, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  What used to take a long time and sometimes reduced my daughter to tears can now be accomplished in under a minute with no pain, no stuck bristles, no forcing our way through the knots-- it just brushes through like there are no knots at all. I am hoping that it is durable and holds up for a while, but I&#x27;m definitely buying more in case this company doesn&#x27;t last and they stop selling them.  I love, love, love this thing!</li>
            <li> It does wonders untangling my hair.</li>
            <li> Super gentle brush, I really like this.</li>
            <li> I purchased based a recommendation from a friend and I had amazon gift cards to use.  I found wet or dry, your head will be glad you purchased this brush!  I no longer need detangler or extra conditioner as the flexibility and softness of this brush handles any tangle with ease.</li>
            <li> its keep wig hair smooth and clean and easy to bursh again and again and again. if you wear it or with your hand.</li>
            <li> My baby boy had really curly hair and this comb is a lifesaver. I don&#x27;t have to use extra conditioner to be able to comb his hair anymore.</li>
            <li> I doubted this would go through my wet tangles...but I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve tried the wide toothed combs and many brushes. I always used sprays, serums and leave-in conditioners to lessen the pain and hair loss from getting the tangles out of my wet hair. I dreaded washing it and would put it off. Well, on the first try, WITHOUT sprays or serums IT REALLY WORKED. I bought a few more for fellow tangle sufferers and they were impressed.I highly.recommended.  :-D</li>
            <li> this hair brush is amazing. I love it so much &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Love it! Keeps my hair feeing soft. Detangles my hair without pulling on it. Buying one for my mom she likes it too.</li>
            <li> For some reason the oval shaped Wet Brushes work much better than this paddle brush. I love my oval wet brushes from the same company and use the &amp;#34;Lil&#x27; Wet Brush&amp;#34; compact size whenever I travel.</li>
            <li> I have three daughters with LONG hair, and my hair is also long....to my waist to be exact! After countless conditioners and products to try to make brushing easier, I came across this product.  I have to say it was one of the best purchases I have ever made.  It works great!!! You can use it while in the bath with conditioner or you can use it on dry hair.  While ALL the other brushes I have ever use cause tears, this one doesn&#x27;t!!!</li>
            <li> I have been in tears trying to comb my wet hair before. I was shocked this brush worked so well and still am confused as to how. All I know is that I will never be without one.</li>
            <li> This brush is fabulous!  I have long thick hair and it brushes it without any problem, rats too!  Wet hair, no problem.  So happy with this purchase, I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> EXACTLY what I was expecting, this brush is AMAZING! It feels really soft in your hair and gets all of your knots out without tugging and pulling your hair which I desperate needed. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price since it&#x27;s cheaper than the original price on the actual site and worth the same!</li>
            <li> This has been a very reliable brush. I like to use it in the shower when I have conditioner in my hair and the tangles fall right out. My wife and daughter also share this brush. We&#x27;ve used it daily for exactly a year now and it&#x27;s in almost perfect condition. No bristles have fallen out or twisted and bent at all. Best of all my 6 YO daughter is tears free....</li>
            <li> Whoever designed this brush is absolutely brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter and I have really thick hair and this brush eases through wet hair with pulling or tearing.  Recently, I had my mom, sister, little niece and daughter up at the lake house for a girls&#x27; weekend.  Everyone tried this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister couldn&#x27;t believe it...her 2-yr old didn&#x27;t fuss at all while getting her wet hair brushed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This worked for everyone...long thick hair to my niece&#x27;s fine blond curls.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  I got the wet comb and this wet brush and they are just perfect!  There used to be so much matted hair in my brushes on a regular basis.  Now I never have to clean out this brush cause there is hardly any hair in it.  It has a normal handle so it is easy to hold.  It is a large paddle brush so it covers lots of hair.  I looked at other detangling brushes but they were small and had no handles.  This one is perfect.  It did have a rubbery smell in the beginning, but it fades and I don&#x27;t notice it anymore.  I would definitely buy these again and again.</li>
            <li> not as gentle as the original wet brush&lt;br /&gt;has a very bad industrial plastic smell</li>
            <li> I was told to order this brush by a salesperson at a famous beauty supply store. I was a little unsure if it would work when I received it, because it looked like any normal brush. Not only did it work on my daughter&#x27;s hair it also worked on my 4 year old niece, who hate to get her hair washed because it tangled and pulled. Its not a normal brush! Its not an everyday brush. It&#x27;s a wet brush.</li>
            <li> Honestly an amazing brush - Never tugs, pulls, rips or tears. Glides through wet hair or dry! Perfect.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush. My daughters hair is down to her hips and its such a pain to brush her hair. This brush goes through her hair like butter. No more fighting no more tears...we love it!!</li>
            <li> The rumors are true it&#x27;s an amazing brush. It just feels so smooth and leaves my hair silky. It&#x27;s the best for de tangling. Then I use my bass s shape bamboo  brush mostly for scalp invigoration. My hair brush situation is fully locked and loaded!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter.  The neighbor had one and she had to have it.  She found it to work great through her medium lenght hair.  It is easy to use and gets the tangles out so easily.</li>
            <li> I used to hate washing my hair for the fear of the post shower brush session. This brush changed my life. I have thick and curly/wavy hair- no more pain! It also helped with the post baby fall out period. I can&#x27;t imagine bringing any other brush into my life- I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for kids. Only con is the horrid off gassing when I first bought it.</li>
            <li> love this brush!  i have long hair that gets tangled easily esp after a shower.  this is the first brush i&#x27;ve used that actually doesn&#x27;t snag and pull out a bunch of hair when my hair is still wet from shower.  the bristles aren&#x27;t as stiff as the ones on my old paddle brush - def more flexible.  would def rec this brush to anyone that needs a brush that gently detangles - would be great for kids (maybe the regular size brush) who hate getting their hair brushed because of the pulling etc.</li>
            <li> Best hair brush everrrrr! Yes it&#x27;s that amazing!  I have thick long hair that has a slight wave to it. My old brush would just tug at my knots and It would take me awhile to get them out. This brush untangled all my knots within seconds and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all! It&#x27;s cheap and totally worth the money! Your hair will thank you!</li>
            <li> The description of this brush states it is &amp;#34;The Wet Brush&amp;#34; but the actual brush only says &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34;. I am not sure if that makes an actual difference, but it appears to in looking at other products.  &amp;#34;The Wet Brush&amp;#34; seems to be more expensive. That being said, this brush is able to get through the tangles of my wet curly hair with zero problems. Somehow it has decreased my blow dry time as  well. It&#x27;s magic! I removed a star because I don&#x27;t like being tricked and if there are two different brands, the correct brand should be presented.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest invention since slice bread.  Since using this brush my hair, ( I am a black female), which is kinky and hard to comb at times, is actually growing. No hair is splitting, or pulling when I brush through either wet or dry.  I highly endorse this product.  Awesome.</li>
            <li> I have a long curly hair and very thin so get tangle very easily, i get tired of using brushes from target etc. The moment I start using this brush, I just fall in love with it, is perfect for my hair and detangle in seconds. The price is super economic.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and it&#x27;s so hard to get through.  My hair stylist told me to get a &amp;#34;wet brush&amp;#34; so I decided to look it up on here.  When you get it you would think &amp;#34;this thing will never work&amp;#34; but WOW!!  It does!!!  Works great on dry hair too! Love it!</li>
            <li> Bristles melted and bent when I tried to blow dry my hair. So now I have 2 brushes one to brush my hair and another to blow-dry it with :/</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair and I love this hairbrush. It works especially well on wet hair. It seems to magically dissolve tangles. We tried it on my young daughter and she loves it too. No more crying. She wants to get one of her own.</li>
            <li> My hair is just the toughest hair - wavy- curly and fine, breaks so easily and knots even worse! I&#x27;ve spent hours untangling my own hair- wondering where I&#x27;ve gone wrong? This brush has saved my headaches and I highly recommend if you have knots issues, tangles, etc.</li>
            <li> Everyone must own especially little girls!</li>
            <li> NICE LOOKS GOOD PRICE IS REASONABLE !!!!! PRODUCT CAME RIGHT ON TIME  I WASNT SURE ABOUT THIS PRODUCT BUT IT ACTUALLY WORKS GIVE IT A TRY U WONT B DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> Wow!&lt;br /&gt;Best brush I have ever had! It&#x27;s like magical! It detangles softly and efficiently :D Loved it!</li>
            <li> All my friends and family love it they also purchased the wet brush. It is definitely a great product leaves hair feeling smooth and looking shiny</li>
            <li> I love this for my hair and my daughters thin, fine, long hair.</li>
            <li> I read all of the excellent reviews about this brush and decided to try it.  It is a good brush for wet hair, but only for the bottom half of hair.  It doesn&#x27;t go through wet hair when brush is pushed along the head because the bristles are too flexible.  This, to me, is a little annoying because I like ALL of my hair brushed.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a reasonable brush on dry hair.</li>
            <li> Really works on my long hair, wet or dry.  Feels great on scalp.  Does not pull so much hair out.  Arrived with some of bristles bent but  they bounced back with use.</li>
            <li> I bought this in an effort to grow my thin, brittle hair longer without abusing it.  I am very happy I did as it will be my only hair brush going forward.</li>
            <li> I bought The Wet Brush squirt and Metallics purple brush, for myself and my poor niece that shares in the same fine, tangly hair type. The Wet Brush has been a hair brushing saver. For some reason though, the squirt/mini brush seems to work the best for my hair, but they all work pretty good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost miraculous - apply this brush lightly to your towel dried air and the tangles just fall away.  It&#x27;s now my favorite brush.</li>
            <li> The wet brush detangles wet hair like no other brush - i reccomend this brush to anyone -- i have a lot of hair and it works perfect</li>
            <li> i was expecting cause the price it would be crappy. then i read the reviews and expected it to be an alright brush for the price. this is literally the most amazing brush i have ever used and im going to tell everyone to get it!!! GET THISS BRUSH!!!</li>
            <li> Love this brush and wouldn&#x27;t use any other one. Wet or dry works just perfect. I got a couple of them, small and round for my daughter and she loves it more than any other brush</li>
            <li> First thing&#x27;s first, I have very long, thick and curly hair. It tangles like nobody&#x27;s business and I typically avoid brushing it at all costs. UNTIL I heard about this brush on a blog I follow and ordered it soon after. I thought the way she was raving about it, it had to at least help ease my tangle troubles. To my surprise, this brush is actually made of magic. I don&#x27;t know how it works but I never have a problem brushing my hair anymore. It&#x27;s completely painless and easy. I don&#x27;t have to fight the tangles out or go over it and over it to get it brushed. Seriously, it&#x27;s insane. Try this brush! Promise you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft. Just perfect!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply amazing! I have long and damaged hair due to bleaching. This really helps &amp; no tangles.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Really does work! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Wow wish I always used this brush! Works great, it will be so much better for my split ends. No snags with wet hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as I have always had extremely tangled hair and have to use tons of conditioner to get knots out. This brush really does work and I now save a lot on conditioner! Wish I had this brush years ago. I have several expensive brushes but this brush has become my stand by now and I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this works so differently, bu it glides thru my hair. This brush brushes right past tangles with ease. I have already recommended it to myhairdresser and all my friends wih kids.  This brush is awesome.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS HAIRBRUSH! My daughter and I both have long hair and I went back later and bought an additional brush. These work best in DRY hair or half dry hair. They&#x27;re not super effective on wet hair. They caused my crying daughter to stop crying and she even learned to brush her own hair!!!</li>
            <li> First brush that didn&#x27;t hurt my hair.  I could actually brush my hair while it was wet and not damage it. It went through and tangle. It was cheaper than the ones that our on tv.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even feel like its brushing my hair. I have very very thick curly/wavy hair. I used to not even brush it, just scrunch it and go but now I can brush it and I don&#x27;t even feel it! I also tried brushing my little sisters hair , which is always a giant rats nest, and usually she cries and freaks out but with this she couldn&#x27;t even tell and both mine and her were very soft afterwards. The only problem I had was that the bristle was a little bent but otherwise I love it!</li>
