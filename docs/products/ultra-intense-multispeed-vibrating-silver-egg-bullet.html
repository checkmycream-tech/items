            <li>This toy is so much fun very very good price an great if it&#x27;s your 1st toy</li>
            <li>Every woman should own one of these.</li>
            <li>Great product intense vibrations great for both partners.</li>
            <li>Gives great stimulation with a VERY powerful motor.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>cheap!</li>
            <li>durable and discreet. :)</li>
            <li>TOLD ALL THE GIRLS ABOUT THEM AND MOST ORDERED ONE FOR THEMSELVES.</li>
            <li>was free as I had a $5 gift card from bing rewards :</li>
            <li>The power box seemed to be made rather cheaply.</li>
            <li>It was cheap.</li>
            <li>Cheap and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>I was really excited upon recieving this.</li>
            <li>this little toy powerful feels awesome mmmmmmmmm .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad for a starter,&lt;br</li>
            <li>It died rather quickly.</li>
            <li>The amazing intensity of these type of devices will bring ANYONE to an orgasm quickly when placed in the clitoral area, and it packs a lot more bang for your buck then many of the more expensive devices typicallyh found.  </li>
            <li>The power in it is great and if the power is too much, it can be easily turn down by the dial on the side.  </li>
            <li>And if there&#x27;s anything more aggravating, it&#x27;s a vibrator that slows down on its own.</li>
            <li>This product is so much fun to use.</li>
            <li>The package is pull-open easy,(I figured there would have at least been some kind of tape around it to tightly secure the package) and the product feels cheaply made.</li>
            <li>, please make this one of your first purchases.  </li>
            <li>, my girlfriend won&#x27;t leave home without it now ;-)</li>
            <li>It was my first sex toy, and I was looking forward to using it.</li>
            <li>Cheap and lightweight, ordered over 1 year ago still works well, not very strong but its ok</li>
            <li>They were fast.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>i repurchase once i wear it out... haha</li>
            <li>I was very disapointed.</li>
            <li>It came with batteries and they died after 3 days I bought new ones and then the thing doesn&#x27;t give as much power as the first day.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Intense\\&quot; I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be looking for a new toy.</li>
            <li>POWERFUL LITTLE DEVIL.</li>
            <li>The egg barely vibrates.</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much.</li>

            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long...</li>
            <li> I never knew Amazon sold things like this for a long time.</li>
            <li> Intensity was acceptable, however only after a few uses, wire broke at egg.  </li>
            <li> Trust me, it works extremely well.</li>
            <li> Although it is powerful, the seam in the middle gets annoying and messy, and takes way too long to reach climax.</li>
            <li> Not worth the few dollars spent</li>
            <li> When set on the highest setting it gradually slows down.</li>
            <li> (Usually it takes me about three minutes, with this it takes about 15).</li>
            <li> the down side is the wire is so thin after a few uses it shorts out.</li>
            <li> It is well worth your money You will not be disappointed with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed in this product.</li>

            <li> I would order from this company again.  They were fast.  Product was same as described.  Every woman should own one of these.</li>
            <li> Cheap and lightweight, ordered over 1 year ago still works well, not very strong but its ok</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never owned a bullet and you&#x27;re in the market for a sex toy, please make this one of your first purchases.  The amazing intensity of these type of devices will bring ANYONE to an orgasm quickly when placed in the clitoral area, and it packs a lot more bang for your buck then many of the more expensive devices typicallyh found.  This one works great, my girlfriend won&#x27;t leave home without it now ;-)</li>
            <li> Trust me, it works extremely well. Your partner will thank you for buying this and good god look at the price. I highly recommend this product. You&#x27;ll need two AA&#x27;s for it as well.</li>
            <li> This product is so much fun to use. I never knew Amazon sold things like this for a long time. Thanks</li>
            <li> This toy is so much fun very very good price an great if it&#x27;s your 1st toy omg I love this little toy powerful feels awesome mmmmmmmmm .</li>
            <li> Amazing toy! It is well worth your money You will not be disappointed with this purchase! You have got to try it for yourself!</li>
            <li> I was really excited upon recieving this. It was my first sex toy, and I was looking forward to using it. Although it is powerful, the seam in the middle gets annoying and messy, and takes way too long to reach climax. (Usually it takes me about three minutes, with this it takes about 15). I&#x27;ll definitely be looking for a new toy.</li>
            <li> Great product intense vibrations great for both partners. the down side is the wire is so thin after a few uses it shorts out. i had to rewire it with a heavier gauge wire works great now.</li>
            <li> Intensity was acceptable, however only after a few uses, wire broke at egg.  cheap! Not worth the few dollars spent</li>
            <li> I like it,... This is my 1st one I ever had. It&#x27;s not bad for a starter,&lt;br /&gt;It came way faster then I thought it would which was nice.&lt;br /&gt;I was free as I had a $5 gift card from bing rewards :3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and the paints chipping.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed in this product. When I received it, it did not work. I figured maybe it was the batteries that I was putting in it that was not working, but after trying multiple brands of batteries, I knew it was the product itself. Maybe it&#x27;s just my luck! The package is pull-open easy,(I figured there would have at least been some kind of tape around it to tightly secure the package) and the product feels cheaply made. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> go to product i repurchase once i wear it out... haha</li>
            <li> Works great, does what you need it to do and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it breaking or the cord falling apart</li>
            <li> It died rather quickly. I was very disapointed. The power box seemed to be made rather cheaply. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product of the company that made it.</li>
            <li> The packaging was great, I couldn&#x27;t even tell what was inside until I opened it. Gives great stimulation with a VERY powerful motor. durable and discreet. :)</li>
            <li> The power in it is great and if the power is too much, it can be easily turn down by the dial on the side.  It hasn&#x27;t shorted out on me yet so that&#x27;s a good sign as well.</li>
            <li> There was nothing \\&quot;ultra intense\\&quot; about this product. The egg barely vibrates. When set on the highest setting it gradually slows down. And if there&#x27;s anything more aggravating, it&#x27;s a vibrator that slows down on its own. It was cheap. I shouldn&#x27;t have expected much. But with a name like \\&quot;Ultra Intense\\&quot; I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> Cheap and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It came with batteries and they died after 3 days I bought new ones and then the thing doesn&#x27;t give as much power as the first day. Storage or energy! Cheap but it doesn&#x27;t last long...</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, I GAVE AS PRESENTS AND THEY LOVED THEM.  TOLD ALL THE GIRLS ABOUT THEM AND MOST ORDERED ONE FOR THEMSELVES. POWERFUL LITTLE DEVIL.</li>
