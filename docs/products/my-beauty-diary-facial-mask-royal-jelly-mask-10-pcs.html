            <li>Good product for the money.  </li>
            <li>These masks, coupled with a good humidifier, help to solve</li>
            <li>loved this.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very cool to the touch, so they feel wonderful after a warm shower, or if you just used an exfoliant.</li>
            <li>If any reader knows of a product which is just as good but cheaper, I&#x27;d be very pleased to know about it.</li>
            <li>This mask is not my perfect expectation at the first thought.</li>

            <li>Nice</li>
            <li>it just makes my skin so perfect and soft and poreless.</li>
            <li>and i even mix my own honey to it to make it better.</li>
            <li>who enjoys trying new - and sometimes better skincare cosmetics - she has been using it and is very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>it has a sweet and pleasant smell and not greasy.</li>
            <li>The Bird&#x27;s Nest smells very lightly of sugarcane.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, pleasant smell and perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I  would say this is one of my favorite ones out of the six that I tried.</li>
            <li>Smell great, feel good on face until next morning</li>
            <li>I have tried many types, but Royal Jelly is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a bit more firming and brightening.</li>
            <li>The essence also seems a bit more lightweight than the Royal Jelly.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t look like a lobster during those days as well :)</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used the Hyalurunic Acid Moisturizing Masks too, and love those as well.</li>
            <li>The essence feels very rich for the Caviar Mask, so if you have aging concerns and don&#x27;t mind fragrance, I&#x27;d recommend the Caviar.</li>
            <li>The mask itself is wonderful, there&#x27;s a very gentle honey smell (I don&#x27;t normally like honey</li>
            <li>A great way to end a busy day.</li>
            <li>I am always loyal to these masks!</li>
            <li>But because of its attractive price, I got and tried on last night.</li>
            <li>: my skin looks so soft, bright and moistured.</li>
            <li>My makeup also goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li>Happy to say when I use this the night before (During the winter I actually sleep with it on).</li>
            <li>Total Win.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice little treat, or a good gift idea if you make gift baskets for females in your family etc.</li>
            <li>The Royal Jelly mask has a very light sweet scent and it feels very soothing and nourishing.</li>
            <li>Love korean beauty products and this mask is a real winner.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li>My facial skin does feel more plush and look more glowy after using this product, I&#x27;ll give it that.</li>
            <li>So far the Royal Jelly is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>Very very hydrating.</li>
            <li>And whenever I put this mask on, my face is ten times brighter and has this healthy glow.</li>
            <li>The Royal Jelly mask is my all-time favorite of the My Beauty Diary line of facial masks.</li>
            <li>is a good product which is well-priced, especially when compared with similar items.</li>
            <li>My face feels soft for a few days after using one, which it awesome as I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li>It works very well with me.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much improvement after using it.</li>
            <li>Very saturated cotton masks to use when you need a boost of moisture.</li>
            <li>To me it&#x27;s a bit much</li>
            <li>The Caviar is much more &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; than the other two.</li>
            <li>I love that there&#x27;s a thin layer of plastic between the layers of the mask, so it&#x27;s really easy to pull apart and not have it rip.</li>
            <li>So relaxing (and entertaining for other people to see)!</li>
            <li>Super simple to adjust.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts, thankfully it has not broken me out.</li>
            <li>I think all of them have pretty much the same results.</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have become obsessed with sheet masks lately, and this brand is wonderfully soothing and left my skin feeling smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>After using the mask my skin felt really soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>but I tend to be sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love how viscous and thick the essence is, like honey.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is what makes this particular \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; stand out for me--not too strong, not too weak.</li>
            <li>Very nutritious for dry skin</li>
            <li>It is not the real thing, but it is fake!It took me only a minute, it constantly stimulates my eyes!Undesirable businessman！！&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li>My friend said my face looks glory, i am not sure that is true or not, but I&#x27;d like to recommend it to people.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin plus the winter here in NV is extremely dry, so I need lots of things to keep me moisturized.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This mask is not my perfect expectation at the first thought. But because of its attractive price, I got and tried on last night. The result turned out to be AMAZING! Very effective as it declared: my skin looks so soft, bright and moistured. Love! Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Great masks, I will buy them again I guess</li>
            <li> shipping in good condition. It looks so nice!</li>
            <li> I have used other my beauty diary masks,  but this one was beyond expectation. I felt so refreshed after using it.  I  would say this is one of my favorite ones out of the six that I tried.</li>
            <li> Good product for the money.  The masks are a bit messy though.  I haven&#x27;t used all of the masks yet and I&#x27;ve had the box about a year.</li>
            <li> Smell great, feel good on face until next morning</li>
            <li> I love that there&#x27;s a thin layer of plastic between the layers of the mask, so it&#x27;s really easy to pull apart and not have it rip. The mask itself is wonderful, there&#x27;s a very gentle honey smell (I don&#x27;t normally like honey but I don&#x27;t mind this smell) and it just makes my skin so perfect and soft and poreless. I look like a china doll afterwards.</li>
            <li> I had a terrible ance break out weeks ago. It left me red scar all over the face. I used 3 pieces of this mask and the red scars are all gone now!</li>
            <li> My skin is glowing and plumped after this mask.</li>
            <li> this product i ve used for a year, i has really bad and sensitive skin, after i use i my face looks smoother.</li>
            <li> who enjoys trying new - and sometimes better skincare cosmetics - she has been using it and is very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I am always loyal to these masks! They are great and cute packaging! I have tried many types, but Royal Jelly is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I adore all of the My Beauty Diary Masks. So far the Royal Jelly is my favorite scent. I think all of them have pretty much the same results. Very very hydrating. They are beyond soaked in serum. Literally I can leave the mask on for over 30 min and they still have some moisture. I put one on, rub the exess into my neck and chest, relax for a while, and then use the excess on my legs, arms, and feet! These things are a gem. A great way to end a busy day. I would recommend trying ALL of them.</li>
            <li> I can leave this mask on for hours and it would be still wet. This one in my opinion is the best one out of the &amp;#34;My Beauty Diary&amp;#34; collection. It smells like honey! And whenever I put this mask on, my face is ten times brighter and has this healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Love korean beauty products and this mask is a real winner. I have skin that&#x27;s dry and oily at the same time (if that makes sense) this mask gives moisture without making me greasy. After using it, my skin feels AMAZING. I use them about once a week and I have very sensitive skin. Any perfume etc irritates me beyond belief and I have had no issues with these masks.</li>
            <li> Nice and i even mix my own honey to it to make it better.</li>
            <li> not ideal for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> ahh spa treatment at home</li>
            <li> I tend to have really dry skin being in the AC room all day in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;This mask doesn&#x27;t just work, it also smells yummy!! Very nutritious for dry skin type.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t just think about it, try it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s brightening and moisture effets are great! It&#x27;s the product I&#x27;ve been searching for! Definitely will buy again after I used up this pack!</li>
            <li> The Royal Jelly mask is my all-time favorite of the My Beauty Diary line of facial masks. All of the masks I&#x27;ve tried (Red Wine, Black Pearl, Strawberry Yogurt)do what they claim to do: moisten my face for an extended period of time. The fragrance is what makes this particular \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; stand out for me--not too strong, not too weak. (And who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like honey for their honey?) I have dry skin and winter in particular is a difficult time for me. These masks, coupled with a good humidifier, help to solve this perennial problem.&lt;br /&gt;Another feature which appeals to me is that the masks will stay put so I can get up and move around a bit rather than be stuck in one place for 20 minutes. It&#x27;s also possible to tear open the eye or mouth holes a little in order to wear reading glasses or drink from a water bottle.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product which is well-priced, especially when compared with similar items. If any reader knows of a product which is just as good but cheaper, I&#x27;d be very pleased to know about it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin plus the winter here in NV is extremely dry, so I need lots of things to keep me moisturized. I bought different types of &#x27;My Beauty Diary Facial Mask&#x27;, and use one piece everyday whenever i feel dry. It works very well with me. My friend said my face looks glory, i am not sure that is true or not, but I&#x27;d like to recommend it to people. Just choose the type fits your skin and needs.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much improvement after using it. But it&#x27;s not bad. At least it can moisturize you skin. No harm</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that leans towards being oily. After using the mask my skin felt really soft and moisturized. I also have very sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts, thankfully it has not broken me out. I will be repurchasing. Not five stars because I didn&#x27;t see any improvement on the \\&quot;fine\\&quot; lines that I had. Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li> loved this.  made my face feel moisturized and looked brighter</li>
            <li> It is not the real thing, but it is fake!It took me only a minute, it constantly stimulates my eyes!Undesirable businessman！！&lt;br /&gt;Dont buy！</li>
            <li> A great deal. Very saturated cotton masks to use when you need a boost of moisture.</li>
            <li> My facial skin does feel more plush and look more glowy after using this product, I&#x27;ll give it that. I love how viscous and thick the essence is, like honey. I probably wouldn&#x27;t repurchase, as it&#x27;s not my usual...I cleanse, tone, moisturize, and have had these masks for several months and I&#x27;ve used three I think. It&#x27;s a nice little treat, or a good gift idea if you make gift baskets for females in your family etc.</li>
            <li> I have become obsessed with sheet masks lately, and this brand is wonderfully soothing and left my skin feeling smooth and hydrated.  So relaxing (and entertaining for other people to see)! I wound up giving a mask to everyone in my immediate family as part of their christmas stocking this year.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, pleasant smell and perfect for my sensitive skin. I actually had a cystic blemish , I used my proactive followed by the mask , woke up in the am and the redness was gone and pimple reduced! My makeup also goes on so smooth. Love this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried three of the My Beauty Diary masks. Royal Jelly, Bird&#x27;s Nest and Caviar. The Royal Jelly mask has a very light sweet scent and it feels very soothing and nourishing. The Bird&#x27;s Nest smells very lightly of sugarcane. It seems to be a bit more firming and brightening. The essence also seems a bit more lightweight than the Royal Jelly. The Caviar is much more &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; than the other two. To me it&#x27;s a bit much but I tend to be sensitive to fragrance. The essence feels very rich for the Caviar Mask, so if you have aging concerns and don&#x27;t mind fragrance, I&#x27;d recommend the Caviar. If you&#x27;re looking to just &amp;#34;brighten up&amp;#34; your skin and get a boost of hydration, I&#x27;d go with the Bird&#x27;s Nest or Royal Jelly.</li>
            <li> I have DRY, ACNE PRONE, REDNESS skin.&lt;br /&gt;Safe to say when winter arrives it strikes terror to me when I have to prepare for the worst. Happy to say when I use this the night before (During the winter I actually sleep with it on). My skin doesn&#x27;t get so dry to the point where sandpaper is smoother then my face. It also takes out the redness from my skin so I don&#x27;t look like a lobster during those days as well :)</li>
            <li> it has a sweet and pleasant smell and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Love these.  Work great and leave my skin looking wonderful!</li>
            <li> I. Freakin. Love. these things. They&#x27;re very cool to the touch, so they feel wonderful after a warm shower, or if you just used an exfoliant. My face feels soft for a few days after using one, which it awesome as I have very dry skin. I&#x27;ve been sharing them with my friends and family. Total Win.</li>
            <li> I love these. They take a little practice to cover your face, I&#x27;m male so I need to cut the corners of my eyes and the bridge of my nose. Super simple to adjust. I&#x27;ve also used the Hyalurunic Acid Moisturizing Masks too, and love those as well.</li>
