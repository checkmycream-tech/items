            <li>On top of that, it smells great and is relatively effective at cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li>I found it to be excellent and doesn&#x27;t have sodium laurel sulfate or propylene glycol in it like most cheap shampoos do.</li>

            <li>Honestly amazing.</li>
            <li>One word: Amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells so amazing, my fianc&amp;eacute; even started using it for himself.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells like banana life savers and that&#x27;s good because when I used to eat life savers, the tropical ones were my favorite.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s kind of expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s kind of expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you have oily skin that is also sensitive and a great price here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair care line ever, and I have tried so many of them!  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, really fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been needing a cleansing shampoo for months but couldn&#x27;t find a good one that could cleanse the dandruff and scrub my scalp clean without leaving,it brittle.</li>
            <li>It is completely 100% residue-free, and it is safe and won&#x27;t cause any build up at all. :D</li>
            <li>Amazing especially for psoriasis and eczema of the scalp, gives hair a wonderful texture.</li>
            <li>You will be more than satisfied</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t been able to find any of my favorite hair shampoos or conditioners</li>
            <li>I LOVE this shampoo.</li>
            <li>My scalp feels a 1000x better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this review for people of all ethnicities so everyone can make an informed choice and hopefully buy more of this shampoo</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use more product, just splash a bit more water on it and it lathers better.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re probably better off buying it at one of these stores (or even a drugstore) than online.</li>
            <li>I like the way it smells, but it&#x27;s not my favorite Shea Moisture scent..</li>
            <li>It controls my husband&#x27;s dandruff better than Head and Shoulders or Neutrogena T-Gel.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed that many of the reviewers were Caucasian.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>and I stocked up on my favorite formulas.  </li>
            <li>With these products (and a few excellent styling products) I have a good hair day almost every day.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way this shampoo does not strip my hair of its moisture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen more growth and thickness since using this product</li>
            <li>My favorite to use.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo because I have relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>It has too many chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>eat better, it&#x27;s your diet, or use head and shoulders or home remedies dandruff</li>
            <li>It lathers well and the smell is tolerable (banana smell, not my favorite)</li>
            <li>and I have tried so many.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I plan on using it once more a month to make sure it gets everything...</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re also better off buying at Walmart, target, or Walgreens.</li>
            <li>Hoping the system used together will have even greater benefits/effects.</li>
            <li>I love the body wash and tried the shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is MAGIC IN A BOTTLE.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I use this shampoo with the Shea Butter Moisture Retention conditioner and the Shea Butter Restorative Elixir, but I like this so much more than the Shea Butter Mositure Retention shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I also really love the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>caused more itching than before.</li>
            <li>so I bought this shampoo, the purification mask, the hibiscus milk and my favorite shea butter shampoo.</li>
            <li>so it has more body.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t wash my hair that often because it&#x27;s wayyyy better for your hair.</li>
            <li>way more bearable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will not be buying any more of this products unless they change the formula to make it more shampoo like.</li>
            <li>What more could I ask from a hair product?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend using this more than once a week, because it is geared towards a race who&#x27;s</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not to say you can&#x27;t use this line, but to better assist anyone with using this.</li>
            <li>A gentle sweet smelling wonderful shampoo and especially good for anyone with hair damage, like from over-processing, or a dry scalp.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing reviews saying it&#x27;s too drying, and maybe it&#x27;s not the best if you&#x27;ve got long hair.</li>
            <li>My husband has dandruff, possibly mild psoriasis, and this works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will just have to wait and see if it works on scalp , I think I remember someone on youtube say it is better to dilute them so it will not be too strong.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so clean!</li>
            <li>I rather use the conditioner only in this product line which is a very good product.</li>
            <li>With all of these formulas, my hair has fantastic body, no frizz and feels and looks extremely healthy.  </li>
            <li>Works great for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;d just like to say that this product is 9.99 on walgreens website, and if you plan on trying the collection or spending 25$ or more, you can get free shipping.</li>
            <li>Also, I love that this is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>If you value a happy scalp over soft hair, get this stuff.</li>
            <li>Good all-around shampoo.</li>
            <li>Very mild yet cleanses verywell.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even believe how amazing my scalp felt after I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>This is a good hair conditioner for normal hair.</li>
            <li>It does not do anything new or good at all for my hair.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I like the SM Jamaican Black Castor Oil shampoo, which smells wonderful and which also removes buildup with apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>Never mind it is marketed as a shampoo for scalp treatment, even if your scalp is fine</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t strip the moisture from my Afro-textured hair which is a huge plus when it comes to dandruff/clarifying shampoos.</li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference yet.</li>
            <li>is a great shampoo, but only use it for clarifying and removing buildup.</li>
            <li>I was in Ulta when I noticed the Jamaican shampoo and bought it because my colored hair needed a sulfate free buildup removing formula</li>
            <li>(SM products are also available at Ulta and are sometimes on sale there too.)</li>
            <li>I have 4a type hair and non sulfate shampoos are important to the health of our hair.</li>
            <li>(Buy one get one free) sale</li>
            <li>I have been trying to switch everything in our home to chemical free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t take much product to get wonderful sudsy lather (which is unlike other sulfate free formulas I&#x27;ve used).  </li>
            <li>The latter was rich and it felt great massaging it between the strands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if there was ANY recommendation as to which dandruff ridding solution was the best, most natural, and did absolutely no damage to ones hair.</li>
            <li>areas where I have the most issues and build-up first and to ensure that I did not feel any burning on my scalp (some of the &amp;#34;hair falling-out&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about 10.00 a bottle, but it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t perfect, but it will soothe the more irritating symptoms of seb derm and serve as a good cleanser in general.</li>
            <li>In desperation, I ordered it and find that it does clean my scalp without drying it out.  </li>
            <li>I started buying this shampoo as an alternative to head and shoulders for my dandruff, I liked that it was sulfate free since I am transitioning to natural hair.</li>
            <li>The shampoo did get my scalp clean though.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair FEEL really clean and shiny</li>
            <li>When I couldn&#x27;t find relief for my latest breakout, I did some research online about more natural remedies.</li>
            <li>Nothing but my clean itch-free scalp.</li>
            <li>My scalp looked like the gross pictures you see on Google when you want to feel better about your own dandruff problems.</li>
            <li>I have to use a LOT to clean my hair</li>
            <li>rinsed out, my hair was squeaky clean without that frizzy</li>
            <li>we&#x27;ll see how much more effective after a few more washes.</li>
            <li>I have 3c natural hair and it works amazing with it.</li>
            <li>hope it is good in the future.</li>
            <li>A sweet plantain</li>
            <li>but I think it smells sweet.</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;My hair type is 1a, fine and really smooth, straight for the most part but gets oily really</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s sulfate-free as I suspect that my flakes had more to do with sulfate-sensitivity than actual dandruff.</li>
            <li>: More runny than normal shampoos</li>
            <li>Hope this really helps!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper from the SheaMoisture site (free shipping over $35) or Target.&lt;br /&gt;It goes really quickly&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper from the SheaMoisture site (free shipping over $35) or Target.&lt;br /&gt;It goes really quickly&lt;</li>
            <li>My NATURAL shampoo was OK at controlling itchy scalp and flakes/crud.  </li>
            <li>I hope this review is useful to people.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my scalp not so crusty and itchy, and it makes my hair soft and not at all frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had an intense itch for days, plus the smell is very yummy!!!</li>
            <li>that raw shampoo, while sulfate free, is an entirely different animal and it takes some time for your hair and scalp to adjust before you get the best results.  </li>
            <li>The BEST use of this shampoo is to wash your hair with it once a week and then use regular shampoo every other day.</li>
            <li>It would be this product right here.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It started working RIGHT AWAY.</li>
            <li>They are right scalp was itchy once again after I used it I had to use apple cider vingear.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is also very cooling and soothing, and rinses clean with no residue.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really felt my hair this clean in a while.</li>
            <li>The curls were formed perfectly, and even using a hair dryer ( I was in a rush, plus I wanted to subject the shampoo to all the possible scenarios) did not affect my hair</li>
            <li>It might be too clarifying for some, but for thick, unmanageable hair, it&#x27;s a perfect fit for cleansing the hair, grabbing the dirty oils, and giving you a beautiful fresh head of hair.</li>
            <li>It helps to cleanse my hair, but it also promotes healthy growth and general look of it.</li>
            <li>Like all Shea Moisture products this one is made from all natural ingredients with the another plus being its perfect for moisturizing coarse/ethnic hard to handle hair.</li>
            <li>does a great job of cleaning hair and is free of irritating chemicals</li>
            <li>I use spray bottle filled with warm water and a few drops of rosemary oil.</li>
            <li>It smelled of Shea butter and it had a very gentle fragrance to it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Regardless, the problem areas are the sides and back of my head, not the top where I apply Rogaine.  </li>
            <li>First, this is a CLARIFYING shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I first used this product after I had taken some Senegalese twists out of my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is now incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I think this may have been the first thing from Shea Moisture I tried - both the shampoo and the conditioner</li>
            <li>He wants me to buy it by the case!  </li>
            <li>Walgreens offers free shipping for all orders over $25.</li>
            <li>+ year former dandruff sufferer :)</li>
            <li>+ year former dandruff sufferer :)</li>
            <li>After reading the ingredients of this products, I thought I had found an answer for natural chemical free ingredients.</li>
            <li>I picked up this shampoo at Walgreens in desperation when the health food store stopped stocking my natural fragrance free shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I am still corcern because I agree with most reviews it did left my hair drying and unmanaged.</li>
            <li>I enjoy giving my patronage to a small business that produces such great products.  </li>
            <li>I use the whole line of black soap products now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped very quickly! !</li>
            <li>experienced minimal tingling, which I actually like as it makes me feel as if the product is seeping in and doing its job.</li>
            <li>I used that stuff for a while and while the flakes didn&#x27;t disappear, they most definitely were less abundant on my head.</li>
            <li>It is best for thick, curly/coily types and for those who suffer from constant dandruff/dermatitis/psoriasis.</li>
            <li>Not only did it clear his dermatitis completely, it left his hair looking &amp; smelling great.</li>
            <li>build-up was gone, and the hair was super shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to any one who want a pure shampoo</li>
            <li>I had an immediate experience of the advertised claim of this very high quality product that this seller has produced.</li>
            <li>My scalp feel fine and my hair feels soft and not dried out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for scalp that is itchy due to dry skin.</li>
            <li>I recently ran into a huge buy 1 get 1 sale at Walgreens</li>
            <li>I immediately saw this stuff at CVS and had to give it a try simply because it was the same amazing company that had almost conquered the undesirable flake.</li>
            <li>and I really need moisture.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this shampoo, I really did.  </li>
            <li>The product made my hair very ruff.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and will be trying it myself!</li>
            <li>and I would much rather deal with flaking than itching.</li>
            <li>So much so that she threw her salon product in trash and brought this with her to her hair appointment tonight at 7:30pm.  </li>
            <li>have type 4A hair (very coily)</li>
            <li>This shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather a whole lot, and is runny (like someone else mentioned)</li>
            <li>It cleans my hair very well, even on days</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really oily.</li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo for just over a month and really like it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping also.</li>
            <li>I cannot say much in terms of the longevity as I have just used the product for a couple hours</li>
            <li>I am at an APO address and it arrived surprisingly fast considering my location.</li>
            <li>but it strips my hair sooooooo much.</li>
            <li>This really works for me</li>
            <li>I actually really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>You can not just go off of what people say, and some people hair take well to protein--mine--not so much.</li>
            <li>I was beginning to develop a real scalp problem.</li>
            <li>This stuff really really REALLY cleanses your scalp of all impurities.</li>
            <li>I really do like it though.</li>
            <li>I guess they use too much of \\&quot;drying</li>
            <li>i particularly dont like the smell and the viscosity of this product, still, its better than any commercial product--claiming to be all natural with like 20000000 chemicals in it!</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to reek of tea tree, and while I love it for household cleaning and medicinal stuff, I am not wild about wearing it as my new perfume.</li>
            <li>It is a drying shampoo (hence the deep clean) but for my hair  it balanced it out and made it look and feel really, really clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>PLUS on top of that, my hair was extremely tangled using the shampoo AND conditioner.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am not extremely disappointed with this product at all.</li>
            <li>I try not to shampoo my hair more often than every other day, and it tends to be on the oily side.</li>
            <li>I am not itchy / stinging for the first time in weeks and my scalp is clear!</li>
            <li>husband also has a very itchy scalp and some kind of scalp condition (not really sure what).  </li>
            <li>First of all, my hair has not dried yet, so I have no idea</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it contains natural ingredients and is sulfate free (sulfates can definitely cause scalp irritation).  </li>
            <li>Another thing, if you desperately want to clear up your psoriasis, it&#x27;s best if you follow this regimen along with taking some fish oil supplements, drinking plenty of water and doing exercise.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo andall the SM products</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>; comments concerned me enough to do a patch testing).&lt;br /&gt;After wetting it, I lightly applied the shampoo directly to the scalp where I was having the largest amount of build-up, and then tied the hair up and let the steam of the shower do its magic for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also use the raw shea butter regular conditioner, which is lighter and really good too.  </li>
            <li>I ususally only do like one lather but will only use this as a last resort if i run out of the coconut hibiscus one which is my favorite!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rinsing it out was easy, and my hair did not feel as if it was tangled (more then usual after applying shampoo) nor was it stripped dry.</li>
            <li>Because it is a sulfate free shampoo the lather is also lacking, but that was to be expected.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend tried this shampoo a few days ago and immediately fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>but a lot of hair, so normal shampoos don&#x27;t get all of the buildup out of my hair.</li>
            <li>I hope I can buy this shampoo for the next 20 years...or for as long as I have my hair! :-)</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s used it every since; it doesn&#x27;t completely heal the condition, but it makes it a little more manageable for him.</li>
            <li>My hair feels like straw and is super dry after.</li>
            <li>(I have a lot of fine hair down to my shoulders.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and a sulfa allergy.</li>
            <li>At first I would only use it on my scalp and that worked out well</li>
            <li>The ingredients I can actually pronounce and no weird sulfates.</li>
            <li>I am a dude with pretty short hair too.</li>
            <li>I use the raw shea butter formula the most frequently.  </li>
            <li>Well tonight i washed for the third time with shea moisture shampoo, not only does my scalf feel clean</li>
            <li>On the plus side, a little goes a long way and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>As a HUGE fan of the 8oz black soap, I figured I&#x27;d give this a shot...mainly because I read ingredients:  </li>
            <li>Upon first touch of my hair, this shampoo left my hair feeling soft and moisturized--then came the storm.</li>
            <li>I love the Shea Butter Shampoo and Deep Conditioner Treatment, The Black Soap Purification Masque, and The Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie.</li>
            <li>(yeah I know rogaine is not designed for this area, but it slows down the loss significantly)  </li>
            <li>Most Black people, especially those who are natural hair, DONT shampoo their hair often and some not at all.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because its a little watery, making you use more of it.</li>
            <li>only thing is I wish it lathered up a little more.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly 3b hair and have been wearing it straight all winter which means washing it only once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all these ingredients separately to clear up my scalp but to no avail.</li>
            <li>appreciate all natural products and was hopeful for what this line represents</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I have Nigerian-American natural hair of the \\&quot;4c\\&quot; curl pattern.</li>
            <li>It has ingredients that fight scalp problems naturally, lathers well and smells like plantains.</li>
            <li>I have short(2&amp;#34;ish), soft hair that I get cut every 3-4 weeks</li>
            <li>(She is SouthAmerican with straight, dye-assisted blonde hair)</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair soft and manageable, without conditioner.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to people who have hair that is prone to oiliness and are looking for natural shampoo that balances it out.</li>
            <li>The redness and irritation completely disappeared after that.</li>
            <li>And four days is a far cry from the one to two hours I was experiencing before this.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting this shampoo to do anything for my texture, but boy was I pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>And this is all natural, which is an added bonus.     </li>
            <li>He says his hair &amp; scalp feel like they did when he was 7 years old.  </li>
            <li>However, this shampoo does strip a lot of the natural oils in your hair.</li>
            <li>That extra bit really, really helped.</li>
            <li>ONLY CON is that it goes SO FAST.</li>
            <li>I then used the shampoo through out my whole scalp area, leaving the ends out as much as possible.</li>
            <li>I recently suffered from patches of scalp psoriasis and this product was so gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it leaves some moisture, but only as much as a clarifying shampoo can.</li>
            <li>I will buy squeeze bottle for next time, so it can go straight to my scalp not hair.</li>
            <li>What I will do is dilute it with wate in tube container and put directly on scalp, wash off with apple cider vingear then do conditioner on hair to root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have short hair, but this shampoo works really well for me.  </li>
            <li>Maybe the people who say it causes skin problems are allergic to some of the natural ingredients??  </li>
            <li>My skin did feel slightly tender after using it at first, but I think that&#x27;s because there was so much it needed to scrub off, so</li>
            <li>Now with that being said, the sole reason I picked this stuff up today is because I used their basic original shampoo with basic moisturizing capabilities.</li>
            <li>I love the Raw Shea Butter shampoo from the same company but this one just didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>but it is not as strong as the African Black Soap formula.</li>
            <li>so it will stay unchanged and be available for a long, long time!!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to use anything too harsh or full of chemicals</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe, but the feeling is similar to scratching an itch that you haven&#x27;t been able to reach in years, and then it&#x27;s just gone.</li>
            <li>At least I can say I was not disappointed with the results this product had left me, as I already was aware of what this product could possibly do to my hair.</li>
            <li>This particular one was the only one left at Target</li>
            <li>Also, I realize this is Sulfate free, but this was extremely hard to use, it felt like I was rubbing glue in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have rather short, fine, thin straight hair and an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>By the time I wash my hair, my scalp is quite oily and because I use several styling products, it is frequently sticky as well.  </li>
            <li>I found this brand on the Skin Deep database as I was looking for all natural shampoos without the chemicals, irritants and whatnot.</li>
            <li>I have only used it once so far.</li>
            <li>My (then) two year old is mixed with curly hair.</li>
            <li>So now I barely have any dandruff after a month of using this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I will have to find tube container that is very tiny going directly to scalp.</li>
            <li>In fact, most things made it worse.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s kind of expensive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s kind of expensive.</li>
            <li>made sure to read most of the reviews here and some of the consumers complained about the stress that this product produces on hair and scalp, so needless to say I was a bit hesitant.</li>
            <li>I occasionally use it on my super thin, straight hair as a clarifying shampoo and it works wonders!</li>
            <li>It makes those first two washes (about a week and a half)</li>
            <li>Not a single flake.</li>
            <li>It has been almost two hours since I&#x27;ve used it and not a SINGLE flake in sight.</li>
            <li>This product did not really help with my scalp issues, there are much cheaper shampoos that will have the same results.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind this product line is made for Black people, particularly those with natural hair.</li>
            <li>No dandruff, no scales, no dry patches.</li>
            <li>Not wanting to waste it, I use the black soap shampoo as a body wash, which it actually seems better suited for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In one use, this has worked better than Head and Shoulders or any other common, commercially-available dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>Unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried, this one does a fairly decent job at controlling the unbearable itch that often comes along with seb derm</li>
            <li>I bought this as a natural way to take care of my sometimes dry, itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair felt soft, moisturized, and defined without leaving it dry for a clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li>When I washed my hair with this longer, my hair instantly tangled and became very hard, dry and brittle--not cute at all.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft with loose curls and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I have 4a/4b curly/coily hair and this actually doesn&#x27;t dry it out at all; it clearly removes all the build-up from my hair without stripping it.  </li>
            <li>It was so bad that my cousin would ask can she wash my hair for me because they felt as if i was not doing a good job washing it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It smells so amazing, my fianc&amp;eacute; even started using it for himself.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells like banana life savers and that&#x27;s good because when I used to eat life savers, the tropical ones were my favorite.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s kind of expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s kind of expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you have oily skin that is also sensitive and a great price here at Amazon.</li>

            <li> It smells wonderful, really fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>

            <li> It is completely 100% residue-free, and it is safe and won&#x27;t cause any build up at all. :D</li>
            <li> Amazing especially for psoriasis and eczema of the scalp, gives hair a wonderful texture.</li>
            <li> You will be more than satisfied</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t been able to find any of my favorite hair shampoos or conditioners</li>
            <li> I LOVE this shampoo.</li>
            <li> My scalp feels a 1000x better.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review for people of all ethnicities so everyone can make an informed choice and hopefully buy more of this shampoo</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use more product, just splash a bit more water on it and it lathers better.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re probably better off buying it at one of these stores (or even a drugstore) than online.</li>
            <li> I like the way it smells, but it&#x27;s not my favorite Shea Moisture scent..</li>
            <li> It controls my husband&#x27;s dandruff better than Head and Shoulders or Neutrogena T-Gel.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed that many of the reviewers were Caucasian.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> and I stocked up on my favorite formulas.  </li>
            <li> With these products (and a few excellent styling products) I have a good hair day almost every day.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell and the way this shampoo does not strip my hair of its moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen more growth and thickness since using this product</li>
            <li> My favorite to use.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo because I have relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> It has too many chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> eat better, it&#x27;s your diet, or use head and shoulders or home remedies dandruff</li>
            <li> It lathers well and the smell is tolerable (banana smell, not my favorite)</li>
            <li> and I have tried so many.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I plan on using it once more a month to make sure it gets everything...</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re also better off buying at Walmart, target, or Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Hoping the system used together will have even greater benefits/effects.</li>
            <li> I love the body wash and tried the shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is MAGIC IN A BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I use this shampoo with the Shea Butter Moisture Retention conditioner and the Shea Butter Restorative Elixir, but I like this so much more than the Shea Butter Mositure Retention shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I also really love the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> caused more itching than before.</li>
            <li> so I bought this shampoo, the purification mask, the hibiscus milk and my favorite shea butter shampoo.</li>
            <li> so it has more body.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t wash my hair that often because it&#x27;s wayyyy better for your hair.</li>
            <li> way more bearable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will not be buying any more of this products unless they change the formula to make it more shampoo like.</li>
            <li> What more could I ask from a hair product?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend using this more than once a week, because it is geared towards a race who&#x27;s</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not to say you can&#x27;t use this line, but to better assist anyone with using this.</li>
            <li> A gentle sweet smelling wonderful shampoo and especially good for anyone with hair damage, like from over-processing, or a dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing reviews saying it&#x27;s too drying, and maybe it&#x27;s not the best if you&#x27;ve got long hair.</li>
            <li> My husband has dandruff, possibly mild psoriasis, and this works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will just have to wait and see if it works on scalp , I think I remember someone on youtube say it is better to dilute them so it will not be too strong.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so clean!</li>
            <li> I rather use the conditioner only in this product line which is a very good product.</li>
            <li> With all of these formulas, my hair has fantastic body, no frizz and feels and looks extremely healthy.  </li>
            <li> Works great for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;d just like to say that this product is 9.99 on walgreens website, and if you plan on trying the collection or spending 25$ or more, you can get free shipping.</li>
            <li> Also, I love that this is sulfate free.</li>
            <li> If you value a happy scalp over soft hair, get this stuff.</li>
            <li> Good all-around shampoo.</li>
            <li> Very mild yet cleanses verywell.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even believe how amazing my scalp felt after I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> This is a good hair conditioner for normal hair.</li>
            <li> It does not do anything new or good at all for my hair.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I like the SM Jamaican Black Castor Oil shampoo, which smells wonderful and which also removes buildup with apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li> Never mind it is marketed as a shampoo for scalp treatment, even if your scalp is fine</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t strip the moisture from my Afro-textured hair which is a huge plus when it comes to dandruff/clarifying shampoos.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference yet.</li>
            <li> is a great shampoo, but only use it for clarifying and removing buildup.</li>
            <li> I was in Ulta when I noticed the Jamaican shampoo and bought it because my colored hair needed a sulfate free buildup removing formula</li>
            <li> (SM products are also available at Ulta and are sometimes on sale there too.)</li>
            <li> I have 4a type hair and non sulfate shampoos are important to the health of our hair.</li>
            <li> (Buy one get one free) sale</li>
            <li> I have been trying to switch everything in our home to chemical free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t take much product to get wonderful sudsy lather (which is unlike other sulfate free formulas I&#x27;ve used).  </li>
            <li> The latter was rich and it felt great massaging it between the strands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if there was ANY recommendation as to which dandruff ridding solution was the best, most natural, and did absolutely no damage to ones hair.</li>
            <li> areas where I have the most issues and build-up first and to ensure that I did not feel any burning on my scalp (some of the &amp;#34;hair falling-out&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about 10.00 a bottle, but it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t perfect, but it will soothe the more irritating symptoms of seb derm and serve as a good cleanser in general.</li>
            <li> In desperation, I ordered it and find that it does clean my scalp without drying it out.  </li>
            <li> I started buying this shampoo as an alternative to head and shoulders for my dandruff, I liked that it was sulfate free since I am transitioning to natural hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo did get my scalp clean though.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair FEEL really clean and shiny</li>
            <li> When I couldn&#x27;t find relief for my latest breakout, I did some research online about more natural remedies.</li>
            <li> Nothing but my clean itch-free scalp.</li>
            <li> My scalp looked like the gross pictures you see on Google when you want to feel better about your own dandruff problems.</li>
            <li> I have to use a LOT to clean my hair</li>
            <li> rinsed out, my hair was squeaky clean without that frizzy</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ll see how much more effective after a few more washes.</li>
            <li> I have 3c natural hair and it works amazing with it.</li>
            <li> hope it is good in the future.</li>
            <li> A sweet plantain</li>
            <li> but I think it smells sweet.</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;My hair type is 1a, fine and really smooth, straight for the most part but gets oily really</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s sulfate-free as I suspect that my flakes had more to do with sulfate-sensitivity than actual dandruff.</li>
            <li> : More runny than normal shampoos</li>
            <li> Hope this really helps!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper from the SheaMoisture site (free shipping over $35) or Target.&lt;br /&gt;It goes really quickly&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper from the SheaMoisture site (free shipping over $35) or Target.&lt;br /&gt;It goes really quickly&lt;</li>
            <li> My NATURAL shampoo was OK at controlling itchy scalp and flakes/crud.  </li>
            <li> I hope this review is useful to people.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my scalp not so crusty and itchy, and it makes my hair soft and not at all frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had an intense itch for days, plus the smell is very yummy!!!</li>
            <li> that raw shampoo, while sulfate free, is an entirely different animal and it takes some time for your hair and scalp to adjust before you get the best results.  </li>
            <li> The BEST use of this shampoo is to wash your hair with it once a week and then use regular shampoo every other day.</li>
            <li> It would be this product right here.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It started working RIGHT AWAY.</li>
            <li> They are right scalp was itchy once again after I used it I had to use apple cider vingear.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is also very cooling and soothing, and rinses clean with no residue.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really felt my hair this clean in a while.</li>
            <li> The curls were formed perfectly, and even using a hair dryer ( I was in a rush, plus I wanted to subject the shampoo to all the possible scenarios) did not affect my hair</li>
            <li> It might be too clarifying for some, but for thick, unmanageable hair, it&#x27;s a perfect fit for cleansing the hair, grabbing the dirty oils, and giving you a beautiful fresh head of hair.</li>
            <li> It helps to cleanse my hair, but it also promotes healthy growth and general look of it.</li>
            <li> Like all Shea Moisture products this one is made from all natural ingredients with the another plus being its perfect for moisturizing coarse/ethnic hard to handle hair.</li>
            <li> does a great job of cleaning hair and is free of irritating chemicals</li>
            <li> I use spray bottle filled with warm water and a few drops of rosemary oil.</li>
            <li> It smelled of Shea butter and it had a very gentle fragrance to it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Regardless, the problem areas are the sides and back of my head, not the top where I apply Rogaine.  </li>
            <li> First, this is a CLARIFYING shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I first used this product after I had taken some Senegalese twists out of my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is now incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I think this may have been the first thing from Shea Moisture I tried - both the shampoo and the conditioner</li>
            <li> He wants me to buy it by the case!  </li>
            <li> Walgreens offers free shipping for all orders over $25.</li>

            <li> + year former dandruff sufferer :)</li>
            <li> After reading the ingredients of this products, I thought I had found an answer for natural chemical free ingredients.</li>
            <li> I picked up this shampoo at Walgreens in desperation when the health food store stopped stocking my natural fragrance free shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I am still corcern because I agree with most reviews it did left my hair drying and unmanaged.</li>
            <li> I enjoy giving my patronage to a small business that produces such great products.  </li>
            <li> I use the whole line of black soap products now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped very quickly! !</li>
            <li> experienced minimal tingling, which I actually like as it makes me feel as if the product is seeping in and doing its job.</li>
            <li> I used that stuff for a while and while the flakes didn&#x27;t disappear, they most definitely were less abundant on my head.</li>
            <li> It is best for thick, curly/coily types and for those who suffer from constant dandruff/dermatitis/psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Not only did it clear his dermatitis completely, it left his hair looking &amp; smelling great.</li>
            <li> build-up was gone, and the hair was super shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any one who want a pure shampoo</li>
            <li> I had an immediate experience of the advertised claim of this very high quality product that this seller has produced.</li>
            <li> My scalp feel fine and my hair feels soft and not dried out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for scalp that is itchy due to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I recently ran into a huge buy 1 get 1 sale at Walgreens</li>
            <li> I immediately saw this stuff at CVS and had to give it a try simply because it was the same amazing company that had almost conquered the undesirable flake.</li>
            <li> and I really need moisture.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo, I really did.  </li>
            <li> The product made my hair very ruff.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and will be trying it myself!</li>
            <li> and I would much rather deal with flaking than itching.</li>
            <li> So much so that she threw her salon product in trash and brought this with her to her hair appointment tonight at 7:30pm.  </li>
            <li> have type 4A hair (very coily)</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather a whole lot, and is runny (like someone else mentioned)</li>
            <li> It cleans my hair very well, even on days</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really oily.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for just over a month and really like it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping also.</li>
            <li> I cannot say much in terms of the longevity as I have just used the product for a couple hours</li>
            <li> I am at an APO address and it arrived surprisingly fast considering my location.</li>
            <li> but it strips my hair sooooooo much.</li>
            <li> This really works for me</li>
            <li> I actually really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> You can not just go off of what people say, and some people hair take well to protein--mine--not so much.</li>
            <li> I was beginning to develop a real scalp problem.</li>
            <li> This stuff really really REALLY cleanses your scalp of all impurities.</li>
            <li> I really do like it though.</li>
            <li> I guess they use too much of \\&quot;drying</li>
            <li> i particularly dont like the smell and the viscosity of this product, still, its better than any commercial product--claiming to be all natural with like 20000000 chemicals in it!</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to reek of tea tree, and while I love it for household cleaning and medicinal stuff, I am not wild about wearing it as my new perfume.</li>
            <li> It is a drying shampoo (hence the deep clean) but for my hair  it balanced it out and made it look and feel really, really clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> PLUS on top of that, my hair was extremely tangled using the shampoo AND conditioner.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am not extremely disappointed with this product at all.</li>
            <li> I try not to shampoo my hair more often than every other day, and it tends to be on the oily side.</li>
            <li> I am not itchy / stinging for the first time in weeks and my scalp is clear!</li>
            <li> husband also has a very itchy scalp and some kind of scalp condition (not really sure what).  </li>
            <li> First of all, my hair has not dried yet, so I have no idea</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it contains natural ingredients and is sulfate free (sulfates can definitely cause scalp irritation).  </li>
            <li> Another thing, if you desperately want to clear up your psoriasis, it&#x27;s best if you follow this regimen along with taking some fish oil supplements, drinking plenty of water and doing exercise.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo andall the SM products</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> ; comments concerned me enough to do a patch testing).&lt;br /&gt;After wetting it, I lightly applied the shampoo directly to the scalp where I was having the largest amount of build-up, and then tied the hair up and let the steam of the shower do its magic for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also use the raw shea butter regular conditioner, which is lighter and really good too.  </li>
            <li> I ususally only do like one lather but will only use this as a last resort if i run out of the coconut hibiscus one which is my favorite!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rinsing it out was easy, and my hair did not feel as if it was tangled (more then usual after applying shampoo) nor was it stripped dry.</li>
            <li> Because it is a sulfate free shampoo the lather is also lacking, but that was to be expected.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend tried this shampoo a few days ago and immediately fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> but a lot of hair, so normal shampoos don&#x27;t get all of the buildup out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I hope I can buy this shampoo for the next 20 years...or for as long as I have my hair! :-)</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s used it every since; it doesn&#x27;t completely heal the condition, but it makes it a little more manageable for him.</li>
            <li> My hair feels like straw and is super dry after.</li>
            <li> (I have a lot of fine hair down to my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and a sulfa allergy.</li>
            <li> At first I would only use it on my scalp and that worked out well</li>
            <li> The ingredients I can actually pronounce and no weird sulfates.</li>
            <li> I am a dude with pretty short hair too.</li>
            <li> I use the raw shea butter formula the most frequently.  </li>
            <li> Well tonight i washed for the third time with shea moisture shampoo, not only does my scalf feel clean</li>
            <li> On the plus side, a little goes a long way and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> As a HUGE fan of the 8oz black soap, I figured I&#x27;d give this a shot...mainly because I read ingredients:  </li>
            <li> Upon first touch of my hair, this shampoo left my hair feeling soft and moisturized--then came the storm.</li>
            <li> I love the Shea Butter Shampoo and Deep Conditioner Treatment, The Black Soap Purification Masque, and The Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie.</li>
            <li> (yeah I know rogaine is not designed for this area, but it slows down the loss significantly)  </li>
            <li> Most Black people, especially those who are natural hair, DONT shampoo their hair often and some not at all.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because its a little watery, making you use more of it.</li>
            <li> only thing is I wish it lathered up a little more.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly 3b hair and have been wearing it straight all winter which means washing it only once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all these ingredients separately to clear up my scalp but to no avail.</li>
            <li> appreciate all natural products and was hopeful for what this line represents</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have Nigerian-American natural hair of the \\&quot;4c\\&quot; curl pattern.</li>
            <li> It has ingredients that fight scalp problems naturally, lathers well and smells like plantains.</li>
            <li> I have short(2&amp;#34;ish), soft hair that I get cut every 3-4 weeks</li>
            <li> (She is SouthAmerican with straight, dye-assisted blonde hair)</li>
            <li> It also leaves my hair soft and manageable, without conditioner.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to people who have hair that is prone to oiliness and are looking for natural shampoo that balances it out.</li>
            <li> The redness and irritation completely disappeared after that.</li>
            <li> And four days is a far cry from the one to two hours I was experiencing before this.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this shampoo to do anything for my texture, but boy was I pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> And this is all natural, which is an added bonus.     </li>
            <li> He says his hair &amp; scalp feel like they did when he was 7 years old.  </li>
            <li> However, this shampoo does strip a lot of the natural oils in your hair.</li>
            <li> That extra bit really, really helped.</li>
            <li> ONLY CON is that it goes SO FAST.</li>
            <li> I then used the shampoo through out my whole scalp area, leaving the ends out as much as possible.</li>
            <li> I recently suffered from patches of scalp psoriasis and this product was so gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it leaves some moisture, but only as much as a clarifying shampoo can.</li>
            <li> I will buy squeeze bottle for next time, so it can go straight to my scalp not hair.</li>
            <li> What I will do is dilute it with wate in tube container and put directly on scalp, wash off with apple cider vingear then do conditioner on hair to root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have short hair, but this shampoo works really well for me.  </li>
            <li> Maybe the people who say it causes skin problems are allergic to some of the natural ingredients??  </li>
            <li> My skin did feel slightly tender after using it at first, but I think that&#x27;s because there was so much it needed to scrub off, so</li>
            <li> Now with that being said, the sole reason I picked this stuff up today is because I used their basic original shampoo with basic moisturizing capabilities.</li>
            <li> I love the Raw Shea Butter shampoo from the same company but this one just didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> but it is not as strong as the African Black Soap formula.</li>
            <li> so it will stay unchanged and be available for a long, long time!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to use anything too harsh or full of chemicals</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe, but the feeling is similar to scratching an itch that you haven&#x27;t been able to reach in years, and then it&#x27;s just gone.</li>
            <li> At least I can say I was not disappointed with the results this product had left me, as I already was aware of what this product could possibly do to my hair.</li>
            <li> This particular one was the only one left at Target</li>
            <li> Also, I realize this is Sulfate free, but this was extremely hard to use, it felt like I was rubbing glue in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have rather short, fine, thin straight hair and an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> By the time I wash my hair, my scalp is quite oily and because I use several styling products, it is frequently sticky as well.  </li>
            <li> I found this brand on the Skin Deep database as I was looking for all natural shampoos without the chemicals, irritants and whatnot.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once so far.</li>
            <li> My (then) two year old is mixed with curly hair.</li>
            <li> So now I barely have any dandruff after a month of using this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I will have to find tube container that is very tiny going directly to scalp.</li>
            <li> In fact, most things made it worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of expensive.</li>
            <li> made sure to read most of the reviews here and some of the consumers complained about the stress that this product produces on hair and scalp, so needless to say I was a bit hesitant.</li>
            <li> I occasionally use it on my super thin, straight hair as a clarifying shampoo and it works wonders!</li>
            <li> It makes those first two washes (about a week and a half)</li>
            <li> Not a single flake.</li>
            <li> It has been almost two hours since I&#x27;ve used it and not a SINGLE flake in sight.</li>
            <li> This product did not really help with my scalp issues, there are much cheaper shampoos that will have the same results.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind this product line is made for Black people, particularly those with natural hair.</li>
            <li> No dandruff, no scales, no dry patches.</li>
            <li> Not wanting to waste it, I use the black soap shampoo as a body wash, which it actually seems better suited for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In one use, this has worked better than Head and Shoulders or any other common, commercially-available dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> Unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried, this one does a fairly decent job at controlling the unbearable itch that often comes along with seb derm</li>
            <li> I bought this as a natural way to take care of my sometimes dry, itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair felt soft, moisturized, and defined without leaving it dry for a clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> When I washed my hair with this longer, my hair instantly tangled and became very hard, dry and brittle--not cute at all.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft with loose curls and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have 4a/4b curly/coily hair and this actually doesn&#x27;t dry it out at all; it clearly removes all the build-up from my hair without stripping it.  </li>
            <li> It was so bad that my cousin would ask can she wash my hair for me because they felt as if i was not doing a good job washing it.</li>
            <li> Compared to these minor issues, however, by far the most disappointing thing is that it does nothing for the flakes on my head.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my other &#x27;so called NATURAL dandruff shampoo&#x27; and was stuck using my girlfriend&#x27;s salon &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Well, I was correct in that the ingredients are great for us to use everyday, but when you use it, it is very difficult to get anything that feels like shampoo in our hair.</li>
            <li> So for the reviewers that said it left their hair dry, unruly, and tangled have probably been using this as a regular shampoo rather than a once-in-a-while shampoo.</li>
            <li> After flat ironing, parted my hair in sections then rubbed my scalp with olive oil.</li>
            <li> We tried many different over the counter shampoos, but none of them worked and all of them had harsh chemicals which sometimes made his condition worse.</li>
            <li> Looser hair types wouldn&#x27;t benefit from this product because the natural sebum in the scalp travels easier down the hair shaft than in tighter curls.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shake well first to settle down natural ingredient in black soap, then squeeze out a little and dilute water.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m better off using this shampoo only because everything else will make my scalp itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally straight and limp and I keep it cut short, so I generally like shampoos that leave it a little dry</li>
            <li> It is probably not moisturizing enough for very dry or chemically processed hair.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on how my hair would hold up over long term using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This routine keeps dryness at bay (always a problem with long hair) and it leaves my hair bouncy and shiny.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is thicker than I expected, like a regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not used to shampoo and conditioner after using castile soap and vinegar for so long, but I feel like this takes a lot.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a good hair conditioner for normal hair. It is probably not moisturizing enough for very dry or chemically processed hair.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work for me. it could be that I only use it once a week, I will start using 3x a week and see if that makes a difference.</li>
            <li> my hair felt like I put 10 sulfate shampoos on my scalp.. omg. Maybe next time I&#x27;ll get the moisture retention shampoo instead 😟 considering I have no scalp conditions and I really need moisture. I knew this would be somewhat of a clarifying shampoo but my god 😩</li>
            <li> This product is quite special and is as advertised too!!!  I had an immediate experience of the advertised claim of this very high quality product that this seller has produced. You will be more than satisfied should you purchase this product.  Very satisfied indeed!!!!!</li>
            <li> If you have scalp problems or dermatitis, this shampoo is a miracle. I have very sensitive skin and a sulfa allergy. I&#x27;ve spent tons of money on prescription meds for my scalp probs and nothing has worked except this shampoo. I use the whole line of black soap products now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped very quickly! !</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because of the conditioner. I purchased the conditioner at Walgreens while on vacation with family. I WILL NOT use my families beauty products/toiletries. I just prefer not to use harsh chemicals on my body. So, it was a must for me to stop and pick up the product brands I like. They were out of stock of the [[ASIN:B0038TVHGG Shea Moisture Organic Raw Shea Butter Moisture Retention Shampoo]] &amp; [[ASIN:B0038TYTI4 Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative conditioner - 12 oz.]] So I went with [[ASIN:B0089N6YA0 Shea Moisture ORGANIC African Black Soap Balancing Conditioner [SEALED]]] instead and some [[ASIN:B0038TXGL0 Shea Moisture ORGANIC Coconut &amp; Hibicus Curl &amp; Shine Shampoo]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like banana life savers and that&#x27;s good because when I used to eat life savers, the tropical ones were my favorite. It makes my hair feel squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I hadn&#x27;t been able to find any of my favorite hair shampoos or conditioners then I would have just purchase baking soda as the shampoo and vinegar for the conditioner and would have just mixed each one separately with water and used the baking soda paste as the hair wash and the diluted vinegar as the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a reference point, I have combination skin and oily hair.</li>
            <li> I have scalp psoriasis, so I decided to use this shampoo to help me out. Yeah, it did the job in cleaning my scalp, but a couple days later my scalp was sooo itchy, &amp; I knew it was the shampoo because that was the only thing different I used in my hair. PLUS on top of that, my hair was extremely tangled using the shampoo AND conditioner. I had to re-condition with another conditioner. Never Again. Now I&#x27;m stuck with this bottle -_-</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo, I really did.  I love the Raw Shea Butter shampoo from the same company but this one just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I was using this for a month until I noticed my scalp was itching like crazy.  It took a while to figure out that this shampoo was the culprit.  As soon as I stopped using this, my scalp cleared up in about a week.  I must be reacting to something in the shampoo.  I guess I will gift this to my mom or brothers.  On the plus side, a little goes a long way and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I was allergic to this :(</li>
            <li> This product did not really help with my scalp issues, there are much cheaper shampoos that will have the same results. Also, I realize this is Sulfate free, but this was extremely hard to use, it felt like I was rubbing glue in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others noticed, it left my hair feeling tangled and unmanageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is so overpriced on amazon AND in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate all natural products and was hopeful for what this line represents but, I Will not buy again!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have Nigerian-American natural hair of the \\&quot;4c\\&quot; curl pattern. I have an oily scalp with dry hair strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this shampoo up at Walgreen&#x27;s because I needed something that would totally cleanse my hair. I used to use all natural products, but for the past three weeks, I was using silicones in my wash out conditioners AND co-washing my hair (absolutely awful!). My hair was dull, weighed down, and dirty. My scalp (especially at the crown) was itchy like crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo was so effective and wonderful!!! I LOVE this shampoo. It&#x27;s corresponding conditioner is a must. This shampoo truly cleans the hair. Yes, your hair will feel \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot;. But that is the point of using shampoo. My scalp feels a 1000x better. I will never use silicones or co-wash again. The corresponding conditioner to this shampoo is wonderful. They both smell great! The shine and life has been restored to my hair. I&#x27;m going to continue washing my hair twice a week with this shampoo. It&#x27;s absolutely great for oily and itchy scalps.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a natural way to take care of my sometimes dry, itchy scalp. It has ingredients that fight scalp problems naturally, lathers well and smells like plantains. It doesn&#x27;t strip the moisture from my Afro-textured hair which is a huge plus when it comes to dandruff/clarifying shampoos. It works so it&#x27;s a staple in my hair care routine. I buy it from Target or Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. When I used the shampoo, I did my usual pre-shampoo (conditioner and/or oil) treatment and focused the shampoo on my scalp (as I do with any shampoo I use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingedients: Water, Decyl Glucoside, African Black Soap, Salicylic Acid , Willow Bark Extract, Neem Oil, Charcoal Powder, Tea Tree Oil, Jojoba Oil, Shea butter Oil, Aloe Vera Leaf Juice, Vitamin E  Rosemary Extract, Plantain Extract, Honeysuckle flower Extract, Japanese Honeysuckle Flower Extract</li>
            <li> Well, this slightly lessened my dandruff problem, but it didn&#x27;t get rid of it completely, unfortunately. The smell was also not the best, but I got used to it eventually. I would still reccomend this problem for anyone who has tried multpile dandruff solutions that didn&#x27;t work for them, thoguh!</li>
            <li> i particularly dont like the smell and the viscosity of this product, still, its better than any commercial product--claiming to be all natural with like 20000000 chemicals in it! anyway, it cleans--thats what it was meant for but i actually prefer the alaffia line of black soap shampoos (any one will do)...</li>
            <li> Good all-around shampoo. Read the ingredients.</li>
            <li> It does not do anything new or good at all for my hair.</li>
            <li> I did no like this product at all. The product made my hair very ruff. I had to use the conditioner to soften my hair. My hair texture is between type 3b and 3c. I rather use the conditioner only in this product line which is a very good product.</li>
            <li> My daughter has had psoriasis and it is almost gone after using the Shea product.  I highly recommend it and will be trying it myself!</li>
            <li> I suffer from seborrheic dermatitis, so finding a product that helps this condition is tricky. I picked up Shea Moisture&#x27;s African Black Soap Deep Cleansing Shampoo at Target in the hopes that it would alleviate some of my symptoms. The consistency of the shampoo is not great. It&#x27;s rather runny and I have to use a lot to get it all over my scalp, even with my short hair. Because it is a sulfate free shampoo the lather is also lacking, but that was to be expected. Compared to these minor issues, however, by far the most disappointing thing is that it does nothing for the flakes on my head. Even so, this shampoo still gets some praise from me. Unlike other products I&#x27;ve tried, this one does a fairly decent job at controlling the unbearable itch that often comes along with seb derm and I would much rather deal with flaking than itching. On top of that, it smells great and is relatively effective at cleaning my hair. I have found that I do need to condition afterward, though, as it is a little drying. Overall, I am not extremely disappointed with this product at all. It isn&#x27;t perfect, but it will soothe the more irritating symptoms of seb derm and serve as a good cleanser in general.</li>
            <li> It smells and did nothing for my severe dandriff problem.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It works great for my psoriasis on the scalp.  I use the conditioner as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review for people of all ethnicities so everyone can make an informed choice and hopefully buy more of this shampoo so it will stay unchanged and be available for a long, long time!!! About me:  American - Polish &amp; white, 43yo.  Slightly receding hairline at widows peak. I ran out of my other &#x27;so called NATURAL dandruff shampoo&#x27; and was stuck using my girlfriend&#x27;s salon &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;.  My NATURAL shampoo was OK at controlling itchy scalp and flakes/crud.  After a month of using my girlfriend&#x27;s product, I was constantly scratching my head and would find tiny scab-like things flaking out of my hair.  It was bad enough being a &#x27;flake manufacturing machine&#x27; but the random, intense itch sensation and scratching was definitely making matters worse as well as making me CRAZY! Note:  I use Rogaine Liquid every day for my receding hairline/widows peak. (yeah I know rogaine is not designed for this area, but it slows down the loss significantly)  Regardless, the problem areas are the sides and back of my head, not the top where I apply Rogaine.  I also use LA Looks Extreme Hold gel every day. As a HUGE fan of the 8oz black soap, I figured I&#x27;d give this a shot...mainly because I read ingredients:  Salicylic Acid from White Willow Bark and no sulfates at all.  I shampoo every morning and after about 5 days I noticed I hadn&#x27;t scratched my head for a while...I was like &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;!  Now it&#x27;s been 3 weeks since I&#x27;ve been using Shea Moisture - Deep Cleansing Shampoo and all is well. I have short(2&amp;#34;ish), soft hair that I get cut every 3-4 weeks so I can&#x27;t comment on how my hair would hold up over long term using this shampoo.  I can say that my hair looks a little thicker and has stopped shedding from Rogaine like it used to. Side note:  My girlfriend tried this shampoo a few days ago and immediately fell in love with it.  So much so that she threw her salon product in trash and brought this with her to her hair appointment tonight at 7:30pm.  (She is SouthAmerican with straight, dye-assisted blonde hair) **Update: 1/14/2016... per my girlfriend; it is NOT a good idea if you use any color in hair. This will strip/wash out the color after as little as one or two washes.  I have since reduced frequency to 2-3 days per week with this shampoo.  It&#x27;s Plenty for me.** I hope I can buy this shampoo for the next 20 years...or for as long as I have my hair! :-) One last thought:  This shampoo DOES NOT lather/foam up like traditional shampoos.  You don&#x27;t need to use more product, just splash a bit more water on it and it lathers better.  (Sodium lauryl/laureth sulfate is what makes the fancy foam, and it is also poisonous to humans...google it!) I hope this review is useful to people. Cheers</li>
            <li> First, this is a CLARIFYING shampoo. It literally says on the bottle, &amp;#34;Deep Cleansing Shampoo,&amp;#34; meaning it is going to strip your hair of any and every oil/product you have on it. So for the reviewers that said it left their hair dry, unruly, and tangled have probably been using this as a regular shampoo rather than a once-in-a-while shampoo. If your scalp is still itchy afterwards, then either you didn&#x27;t remove all of the buildup or you may be allergic to one of the ingredients listed.&lt;br /&gt;Second, you can buy this product for less at Wal-Mart, target, and sally&#x27;s. You&#x27;re probably better off buying it at one of these stores (or even a drugstore) than online. Anyway...&lt;br /&gt;I have type 4A hair (very coily) and I first used this product after I had taken some Senegalese twists out of my hair. I had a ton of product buildup, dandruff, and a dry, itchy scalp. I shampooed my hair in sections twice and used the raw shea butter conditioner. I haven&#x27;t had any dandruff or itchy scalp since using this product. I only use this once I see buildup. I use the raw shea butter line as my regular shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great shampoo, but only use it for clarifying and removing buildup. It is not an everyday shampoo. It is best for thick, curly/coily types and for those who suffer from constant dandruff/dermatitis/psoriasis. Looser hair types wouldn&#x27;t benefit from this product because the natural sebum in the scalp travels easier down the hair shaft than in tighter curls. Using this product will probably cause the oil glands to work over time, making your hair oilier faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Cheaper in stores, removes buildup, smells great&lt;br /&gt;Cons: More runny than normal shampoos</li>
            <li> I try not to shampoo my hair more often than every other day, and it tends to be on the oily side. I also do not use conditioner. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather a whole lot, and is runny (like someone else mentioned) but that is common in a lot of &#x27;natural&#x27; products I have used. It cleans my hair very well, even on days were it&#x27;s really oily. It also leaves my hair soft and manageable, without conditioner. I like the way it smells, but it&#x27;s not my favorite Shea Moisture scent.. I have been using this shampoo for just over a month and really like it.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo for those with scalp problems, including oily hair.  It can be used regularly for those with chronic issues, but for those who simply want to remove product buildup it should be used only occasionally.  It smells wonderful, really fresh and clean.  It controls my husband&#x27;s dandruff better than Head and Shoulders or Neutrogena T-Gel.  I like the fact that it contains natural ingredients and is sulfate free (sulfates can definitely cause scalp irritation).  My hair is medium in texture, somewhat wavy and color treated and this shampoo does not affect my hair color at all.  By the time I wash my hair, my scalp is quite oily and because I use several styling products, it is frequently sticky as well.  I only need one lathering of this shampoo to remove the excess oil and buildup. I wash my hair 2 to 3 times a week and use this every third time or so.  I also use the SM Raw Shea Butter shampoo regularly.  After shampooing I use the  Raw Shea Butter mask for about 15 minutes while I complete my shower.  Occasionally I use the mask for an hour using a heat cap.  This routine keeps dryness at bay (always a problem with long hair) and it leaves my hair bouncy and shiny.  Additionally, I like the SM Jamaican Black Castor Oil shampoo, which smells wonderful and which also removes buildup with apple cider vinegar but it is not as strong as the African Black Soap formula. I discovered SM raw shampoo through the online reviews because I was dissatisfied with what I was using and was seeking an alternative and I noticed that many of the reviewers were Caucasian.  In Walgreens, SM products are in a separate section that is devoted to African American hair care products so I had never given them a glance. I was in Ulta when I noticed the Jamaican shampoo and bought it because my colored hair needed a sulfate free buildup removing formula and I didn&#x27;t know that such a thing existed.  I was really anxious to try it and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I like all three formulas of SM shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried.  The strongest is the African Black Soap.  The raw shea butter formula takes some getting used to.  I had to use it 2 or 3 times before my hair responded to it.  I understand from the reviews that raw shampoo, while sulfate free, is an entirely different animal and it takes some time for your hair and scalp to adjust before you get the best results.  I also use the raw shea butter regular conditioner, which is lighter and really good too.  Any Walgreens or CVS carries this product line.  I recently ran into a huge buy 1 get 1 sale at Walgreens and I stocked up on my favorite formulas.  I use the raw shea butter formula the most frequently.  For a while I was using the Jamaican formula every time I shampooed but I think it was drying the ends of my hair out a little bit.  Some reviewers have stated that after using SM shampoos, their hair became extremely tangled, even matted.  This has not been my experience by any means.  I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t take much product to get wonderful sudsy lather (which is unlike other sulfate free formulas I&#x27;ve used).  And the conditioner and masks don&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.  With all of these formulas, my hair has fantastic body, no frizz and feels and looks extremely healthy.  For the best price, I suggest you check out the drugstores.  When not on sale, I pay $10.99 for any of the SM products.  I think this is a fair price.  However, none of the drugstores carry every one of the SM products.  (SM products are also available at Ulta and are sometimes on sale there too.) With these products (and a few excellent styling products) I have a good hair day almost every day.  I am a convert to SM.  I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t find out about these products sooner.  For those who hate silicone, SM products are silicone free, just FYI.  I enjoy giving my patronage to a small business that produces such great products.  I will try the body care SM products next.  I highly recommend this shampoo andall the SM products I&#x27;ve mentioned.all the SM products I&#x27;ve mentioned.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the way this shampoo does not strip my hair of its moisture. I&#x27;ve seen more growth and thickness since using this product</li>
            <li> I could smell the shampoo through the package. The bottle came to me leaking. Great shampoo though. My favorite to use.</li>
            <li> Shea has definetly helped in my battle with soriasis. Anyone suffering .......it&#x27;s worth a try. Very mild yet cleanses verywell.</li>
            <li> Works great for my natural hair. Fast shipping also. I would recommend this to any one who want a pure shampoo</li>
            <li> I truly wish i can give this shampoo 100 stars. My scalp was TERRIBLE. I have a very bad case of dandruff that won&#x27;t allow me to do  anything to my hair. I would wash today and as i am drying my hair i can see the flakes falling. My scalp also have a horrid odor. Anyone walking in after i dried my hair would ask if i truly washed my hair because it still smelled bad. It was so bad that my cousin would ask can she wash my hair for me because they felt as if i was not doing a good job washing it. Well tonight i washed for the third time with shea moisture shampoo, not only does my scalf feel clean i walked in my room after drying my hair and it smelled very nice. I bought also the conditioner and the masque. Great product</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo because I have relaxed hair. I use it after a perm because the shampoo that comes with the only perm I use burns my scalp....It has too many chemicals in it. This dosent. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because its a little watery, making you use more of it. But it smells great.</li>
            <li> When I say I have bad dandruff; I&#x27;m talking about the absolute worst thing you can think of. It got to the point that I could literally rub my hands through my hair for hours and produce mountains of flakes. It was like a snowstorm. Any of those with the condition that I have just mentioned know of its presence. This isn&#x27;t the- eat better, it&#x27;s your diet, or use head and shoulders or home remedies dandruff this is the incessant even when you think it&#x27;s gone dandruff it&#x27;s still there when you comb, itch, or for Christ&#x27;s sake take off a hat. Now with that being said, the sole reason I picked this stuff up today is because I used their basic original shampoo with basic moisturizing capabilities. I used that stuff for a while and while the flakes didn&#x27;t disappear, they most definitely were less abundant on my head. Mind you I am a lightskin individual (my father being white and my mother black) so I got stuck with the unfortunate dandruff gene. I immediately saw this stuff at CVS and had to give it a try simply because it was the same amazing company that had almost conquered the undesirable flake. After I got home from my run actually a couple hours ago I put the shampoo to the test. My god if anyone else is reading this and has the same condition as me I am telling you, no, begging you to please buy this. I got out of the shower and combed my hair and as usual since it was damp to no surprise there was no dandruff. I dryed it off with my towel and crossed my fingers and combed over and to my surprise, I swear I almost cried. Not a single flake. It has been almost two hours since I&#x27;ve used it and not a SINGLE flake in sight. I cannot say much in terms of the longevity as I have just used the product for a couple hours but if there was ANY recommendation as to which dandruff ridding solution was the best, most natural, and did absolutely no damage to ones hair. It would be this product right here. If it beat the pesky flake that I thought couldn&#x27;t be conquered it couldvery well do the same to you. I can&#x27;t believe I just took the time to type that all. I never post reviews especially on amazon, but if you have the flake.... And you have it like me, and you try and try and try to tell people or use a bunch of products, please use this so you can be just as overjoyed as I have been. Not a flake in sight. God it&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
            <li> Saw this shampoo and conditioner on a blog for people with scalp psoriasis.  In desperation, I ordered it and find that it does clean my scalp without drying it out.  The conditioner is also very cooling and soothing, and rinses clean with no residue.  Would definitely recommend for folks with flaky scalp conditions.</li>
            <li> Saw a couple product reviews on youtube for this shampoo and decided to try it out. I am at an APO address and it arrived surprisingly fast considering my location. As for the shampoo itself, after only using it one time i can tell you it cleans the grease and dirt build up out of your hair very effectively. Like all Shea Moisture products this one is made from all natural ingredients with the another plus being its perfect for moisturizing coarse/ethnic hard to handle hair. I am in my &amp;#34;wolfing&amp;#34; mode at the moment trying to get my waves back to we&#x27;ll see how much more effective after a few more washes. *cheers*</li>
            <li> I found this brand on the Skin Deep database as I was looking for all natural shampoos without the chemicals, irritants and whatnot. This particular one was the only one left at Target so I bought it even though I don&#x27;t have any scalp problems other than oiliness after about a day.&lt;br /&gt;My hair type is 1a, fine and really smooth, straight for the most part but gets oily really fast.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo did a great job and removing oils and build up. I haven&#x27;t really felt my hair this clean in a while. It is a drying shampoo (hence the deep clean) but for my hair  it balanced it out and made it look and feel really, really clean.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it is good in the future. I have only used it once so far. I would recommend it to people who have hair that is prone to oiliness and are looking for natural shampoo that balances it out. Never mind it is marketed as a shampoo for scalp treatment, even if your scalp is fine it did not make it any worse for me.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it lathers really good compared to my expectations. I thought it wouldn&#x27;t lather at all.</li>
            <li> I started buying this shampoo as an alternative to head and shoulders for my dandruff, I liked that it was sulfate free since I am transitioning to natural hair. It lathers well and the smell is tolerable (banana smell, not my favorite) but it strips my hair sooooooo much. At first I would only use it on my scalp and that worked out well but I also like to use it along the length of my hair every once in a while. Whenever I did that it would end up being a disaster! It dries out and tangles up the natural AND relaxed part of my hair, which causes my hair unnecessary breakage. My hair feels like straw and is super dry after. Even after using a deep conditioner and leave in AND oil! So if you do want to use it I recommend only on the scalp, as to avoid brittle hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo that gets rid of my dandruff and I have tried so many. This really works for me</li>
            <li> Love this stuff smells good &amp; great for flakey scalps.  A little pricey though</li>
            <li> help with my oily scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought it from walgreens B1G1F. its runny and does not lather well and I was worried its a fake, but it resolved my dermatitis. I have used other expensive and natural products, this is the only product that has worked. I also got the deep masque and conditioner. I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing ! I love it it cleans my hair but doesn&#x27;t steal all the moisture. I&#x27;m African American and it is made for our hair texture. I have 3c natural hair and it works amazing with it. I will be ordering the conditioner too! With this shampoo a small amount goes along way. It&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> My teenage son has seborrheic dermatitis which causes red scaly patches around his hairline.  We tried many different over the counter shampoos, but none of them worked and all of them had harsh chemicals which sometimes made his condition worse. I saw the Shea Moisture African Black Soap Shampoo in a Target store and decided to give it a try and I am really glad I did! Not only did it clear his dermatitis completely, it left his hair looking &amp; smelling great. This is a great product if you have oily skin that is also sensitive and a great price here at Amazon. A little goes a long way, so one bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have rather short, fine, thin straight hair and an itchy scalp. I actually really like this shampoo. The ingredients I can actually pronounce and no weird sulfates. The consistency is thicker than I expected, like a regular shampoo. My scalp feel fine and my hair feels soft and not dried out. I recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have scalp dematitis and this shampoo is incredible. I can&#x27;t even believe how amazing my scalp felt after I used it for the first time. It&#x27;s hard to describe, but the feeling is similar to scratching an itch that you haven&#x27;t been able to reach in years, and then it&#x27;s just gone. My skin did feel slightly tender after using it at first, but I think that&#x27;s because there was so much it needed to scrub off, so the sore feeling was actually pleasant. The redness and irritation completely disappeared after that. Seriously,  if you are like me and have tried everything for your scalp condition, just use this and be done with it. Honestly amazing.</li>
            <li> So I just bought this product and used it and I&#x27;m so happy with the results! I&#x27;ve been needing a cleansing shampoo for months but couldn&#x27;t find a good one that could cleanse the dandruff and scrub my scalp clean without leaving,it brittle. In order to replenish the oils, I followed it with a cream conditioner and then used argan oil 7 essentials spray to blowdry. After flat ironing, parted my hair in sections then rubbed my scalp with olive oil. My hair feels so clean! I plan on using it once more a month to make sure it gets everything...</li>
            <li> First of all, my hair has not dried yet, so I have no idea what it will do to my texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Caucasian with straight hair, but I was having some serious scalp itch and flakes. In one use, this has worked better than Head and Shoulders or any other common, commercially-available dandruff shampoo. I love that it&#x27;s sulfate-free as I suspect that my flakes had more to do with sulfate-sensitivity than actual dandruff. I usually only use baby shampoo and only developed heavy flakes after using Pantene (it was supposed to be moisturizing, but it dried my scalp out so bad I was embarrassed to wear it down and I wear a lot of black; this wasn&#x27;t even like, &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; dandruff, it was like, peeling in sheets...allergy? Chemical burn? No idea.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good. I am not itchy / stinging for the first time in weeks and my scalp is clear! As mentioned in other reviews, I don&#x27;t plan on using this every day, but maybe as maintenance once per week and go back to using baby shampoo the rest of the time.</li>
            <li> does a great job of cleaning hair and is free of irritating chemicals</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would help my daughters itchy and sometimes smelling scalp from eczema. We haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference yet. I used it and didn&#x27;t care for the effect on my hair. My mistake for not purchasing a conditioner. We will keep trying. Also, the fragrance isn&#x27;t too great. Too bad because I love all other Shea moisture products and their fragrances.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really deep cleans my hair and scalp without stripping it. It is a non-sulfate shampoo. Exfoliates and detoxifies my hair and scalp by removing product buildup, chlorine and hair water residue. Makes my hair shine. It does alleviate itching and flaking extremely well. I have 4a type hair and non sulfate shampoos are important to the health of our hair. I also like the smell. I will definitely buy again as this shampoo is one of my staples.</li>
            <li> Once again, I&#x27;ve tried something a lot of people were already saying didn&#x27;t work for their hair. Nevertheless, I still needed to try it for myself. This shampoo is a trickster. Upon first touch of my hair, this shampoo left my hair feeling soft and moisturized--then came the storm. When I washed my hair with this longer, my hair instantly tangled and became very hard, dry and brittle--not cute at all. The shampoo did get my scalp clean though. I would still recommend that people try this product to see if it works for them. You can not just go off of what people say, and some people hair take well to protein--mine--not so much. At least I can say I was not disappointed with the results this product had left me, as I already was aware of what this product could possibly do to my hair. Also, I&#x27;d just like to say that this product is 9.99 on walgreens website, and if you plan on trying the collection or spending 25$ or more, you can get free shipping. I love the masque in this collection though!</li>
            <li> This product is all that and a bag of chips. I have 3c/4a hair and very dry, itchy scalp. I used this once and - BAM!!! The itch is gone. I haven&#x27;t had an intense itch for days, plus the smell is very yummy!!! My hair felt soft, moisturized, and defined without leaving it dry for a clarifying shampoo. A little goes a long way.  You&#x27;re also better off buying at Walmart, target, or Walgreens. I think I&#x27;m better off using this shampoo only because everything else will make my scalp itch like crazy. Buy and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I was beginning to develop a real scalp problem. I have naturally curly 3b hair and have been wearing it straight all winter which means washing it only once or twice a week. A few months ago it began itching and the intensity only increased. It got so bad the itching would begin within an hour or two of washing--it was was becoming embarassing at work and I was scratching so hard I was starting to get scabs on my scalp. My stylist said it&#x27;s due to the cold dry weather.    I tried a few things including Scalpacin, which felt like \\&quot;half measures\\&quot;. They either didn&#x27;t work, or would temporarily alleviate the symptoms but not attack the root cause. Finally I tried this shampoo. I&#x27;ve used it now twice.     One word: Amazing. After one use I saw immediate effects. My scalp feels healthier, no more scabs. The itching was gone immediately. The itching did return about 4 days after washing, but at a severe fraction of the intensity. And four days is a far cry from the one to two hours I was experiencing before this. I&#x27;m hoping with continued use, I&#x27;ll see prolonged effects.    I wasn&#x27;t expecting this shampoo to do anything for my texture, but boy was I pleasantly surprised. My hair is now incredibly soft and smooth. It feels like I just got a refresher on my keratin treatment.    Also, I love that this is sulfate free. I avoid sulfates --to protect my curls and my keratin treatment. And this is all natural, which is an added bonus.     I am so pleased with this product I went out today and bought the conditioner and masque in this line--which also have great reviews. Hoping the system used together will have even greater benefits/effects.</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo! Started using it about a month ago and I find the paraben free formula just perfect for my hair. It might be too clarifying for some, but for thick, unmanageable hair, it&#x27;s a perfect fit for cleansing the hair, grabbing the dirty oils, and giving you a beautiful fresh head of hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  I think this may have been the first thing from Shea Moisture I tried - both the shampoo and the conditioner together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this shampoo as a clarifying shampoo - so only about once a month, or when I take down braids.  For that, this shampoo is amazing!  I have 4a/4b curly/coily hair and this actually doesn&#x27;t dry it out at all; it clearly removes all the build-up from my hair without stripping it.  I also love the way it smells!  A sweet plantain smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband also has a very itchy scalp and some kind of scalp condition (not really sure what).  I bought him the shampoo and conditioner to use and he&#x27;s used it every since; it doesn&#x27;t completely heal the condition, but it makes it a little more manageable for him.</li>
            <li> My husband has dandruff, possibly mild psoriasis, and this works amazingly well. He says his hair &amp; scalp feel like they did when he was 7 years old.  He jokes that he has Ken hair now (Ken &amp; Barbie). He wants me to buy it by the case!  He uses it with Shea Moisture African Black Soap Purification Hair Masque.</li>
            <li> My (then) two year old is mixed with curly hair. During the winter he started getting dandruff. Big flaky dandruff. Blech. I am not a fan. I didn&#x27;t want to use anything too harsh or full of chemicals so I ended up trying this. BEST DECISION EVER. Seriously his dandruff was completely gone within two or three washings. I would highly recommend this product. It lasts forever too. I occasionally use it on my super thin, straight hair as a clarifying shampoo and it works wonders!</li>
            <li> This product worked well for me when I had pityriasis because it didn&#x27;t irritate my already inflammed scalp. It&#x27;s great for scalp that is itchy due to dry skin. BUT DO NOT BUY THIS HERE. It is not worth $20 a bottle. Just go to Target&#x27;s Web site and purchase it for less than $10.</li>
            <li> I love the body wash and tried the shampoo. Makes my hair FEEL really clean and shiny</li>
            <li> I am SOOOO happy i found this! It was by chance when buying shea moisture baby for my boys (that is all i use on them, best product ever) NOTHING has cleared my scalp until now. In fact, most things made it worse. My scalp was so disgusting that i would spend an hour just trying to clear all of the flakes from my hair. Then i would put a scarf around my head on really bad days. I have tried EVERYTHING from coconut oil, tea tree oil, acv, head and shoulders, and i have purchased 4 different natural dandruff/dry scalp shampoos here and they all made my scalp worse. I even cut things from my diet to try to improve it. This cleared it after 1 use and it has been two weeks! I am obsessed. I used the conditioner in conjunction with this. It is MAGIC IN A BOTTLE. Buy it, you will thank the me &amp; shea moisture gods.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  It makes my hair soft with loose curls and not frizzy.  This is my favorite hair care line ever, and I have tried so many of them!  I use this shampoo with the Shea Butter Moisture Retention conditioner and the Shea Butter Restorative Elixir, but I like this so much more than the Shea Butter Mositure Retention shampoo.  I love how it makes my scalp not so crusty and itchy, and it makes my hair soft and not at all frizzy.  I wil say the conditioner and elixir are both required for me too though.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! I have very fine hair but a lot of hair, so normal shampoos don&#x27;t get all of the buildup out of my hair. I can use this everyday without it drying out my hair! (my hair is on the oily side though). I also really love the smell of this shampoo. Please don&#x27;t stop making this, I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone that has dreads. She said it works great!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have severe scalp psoriasis and have tried SEVERAL products, including prescription shampoos from the dermatologist. When I couldn&#x27;t find relief for my latest breakout, I did some research online about more natural remedies. I thought I would give this a try because it was cheaper than other brands, and it had NO CHEMICALS! This stuff really really REALLY cleanses your scalp of all impurities. No dandruff, no scales, no dry patches. Nothing but my clean itch-free scalp. However, this shampoo does strip a lot of the natural oils in your hair. That is why I also purchased the balancing conditioner that goes with this shampoo to help replenish some of the moisture to my hair. This shampoo has a bit of a funky scent to it (plantain extract, willow bark and tea tree) but I think it smells sweet. The BEST use of this shampoo is to wash your hair with it once a week and then use regular shampoo every other day. Another thing, if you desperately want to clear up your psoriasis, it&#x27;s best if you follow this regimen along with taking some fish oil supplements, drinking plenty of water and doing exercise. Hope this really helps!!</li>
            <li> caused more itching than before. i had a severe allergic reaction to this product which affected my scalp and backside where the soap landed. would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I started off with the Shea Moisture Shea Butter Shampoo and Conditioner. I loved the shampoo and the conditioner wasn&#x27;t the best but I was invested enough to try the rest of their line. Walgreens had a BOGO (Buy one get one free) sale so I bought this shampoo, the purification mask, the hibiscus milk and my favorite shea butter shampoo. I was experiencing an itchy scalp so I used this. I&#x27;m not happy with the results. My hair felt so stripped it literally squeaked after the rinse. I had to hurry and do a moisture treatment. And worst of all, my scalp actually became more itchy! I went back back to the shea butter shampoo for my next wash and all was well again. Not wanting to waste it, I use the black soap shampoo as a body wash, which it actually seems better suited for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shea Moisture products have been a hit or miss for me. I love the Shea Butter Shampoo and Deep Conditioner Treatment, The Black Soap Purification Masque, and The Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie. Also the shea moisture line is sold in stores and on their respective websites (walgreens and target) for 9.99, so don&#x27;t let them price gouge you here! Walgreens offers free shipping for all orders over $25. I always get my shea moisture stuff from walgreens</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m seeing reviews saying it&#x27;s too drying, and maybe it&#x27;s not the best if you&#x27;ve got long hair. My hair is naturally straight and limp and I keep it cut short, so I generally like shampoos that leave it a little dry so it has more body. I also have gross oily skin- including on my scalp. This shampoo is made with black soap AND salicylic acid, so it killed off all the bacteria on my scalp. It is so awesome not to have an itchy head. If you value a happy scalp over soft hair, get this stuff.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. I&#x27;ve always had issues with an itchy scalp and dandruff. A couple years ago, I took the plunge into &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; and started washing my hair with baking soda and vinegar. I&#x27;ve switched it around to castile soap and vinegar, and back to baking soda, but to no avail. My scalp looked like the gross pictures you see on Google when you want to feel better about your own dandruff problems. I also don&#x27;t wash my hair that often because it&#x27;s wayyyy better for your hair. Unfortunately, I have naturally greasy skin. So it gets oily and used to get so itchy I couldn&#x27;t stand it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, back to the review. I started using this stuff about a month ago. I wash my hair about every 5 days. I also purchased the conditioner with this.&lt;br /&gt;It started working RIGHT AWAY. I noticed I wasn&#x27;t scratching my head as much, and while I still had dandruff, it wasn&#x27;t as bad as it had been. I leave the shampoo on for a couple minutes, and then leave the conditioner on for 5+ minutes.&lt;br /&gt;This helps solve the dandruff issue with the power of tea tree, willow bark, and salicylic acid. I&#x27;ve tried all these ingredients separately to clear up my scalp but to no avail. But dang, does this stuff WORK.&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning, I used their Intensive Scalp Elixir to combat the itchiness. And boy, does that work too! I&#x27;m not really using it anymore as the itch urge has gone away, but the elixir is a MUST if you&#x27;re a scratcher like me. It makes those first two washes (about a week and a half) way more bearable.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t totally getting all the results I wanted with the shampoo/conditioner, so I also got the hair masque (ALL of this is in the African Black Soap line, btw). That extra bit really, really helped. So now I barely have any dandruff after a month of using this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY CON is that it goes SO FAST. I have to use a LOT to clean my hair (I have a lot of fine hair down to my shoulders. Not super thick). I&#x27;ve used it about six-ish times and the bottle is almost halfway done. Maybe I&#x27;m not used to shampoo and conditioner after using castile soap and vinegar for so long, but I feel like this takes a lot. And it&#x27;s kind of expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TO SUM:&lt;br /&gt;Works extremely well for dandruff&lt;br /&gt;I use it in combination with the conditioner and hair masque from the same line&lt;br /&gt;The elixir is a must if you have an itchy scalp&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of expensive. It&#x27;s cheaper from the SheaMoisture site (free shipping over $35) or Target.&lt;br /&gt;It goes really quickly&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not used to the scent of black soap, you might find it a little weird.

            <li> It cleanses my hair well but..DRIES it out so bad...my hair feels like straw afterwards. I ususally only do like one lather but will only use this as a last resort if i run out of the coconut hibiscus one which is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to switch everything in our home to chemical free. After reading the ingredients of this products, I thought I had found an answer for natural chemical free ingredients. Well, I was correct in that the ingredients are great for us to use everyday, but when you use it, it is very difficult to get anything that feels like shampoo in our hair. And, it is really thick so its hard to get out.  I will not be buying any more of this products unless they change the formula to make it more shampoo like. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian with some serious Greek curls. My hair is very curly, with thin strands but lots of them. reaching down to my lower back. If dirty, it becomes very dry and  tangled, so I am always careful to have plenty of moisturizing and detangling tools on hand. However, because of this I am often left with product residue that I am unable to reach or get out of that back area, on top of my head, and it has been a frustrating bane of my existence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Shea Moisture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made sure to read most of the reviews here and some of the consumers complained about the stress that this product produces on hair and scalp, so needless to say I was a bit hesitant. I purchased this shampoo at 3 am on one of those &amp;#34;can&#x60;t sleep- so I will shop&amp;#34; nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When  it arrived I was expecting it to reek of tea tree, and while I love it for household cleaning and medicinal stuff, I am not wild about wearing it as my new perfume. It smelled of Shea butter and it had a very gentle fragrance to it.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to &amp;#34;pretreat&amp;#34; areas where I have the most issues and build-up first and to ensure that I did not feel any burning on my scalp (some of the &amp;#34;hair falling-out&amp;#34; comments concerned me enough to do a patch testing).&lt;br /&gt;After wetting it, I lightly applied the shampoo directly to the scalp where I was having the largest amount of build-up, and then tied the hair up and let the steam of the shower do its magic for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I experienced minimal tingling, which I actually like as it makes me feel as if the product is seeping in and doing its job. I then used the shampoo through out my whole scalp area, leaving the ends out as much as possible. The latter was rich and it felt great massaging it between the strands.&lt;br /&gt;Rinsing it out was easy, and my hair did not feel as if it was tangled (more then usual after applying shampoo) nor was it stripped dry. I applied one of the Shea moisture moisturizing masks afterward to ensure lasting hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When rinsed out, my hair was squeaky clean without that frizzy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My build-up was gone, and the hair was super shiny and soft.  The curls were formed perfectly, and even using a hair dryer ( I was in a rush, plus I wanted to subject the shampoo to all the possible scenarios) did not affect my hair negatively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that I always brush my hair out prior to wetting it in order to minimize any breakage. I use spray bottle filled with warm water and a few drops of rosemary oil. This helps in detangling those stubborn knots and softens my hair follicles. This may add to the experience:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product. While not meant for everyday use, it has become a crucial part of my cleansing routine. It helps to cleanse my hair, but it also promotes healthy growth and general look of it. What more could I ask from a hair product?</li>
            <li> A gentle sweet smelling wonderful shampoo and especially good for anyone with hair damage, like from over-processing, or a dry scalp.  I recently suffered from patches of scalp psoriasis and this product was so gentle on my skin.  It cleaned my hair and restored the moisture that was robbed away by other psoriasis shampoo treatments.  I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis in my scalp really bad and my scalp itches like crazy. I tried this and the psoriasis is practically gone and no itching. It&#x27;s about 10.00 a bottle, but it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li> This soap is perfect for DREADLOCKS!  I use it, it contains tea tree oil, which prevents fungus, helps itch, and repels lice.  It smells so amazing, my fianc&amp;eacute; even started using it for himself.  It is completely 100% residue-free, and it is safe and won&#x27;t cause any build up at all. :D</li>
            <li> Amazing especially for psoriasis and eczema of the scalp, gives hair a wonderful texture.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind this product line is made for Black people, particularly those with natural hair. With that in mind this shampoo is NOT a regular shampoo. Most Black people, especially those who are natural hair, DONT shampoo their hair often and some not at all. Also, naturals tend to use a lot of products on their hair, which can cause product build up. This is a CLARIFYING shampoo, so it&#x27;s meant to strip the hair and scalp of everything. Yes, it leaves some moisture, but only as much as a clarifying shampoo can. So, if you are of another race using this shampoo DO NOT think it is like a regular shampoo, because it&#x27;s not. I don&#x27;t recommend using this more than once a week, because it is geared towards a race who&#x27;s hair and hair care needs aren&#x27;t the same as yours. That&#x27;s not to say you can&#x27;t use this line, but to better assist anyone with using this.</li>
            <li> I picked up this shampoo at Walgreens in desperation when the health food store stopped stocking my natural fragrance free shampoo.  I love this product! It cleans out the crap I pick up daily from just living and working, and for the first time in years I no longer have itching or dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;In response to those who find the shampoo drying and shake their heads at my almost daily use I respond: My go-to shampoo until I was in my late twenties was a bar of homemade lye soap so this is no more drying for me than the lye soap.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone who suffers from fragrance or other additive allergies.</li>
            <li> It does help with scalp itch and psoriasis- only thing is I wish it lathered up a little more. My hair SOAKS it up, which I guess is a good thing. I just feel like I have to use a lot of it. I am a dude with pretty short hair too. I really do like it though.</li>
            <li> I am still corcern because I agree with most reviews it did left my hair drying and unmanaged. I guess they use too much of \\&quot;drying ingredients\\&quot; like sacylic , willow bark, etc. But I guess it is only purpose to be put on scalp not hair. I will buy squeeze bottle for next time, so it can go straight to my scalp not hair. I will see if it works. I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again if it conutinues to getting dry like that, from me put on scalp. It has a lot of foaming so it was hard for me keep it on scalp. I will have to find tube container that is very tiny going directly to scalp. They are right scalp was itchy once again after I used it I had to use apple cider vingear. It has great anti bacterial proptery and is known to many ppl for relieving itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will just have to wait and see if it works on scalp , I think I remember someone on youtube say it is better to dilute them so it will not be too strong. What I will do is dilute it with wate in tube container and put directly on scalp, wash off with apple cider vingear then do conditioner on hair to root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my scalp continues to itch for 2 weeks, i would throw it away&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finna put it in squeeze tube and it works as I thought! I found out that I can&#x27;t relieve itchy without using it! It only works if you use a little of them and dilute with water just like dilute 50% water w/ .5% or 10% of apple vingear. Sometimes some ppl needs add honey or anything moisturzed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shake well first to settle down natural ingredient in black soap, then squeeze out a little and dilute water. Here you go!</li>
            <li> I have short hair, but this shampoo works really well for me.  Maybe the people who say it causes skin problems are allergic to some of the natural ingredients??  I found it to be excellent and doesn&#x27;t have sodium laurel sulfate or propylene glycol in it like most cheap shampoos do.</li>
