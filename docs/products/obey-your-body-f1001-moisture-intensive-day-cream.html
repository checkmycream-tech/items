            <li> love both face and eye creams! very moisture filled creams....great for skin when the sun puts stress which can dry your face out too much. Best for skin that is not oily, otherwise you will feel too greasy.</li>
            <li> My face always appears dry in the colder months especially and this really seemed to make it less dry, which is good enough for me!</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my mom and it does wonders for her face. She is in her late 50&#x27;s and has a dry skin. After about 3 weeks of usage the difference was very obvious. Her face brightened and tightened up. Very pleased and price definitely meets the value. Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t go much higher as the first time I purchased it, it was less than twenty dollars and it rapidly (within months) went up to over forty dollars per cream.</li>
            <li> The product came in good condition only boxes were a bit damaged. Product otherwise perfect as you would buy  it in shop directly. Delivery was good too. I would defintely oder here again. Pricewise its even better than the shop.</li>
            <li> little too expensive, small amount for only 2-3 months depending how much and when you use it. The good part about it contains a lot of good ingredients that are good for the skin, it&#x27;s not oily won&#x27;t leave your skin looking shiny after application. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> excellent service&lt;br /&gt;Cream seems good, non-greasy which is what I was looking for&lt;br /&gt;I have the soap which I really, really like</li>
            <li> On a scale of 1-10, this gets a 10!</li>
            <li> This is the best facial product, it will remove removes layers of dry skin</li>
            <li> Good quality and price.</li>
            <li> I just started using this procduct and I really like the way it feels on my skin.  It seems like my make-up looks much better over this cream.  I bought my first jar at a kiosk in the mall and thought I got a good deal at $39.  I love the feel on my skin.  I don&#x27;t want to run out of this product, ever.</li>
            <li> excellent cream!!!!!! Recommended to all of you. so good!!!!!!!!! Take it!!!!!!! Amazing cream!!!!!!!! Price is really awesome and the quality fantastic.</li>
            <li> I normally use this product, so it was not a blind purchase. Great cream and great price on Amazon. If you google it and research it, you will pay more elsewhere.</li>
            <li> For some reason it didn&#x27;t make a difference. You&#x27;d need to apply a lot just to remove dryness. Would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Its good my wife loves it</li>
            <li> A friend gave me some of this for a gift and wasn&#x27;t sure where to get more. Was so happy to find this on your web site.</li>
            <li> This product is the best!</li>
            <li> I have used many face moisturizers because I have dry skin.  This one seems to help with that problem.  Also, it doe not have perfume in it.</li>
            <li> My sweetheart loves this, so I love it. I pay a fraction of what she paid and she doesn&#x27;t know, that makes me look like a big spending hero.&lt;br /&gt;I do the same with her jewelry, we shop at the mall for what she likes but I sure as heck don&#x27;t buy it there!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon ROCKS!</li>
            <li> I received the product and I am very pleased.  I will definitely recommend to a friend and will definitely be purchasing again.  Delivery was great.</li>

            <li> THE JURY IS STILL OUT. JUST STARTED USING IT SO WILL HAVE TO SEE. FEELS GOOD AT THIS POINT . LIKE THAT IT HAS SPF.</li>
            <li> This cream is light yet provides great coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to any one with dry to normal skin types.</li>
            <li> The best face cream I have ever used</li>
