    <ol>
            <li>Works great !</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li>It works you just need to practice to get it perfect.</li>
            <li>Excellent!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great eyelid tape.</li>
            <li>These are great - they if you have oily skin</li>
            <li>Just make sure to follow the instructions on the label!</li>
            <li>It kind of works</li>
            <li>I loved, loved, loved, that first generation product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, these seem to blend really nicely with skin and have really good sticking/staying power, unlike some of the cheaper options available on ebay</li>
            <li>So sweet!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still I love it.</li>
            <li>Much better than the tape.</li>
            <li>I have asymmetrical eyes and use eyelid tape to make them appear more even.</li>
            <li>However, eyeshadow must be applied AFTER tape application because you can&#x27;t apply the tape on top of eyeshadow powder.</li>
            <li>With the correct eyeshadow colors and technique, you will be able to hide the tape quite well.</li>
            <li>No one will be able to tell you are wearing it unless they are specifically trying to look for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but most people aren&#x27;t looking out for tape on their friends&#x27; eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brand can improve it by making it easier to peel off the backing but aside from that, I&#x27;ve found it better than most of its competitors.</li>
            <li>I personally love the BN one</li>
            <li>(this product I am reviewing now) better, cause it&#x27;s easier to handle.</li>
            <li>But once I got the hang of it, it was love.</li>
            <li>maybe I need more practice.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>First the shipping is very fast and the package I received was in very good condition.</li>
            <li>This tape is strong and it takes the top layers of the skin off after a while.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also found that if applied to the eyelid correctly, this tape is easy to disguise with makeup.</li>
            <li>Very natural and also stick good on the eyelid .</li>
            <li>This BN fiber is just as sticky and comfortable on my eyelids.</li>
            <li>very easy to use， and very helpful！</li>
            <li>But it totally worth a try!</li>
            <li>It is by far the best double eyelid maker ..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so strong that even when you take it off at night, the crease can sometimes last until the following day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried quite a number of eyelid tape brands and this seems to be the best quality.  </li>
            <li>I love it because it stick very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The product is authentic and very well-made.</li>
            <li>Since once you get some practices, it&#x27;s really easy, and makes your eye big and cute.</li>
            <li>I agree that this is one of the product&#x27;s main flaws, and when you buy it for the first time, you might ruin many pieces of tape trying to peel them off.</li>
            <li>One tip I have for eye make-up application is that everything has to be done super gently!</li>
            <li>Be very gentle with your eyeshadow brush and take your time with the eyeshadow application.</li>
            <li>I had to use eyelid glue before putting the tape on but it worked only a bit better than either product alone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sort of funny.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work, but it&#x27;s a lot more affordable than some brands out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great value too since you get 105pcs (which, like the old Mezaik ones, I pull and cut in half and use 1 fiber for both eyes).</li>
            <li>If this cannot be achieved no matter how many times you try, the piece of tape might be too long for you.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s in skin color that allows you to really hide the fiber.</li>
            <li>I ended up tossing the whole package.</li>
            <li>Really easy to use, very sticky and lasts long.</li>
            <li>Not a lot people in US here are familiar with the double eyelid tape</li>
            <li>I started using AB mezical fibers, the original one, shortly before they discontinued the product.</li>
            <li>since they changed to the new version, the fibers are stiffer and do not cooperate!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and i was using it to correct my left eye to my right</li>
            <li>With this one, it looks super natural, so you don&#x27;t have to put on a crap load of makeup on top of it to hide the fact that youre wearing eyelid tape, and it;s super comfortable and you can barely feel it when you blink.</li>
            <li>First of all, I think it&#x27;d be helpful for you as reviewing readers to know that I am 22, Asian, and was born with monolids.</li>
            <li>However if you have thin eyelids, and you choose a narrow tape, this problem is just minor; 3 double side tape is usually pretty wide (~2mm), it creates a crease on your eyelid by attaching (glueing) your skin together, it may works fine, but a problem is that since it tapes a large area of your skin together,  it&#x27;s not very comfortable;4 in my opinion, the best product, if you have fair or thin eyelids, are the fiber types, there are two brands for this, AB and BN.</li>
            <li>My skin is thin on my eyelids, so the tape stretches it, pulls it, pinches it, and does not go on straight no matter how many times I do it.</li>
            <li>My right eye is a little more temperamental and lazy, so it still takes some coaxing.</li>
            <li>BN Micro Fiber tape works well, and I prefer it to the other kind of tape that isn&#x27;t double-sided as it is far less obvious and easier to hide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keeping my eye open, I press down on the eyelid to ensure the tape is secure.</li>
            <li>Overall I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I used to use the old version of the mezaik fibers; i would actually use one fiber for both eyes b/c they stretched out long enough and it was easy to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been use various of products to create double eyelid on my monolayer eyes since I was in high school.</li>
            <li>I already have natural double eyelids (just asymmetrical)</li>
            <li>At the two year mark, my left eye lid flipped itself into that position naturally; I did not have to use tape on that lid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little confusing to learn how to use it at first, but if you watch a youtube tutorial or two, it&#x27;ll all be fine.</li>
            <li>I have previously been using the AB Mezical Fiber (first generation) for the last 4 years.</li>
            <li>To get the silver ends off the tape, I grip the tape in the middle (either gently with the tips of my fingernails or with a pair of tweezers - be careful not to grip the sticky middle portion with your actual fingers or it may lose stickiness), then use the fingernails on my other hand to gently peelthe silver end off.</li>
            <li>Deliver very fast, and I got little present.</li>
            <li>one side eye tape works okay on both thin and thick eyelids, but when your eyes blinks, or you close your eyes or look down, people will easily see it.</li>

            <li> I, personally, trim each piece of tape before I use it as I&#x27;ve found it is too long for my eyes.</li>
            <li> With practice, you will find that if you angle the silver end upwards as you are slowly peeling it off, it will actually start to lift the sticky tape off the white backing on the other side, making it much easier to peel the tape off the white backing</li>
            <li> /&gt;Should the ends of the tape start to show after long hours of wear (this can sometimes happen, but not all the time), just dab eyeshadow on to the ends that are showing to hide the appearance of the tape.</li>
            <li> If you wear it for a long time it may start to irritate a bit.</li>
            <li> The packaging was not user-friendly or efficient; the tape did NOT last as long, nor was it waterproof, as the first generation eye tape (sometimes I had to reapply a FEW times through the day!); the tape would break as I was carefully stretching it - a waste, as it broke before I could even use it.</li>
            <li> BN Micro Fiber double eye tape was nothing compared to the previous AB lid tape I was using.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to cut it off, the tape shows, the double eyelids don&#x27;t stay a long time, and is hard to use in general.</li>
            <li> When I release the upper fold of the eyelid, it usually falls into the correct position over the tape.</li>
            <li> When you close your eye again, there should not be any part of the tape visible - it should all be hidden under the fold you created.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but I don&#x27;t doubt that it works for some girls with thicker skin and less droopiness in their eyelids.</li>
            <li> recommend it go with makeups since its still a little bit visible without makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re similar to the old Mezaik ones except maybe a little bit wider, but not in a noticeable annoying way.</li>
            <li> The one thing it did do well was hold up my lids when it decided to cooperate with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product for people who are serious about eye lid tapes and do not like to waste time and money; however, if there is someone who likes to waste time and money, this product is made for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (i have tried quite a few!)    </li>
            <li> The updated AB version is horrible and I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find a replacement that worked just as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Daiso&#x27;s double eyelid tape for a while, and it was really annoying because I could always feel the double eyelid tape on my lids</li>
            <li> its too hard to handle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a bit hard to use sometimes.</li>
            <li> I have hard time applying it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to cut where I want and it moves when I try to cut it</li>
            <li> -i ruined at least 5 before i got 1 to stick in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you have thick eyelid, the glue types won&#x27;t work so well, since you will need something to support the eyelids in order to show the crease;2.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen some other reviews that talk about how difficult it is for them to peel the tape off the backing.</li>
            <li> I have droopy puppy dog eyelids, so when I use the tape, my eyes still droop because I have so much skin,  except there is a nasty uneven fold going across my droopy eyelid.</li>
            <li> The backing is very hard to peel off.</li>
            <li> This product has poor design, it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This is a silly novelty, at least for me.</li>
            <li> so people will just think \\&quot;you have something weird on you</li>
            <li> Difficult to cut the end of the tape once placed on eyelid.</li>
            <li> difficult to use...</li>
            <li> I hate this poor design product... and will never purchase it ever again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shinny handle can not take off, it is very difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very difficult to apply.&lt;br /&gt;2nd, rectangle shape?</li>
            <li> /&gt;3rd, badly performance...</li>
            <li> /&gt;And then some idiot decided to stop making it.</li>
            <li> I hated it.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> either i&#x27;m uncoordinated or this product is not for me. its too hard to handle-i ruined at least 5 before i got 1 to stick in place.&lt;br /&gt;i cannot recommend this  but i will try another product.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best double eyelid maker .. It&#x27;s just a bit hard to use sometimes.</li>
            <li> very easy to use， and very helpful！</li>
            <li> I love it because it stick very well.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it go with makeups since its still a little bit visible without makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Still I love it.</li>
            <li> It kind of works but I think I prefer tapes instead.</li>
            <li> Works great ! Very natural and also stick good on the eyelid . Much better than the tape. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have asymmetrical eyes and use eyelid tape to make them appear more even. BN Micro Fiber tape works well, and I prefer it to the other kind of tape that isn&#x27;t double-sided as it is far less obvious and easier to hide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is definitely a learning curve to using it - especially if you have never used eyelid tape before. Everyone has a different method for achieving their desired effect because everyone&#x27;s eyes are different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I do not use the stick they provide for &#x27;poking&#x27; the eyelid into place. I already have natural double eyelids (just asymmetrical) so I simply lift the eyelid fold with my fingers into its desired &#x27;position&#x27;, then close the eye to figure out where the fold starts. Then, I place the tape on the edge of where the fold should be. I lift the upper part of the eyelid again while opening the eye. When I release the upper fold of the eyelid, it usually falls into the correct position over the tape. Keeping my eye open, I press down on the eyelid to ensure the tape is secure. When you close your eye again, there should not be any part of the tape visible - it should all be hidden under the fold you created. If this cannot be achieved no matter how many times you try, the piece of tape might be too long for you. I, personally, trim each piece of tape before I use it as I&#x27;ve found it is too long for my eyes. I cut off one of the silver-tipped ends entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen some other reviews that talk about how difficult it is for them to peel the tape off the backing. I agree that this is one of the product&#x27;s main flaws, and when you buy it for the first time, you might ruin many pieces of tape trying to peel them off. To get the silver ends off the tape, I grip the tape in the middle (either gently with the tips of my fingernails or with a pair of tweezers - be careful not to grip the sticky middle portion with your actual fingers or it may lose stickiness), then use the fingernails on my other hand to gently peelthe silver end off. With practice, you will find that if you angle the silver end upwards as you are slowly peeling it off, it will actually start to lift the sticky tape off the white backing on the other side, making it much easier to peel the tape off the white backing later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just personally how I do it, and what works for me. Others may have different methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also found that if applied to the eyelid correctly, this tape is easy to disguise with makeup. People can&#x27;t tell I am wearing any. One tip I have for eye make-up application is that everything has to be done super gently! Otherwise the tape will come off as you are applying makeup. Always apply your eyeliner BEFORE, and not after, you put on the tape. The dragging motion of the eyeliner on your lid can be enough to pull your lid away from the tape. However, eyeshadow must be applied AFTER tape application because you can&#x27;t apply the tape on top of eyeshadow powder. It won&#x27;t stick. Be very gentle with your eyeshadow brush and take your time with the eyeshadow application. With the correct eyeshadow colors and technique, you will be able to hide the tape quite well. No one will be able to tell you are wearing it unless they are specifically trying to look for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should the ends of the tape start to show after long hours of wear (this can sometimes happen, but not all the time), just dab eyeshadow on to the ends that are showing to hide the appearance of the tape. Again, with practiced application, this can hide the tape quite well. It will only seem obvious to you because you know it is there but most people aren&#x27;t looking out for tape on their friends&#x27; eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great eyelid tape. The brand can improve it by making it easier to peel off the backing but aside from that, I&#x27;ve found it better than most of its competitors.</li>
            <li> First the shipping is very fast and the package I received was in very good condition. Thumbs up!! The product is authentic and very well-made. I&#x27;ve been use various of products to create double eyelid on my monolayer eyes since I was in high school. And I am going to share some of my experiences here: 1. if you have thick eyelid, the glue types won&#x27;t work so well, since you will need something to support the eyelids in order to show the crease;2. one side eye tape works okay on both thin and thick eyelids, but when your eyes blinks, or you close your eyes or look down, people will easily see it. Not a lot people in US here are familiar with the double eyelid tape so people will just think \\&quot;you have something weird on you eyes\\&quot;. However if you have thin eyelids, and you choose a narrow tape, this problem is just minor; 3 double side tape is usually pretty wide (~2mm), it creates a crease on your eyelid by attaching (glueing) your skin together, it may works fine, but a problem is that since it tapes a large area of your skin together,  it&#x27;s not very comfortable;4 in my opinion, the best product, if you have fair or thin eyelids, are the fiber types, there are two brands for this, AB and BN. I personally love the BN one (this product I am reviewing now) better, cause it&#x27;s easier to handle. And it&#x27;s in skin color that allows you to really hide the fiber. Overall I highly recommend this product. However, it&#x27;s also my advise that depends on your eyelid (shape, fat content，skin sensitivity), the effects may vary. But it totally worth a try! Since once you get some practices, it&#x27;s really easy, and makes your eye big and cute.</li>
            <li> This product has poor design, it doesn&#x27;t work for me. The shinny handle can not take off, it is very difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> First of all, I think it&#x27;d be helpful for you as reviewing readers to know that I am 22, Asian, and was born with monolids. I have previously been using the AB Mezical Fiber (first generation) for the last 4 years. That product, like any eye tape product, takes practice and experimentation to figure out what shape and depth works for your eyes and face. But once I got the hang of it, it was love. I wore them every day. At the two year mark, my left eye lid flipped itself into that position naturally; I did not have to use tape on that lid. My right eye is a little more temperamental and lazy, so it still takes some coaxing. I loved, loved, loved, that first generation product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then some idiot decided to stop making it. (Yes, I am upset about this.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BN Micro Fiber double eye tape was nothing compared to the previous AB lid tape I was using. The packaging was not user-friendly or efficient; the tape did NOT last as long, nor was it waterproof, as the first generation eye tape (sometimes I had to reapply a FEW times through the day!); the tape would break as I was carefully stretching it - a waste, as it broke before I could even use it. The one thing it did do well was hold up my lids when it decided to cooperate with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product for people who are serious about eye lid tapes and do not like to waste time and money; however, if there is someone who likes to waste time and money, this product is made for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered another brand of eye lid tape; it&#x27;s back to square one, experimenting with brands and whatnot until I find something that works.</li>
            <li> These are great - they if you have oily skin the tacky glue on the edges comes undone so well - if you are not careful people will give you strange looks.</li>
            <li> I hate this poor design product... and will never purchase it ever again.&lt;br /&gt;1st, it&#x27;s very difficult to apply.&lt;br /&gt;2nd, rectangle shape? never seen like that in my life...&lt;br /&gt;3rd, badly performance...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to cut it off, the tape shows, the double eyelids don&#x27;t stay a long time, and is hard to use in general. I had to use eyelid glue before putting the tape on but it worked only a bit better than either product alone. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use, very sticky and lasts long. If you wear it for a long time it may start to irritate a bit.</li>
            <li> I used to use the old version of the mezaik fibers; i would actually use one fiber for both eyes b/c they stretched out long enough and it was easy to do. since they changed to the new version, the fibers are stiffer and do not cooperate! that&#x27;s why i switched to these ones--they&#x27;re great! They&#x27;re similar to the old Mezaik ones except maybe a little bit wider, but not in a noticeable annoying way. Also, these seem to blend really nicely with skin and have really good sticking/staying power, unlike some of the cheaper options available on ebay (i have tried quite a few!)    Overall, since the Mezaik change, these are now my go-tos. Great value too since you get 105pcs (which, like the old Mezaik ones, I pull and cut in half and use 1 fiber for both eyes).</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well. Difficult to cut the end of the tape once placed on eyelid.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on me........at all.</li>
            <li> This is a silly novelty, at least for me. My skin is thin on my eyelids, so the tape stretches it, pulls it, pinches it, and does not go on straight no matter how many times I do it. I have droopy puppy dog eyelids, so when I use the tape, my eyes still droop because I have so much skin,  except there is a nasty uneven fold going across my droopy eyelid. It&#x27;s sort of funny. However, repeated attempts at perfecting it hurts. This tape is strong and it takes the top layers of the skin off after a while. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but I don&#x27;t doubt that it works for some girls with thicker skin and less droopiness in their eyelids.</li>
            <li> This is my second batch of eyelid tape that I have bought from Amazon.  Not only does it work, but it&#x27;s a lot more affordable than some brands out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sticks well and lasts all day.  It&#x27;s so strong that even when you take it off at night, the crease can sometimes last until the following day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried quite a number of eyelid tape brands and this seems to be the best quality.  It&#x27;s definitely something I recommend.  Just make sure to follow the instructions on the label!</li>
            <li> It works you just need to practice to get it perfect.</li>
            <li> I started using AB mezical fibers, the original one, shortly before they discontinued the product. The updated AB version is horrible and I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find a replacement that worked just as well. This BN fiber is just as sticky and comfortable on my eyelids. It didn&#x27;t take practice to get used to using this one because it&#x27;s essentially the same as the AB. Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I have hard time applying it. It&#x27;s hard to cut where I want and it moves when I try to cut it......maybe I need more practice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently discovered this double eyelid tape like atleast a year ago, and OMG!! it&#x27;s a miracle worked.. I absolutely love it</li>
            <li> So sweet!! Deliver very fast, and I got little present. I like it.</li>
            <li> The side that&#x27;s supposed to stick to the eyelid doesn&#x27;t stick. The backing is very hard to peel off. I&#x27;ve tried several different brands, and this one is the hardest to peel. I ended up tossing the whole package.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little confusing to learn how to use it at first, but if you watch a youtube tutorial or two, it&#x27;ll all be fine. I&#x27;ve been using Daiso&#x27;s double eyelid tape for a while, and it was really annoying because I could always feel the double eyelid tape on my lids and I could feel it when it was coming out of place. With this one, it looks super natural, so you don&#x27;t have to put on a crap load of makeup on top of it to hide the fact that youre wearing eyelid tape, and it;s super comfortable and you can barely feel it when you blink. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I hated it. I would stick with the regular. I already have a lid and i was using it to correct my left eye to my right but it wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> difficult to use...but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  I would buy again!</li>
