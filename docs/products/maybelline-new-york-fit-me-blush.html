            <li>It&#x27;s easy to blend and apply! :)</li>
            <li>It does not give you color it need to digging with the brush to get very light color and the brush hurts</li>
            <li>It is a nice color and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I even scrape the surface with my fingernail in an effort to pick up more color but even then no color shows up.</li>
            <li>Also I love the blush brush.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love this blush, it stays on al l  day and the color blends</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve ever tried, if I put a lot of product I can blend it out easily and not look like a clown :)</li>
            <li>But when I am going for a light make up, it looks cute, just wish it was \\&quot;thicker\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Product worked just fine.</li>
            <li>I would have given it another star if it was not as light.  </li>
            <li>It turned out it to light.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super gooey.</li>
            <li>My mom bought this blush for her, and I didnt like it because of the color (deep rose)</li>
            <li>DEEP ROSE BLUSH---</li>
            <li>I really love this blush color, I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because the brush isn&#x27;t soft, I&#x27;m using another one</li>
            <li>Arrived super fast too!</li>
            <li>Priced right</li>
            <li>got me 2 of these...expecting it would be really nice and rosey color, when i got it, it turns out its a light pink!!</li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;m buying this. :)</li>
            <li>its completely dried i have used this before and loved the blush</li>
            <li>I specially like this one because it gives me a natural blush</li>
            <li>But overall, I would recommend it, easy to carry around.</li>
            <li>I really like the color because it shows a lot.  </li>
            <li>I dabbed and dabbed at it, but still couldn&#x27;t get much onto my brush.  </li>
            <li>Cheap case and the color doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
            <li>I am African American and it does not show much on my skin unless I put many layers.  </li>
            <li>It came open and without a brush , but the prodect is fine just not long wear at all</li>
            <li>I am all about getting good products for a good price, but I was very disappointed in the product and do not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I love how this goes with my skin tone, I also use other products from the fit me line, this blush usually lasts me about</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize this would be a little too light for my complexion.</li>
            <li>If u are looking for something soft go with the coral.</li>
            <li>you have allergies, or your skin is sensitive in any way, do NOT buy this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>pretty pink, looks natural</li>

            <li> just the color i wanted</li>
            <li> Nice color. I was a bit ambivalent about picking it online, but this was successful.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it&#x27;s maybelline. I have long trusted their products. I specially like this one because it gives me a natural blush and it&#x27;s long lasting. It&#x27;s easy to blend and apply! :)</li>

            <li> Perfect natural-looking color and stays on all day</li>
            <li> My mom bought this blush for her, and I didnt like it because of the color (deep rose) but one day I decided to try it out and i was really shocked about how blendable it was! You can DEFINITELY make a softer look if you want, probably the BEST blush i&#x27;ve ever tried, if I put a lot of product I can blend it out easily and not look like a clown :)</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom and she loved it! :) This is the second time I&#x27;m buying this. :)</li>

            <li> Good blush for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this blush, it stays on al l  day and the color blends well.  I use it everyday and it goes with whatever i wear.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this would be a little too light for my complexion. I still use it once in a while.  Priced right</li>
            <li> DEEP ROSE BLUSH---I looked up this color blush and it was suppose to be deep in color for a black women.  It turned out it to light.  It just blends in with my skin.  I want to send it back.  Iam very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Color looks good but I found I had to keep applying for anything to show up.</li>
            <li> Excellent, I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
            <li> It came open and without a brush , but the prodect is fine just not long wear at all</li>
            <li> This blush has no pigment at all.  I dabbed and dabbed at it, but still couldn&#x27;t get much onto my brush.  I am all about getting good products for a good price, but I was very disappointed in the product and do not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> The color is about two shades lighter than it is pictured. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product. I&#x27;ve used it with both liquid and powder foundation.</li>
            <li> Cheap case and the color doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
            <li> I love how this goes with my skin tone, I also use other products from the fit me line, this blush usually lasts me about 6- 8 months</li>
            <li> I love this color and rarely find it in stores, so I am so happy Amazon carries it! Great price, too!</li>
            <li> I really love this blush color, I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because the brush isn&#x27;t soft, I&#x27;m using another one</li>
            <li> Received item already opened and missing blush brush.</li>
            <li> Works great color was perfect for me</li>
            <li> pretty pink, looks natural</li>
            <li> love this shade! yes, fits me!</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this product along with the bronzer.  She was very disappointed.  Could not see on her face.  It was as if product was invisible.  Would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Thank You Very Pleased With product .</li>
            <li> It comes without a brush</li>
            <li> Okay so I have allergies.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of writing an essay on how awful my allergies are, lemme get to the point.&lt;br /&gt;If you have allergies, or your skin is sensitive in any way, do NOT buy this.&lt;br /&gt;I applied it to my face and my skin started turning red. Not because of the blush, it was a chemical reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Now, not everyone&#x27;s the same, so this may not happen to you.&lt;br /&gt;However, the brush that it comes with SUCKS. It&#x27;s super gooey. Not to mention it&#x27;s small and barely works.&lt;br /&gt;And the blush barely shows! :/</li>
            <li> got me 2 of these...expecting it would be really nice and rosey color, when i got it, it turns out its a light pink!! doesn&#x27;t even show up when i put it on!!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s nice, and came in time, but if its a rosey cheeks you want this isnt it.</li>
