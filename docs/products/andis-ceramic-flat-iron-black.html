    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have had it for 2 years and it is still awesome.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and the best feature is that you can use TWO hands without getting burned.  </li>
            <li>Excellent.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with my product.</li>
            <li>This wand is great.  </li>
            <li>Great buy too.</li>
            <li>in all, a great price</li>
            <li>but this one still works good.</li>
            <li>I really love it!  </li>
            <li>It comes out so nice</li>
            <li>the price, it works nicely, and I recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I kind of have to pull that hair out.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money</li>
            <li>and so glad I took it.  </li>
            <li>Her daddy says he&#x27;s glad it has the automatic shut-off feature, and wouldn&#x27;t allow any heating hair appliances without that feature in his home, where teenagers are concerned.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>it works ok....</li>
            <li>love this thing.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is not the best I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
            <li>I purchased the item without realising it did not have a UK friendly use plug!  </li>
            <li>This is a great cheap flat iron to own.</li>
            <li>I got this for a granddaughter, who says it&#x27;s easy to use and works well for her.</li>
            <li>As I wanted the great priced item, I purchased an adapter universal plug, however this did not do the job for this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great flat iron.  </li>
            <li>It is well made with the swivel cord and best of all it moves down my hair without a snag or pull and leaves it nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>it also has a great lock on it to lock it closed to make it easy to pack in a suitcase.</li>
            <li>The Andis ceramic flat iron works good for the money.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron can straighten my course hair fairly well.</li>
            <li>I finish with a quick run through with the blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>Especially during this holiday season!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for providing such great service!</li>
            <li>and I liked the size of the other better</li>
            <li>It does not pull your hair and glides very nicely through the sections, however, it didn&#x27;t get quite hot enough to get the exact look that I was going for.  </li>
            <li>Anyway I love this and would recommend it to anybody looking for a new iron.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this for anyone who wants a cheap, but well working straightener.</li>
            <li>This iron gets hot quickly (30 seconds) but does not burn your hair.  </li>
            <li>so I can get it right up close to my scalp and straighten even the hair up there.</li>
            <li>I love that the heat setting is adjustable, it heats up quickly and the head is not too big</li>
            <li>this was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>i loved the first one so much that i decided to get the exact same one when it came time to get a new one.</li>
            <li>I would say that should be a mandatory safety feature in the hair appliance industry, but hey, others might be able to come up with a reason for not having that, though I wouldn&#x27;t know what that could possibly</li>
            <li>I had my first one for about 4 years.</li>
            <li>Fast heating!</li>
            <li>First \\&quot;search\\&quot; BAM, Amazon had it.</li>
            <li>I love how fast it heats up and the different settings and how hot it can get to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>I got it a few months ago and fell in love with it immediately!</li>
            <li>It really does what it says.</li>
            <li>Works very well for my hair.</li>
            <li>And we searched for very close to a year,.</li>
            <li>1.5 inches is a good size, but just not hot enough.</li>
            <li>but it does not leave your hair completely flat and smooth....</li>
            <li>The best part of the entire thing is, i knew i would like the iron, I&#x27;ve use nothing but this brand for years, however, we are unable to find it in ANY store, and we searched a LARGE number of stores, \\&quot;Beauty&#x27;, \\&quot;Walmart\\&quot;, \\&quot;Kmart\\&quot; and \\&quot;Ultas\\&quot; with no luck.</li>
            <li>... wish I would have spent a little more money on a better quality item.</li>
            <li>The 1.5 inches is bigger than most but the only problem I keep having is that my hair tends to get stuck on the ends of it</li>
            <li>......, decent shipping cost from the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>This is the first flat iron I have ever seen with this feature.  </li>
            <li>Before I was done flat ironing my daughter&#x27;s whole head, her hair had returned to its normal curly state.  </li>
            <li>The product is suppose to heat up in a specified time and then the blinking green light is suppose to shut off.  </li>
            <li>This product is ok, but I have really thick hair</li>
            <li>My hair is very very thick and slightly frizzy and works on mine beautifully..</li>
            <li>and it just takes a long time for me to get it straight.</li>
            <li>I finally replaced my old flat iron of 8 years with this one- the same exact model.  </li>
            <li>I am unable to give an honest review on the this item.  </li>
            <li>It feels like a professional Flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I prefer to wash my hair and let it air dry almost completely</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This flat iron I purchased and did a lot of investigating before I bought.  I am so glad I didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money this was very reasonable.  It feels like a professional Flat iron.  It is well made with the swivel cord and best of all it moves down my hair without a snag or pull and leaves it nice and soft.  I prefer to wash my hair and let it air dry almost completely I finish with a quick run through with the blow dryer.  I add nothing at all to my hair before I I straighten it except a heat protecting spray.  It comes out so nice whereas when I used product it would feel waxy with heat.  Just a bid of added advice I received from someone and so glad I took it.  Anyway I love this and would recommend it to anybody looking for a new iron.  My hair is very very thick and slightly frizzy and works on mine beautifully..</li>
            <li> The flat iron works so well! I got it a few months ago and fell in love with it immediately! It really does what it says. I recommend this for anyone who wants a cheap, but well working straightener.</li>
            <li> I got this for a granddaughter, who says it&#x27;s easy to use and works well for her. Her daddy says he&#x27;s glad it has the automatic shut-off feature, and wouldn&#x27;t allow any heating hair appliances without that feature in his home, where teenagers are concerned. I would say that should be a mandatory safety feature in the hair appliance industry, but hey, others might be able to come up with a reason for not having that, though I wouldn&#x27;t know what that could possibly be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it works nicely, and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great cheap flat iron to own. The 1.5 inches is bigger than most but the only problem I keep having is that my hair tends to get stuck on the ends of it and I kind of have to pull that hair out.</li>
            <li> I finally replaced my old flat iron of 8 years with this one- the same exact model.  I have had it for 2 years and it is still awesome.  I love it.  I can curl my hair with it as well as straighten.  This is the only one I will use.  Even though it gets up to 400 degrees, it doesn&#x27;t instantly burn your hair like some of them do.</li>
            <li> Item did not work as it was advertised.  The product is suppose to heat up in a specified time and then the blinking green light is suppose to shut off.  This never happened.  Before I was done flat ironing my daughter&#x27;s whole head, her hair had returned to its normal curly state.  I will, however, continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I was heartbroken when I dropped my Amika and the plates on it broke.  So I was looking for a less expensive alternative.  I tried the Cricket with titanium plates, but it was only 1 inch; and did not really straighten my hair.  This wand is great.  I have coarse, thick hair that is now wavy due to the unruly gray hair.  This iron gets hot quickly (30 seconds) but does not burn your hair.  Oh, and the best feature is that you can use TWO hands without getting burned.  There is a place for your fingers/thumb on the end and you can grab it there it is not hot at all.  This is the first flat iron I have ever seen with this feature.  I really love it!  Great buy too.</li>
            <li> I am unable to give an honest review on the this item.  I purchased the item without realising it did not have a UK friendly use plug!  As I wanted the great priced item, I purchased an adapter universal plug, however this did not do the job for this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great price......, decent shipping cost from the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a shame it is not compatible for use in the UK.</li>
            <li> This product is ok, but I have really thick hair and it just takes a long time for me to get it straight.</li>
            <li> This is my second curling iron from Andis. I had my first one for about 4 years. Eventually it would still turn on but not heat up. Got this one to replace it - it is a 1/2&amp;#34; smaller than my other one and I liked the size of the other better but this one still works good. I love how fast it heats up and the different settings and how hot it can get to straighten my hair. Works very well for my hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Fast heating!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my daughter.... From the looks of her hair...it works ok....but it does not leave your hair completely flat and smooth....Like they say you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this twice now (I&#x27;m hard on my hair straightener!)  I love that the heat setting is adjustable, it heats up quickly and the head is not too big so I can get it right up close to my scalp and straighten even the hair up there. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> The Andis ceramic flat iron works good for the money.  It does not pull your hair and glides very nicely through the sections, however, it didn&#x27;t get quite hot enough to get the exact look that I was going for.  I like where the buttons are because they are not in your way and I prefer the manual dial to digital.  1.5 inches is a good size, but just not hot enough.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my product. The best part of the entire thing is, i knew i would like the iron, I&#x27;ve use nothing but this brand for years, however, we are unable to find it in ANY store, and we searched a LARGE number of stores, \\&quot;Beauty&#x27;, \\&quot;Walmart\\&quot;, \\&quot;Kmart\\&quot; and \\&quot;Ultas\\&quot; with no luck. And we searched for very close to a year,. My \\&quot;son\\&quot; suggested \\&quot;Amazon\\&quot; and what  blessing!!!! First \\&quot;search\\&quot; BAM, Amazon had it. THEN before I knew it, We had it here!!! PERFECTION!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely use Amazon again, and I already suggest Amazon to everyone. Especially during this holiday season!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for providing such great service!</li>
            <li> Great flat iron.  Stands up to traveling with it every week.  Heats evenly therefore no damage to my hair.  I&#x27;ve had several of these and will keep buying them.</li>
            <li> no longer spending 30 minutes to straighten my hair! love this thing. it also has a great lock on it to lock it closed to make it easy to pack in a suitcase.</li>
            <li> this is my second andis flat iron. i loved the first one so much that i decided to get the exact same one when it came time to get a new one.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all... wish I would have spent a little more money on a better quality item.</li>
            <li> This flat iron can straighten my course hair fairly well. However, after each time that I run the straightener through my hair, I often have to brush it immediately afterwards, as my hair sticks in place. It gets the job done, but the straightening process could be a lot easier.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is not the best I&#x27;ve ever owned but it does do the job if you are looking for a cheaper option</li>
