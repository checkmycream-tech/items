            <li>I love the smell!</li>
            <li>Learned to love them on a trip to Australia/New Zealand !</li>
            <li>I purchased this because it has Manuka Honey which has amazing health benefits which, to me, are mitigated because of the added dyes/fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It also gives your skin a nice glow without looking oily.</li>
            <li>Originally bought after seeing some great thigs about Manuka Honey.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that gives just he right amount of moisture!</li>
            <li>Makeup goes over it very easily and doesn&#x27;t get oily.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to purchase this item because I heard many good things about manuka honey, so since they have this product in skin care, I was elated.</li>
            <li>to have  ordered this product love the feel, smell and effects :) I will buy it again!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d gladly pay more to get Manuka honey in my moisturizer but not if it has chemicals I don&#x27;t need!</li>
            <li>The scent lingers so nicely and it&#x27;s just a very nourishing and decadent product for a great price.</li>
            <li>Just a good mild moisturizer with sun protection.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.....</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Perfect moisturizer for my skin, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>It dries to a nice smooth finish on my skin...ready for my foundation.</li>
            <li>I plan to continue using it, and adding more of their products.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my hands :)</li>
            <li>It is THE BEST I have tried and I&#x27;ve had my in-laws ship several more to me since their visit.  </li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I find I need more of a cream during the day as well as night.</li>
            <li>Love all products which contain Manuka</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li>I also feel my skin more stretch out.</li>
            <li>Should I give more than using this product</li>
            <li>It feels really light on your skin and smells so nice.  </li>
            <li>but it seems to be more of a surface moisture verses a penatrating moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li>I wanna be sure.</li>
            <li>This feels so soft light , smells good, feels great on my skin seller</li>
            <li>there are better face creams that are better in the us.</li>
            <li>We are so glad we can buy these products in the USA. ....  </li>
            <li>I did a patch test and so far so good!</li>
            <li>Your skin feels fabulous and it has a very pleasant soft scent.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>smells very good and leaves skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and sweet, the texture is light and absorbing and it&#x27;s perfect under makeup.</li>
            <li>it is just as rich and creamy yet very light.  </li>
            <li>but so far I love it!!</li>
            <li>I keep it in my purse for easy access.</li>
            <li>However the smell is quite strong (for people who likes it is fine).</li>
            <li>This moisturizer soaks into your skin easily and leaves it feeling silky smooth and supple without leaving a greasy finish.  </li>
            <li>The SPF factor is great - I&#x27;ve worn this moisturizer to the beach and the pool on very sunny, hot days without adding additional sunscreen and I never suffered any sunburn to my face.</li>
            <li>Not super impressed.</li>
            <li>It seems to have a light beeswax smell to me.</li>
            <li>I love the distinct smell that all of these products have.</li>
            <li>I used couple of times for far and love the texture, smell and overall how it feels on my skin: doesn&#x27;t clog the pores or sticky at all - perfect under the makeup.</li>
            <li>Would not personally buy again, however, it may be great for someone else.</li>
            <li>great for daily use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s Bees for years and years, but this is far superior.</li>
            <li>Started first by using the moisturizer and loved it so much, I ordered, the night cream, the serum, and the eye cream,&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Clinique feels too greasy; Oil of Olay is too light (and shortlasting); Nivea, Aveeno, and Eucerin aren&#x27;t worth the cost) but this one takes the cake.</li>
            <li>I like all Wild Fern products and this is a nice cream not lotion with sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer par up with my Mychelle Daily Cream</li>
            <li>This is my second time trying this product, I do feel the smoothness and also smells good</li>
            <li>This is a light, silky moisturizer that gets absorbed quickly and leaves no sticky residue.  </li>
            <li>I got this to try due to hearing manuka honey was great for skin.</li>
            <li>I love it, been using it for 10 years, originally purchased it in New Zealand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect amount of moisture for my normal to dry, 42 year young :), skin.</li>
            <li>The texture is nice, the smell is amazing, and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and oily on your skin.</li>
            <li>The item was shipped quickly and almost like it&#x27;s gift wrapped.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>If this works, I will be the first to recommend it!</li>
            <li>Smells great, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>I love the Wild Ferns manuka honey products.</li>
            <li>I found the hand cream while I was in New Zealand several years ago and loved the richness of it.  </li>
            <li>Quite thick and smooth/creamy, it smells wonderfully sweet and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>And it smells pleasant, not strong.</li>
            <li>This is the first moisturizer with sunscreen that did not make my face break out.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase again and intend on purchasing more from their line of products.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasant and light and the moisturiser is rich enough to stand up to the harsh winters where I live.  </li>
            <li>Not that&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ve heard in a long time :)  </li>
            <li>This cream has almost cured the problem and most of the irritation and dry patches are gone.  </li>
            <li>I have SUPER Sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and makes the skin feel soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product, and what it does.</li>
            <li>so I do not use much at all on my face.</li>
            <li>really.</li>
            <li>The smell is gentle and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>As a result, my face is beginning to show some real wear.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>More than noticeable with other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>The smell is very nice and you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 56 years old and have been pretty blase&#x27; about taking care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>If this stands up to all four New England seasons, I will be a customer for life!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but I feel some dryness in some areas of my face in which is dryer than normal, so</li>
            <li>Until about ten years ago, I rarely wore any sunscreen - they all made my face breakout.  </li>
            <li>Naturally, I turned to Amazon and yay!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very nice lotion. Like that it includes SPF and Manuka Honey. Has a nice scent that&#x27;s not too overpowering and a good feel on my skin.</li>
            <li> Pretty good. Leaves skin soft without breaking it out.</li>
            <li> I found the hand cream while I was in New Zealand several years ago and loved the richness of it.  Thought I&#x27;d try the facial moisturizer during the cold winter months and it is just as rich and creamy yet very light.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a light, silky moisturizer that gets absorbed quickly and leaves no sticky residue.  Your skin feels fabulous and it has a very pleasant soft scent.  Makeup goes over it very easily and doesn&#x27;t get oily.  My teenage daughters and I use the entire Wild Ferns Manuka skincare line.  Try the night cream, too.</li>
            <li> I really liked the texture and feel of this product but was very disappointed that it has some chemicals and also food dye and perfume!&lt;br /&gt;But I do like that it also has sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product.....I will be ordering this again and again.</li>
            <li> It get rids if pimples and make my face soft.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Perfect moisturizer for my skin, especially in the winter. It&#x27;s thicker, but not sticky or gloppy. It dries to a nice smooth finish on my skin...ready for my foundation. It seems to have a light beeswax smell to me. I really like this product, and what it does. I plan to continue using it, and adding more of their products.</li>
            <li> This is the first moisturizer with sunscreen that did not make my face break out.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I am a fan of all Wild Ferns manuka honey products. This is a great moisturizer that does NOT cause me to have break outs. It is a little thick so I do not use much at all on my face. I also use it on my hands :) I keep it in my purse for easy access. I love the distinct smell that all of these products have. If you are looking for unscented, then this may not be for you. It is not a flowery scent, but a honey scent instead.</li>
            <li> I discovered this when I was in New Zealand and was sad when I ran out of the tube I bought there, but luckily I can buy it online. This lotion is creamy without being heavy or greasy, yet isn&#x27;t too lightweight. I&#x27;ve tried lots of moisturizers (Clinique feels too greasy; Oil of Olay is too light (and shortlasting); Nivea, Aveeno, and Eucerin aren&#x27;t worth the cost) but this one takes the cake. When my face just needs its daily moisturizer, I grab this. When I&#x27;ve been out in the sun and I need to \\&quot;apologize\\&quot; to my skin, I grab this. When I&#x27;m visiting my brother in Phoenix and my skin is parched, I grab this. It&#x27;s perfect in any situation. And it smells good too!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff as always!</li>
            <li> Fell in love with the Wild Fern Manuka Honey products when I was in New Zealand this past fall.  I&#x27;m so grateful that I can get them through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I have alot of sensitivities to perfumes and other face products.  This one fits the bill for me.  The fragrance is pleasant and light and the moisturiser is rich enough to stand up to the harsh winters where I live.  Love it!</li>
            <li> My in-laws brought over some of this facial moisturizer from New Zealand a few years ago.  It is THE BEST I have tried and I&#x27;ve had my in-laws ship several more to me since their visit.  I&#x27;m BEYOND thrilled to find it on Amazon - yay!!!  This moisturizer soaks into your skin easily and leaves it feeling silky smooth and supple without leaving a greasy finish.  It smells wonderful and refreshing.  The SPF factor is great - I&#x27;ve worn this moisturizer to the beach and the pool on very sunny, hot days without adding additional sunscreen and I never suffered any sunburn to my face. Wonderful product that I will keep buying.</li>
            <li> I like how it smells. I think I will continue purchasing this product. Would recommend definitely to try may be at least because it is natural?...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s Bees for years and years, but this is far superior. It&#x27;s the perfect amount of moisture for my normal to dry, 42 year young :), skin. I bought this with the night cream and eye cream. (I don&#x27;t like to mix moisturizing products.) The day cream feels like it moisturizes my skin throughout the day, but without trapping in moisture like other products. It&#x27;s perfect under my light foundation. Having an added layer of SPF is a bonus. I appreciate that the ingredients list is short and understandable. If this stands up to all four New England seasons, I will be a customer for life!</li>
            <li> i found this product in the internet and i love it. it give my face shine and it looks healthier since i been using this product</li>
            <li> I like the cream but it has an unpleasant smell</li>
            <li> I like all Wild Fern products and this is a nice cream not lotion with sunscreen. I find I need more of a cream during the day as well as night.</li>
            <li> I used couple of times for far and love the texture, smell and overall how it feels on my skin: doesn&#x27;t clog the pores or sticky at all - perfect under the makeup. Ingredients list tells you that it is derived primarily of natural organic ingredients, no harsh chemicals! Good moisturizer par up with my Mychelle Daily Cream</li>
            <li> smells very good and leaves skin smooth and soft. Will buy it again soon. Love all products which contain Manuka</li>
            <li> I sufffer from perioral dermatitis and exczema on my face. I am sensitive and break out no matter what I use. I got this to try due to hearing manuka honey was great for skin. After ten minutes of applying my skin was soft in the spots it was dry and cracked and Tight and my face felt smooth and relieved. The smell is very nice and you only need a small amount. (be careful alot will come outif you squeeze to hard) will definitely buy again and am ordering the night cream and wash again. Highly recommend. Will update after a few days of using.</li>
            <li> Started first by using the moisturizer and loved it so much, I ordered, the night cream, the serum, and the eye cream,&lt;br /&gt;they all work great.  My skin has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li> Great difference in my skin! More than noticeable with other moisturizers. Smooths skin and makes it Soft and supple- really.</li>
            <li> nice light cream perfect for all skin types and with some SPF 15</li>
            <li> I was very excited to purchase this item because I heard many good things about manuka honey, so since they have this product in skin care, I was elated. This is my second time trying this product, I do feel the smoothness and also smells good but I feel some dryness in some areas of my face in which is dryer than normal, so I don&#x27;t know if someone is also experiencing this problem. I also feel my skin more stretch out. Should I give more than using this product is order to feel all the benefits?</li>
            <li> I use this product as a daytime moisturizer.  It feels really light on your skin and smells so nice.  I have used it for over a year and I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Absorbs well and without residue, even on greasy skin. The smell is gentle and not overpowering. Just a good mild moisturizer with sun protection.</li>
            <li> Not super impressed. Has a slight greesy feeling after it&#x27;s put on my skin. Moisturizes well but it seems to be more of a surface moisture verses a penatrating moisturizer. Originally bought after seeing some great thigs about Manuka Honey. Would not personally buy again, however, it may be great for someone else.</li>
            <li> great for daily use. Combo it with night cream, helping my acne scars and hubby&#x27;s rosacea. Eye cream may contain silicone derivative (but great day eye cream)</li>
            <li> I love it, been using it for 10 years, originally purchased it in New Zealand. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that gives just he right amount of moisture! It also gives your skin a nice glow without looking oily.</li>
            <li> I have had an onset of very dry skin in patches on my face and around my hairline.  This cream has almost cured the problem and most of the irritation and dry patches are gone.  It&#x27;s well worth the price I paid for it.  A little bit goes a long way on moist skin.  I will definitely purchase again and intend on purchasing more from their line of products.  I highly recommend this product to anyone with dry skin problems (dermatitis).</li>
            <li> Smells great, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin. I&#x27;ve already ordered my second one, and my mom wanted me to rate it since she loves it as well.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and texture! It&#x27;s been working for me!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer had been recommended to me, but even in Houston, Texas, I was unable to locate any for sale.  Naturally, I turned to Amazon and yay! I found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 56 years old and have been pretty blase&#x27; about taking care of my skin.  I spend a great deal of time outdoors.  Until about ten years ago, I rarely wore any sunscreen - they all made my face breakout.  As a result, my face is beginning to show some real wear.  I had been using Aveno for years, but never really saw an improvement in my skin...it just protected my face.  Not so with Wild Ferns Manuka Honey!  I have been using just atiny dab of the moisturizer each day and I have noticed an improvement in the appearance of my skin.  And so have other people - to the point that they have complements me on the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.  Not that&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ve heard in a long time :)  Best of all, I have had zero allergic reaction to this product...no itching; no breakouts, nada.  I heartily recommend this daily moisturinzer along with the other Wild Ferns Mauka Honey products - it&#x27;s never too late to start taking care of your skin!</li>
            <li> I love the Wild Ferns manuka honey products.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural facial moisturizer with sunscreen.  I tried some more expensive stuff, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the money. This stuff is great! And it smells pleasant, not strong.</li>
            <li> Shipping was really fast. It works great as a winter moisturizer. Really helps for dry skin! However the smell is quite strong (for people who likes it is fine).</li>
            <li> I bought 2 tubes of the wild ferns manuka honey facial moisturiser.  It&#x27;s making my skin feel so soft.  I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> Cream is good but do not like the smell.</li>
            <li> I have SUPER Sensitive skin and i bought this a while back o remove eye makeup but then got too scared to try it on my face. Well i whipped it out and was like, what the heck, why not. I did a patch test and so far so good! EVERYTHING  under the sun breaks me out! I love the smell! I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about. I put apple cider vinegar on my face, so this is heaven compared to that. I will report back in a week or a few days cause, I wanna be sure. But this may have been my savior! Aveeno, cetaphil, neutrogena break me out! And yay for spf, I mix in a little zinc oxide for extra sun protection! Yay for no demethicone! If this works, I will be the first to recommend it! Keep your fingers crossed for me!</li>
            <li> The scent is light and sweet, the texture is light and absorbing and it&#x27;s perfect under makeup. Will definitely reorder and also can&#x27;t wait to try their other products! Very fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> :) im happy to have  ordered this product love the feel, smell and effects :) I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> This feels so soft light , smells good, feels great on my skin seller was prompt, also try the facial cleanser with it are the soap and get great results i like the way it feels together,</li>
            <li> I would not buy this again. did not break me out. there are better face creams that are better in the us.</li>
            <li> We are so glad we can buy these products in the USA. ....  Learned to love them on a trip to Australia/New Zealand !</li>
            <li> Like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product for too long but so far I love it!! The texture is nice, the smell is amazing, and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and oily on your skin. I will definitely look into this brand when I am done with my current nighttime moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li> The item was shipped quickly and almost like it&#x27;s gift wrapped.  The ingredients are simple and if you have dry skin, this will do wonder for that.  Quite thick and smooth/creamy, it smells wonderfully sweet and pleasant.  Absorbs quickly and makes the skin feel soft and hydrated.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I adore this product. The scent lingers so nicely and it&#x27;s just a very nourishing and decadent product for a great price.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer however I will not be ordering it again.  Not only does it have added color (the dreaded yellow #5) but it has artificial fragrance added.  There is NO need for either in a facial moisturizer.  I purchased this because it has Manuka Honey which has amazing health benefits which, to me, are mitigated because of the added dyes/fragrance.  If the manufacturer reads any of these, please stop adding that junk in there!  I&#x27;d gladly pay more to get Manuka honey in my moisturizer but not if it has chemicals I don&#x27;t need!</li>
