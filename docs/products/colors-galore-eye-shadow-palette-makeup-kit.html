    <ol>
            <li>Wonderful arrangement of sparkling colors...</li>
            <li>It was one of the BEST purchases I have made regarding eyeshadow</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did!!!  </li>
            <li>great pigmentation, goes on and stays on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>,COLORS ARE GREAT</li>
            <li>This is a very nice product, and the colors are great.</li>
            <li>great buy and great price :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a good buy or a good gift.</li>
            <li>Loved the makeup.</li>
            <li>love it, and use it every day!</li>
            <li>This eyeshadow kit is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>The product was nice, but it was damaged during shipping.  </li>
            <li>Again, just cheap Revlon ones, but it was a very nice gesture, and they are actually cool colors!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re very very light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are so many looks you can create with this palette.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had better luck with eyeshadows I&#x27;ve bought at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite item that I have every ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li>did i find many colors that worked for me?  </li>
            <li>it literally was love at first sight once i tore it out of the bubble wrap :)</li>
            <li>my eyes were fine, and if you are in pain, stop sticking it in your eyes.  </li>
            <li>What I love about this palette is that it&#x27;s super portable and it has almost every shade I could ever want for an eyeshadow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I truly enjoy mine.</li>
            <li>I was expecting this to be shadow that is totally cheap looking, but figured I&#x27;d try it out.</li>
            <li>there are lots of colors and the seller even sent me 3 free pencils for eyes and lip.  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying a more retro palette with brighter colors to assist in a more modern look soon after.</li>
            <li>This palette is very worth the money.</li>
            <li>I agree with another comment, it needs more modern colors.  </li>
            <li>THIS PURCHASE IS NOT BAD, but dont expect it to rock your world.  </li>
            <li>not bad, though.  </li>
            <li>The palette is not bad itself, I just did not like it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t think the advertising photo is true, so I&#x27;ll try to post some of my own images in the future, but don&#x27;t let that be a deterent.</li>
            <li>I bought it under the impression the colors would be more vivid, I was just dissapointed when I got it.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure there are other palettes on amazon that will impress you more.</li>
            <li>I wish the mirror was bigger, but other than that, this kit is awesome.</li>
            <li>They just don&#x27;t go on as vibrant or rich as I had hoped they would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;thanks soo much!</li>
            <li>There are gradients of the same color type, which I love.</li>
            <li>This item is great, it has every color you could possibly want including simmer and matte colors, plus it wears super nice even without primer, it is a bargain, the colors are small but there are plenty to choose from, its definitely an unbeatable deal!</li>
            <li>Overall, pretty colors, but honestly, just buy MAC, Barry M, you know, the professional type.</li>
            <li>, it has so many colors, its a professional eye shadow kit, can be used if you do professional</li>
            <li>Overall I really love this product and would highly recomend it.</li>
            <li>so much for that.</li>
            <li>I started to tear, I was literally wiping as fast as I could.     </li>
            <li>It says MADE IN US, but it doesn&#x27;t really say much else (like where it&#x27;s been tested, etc.)</li>
            <li>It works really well and the colors are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I love this kit, unlike other Shany palletes, this color variety in this one is in certain color groups.</li>
            <li>The amount of colors for the price is amazing, I get everyday use out of the brown and pink tones in the pallete, and its fun to play the greens and purples for night time looks.</li>
            <li>the colors glide on smoothly, they are all the colors that you&#x27;d want (no stupid colors like neon green or hot pink), the case isnt gigantic</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because it contained colors that I normally would not purchase alone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you are looking to experiment with new looks or just wanting to try out new colors for any look for day time OR night time.</li>
            <li>thing I would like, is to have some pink colors in there, but that will come with my next purchase :)</li>
            <li>the individual colors themselves are pretty small, but there are many shades to work with.  </li>
            <li>I tried it the first time and my eyes were a bit red, but I thought it would pass.</li>
            <li>makeup and giftshop is the only place that I am aware of that sells \\&quot;BR\\&quot; eye shadows,</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and although each color is small and wont last for more than a couple months of regular use for me, it will last longer for anyone who isn&#x27;t a pro.    </li>
            <li>The neutrals in the palette show very well on my skin complexion, since I am mixed.</li>
            <li>and I have extraordinarily sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the colors are pretty pigmented and work well with primer and water and other mixing mediums.  </li>
            <li>The pigments are very vibrant, as well as long lasting.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am not completely satisfied, but it does offer a lot of selection for modest looks.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to bring a bunch of loose shadows.</li>
            <li> not really,</li>
            <li> However some of the other colors don&#x27;t show up as well.</li>
            <li> IT SHOULD BE NOTED that some other people have purchased this palette other places, maybe wholesale stores for a way lower price.      </li>
            <li> But I found these eyeshadows to be weak - as far as color payoff.</li>
            <li> and I think a little particle of the dust went in my eye and that was it; my eyes were on fire.</li>
            <li> I USED IT EVERYDAY FOR WORK.</li>
            <li> these eyeshadows will blow you out, 180 in a black case, the combinations you can make are staggering !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m indecisive, so the small size of the shadows don&#x27;t bother me, because I like to change up my makeup look everyday.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure how well they&#x27;d hold up in cleaning over time like brushes do.</li>
            <li> The shadows are really small, I did not like the colors.  </li>
            <li> I had to learn the hard way.    </li>
            <li> as for the reviewer who complained that it burned her eyes...</li>
            <li> VERY SMALL</li>
            <li> About four colors were broken, the packaging was very poor.  </li>
            <li> eyeshadow product on amazon, if you are looking for an eyeshadow product, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one or any of the others in this store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Each shadow is about the size of a dime, I use an eyeshadow base with my make-up, however, with this shadow, you could go w/o the base(but</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was anticipating something different when I saw 180 colors of eyeshadow. I am not completely satisfied, but it does offer a lot of selection for modest looks. The neutrals in the palette show very well on my skin complexion, since I am mixed. However some of the other colors don&#x27;t show up as well. I ended up buying a more retro palette with brighter colors to assist in a more modern look soon after.</li>
            <li> What I love about this palette is that it&#x27;s super portable and it has almost every shade I could ever want for an eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I don&#x27;t think the advertising photo is true, so I&#x27;ll try to post some of my own images in the future, but don&#x27;t let that be a deterent. This palette is very worth the money. Girls, you may want to get some other eye shadow brushes or buy extra applicators, though. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the applicators (3) that come with this product and I&#x27;m not sure how well they&#x27;d hold up in cleaning over time like brushes do. And to address the \\&quot;burning\\&quot; issue that these shadows cause: they DID NOT make my eyes or skin burn and I have extraordinarily sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a good buy or a good gift. I truly enjoy mine.</li>
            <li> Does NOT burn in &#x27;my&#x27; eyes. Wonderful arrangement of sparkling colors... great pigmentation, goes on and stays on.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, and use it every day! I suggest getting a proffesional brush with it or the shany brush set (I use the E.L.F brush set, and it works just fine).&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I would like, is to have some pink colors in there, but that will come with my next purchase :)</li>
            <li> I just purchased this for myself as a Christmas Gift, after failing to purchase the 24 eyeshadow palette from Sephora.  So, I was searching for an eyeshadow pallette for awhile and came across this. I purchased this for the same about of money I would have paid for the Sephora palette, and you know what? It was one of the BEST purchases I have made regarding eyeshadow palettes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many looks you can create with this palette.  Each shadow is about the size of a dime, I use an eyeshadow base with my make-up, however, with this shadow, you could go w/o the base(but im picky, so i use the base!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see how some people could be sensitive/allergic to the ingredients since there is quite a bit.  But for me, I did not have any problem with eyes watering/swelling/redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping and handling? no complaints! arrived on time on the exspected date. all in one peice.  no shadows were cracked. although the mirror was unglued when it arrived(but i use the one i have at home anyways! :) Also, it was wrapped in tons of bubble wrap! so it was well protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you are looking to experiment with new looks or just wanting to try out new colors for any look for day time OR night time. this product is for you.  I&#x27;ve even recommended it to a couple of my friends after they have seen it. it literally was love at first sight once i tore it out of the bubble wrap :) great buy and great price :)</li>
            <li> The product was nice, but it was damaged during shipping.  About four colors were broken, the packaging was very poor.  I paid for handling.. so much for that.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE EYE SHADOW,VERY SMALL I WISH WAS BIGGER SIZE,COLORS ARE GREAT I USED IT EVERYDAY FOR WORK.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product, and the colors are great. But I found these eyeshadows to be weak - as far as color payoff. They just don&#x27;t go on as vibrant or rich as I had hoped they would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re very very light. I personally don&#x27;t think you should HAVE to wear primer in order to see your eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had better luck with eyeshadows I&#x27;ve bought at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Loved the makeup. Bought it as a gift for someone and now I think I&#x27;m going to buy myself one too.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite item that I have every ordered from Amazon. The amount of colors for the price is amazing, I get everyday use out of the brown and pink tones in the pallete, and its fun to play the greens and purples for night time looks. My friends are always borrowing it before we go out on the weekends and the colors stay on all night. Overall I really love this product and would highly recomend it.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow kit is absolutely amazing. the colors glide on smoothly, they are all the colors that you&#x27;d want (no stupid colors like neon green or hot pink), the case isnt gigantic like i expected its about the size of a peice of paper and its totally flat, and it like ten cents for each color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best eyeshadow product on amazon, if you are looking for an eyeshadow product, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one or any of the others in this store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks soo much!</li>
            <li> No doubt that this is a bargain! besides quality and its name brand BR, and the size and the 180 color eyeshadow, price is just unbeatable!</li>
            <li> the reason i bought this was because i needed to do some experimenting with eyeshadows to find out which colors would work with my skin tone/eye color.  did i find many colors that worked for me?  not really, but hey, it could just be me and not the palate.    THIS PURCHASE IS NOT BAD, but dont expect it to rock your world.  the colors are pretty pigmented and work well with primer and water and other mixing mediums.  the individual colors themselves are pretty small, but there are many shades to work with.  as for the reviewer who complained that it burned her eyes... that makes no sense to me.  my eyes were fine, and if you are in pain, stop sticking it in your eyes.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED that some other people have purchased this palette other places, maybe wholesale stores for a way lower price.      buy this product if you&#x27;re like me (a newbie up for some experimenting), but if you have a lot of experience with makeup, i&#x27;d advise against it as it will not impress you.  not bad, though.  i&#x27;m sure there are other palettes on amazon that will impress you more.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it contained colors that I normally would not purchase alone.  I am so glad I did!!!  The pigments are very vibrant, as well as long lasting.  Instead of taking several individual eyeshadows when I travel, I will only take this pallette because of the convienience.  I will definitely purchase from this company again!!!</li>
            <li> There are so many colors to choose from, but the issue that I have is it BURNS, like MAD. I tried it the first time and my eyes were a bit red, but I thought it would pass. However, the second day, i tried on one of the colors and I think a little particle of the dust went in my eye and that was it; my eyes were on fire. I thought someone was ripping my eyes out. I started to tear, I was literally wiping as fast as I could.     Obviously, this is probably because I&#x27;m allergic to it, but it also has to do with this, the simple message: Don&#x27;t put anything near your eyes, if you&#x27;re not sure of the product. It says MADE IN US, but it doesn&#x27;t really say much else (like where it&#x27;s been tested, etc.) I had to learn the hard way.    Overall, pretty colors, but honestly, just buy MAC, Barry M, you know, the professional type. After all, you only have 2 eyes.</li>
            <li> these eyeshadows will blow you out, 180 in a black case, the combinations you can make are staggering ! makeup and giftshop is the only place that I am aware of that sells \\&quot;BR\\&quot; eye shadows,</li>

I wish the mirror was bigger, but other than that, this kit is awesome.</li>
            <li> The palette is not bad itself, I just did not like it.  The shadows are really small, I did not like the colors.  I agree with another comment, it needs more modern colors.  I bought it under the impression the colors would be more vivid, I was just dissapointed when I got it.  I&#x27;m returning this palette today.</li>
            <li> I am a prof makeup artist and one of the things I do is try to consolidate eye shadows into pallets like this so I don&#x27;t have to bring a bunch of loose shadows. I was expecting this to be shadow that is totally cheap looking, but figured I&#x27;d try it out. It goes on smoothly and although each color is small and wont last for more than a couple months of regular use for me, it will last longer for anyone who isn&#x27;t a pro.    there are lots of colors and the seller even sent me 3 free pencils for eyes and lip.  Again, just cheap Revlon ones, but it was a very nice gesture, and they are actually cool colors!</li>
            <li> This item is great, it has every color you could possibly want including simmer and matte colors, plus it wears super nice even without primer, it is a bargain, the colors are small but there are plenty to choose from, its definitely an unbeatable deal!</li>
            <li> I have this item, actually I have both JC206-A and JC206-B, it has so many colors, its a professional eye shadow kit, can be used if you do professional make up occasionaly</li>
            <li> I bought this palette over 2 years ago and I still have it. It works really well and the colors are very pigmented.</li>
