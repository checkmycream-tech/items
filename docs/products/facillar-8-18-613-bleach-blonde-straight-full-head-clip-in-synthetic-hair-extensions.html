            <li>they are the perfect shade for my hair too :) thank you :)</li>
            <li>They are very nice and fit great.</li>
            <li>but they came out as purple, but that&#x27;s ok the two colors look great together.</li>

            <li>5 stars for sure!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d for sure buy these again!</li>
            <li>Each piece is super soft, flawless, and absolutely Perfect!</li>
            <li>so I went on the internet and found there are 5 types of synthetic hair this kind is called Kanekalon</li>
            <li>kind of shiny, but once blended into hair they give you a nice highlight, and definatley make it a lot thicker.</li>
            <li>Very soft and excellent quality.</li>
            <li>They tangled very easily.</li>
            <li>but with good care they are fine.</li>
            <li>but so far they are great!</li>
            <li>For the most part they blend nicely with the hair.</li>
            <li>I loved it pretty good for the price it cost .</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair....</li>
            <li>However, since I had recently gotten strawberry highlights, they blended perfectly into my own hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very light</li>
            <li>it makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li>the product was ok.</li>
            <li>but I still love them.</li>
            <li>Clips are just OK.</li>
            <li>then I had to order 2 more &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>The price was extremely cheap!</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>Make sure it is the diameter of curl that you want.  </li>
            <li>Pour this over the hair that is wrapped around the dowel making sure to get ALL the hair.  </li>
            <li>I love it though</li>
            <li>I would have even paid more.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very excited to use them</li>
            <li>If you want to buy these i suggest saving your money and getting extensions from a real website that sells really good quality ones or just get a wig.</li>
            <li>but if I put a little more conditioner on it it matches perfect!</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>If you want cheap but QUALITY, buy this.</li>
            <li>but I will definitely order more!!</li>
            <li>They are ao pretty and feel so nice like real hair!!</li>
            <li>Kanekalon is very popular and can take heat treatment much better then the other.</li>
            <li>but so worth it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even use them was excited for nothing</li>
            <li>I am really excited to get these in.</li>
            <li>I get lots of tangles as well and they always brush right threw without all the strands ripping out!</li>
            <li>These are super soft and I was able to curl them!</li>
            <li>so if you are looking for a bright blonde look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>The hair is so silky and looks real and the price is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I love them thanks will order agin</li>
            <li>Not only is it flawless, but I received it two weeks earlier than the arrival date!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting!</li>
            <li>I already have long hair, but I use extensions to bulk up my own hair for special occasions and what not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is more of a golden LIGHT blonde/bleach blonde.</li>
            <li>but it is so worth the wait.</li>
            <li>These are seriously worth the money.</li>
            <li>Started shedding right out of the package.</li>
            <li>Im wearing them right now.</li>
            <li>THERE NOT EVEN THE RIGHT COLOR.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true they aren&#x27;t bleach blonde more like strawberry</li>
            <li>loved the initial feel of the hair, it was very soft.</li>
            <li>I got mine in the other day and they&#x27;re more of a light brown.</li>
            <li>The hair is shiny, smells funny, unless you&#x27;re using the hair for Halloween then maybe consider getting another piece of extensions.</li>
            <li>More of a strawberry blonde</li>
            <li>more like strawberry blonde!!</li>
            <li>They are super soft!</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t work for me as much as I wanted them too</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve heard synthetic hair extensions don&#x27;t handle hear very well.(they melt)</li>
            <li>so I was very relieved.</li>
            <li>But the product was high quality!</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>They where great my hair is to thin</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shed too too much.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping</li>
            <li>Decent, didn&amp;#34;t really match the color in the picture.</li>
            <li>they are more of a dish water blonde and my hair is bleach blonde</li>
            <li>Got them in today and clearly someone needs their eyes checked or a visit to a color wheel!!</li>
            <li>Left a wave that couldn&#x27;t be straightened out and the great left the piece a little frizzy.</li>
            <li>So many extensions, I wear them everyday, I can straiten and curl them</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though they call this bleach blonde, I do believe that they are slightly darker, with a kind of strawberry highlight to them.  </li>
            <li>They feel very soft and don&#x27;t tangle</li>
            <li>Unless you are willing to spend the extra money to dye each separate piece.</li>
            <li>The hair falls out a little to easy</li>
            <li>.. Received these and they appeared pink up against my light blonde hair.</li>
            <li>They came in 2 weeks early.....</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the 5 in order of least heat resistance to most resistant.&lt;br /&gt;-Polypropylene</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to be able to wear these without it looking ridiculous.</li>
            <li>turns out my hair took short for these to look decent but if it was longer it might look alright.</li>
            <li>, the other was Golden Blonde.  </li>
            <li>wow total sucked .</li>
            <li>They are not a bright bleach blonde which I am pleased with.</li>
            <li>Each strand is thin, but since there are soo many</li>
            <li>The hair is pretty thin, but that works good for me since my hair is already thin.</li>
            <li>I ordered bleach blonde and got a darker color than expected, was really dissapointed</li>
            <li>so fine that normal hair extensions look obvious and fake.  </li>

            <li> I ordered bleach blonde and got a darker color than expected, was really dissapointed</li>
            <li> so fine that normal hair extensions look obvious and fake.  </li>
            <li> The extensions are soft and not shiny at all, but they are not every thick, nor do they blend in very well with my hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they are soft &amp; silky to the touch, but like most of the other ladies have said, they ARE NOT Bleach Blonde.</li>
            <li> other pieces were completely knotted and gross</li>
            <li> So I would suggest low temp flat irons.</li>
            <li> I washed them and blow dried them and they were brand new again!</li>
            <li> but If you do indeed want to buy these, then get 2, there&#x27;s no downside, especially if you have medium to long hair, or even shoulder length.</li>
            <li> They are shipping from China so it will take a little while to ship to where I live</li>
            <li> it is the second closest to human hair other</li>
            <li> They also came in earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> Although after a few wears one of the clips&#x27; stitching has completely undone itself and detached itself from the rest of the track.</li>
            <li> These extensions are strawberry blonde as stated in other reviews</li>
            <li> Allow it to dry (without heat) before unwrapping from a dowel.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty thin hair</li>
            <li> When I received them, I only needed half of one set!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 3 wears the ends became very dry and unmanageable, even when taken care of.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I ordered them a little while back.</li>
            <li> They came faster than expected too.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 different Synthetic hair extensions and it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The color is off , and they are not real hair like they claim.</li>

            <li> I ordered the pre bleach blonde 613 and I absolutely love them!!!! They came in 2 weeks early..... They are super soft! I have done thin hair so they are a little heavy on my head but I will definitely order more!!</li>
            <li> Really nice Extensions!!! Loved them...totally loved them. Very soft and excellent quality. I wish they made in brown color too.</li>
            <li> Worked perfect for us. Just what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> the product was ok. Started shedding right out of the package. Doesn&#x27;t hold a curl for anything. Left a wave that couldn&#x27;t be straightened out and the great left the piece a little frizzy. turns out my hair took short for these to look decent but if it was longer it might look alright.</li>
            <li> I loved it pretty good for the price it cost .</li>
            <li> They are very nice and fit great. They get all tangled and its hard to untangle them but I still love them. I dyed them blue to match my hair but they came out as purple, but that&#x27;s ok the two colors look great together. I would recommend these to anybody who is looking for hair extensions. They also came in earlier than I expected. The earliest date for them to come in was July 16th and they came in July 7th.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give a 4 star and not 5 is because the one clip from the 3 clip piece didn&#x27;t work. Perfection other than that</li>
            <li> The extensions are soft and not shiny at all, but they are not every thick, nor do they blend in very well with my hair. they are a lot brighter and platinum blond then in the picture. they would work to add length to someone who has medium to longish hair already. But I happen to have a pixie cut (really short boyish hair), and I&#x27;ve been growing it out lately but I&#x27;m sort of impatient when it comes to that stuff. There is a LOT of fall out, that with in a month or so there would be no hair left in the clip. The hair its self tangles often and gets a lot of rat nests if not looked after and put down neatly. Also the hair is basically hair you would put on a wig. If you want to buy these i suggest saving your money and getting extensions from a real website that sells really good quality ones or just get a wig. They didn&#x27;t work for me as much as I wanted them too but If you do indeed want to buy these, then get 2, there&#x27;s no downside, especially if you have medium to long hair, or even shoulder length. But not a pixie cut like me.</li>
            <li> wow total sucked . they were frizzy and mangled. i tryed to brush it out but lots an dlots of the hair fell out . other pieces were completely knotted and gross</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. The wait for me was a month and a few days but so worth it! Im wearing them right now. The color is more of a golden LIGHT blonde/bleach blonde. I am so happy with them. I am ordering another pair just to give some volume! I havr thick frizzy haor and you cannot and they blend so well even with my thick hair! I recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> They tangled very easily. After 3 wears the ends became very dry and unmanageable, even when taken care of.&lt;br /&gt;I loved the initial feel of the hair, it was very soft. If they had maintained that feeling I would still be wearing them.</li>
            <li> They are not a bright bleach blonde which I am pleased with. I hate the white looking blonde color. They are great for highlights if you don&#x27;t want to dye your hair. I relax mine and have black hair so I didn&#x27;t want to dye them I just pop these in and they look great!  They came faster than expected too.</li>
            <li> I just ordered these and I&#x27;m very excited to use them, the only thing that concerned me was that they&#x27;re synthetic and I&#x27;ve heard synthetic hair extensions don&#x27;t handle hear very well.(they melt) so I went on the internet and found there are 5 types of synthetic hair this kind is called Kanekalon it is the second closest to human hair other then Monobiber so I was very relieved. Kanekalon is very popular and can take heat treatment much better then the other. Here&#x27;s the 5 in order of least heat resistance to most resistant.&lt;br /&gt;-Polypropylene&lt;br /&gt;-Toyokalon&lt;br /&gt;-Kanekalon&lt;br /&gt;-High Temperature&lt;br /&gt;-Monobiber</li>
            <li> This definitely isn&#x27;t bleach blonde like it claims. I got mine in the other day and they&#x27;re more of a light brown. My hair is very light so there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to be able to wear these without it looking ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I like these. They come in a variety of different width lengths. The hair is pretty thin, but that works good for me since my hair is already thin. Clips are just OK.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about these looking &#x27;fake&#x27;. The hair is so silky and looks real and the price is outstanding. If you want cheap but QUALITY, buy this. You will be jumping for joy!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my granddaughter &amp; she loved it.</li>
            <li> they fit my hair just perfectly</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t bleach blonde like advertised</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these extentions</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Not only is it flawless, but I received it two weeks earlier than the arrival date! I definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for hair extensions. HOWEVER!!! The picture shown is a brighter blonde than what you receive so if you are looking for a bright blonde look elsewhere. Unless you are willing to spend the extra money to dye each separate piece. In that case GO FOR IT!! Each piece is super soft, flawless, and absolutely Perfect!</li>
            <li> These are super soft and I was able to curl them!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love them! They go perfect with my hair color! They are a little shinier than my hair but if I put a little more conditioner on it it matches perfect! Great buy</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re beautiful, and they came just in time</li>
            <li> I bought 2 different Synthetic hair extensions and it was a waste of money. Should have bought 1 human hair for $30.00. The hair is shiny, smells funny, unless you&#x27;re using the hair for Halloween then maybe consider getting another piece of extensions.</li>
            <li> I would not but any thing from then again they are not bleach blonde they are more of a dish water blonde and my hair is bleach blonde dont match me at all wanted then cause in losing my hair due to chemo n miss I can&#x27;t even use them was excited for nothing</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting! Matched my hair color perfect! I ordered 2 sets! As soon as they arrived and used then I had to order 2 more &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;  i tried straightening them... Bad idea! Definitely not &amp;#34;real hair&amp;#34; my son spilt apple juice on them I was so sad.... I washed them and blow dried them and they were brand new again! So happy with my purchase! The price was extremely cheap! But the product was high quality! I get lots of tangles as well and they always brush right threw without all the strands ripping out! 5 stars for sure!</li>
            <li> The color is off , and they are not real hair like they claim.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true they aren&#x27;t bleach blonde more like strawberry blonde but I love them !!! They are ao pretty and feel so nice like real hair!! Defiantly worth it!!!! And came way earlier than the delivery estimate!!</li>
            <li> I am really excited to get these in. I ordered them a little while back. They are shipping from China so it will take a little while to ship to where I live but it is so worth the wait. I read the reviews and they were sooo helpful. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a ACTUAL Bleach Blonde then look elsewhere. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they are soft &amp; silky to the touch, but like most of the other ladies have said, they ARE NOT Bleach Blonde. They are Strawberry Blonde. Seller should change the description to avoid future negative reviews from misled customers.</li>
            <li> Decent, didn&amp;#34;t really match the color in the picture.</li>
            <li> BEWARE! These extensions are strawberry blonde as stated in other reviews.. Received these and they appeared pink up against my light blonde hair. Ended up throwing them away.</li>
            <li> So many extensions, I wear them everyday, I can straiten and curl them and I love it they are the perfect shade for my hair too :) thank you :)</li>
            <li> They where great my hair is to thin but the product was great</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair....so fine that normal hair extensions look obvious and fake.  I already have long hair, but I use extensions to bulk up my own hair for special occasions and what not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were perfect for my hair.  They are thin, which is what makes them work so well for me.  If you have coarser hair, then they probably won&#x27;t work too well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading previous reviews on how thin they were, I ordered two packs.  One the Bleach Blonde, the other was Golden Blonde.  When I received them, I only needed half of one set!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though they call this bleach blonde, I do believe that they are slightly darker, with a kind of strawberry highlight to them.  However, since I had recently gotten strawberry highlights, they blended perfectly into my own hair.  I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference and neither could my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried curling one set with my straightener, but the curl wouldn&#x27;t stay.  However, I tried my technique for curling doll hair and it worked beautifully.  Curl the hair around something that can get wet, a dowel for example.  Make sure it is the diameter of curl that you want.  Next, heat some water - almost to boiling.  Pour this over the hair that is wrapped around the dowel making sure to get ALL the hair.  Immediately soak in cold water to set the curl.  Allow it to dry (without heat) before unwrapping from a dowel.  Carefully finger comb the curls so you don&#x27;t pull the hair from the clips.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do anything with it what so ever and no  matter how many times I wash them they smell awful.</li>
            <li> Not strawberry blonde at all! kind of shiny, but once blended into hair they give you a nice highlight, and definatley make it a lot thicker. Each strand is thin, but since there are soo many it makes a huge difference! Great Buy!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my aunt about a month ago she has only used them once.  The hair falls out a little to easy but if you wet it and put hair spray in it they stay. What you read is what you get. BLEACH BLONDE. Its way lighter than the pic.</li>
            <li> Not for me my niece ordered it.</li>
            <li> More of a strawberry blonde</li>
            <li> Love them! I haven&#x27;t tried curling or straightening them yet but so far they are great! They do tend to tangle up some but with good care they are fine. I would recommend this item. It&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li> For the ten dollar price tag it definitely a deal. Although after a few wears one of the clips&#x27; stitching has completely undone itself and detached itself from the rest of the track. They don&#x27;t shed too too much. The color is as it appears in the picture. I&#x27;ve occasionally used the straightener on these without any issues. Although I don&#x27;t know how they would measure up if subjected to heavier straightener use. For the most part they blend nicely with the hair.</li>
            <li> I order them back in April. Somehow the tracking said delivered but I never received them. Its a good thing the seller worked with me and re sent them. Got them yesterday and they are not bleach blonde !! I waited all this time for them to just sit around and collect dust. Hopefully I can find someone who could use them.. What a freaking waste!!!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife for christmas. Color was perfect. They look and feel almost real.she loves them.</li>
            <li> Its looks like my blonde hair but it has a bump and gets ratty I love it though</li>
            <li> Bleach Blonde it is NOT.....more like strawberry blonde!! Got them in today and clearly someone needs their eyes checked or a visit to a color wheel!!</li>
            <li> I love them thanks will order agin</li>
            <li> These are seriously worth the money. I would have even paid more. They are thin so I suggest ordering two packs. I have pretty thin hair and I&#x27;m even considering another pack. The color is spot on what the pictures shows. They feel very soft and don&#x27;t tangle and she&#x27;d a lot. 9 ran my CHI over the tip of one and it did get a little frizzy. So they are not 100% human hair. So I would suggest low temp flat irons. I don&#x27;t know how they are once colored or wet  but they are great for now to hold me our until my SKR set comes in. I&#x27;d for sure buy these again! Shipping took about two weeks.</li>
            <li> I ordered bleach blonde and got a darker color than expected, was really dissapointed</li>
            <li> Just as described and there are a bunch of them. Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> I got these and i have never had a problem with synthetic extensions before, but when i got these they are terribly thin and as soon as i take them out of the package half of the hair isn&#x27;t even attached and its all down at the bottom. i&#x27;ve honestly never been so disapointed with anything i&#x27;ve had before.. NEVER BUYING FROM THEM AGAIN.......... THERE NOT EVEN THE RIGHT COLOR.</li>
            <li> I really love them !!!!! At first I was disappointed with the color but when I put them on they look just perfect!!!!!!!</li>
