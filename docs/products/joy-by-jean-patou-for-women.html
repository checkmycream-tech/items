            <li>Received it in great time.</li>
            <li>I love Joy!!  </li>
            <li>It smelled authentic Joy but my forearms become COVERED in welts or anywhere I spray it!!</li>
            <li>it made me feel so sophisticated and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I remember when Joy cologne or perfume was found at many of the finer department stores.</li>
            <li>It was wonderful at first</li>
            <li>but since it is a \\&quot;hazardous liquid\\&quot; I am not allowed to return it to Amazon LLC.  </li>
            <li>It arrived promptly and was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>I thought, this is nice, but it is not for me.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still a nice scent</li>
            <li>When I found JOY on Amazon I was so excited that I purchased two bottles.  </li>
            <li>My favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>of the precious</li>
            <li>She has used it for many years and never tires of it.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>I never could detect the civet that so many reviewers have talked about.  </li>
            <li>, this EDT is appropriate for office wear if you are looking for something to wear to work.  </li>
            <li>So, I have to put more on after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>bottle of my beloved \\&quot;Joy\\&quot; at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I love it and save it for special occasions;  the light floral scent of roses is sublime and sexy.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely way to have the scent but not too richly.  </li>
            <li>but it evaporated very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong (think character) feminine quality to it.  </li>
            <li>I think it has a formality about it that makes it appropriate for special occasions.  </li>
            <li>My search became frantic and obessive...and then a  shining light appeared to beckoned me to follow onto Amazon.com to find a 2.5 oz.</li>
            <li>very useful find.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when it arrived.</li>
            <li>love this classic perfume</li>
            <li>It was as though I had buried my face in a huge bouquet of roses, and my first reaction was that it smelled like a roses scented air freshner.  </li>
            <li>Joy is a timeless scent - subtle and lovely.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for filling my day with so much \\&quot;Joy\\&quot;!!</li>
            <li>Upon initial application, all I could smell was roses, roses, roses, and more roses!  </li>
            <li>The packaging was nice, and the bottle looked the same.</li>
            <li>As a truly classic, iconic fragrance, Joy is at least worth trying.</li>
            <li>dreams do sometimes come true, thanks to the supplier of my 2.5 oz.</li>
            <li>An uncle returned from a trip to France and gave me my first bottle...</li>
            <li>The scent was a light sweet smell that made you imagine sunny fields of spring flowers in the French countryside.  </li>
            <li>My wife has been using Joy  for at least 30 years.  </li>
            <li>something different to have on hand for the appropriate occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, it was not a scam.  </li>
            <li>I am on a mission to try all of the truly iconic parfums created between the late 19th through the middle 20th centuries, and I recently acquired this legendary EDT.  </li>
            <li>the time Joy was first produced, it was dubbed the &amp;#34;most expensive parfum in the world.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Then, as dry down settled in, I could smell something sweeter, more interesting than just the roses, which I could still smell quite clearly.  </li>
            <li>I have worn \\&quot;Joy\\&quot; since I was in high school.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey, but ok for the product.  </li>
            <li>I can imagine the likes of a young Katherine Hepburn wearing this parfum.  </li>
            <li>I must admit that I do not like it as much as Chanel No. 5, or L&#x27;air du Temps, or Private Collection, but I do like it.  </li>
            <li>It no longer is the most expensive parfum in the world (not sure which parfum is the most expensive these days), but it is still very nice.  </li>
            <li>Sillage is perhaps two to three feet at first, then one to two feet as it dries down.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> My favorite perfume.  Wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> My heart broke when I learned \\&quot;Joy\\&quot; by Jean Patou [[ASIN:B000C230OE Joy By Jean Patou For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 2.5 Ounces]]was going to be discontinued.  I have worn \\&quot;Joy\\&quot; since I was in high school.  An uncle returned from a trip to France and gave me my first bottle...it made me feel so sophisticated and beautiful.  The scent was a light sweet smell that made you imagine sunny fields of spring flowers in the French countryside.  I was hooked and have woren \\&quot;Joy\\&quot; ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hunted like a hungry wolf in stores and online, panic coarsing through my veins, \\&quot;it can&#x27;t be, no more \\&quot;Joy\\&quot;\\&quot;! My mission was to develop a stockpile that will last me for the rest of my life.  Hunt down every bottle I can find and lock it away.  My search became frantic and obessive...and then a  shining light appeared to beckoned me to follow onto Amazon.com to find a 2.5 oz. bottle of my beloved \\&quot;Joy\\&quot; at a reasonable price.  With my heart beating faster with each passing minute, credit card held suspended in my trembling hand thinking what if this is a \\&quot;scam\\&quot;?!?  Terror consumed me but I had to have it...I couldn&#x27;t let it slip away from me for ever, what if it wasn&#x27;t a scam?  Much to my surprise, it was not a scam.  My treasure was delivered to my doorstep within days and it was everything I had hope for...so for all you Girls out there...dreams do sometimes come true, thanks to the supplier of my 2.5 oz. of the precious \\&quot;Joy\\&quot; and Amazon.com.  Thank you for filling my day with so much \\&quot;Joy\\&quot;!!</li>
            <li> When I found JOY on Amazon I was so excited that I purchased two bottles.  The packaging is perfect.  one would never know from looking at it that it is a counterfeit product.  What&#x27;s worse, not even a nice-smelling counterfeit.  I thought that I could make do with the fake product, but it is so vile and nauseating that I had to throw it away.  I tried to return the second bottle but since it is a \\&quot;hazardous liquid\\&quot; I am not allowed to return it to Amazon LLC.  My only consolation is to leave feedback that can save others from wasting their money.  DO NOT purchase this product.  You will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using Joy  for at least 30 years.  She won&#x27;t use any other perfume.  She gets lots of compliments.  I always give Her a bottle for Christmas.  It is getting difficult to find in stores.  I know I can count on Amazon to provide it.</li>
            <li> This was how my grandmother smelled!! I love Joy!!  I prefer the perfume, but it is difficult to find and very, VERY spendy.  This is a lovely way to have the scent but not too richly.  It is quite pungent and, like Poison, you either can carry it or not!!&lt;br /&gt;Try it!!</li>
            <li> I think something is very wrong with this perfume. It smelled authentic Joy but my forearms become COVERED in welts or anywhere I spray it!!</li>
            <li> very useful find.  excellent resource page.  will probably use this resource again and again.  will tell other friends about this resource/</li>
            <li> I buy this occasionally for my wife. She has used it for many years and never tires of it. Amazon site provided the best price that I could find.  What more can I say?</li>
            <li> Joy perfume is about all I ever wear, except maybe clothes.  It cheers me up during the day to catch a whiff.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  I have worn it for years.  It is a beautiful&lt;br /&gt;fragrance.  It arrived promptly and was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> This was not a good purchase for me. It was the wrong scent. I then found out you cannot return this through Amazon. : (</li>
            <li> I remember when Joy cologne or perfume was found at many of the finer department stores. It was once billed as \\&quot;the world&#x27;s costliest perfume.\\&quot; I believe Procter and Gamble currently owns the company, so I am not sure why it isn&#x27;t found more commonly in the United States, but at least it can be bought online. I love it and save it for special occasions;  the light floral scent of roses is sublime and sexy. It is truly a timeless fragrance.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but ok for the product.  I don&#x27;t know if I can find it in the stores around here any longer.</li>
            <li> I am on a mission to try all of the truly iconic parfums created between the late 19th through the middle 20th centuries, and I recently acquired this legendary EDT.  Upon initial application, all I could smell was roses, roses, roses, and more roses!  It was as though I had buried my face in a huge bouquet of roses, and my first reaction was that it smelled like a roses scented air freshner.  I thought, this is nice, but it is not for me.  Then, as dry down settled in, I could smell something sweeter, more interesting than just the roses, which I could still smell quite clearly.  It was probably jasmine.  I never could detect the civet that so many reviewers have talked about.  Until if finally faded away, it remained on me a mixture of roses and jasmine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time Joy was first produced, it was dubbed the &amp;#34;most expensive parfum in the world.&amp;#34;  It no longer is the most expensive parfum in the world (not sure which parfum is the most expensive these days), but it is still very nice.  I think it has a formality about it that makes it appropriate for special occasions.  I can imagine the likes of a young Katherine Hepburn wearing this parfum.  It has a strong (think character) feminine quality to it.  I must admit that I do not like it as much as Chanel No. 5, or L&#x27;air du Temps, or Private Collection, but I do like it.  It is a keeper; something different to have on hand for the appropriate occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, this EDT is appropriate for office wear if you are looking for something to wear to work.  It stays close to the skin, and on me, it lasts four to five hours and is not overpowering, so it would not likely offend anyone in your office.  Sillage is perhaps two to three feet at first, then one to two feet as it dries down.  As a truly classic, iconic fragrance, Joy is at least worth trying.</li>
            <li> Best price I&#x27;ve evr paid for this!  Delivered on time....would order from them again!</li>
            <li> Joy is a timeless scent - subtle and lovely.  It is a treat for me and I hope for the people around me when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Received it in great time. Hadn&#x27;t had this perfume for years and it didn&#x27;t smell as I remembered it&lt;br /&gt; but it&#x27;s still a nice scent</li>
            <li> love this classic perfume</li>
            <li> One of the best fragrances! I bought for my mom as a gift, but would not mind getting for myself. Smells great!</li>
            <li> It was wonderful at first but it evaporated very quickly.  Next time I&#x27;ll try Eau de Parfum spray. I remember now that my mother used to use Eau de Parfum spray and it smelled like roses.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality at a great price!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when it arrived. It smells just like I remember it 20 years ago. The packaging was nice, and the bottle looked the same. But, the fragrance was a bit weak after a few minutes. So, I have to put more on after a couple of hours. But, the fragrance is unmistakable. My husband went crazy when he smelled it on me. I like to douse a little bit on me before bed. Need I say more?</li>
            <li> Love it - same as the perfume bought at the department store but much less expensive.  Would definately purchase again!</li>
