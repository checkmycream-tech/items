            <li>This is the BEST eye cream I have ever used and my expectations at 45 yrs old were very low!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks of using this product, I was impressed with the line reduction and under-eye tightening effects, but after 1 month I noticed that my eyelashes appeared longer!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this purchase and plan to buy more once my supply runs out.</li>
            <li>My eyes have always been my best feature, even at 71, so I try hard to “preserve” them as best I can.  </li>
            <li>It is going to be great to use during the summer as it is not greasy and it absorbs quick.</li>
            <li>They sent me an e-mail asking me how I liked the product, and when I said I really liked it, they sent me a refill for free!</li>
            <li>Works as good or better then anything I have tried - including products costing lots, lots more like Obagi, Lancome, Chantecaille.</li>
            <li>It feels great and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>The light cucumber scent is also pleasant.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;This was very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It glides on very easy.</li>
            <li>I was real excited to get this after reading the reviews</li>
            <li>The best natural eye gel!</li>

            <li>SURE GLAD I DID!  </li>
            <li>I am so glad to be able to test this product!</li>
            <li>I love products that serve more than one purpose!</li>
            <li>Will continue using it for sure though! :)</li>
            <li>The best part is that it didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and eyes!</li>
            <li>The reviews were right!!!  </li>
            <li>very good, fast shipping</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference on the days I forget to put it on, Very good product</li>
            <li>This is very good and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for a couple off weeks, and have been so far impressed with the results on my puffy eyes in the morning.</li>
            <li>smells wonderful and is working great on my dark circles.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say it&#x27;s working better than what I was using.  </li>
            <li>I am 42 years old and want to look my best.</li>
            <li>I honestly think I could do better by researching dieting changes that target the needs that this product claims to meet.</li>
            <li>Will keep using until the product is finished but not vey confident at this point that this product is effective in reducing eye bags</li>
            <li>Looked on amazon and decided to see what what was cheap or had good reviews.</li>
            <li>far I am very impressed with the impact this product has had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a company that offers excellent customer service.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this product and the seller.&lt;br /&gt;The eye gel has a nice consistency</li>
            <li>My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product that works, is reasonably priced, and comes with a wonderful guarantee!  </li>
            <li>so far, great!!</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that it does tighten the skin on and around my eyes giving me a more awake look.</li>
            <li>Best eye treatment I have used so far (</li>
            <li>I do not feel that it nicely absorbs into my skin but rather a jelly layer on top on eye skin which dries in the morning, leaving a residue on my face.</li>
            <li>I need to be honest - I don&#x27;t feel overwhelmingly enthralled by this product, but I do like it.</li>
            <li>If not the product kind of peels off of my face like its not soaking into my skin but forming a layer on top.</li>
            <li>The best product that I have found so far.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it&#x27;s non-irritating,  The ingredients in this eye gel are natural and one of the best combination I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li>The best eye product so far.</li>
            <li>I love this product, absolutely amazing....</li>
            <li>Love this gel, its texture is amazing and It softens and hydrates the eye so well.</li>
            <li>but after using this I kind believe it work better cus</li>
            <li>My eyes look nice and healthy</li>
            <li>So far I am LOVING this Eye Gel!!!</li>
            <li>It was nice to apply at night and let it set in to do its magic.</li>
            <li>The product is by far the best that I have used to&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I was expecting this one to be more effective but did not meet my expectations.  </li>
            <li>THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN</li>
            <li>real nice, works fast</li>
            <li>The manufacturer recommends using the product for two months to get full value!!  </li>
            <li>I had my doubts it was helping any, but I figured with all the great reivews, it MUST be doing something, right?  </li>
            <li>My eyes get irritated easily and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this!</li>
            <li>The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love love love it!  </li>
            <li>I am very impressed so far, and feel like this product is a really good step in the right direction!</li>
            <li>InstaNatural is definitely my &amp;#34;Fountain of Youth&amp;#34; I give InstaNatural 5 stars for amazing products and excellent customer service.  </li>
            <li>I have used many eye creams and gels regardless of cost and this one is by far the best!  </li>
            <li>This eye gel is honestly the best facial product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell, like a mild cucumber.</li>
            <li>I just can not tell you enough about this cream------------you will NEED to try it on your own to get the full benefits of it!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not something you should say lightly when you have tried hundreds of creams, but it really is the best eye cream out there!</li>
            <li>I was even more impressed when I received an email from the founder of the product, giving tips and assurance that complete satisfaction was guaranteed.</li>
            <li>Good product, happy with results so far</li>
            <li>The consistency is nice, not sticky and the fragrance is really light and nice too.</li>
            <li>did receive this for free to test out, but this review is honest and 100% my own.</li>

            <li>Great product - fast shipper!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it consistently around my eyes for 5 weeks and have experienced a visible improvement.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I look and feel better which makes me more confident.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever experienced any type of skin allergy.  </li>
            <li>This is another great quality product that really works!  </li>
            <li>As the saying goes, if it seems too good to be true....</li>
            <li>I do recommend this gel, and the price is almost too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I really love the easy application and effectiveness!</li>
            <li>Very attentive.</li>
            <li>Skin looks and feels very smooth and moisture after using..</li>
            <li>So to try some of &amp;#34; everything &amp;#34; to preserve my looks has been very important to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a light, fresh scent - but more importantly, it feels wonderful!</li>
            <li>It has a very light essence, but I didn&#x27;t bother me, I never got an allergic reaction neither my husband.</li>
            <li>and they do not do animal testing or use animal ingredients in this product which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>, it feels very light on your skin.</li>
            <li>I like the consistency of this eye cream since it is very light.</li>
            <li>This eye gel  is one of the best products that I have ever tried[  I have tried most of all the top product lines, from  Murad,  Cindy Crawfords, to Perricone, and this is one of the most effective for not only  under the eyes, but for wrinkles on the face and neck as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This spreads nicely and then is easy to cover with make-up or with a night time moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell strong, but it does have a nice scent to it.  </li>
            <li>Hoped it would work great based on all the positive feedback and reviews.</li>
            <li>I have been using Eye Gel for about a month now and am very pleased that those bags have diminished significantly.  </li>
            <li>I love the convenience of the pump to be able to dispense the product and the products feels really good and cool eyes and puffiness</li>
            <li>It shows that the company stands by their products and that satisfying their customers is very important.  </li>
            <li>This Eye Gel has a nice light texture and goes on very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Trying this out has made a huge difference for me!</li>
            <li>By the way, this is a huge bottle!  </li>
            <li>With the combination of both eye gels, I have seen a huge difference!</li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to all my girl friends, and they love it too.</li>
            <li>Now my eyes feel more alert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad I bought the product.</li>
            <li>I got this item for free to try out for a promotion but all my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff  </li>
            <li>it would compress more out of the bottle overnight....</li>
            <li>Egh, I&#x27;ve used better creams.</li>
            <li>I find that it works some days better than others.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>In matter of days my skin looked significantly better.</li>
            <li>And the company is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>I know as the days go by of using this product it will just fade even more.  </li>
            <li>I have had this product for bit more than three weeks</li>
            <li>::)</li>
            <li>I felt like my eyes were aging faster than most of my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>with this product. :)</li>
            <li>(in fact under eyes look better in my before)&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t say for sure if it is a 5 star product.  </li>
            <li>Love the price!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am pleased that the puffiness has been visibly reduced and feel I look that much better.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have seen noticeable changes around my eyes.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m hoping to try more products from this brand soon.</li>
            <li>Probably better than using cucumber slices.</li>
            <li>product was provided free of charge for reviewing purposes in exchange with my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was too sticky for me and it felt like it was making my eye wrinkles even more visible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had better results from this eye gel then the $90 jar of eye cream recommended by a skin renewal dermatologist.</li>
            <li>goes on smooth and absorbs into the skin nicely...</li>

            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many creams over the years without any results and just gave up and used concealer.</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased with this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now been able to use this product for a week</li>

            <li>The more makeup and concealer</li>
            <li>I use to try and hide them, the more the wrinkles show up.</li>
            <li>I heard that people have seen more results the longer they use it</li>
            <li>, this is refreshing, and it works</li>
            <li>I think the area around my eyes appears to me more &amp;#34;rested&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li>The company is lovely to deal with.</li>

            <li>After three days of using this product my skin appeared brighter, more even in tone, and the puffiness under my eyes was drastically reduced.</li>
            <li>I have now used it for two weeks, day and night, and my skin has NEVER looked better.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many bag reducers for my eyes  </li>

            <li>I do wish there was more in the bottle</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell of this eye gel.</li>

            <li>I am sure it will take awhile to see if it makes a noticeable change.</li>
            <li>This gel is a great moisturizer for your whole face.</li>

            <li>and this works better already.  </li>
            <li>Since eye issues were years in the making, it might take more time than a month to reduce.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t escape your genes but this stuff definitely makes the best of what you got.</li>
            <li>oh so many .  </li>

            <li>Most ppl think I am in my 30s. :-)</li>
            <li>I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW: I was hoping to reduce under eye puffiness with this gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this more than 2 months now</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>my skin is getting better</li>
            <li>Love it ...</li>
            <li>The description says most people see improvement after 8 weeks</li>
            <li>I LOVE this gel...</li>
            <li>That really does create quite a great experience for someone who is just being introduced to a company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magic to prevent more wrinkles as well --</li>
            <li>I love thisproduct</li>
            <li>I love this eye gel.</li>
            <li>I probably used it 3 X a day, however, which is more than recommended.  </li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m my age.  </li>
            <li>but I already know I love this product and will reorder it.</li>
            <li>I have seen incredible results with the Eye Gel in my eyes and complete face.  </li>
            <li>and it kinda makes my face look fuller and more plump.</li>
            <li>an okay</li>
            <li>I start getting itchy eyes and felt more line under my eye.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Im  57 and pleased with the results</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now going to order more products.</li>
            <li>For 3 more months I used the Eye Serum.</li>
            <li>more dewy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My eyelids have become brighter and more even toned as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I was hoping for better results.</li>
            <li>Will try it more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m going to give it more time.</li>
            <li>Most eye creams or gels have .5 to 1 oz.</li>
            <li>This has 1.7 fl oz which is comparable to most face care products.</li>
            <li>I am SO glad I did.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what :)</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off using Vaseline or coconut</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I think this gave me more crows feet.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>My colleagues noticed the results on week 3, I was told that I look more rested and youthful.</li>
            <li>and I love it too.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how moisturizing it is since it&#x27;s a drier gel, not a goopy cream, but it sure does the job on my puffiness.</li>
            <li>so it was wonderful to find something that actually works!</li>
            <li>People, mostly men, say that I look like 30, and that is a mood booster for any woman.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Eyes just got more puffy....</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I store it in the refrigerator; the added coolness enhances the refreshing effect.  </li>
            <li>Mmm I love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>This really works great.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to do this, but I feel more is better, though I realize this is not always the case.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m truly pleased with the product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is simply fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to inform that this product has made me look more radiant and has made my skin plumper as I use it in my whole face.  </li>
            <li>I am 100% satisfied</li>
            <li>I think i&#x27;m better off drinking tons of water and flushing out the toxins in my body.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing more of this product.</li>
            <li>eh this product is okay</li>
            <li>I love this product and have noticed a difference in the area around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Use it daily to get the best result!</li>
            <li>Love the texture and silky feel.</li>
            <li>found it interesting that this uses hyaluronic acid, because I&#x27;ve had this substance injected into my knees for joint lubrication.</li>
            <li>Using it once or twice a day, the darkness went from medium (which most folks see on themselves as hideous and disfiguring. . .)</li>
            <li>The puffiness is a bit better, but just a bit.</li>
            <li>Importantly, it does not irritate the eyes, and has no obnoxious scent.i received a sample of this product in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>(Most eye gels burn and cause a rash.)  </li>
            <li>I did get my items for free for a review but have no issue saying when I do not care for a product!</li>
            <li>but this product and its accompanying products do that and more.</li>
            <li>Love the results, I don&#x27;t look like a walking zombie anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But, I also use Watts Hyaluronic Retinol Serums regularly, so I&#x27;m sure that boosts it...</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love every product I have tried from Instanatural.</li>
            <li>These are 100% better.</li>
            <li>I am well pleased and will recommend Youth Express Eye Gel to my friends</li>
            <li>This only validates the care they invest  into making this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Most eye products I have tried irritated my eyes and made them water.  </li>
            <li>Great for my sensitive eyes, and does the job of reducing under eye puffiness Honestly need more time to continue use of product..</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I got this one.</li>
            <li>that it didn&#x27;t burn the eyes or cause me any skin irritations which many products can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He wanted to use something that was safe for around his eyes and would help his eyes look</li>
            <li>for the last two weeks I have noticed an impressive reduction in puffiness and darkness under my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>- I was spending $$$&#x27;s, ok $$$$&#x27;s on products  annually</li>
            <li>Additionally, their customer service is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Wish I had better things to say about it.</li>
            <li>Love this not oily eye gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not gonna buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li>OK let&#x27;s give it to more chance</li>
            <li>I love lovr love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for my sensitive skin and it feels good because it&#x27;s cooling.  </li>
            <li>It looks smoother and my eye-shadow goes on much better.  </li>
            <li>I love all of the InstaNatural products I have tried.</li>
            <li>I chose to buy this when I seen a promotional price and glad I did</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>My eyes look better now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with</li>
            <li>I think this will work better with concealer on top of it.</li>
            <li>I love having this eye gel in my beauty cupboard, and adding it to beauty routine.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I got this product for free to try and give my honest opinion on.</li>
            <li>so I can get the make to blend better.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure that is the reason why I have not seen a drastic change.</li>
            <li>Ok I never write reviews</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many products from</li>
            <li>We can&#x27;t wait to try out more of their products.</li>
            <li>so that is why I apply it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed my eyes are more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Once it runs out, I plan to order more.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>, i believe it will be better in time/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love that you can use it all over your&lt;br /&gt;facial and neck area with firming results.  </li>
            <li>I love this eye gel.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t feel like I need to use it during the day although I have before and had no problem putting my makeup on over top of it</li>
            <li>I love the cucumber smell</li>
            <li>this is perfect help to make you look younger</li>
            <li>I feel it removes the puffiness and bags and gives me a more &#x27;alert and awake&#x27; look every day.</li>
            <li>, the product caused my eyes to burn and to become inflamed and even more puffy.</li>
            <li>I tested to make sure it was this product by taking a couple days off then re-using.</li>
            <li>so I need more time to review the product.</li>
            <li>Eyes are looking better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product and would repurchase in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I had a compliment about how good I looked for my age that very day, and this never happens to me any more.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product right out of the shipping box and, aside from the nice cucumber scent, wasn&#x27;t thrilled.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this eye cream was that it has a nice cucumber scent, I love it!</li>
            <li>So far, so good! :)</li>
            <li>Super awesome and love it- have sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t break me out!</li>

            <li>This is a great product and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Great product without the high $.</li>

            <li>Very light, easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soothing, my under eye circles, while not completely gone, have diminished with just about a month of us and best of all, my skin does not break out or have an adverse reaction.  </li>
            <li>it is nice and cool when you put it on...</li>

            <li>The size is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I bought this product with my own money at full price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Customer service was nice to give me full refund.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did my research on Hyaluronic Acid before ordering Premium Hydration formula (another order) and was impressed to find that this ingredient is used in eye surgeries as well as to treat osteoarthritis and minor wounds.</li>
            <li>The first bottle I loved.</li>
            <li>It feels nice and cool.</li>
            <li>The eye gel is nice and cool while applying</li>
            <li>but it does feel nice and cool on the eyes.  </li>

            <li>This cream is very refreshing and quickly absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>This does a pretty good job.</li>

            <li>Absolutely great for my over medicated body, my skin is rejuvenated and not dull anymore</li>
            <li>I have bought many, many brands to try and reduce the fine lines and crows feet around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Best decision in a long time!</li>
            <li>I have purchased a number of things from InstaNatural and all the products are great and have a lovely natural scent to them.</li>
            <li>but when I put this on all over my face it cleared all my dry skin and my skin looks perfect.</li>
            <li>I really love this product it is so easy to use</li>

            <li>Speed of delivery was incredibly quick and may I just add - AJ from Instanatural is amazing at his job.</li>
            <li>and it truly is amazing the quick results.</li>
            <li>You have to let it dry for a couple of minutes, and it stays perfectly under your make up.</li>
            <li>was really hoping this would work since it looks like there are many good reviews.</li>
            <li>found a great natural product that gave me even better results on my face.  </li>

            <li>Great moisture and no irritation for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The texture is great, it smells really nice (cucumber), and my rough skin around my eyes is now very smooth and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li>I use the Baobab oil on top of it which works fine.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have many fine lines or signs of age.</li>
            <li>Most of my fine wrinkles are almost gone, and my skin looks tighter too.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t be sure which one of the three has helped with the fine lines.</li>
            <li>More like a gel than a cream, and wear just fine under makeup.</li>
            <li>I got more pronounce fine lines under my eyes</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over a month, mostly as an eye cream for fine lines.  </li>

            <li>The eye gel gives instant refreshing; it just feels good!  </li>
            <li>I have tried other creams for years but this one is the best I have found, beating Avon eye cream for sure</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t too runny or lotiony but went on very easy and felt rather cool on the skin.</li>
            <li>People don&#x27;t believe that I am 10 years older than they guess me at thanks to this awesome cream!!!!</li>
            <li>This feels really cool to the eyes once you apply them, that&#x27;s what I love the most about this eye gel.</li>

            <li>It is light and has a lovely scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have recommended the InstaNatural The Best Eye Cream For Dark Circles</li>
            <li>I have written a more detailed review on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com.</li>
            <li>and I have def noticed a more smooth surface under/around my eye area as well as brighter smoother skin as I also use on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this refreshing gel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great all natural product</li>
            <li>Also helps concealer apply more evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>So far I am extremely happy....</li>
            <li>I will report later to see how much more beautiful it makes me.</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve done better at looking at at reviews instead of the ingredients (which aren&#x27;t fantastic anyway but for the price</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now as far as the results I have seen in the appearance in my own face I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>the tone is much more smooth and even.</li>
            <li>the price, you do get a lot of product and shipping was free, but I&#x27;ve had much better results from drugstore brands than with this.</li>
            <li>Smells great and makes my face soft.  </li>
            <li>it makes my skin smooth and better looking</li>
            <li>far, I am happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best money ever spent, and amazon has it the cheapest I could find anywhere.</li>
            <li>It is okay for dark circles but excellent for wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I have been happy with all of the products I have tried so far by this company.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not what I expected after reading all the wonderful reviews.  </li>
            <li>This procuct is pretty awesome as far as depuffing the bags under my eyes that I get from insomia.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been so happy with this eye gel so far.</li>
            <li>I love the light weight of this eye gel, and sometimes I do apply the eye gel on my face too.  </li>
            <li>As a first time user of this product, I am very pleased with my skin after one month.  </li>
            <li>So far I have found that this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I have bought and tried a number of products to help alleviate puffiness, and found that the youth express eye gel has made an incredible difference, even over the last week or so.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural seems to have done its research and turned out a great line of products that are also natural.</li>
            <li>Somehow, I think the gel plumps your skin to create a more smooth appearance.</li>
            <li>it is just so cooling and soothing and more importantly</li>
            <li>did not notice anything great as far as reducing puffy eyes</li>
            <li>And most important drink lots water.  </li>
            <li>I also love the light cooling feeling it had when applied.</li>
            <li>After I read the ingredients, I was amazed at how many incredible and powerful natural items included in this gel...</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many different products and didn&#x27;t see any great results.</li>
            <li>After opening and testing out, I can say that the light cucumber smell is so refreshing</li>
            <li>received this gel complimentary  to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li>Which makes the bottle go much faster, but I am already going to stock up, and give some as Christmas gifts because it is that good.</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary sample of the eye gel and the opinion and review are my own.</li>
            <li>feels good on skin but can&#x27;t see much difference in appearance</li>
            <li>Surprisingly the product did not cause any irritation and was very soothing.</li>
            <li>good product and fast delivery</li>
            <li>I give the product 2 stars for its high quality ingredients, the pleasant smell, and the price.</li>
            <li>This eye cream is very powerful and I love it.</li>
            <li>Very effective and a great price for such a high quality product!</li>
            <li>This absorbs quickly and makes me feel more confident since I know</li>
            <li>I love the cucumber smell and love the fact that this dries quite quickly.  </li>
            <li>Great for attacking those fine lines you start getting in your early 30s.</li>
            <li>It does smooth fine lines and is refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I am excited to see how much better my eyes look by the end of two months.</li>
            <li>So glad I&#x27;ve decided to give this product a try, and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>This is my first review ever, as I just love this product and HAD to share!</li>

            <li>This product has been supplied to me free of charge for review.</li>
            <li>and this product has been gentle, yet effective for my skin.</li>
            <li>I got this product free for a review.</li>
            <li>Works well, goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>It goes on her skin great and doesn&#x27;t drip off like some similar products.</li>
            <li>I received this from InstaNatural to try for free.  </li>
            <li>This gel is non-scented, smooth, cooling and works well under make-up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product received free for review purposes</li>
            <li>Any type of cheap cream or lotion makes me break out</li>
            <li>Also, I was really surprised because of all the good reviews I&#x27;ve read about this product.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This eye treatment is by far the most effective.</li>
            <li>love the fact that this is 100% natural, but the 75% organic kind of threw me.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural products are mostly plant based or natural, but they are also highly effective.</li>
            <li>I have loved the eye cream thus far.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>My circles have lightened significantly and the fine lines have improved as well.  </li>
            <li>Typically, I will never buy something with &#x27;The BEST&#x27; in the title or description because I know it&#x27;s being hyped and that is fully true of</li>
            <li>I love that right after applying this gel I can feel the tightening.</li>
            <li>Right away I saw improvement, but after a couple of weeks the result is even better.  </li>
            <li>After using the &amp;#34;InstaNatural Youth  Express Eye Gel&amp;#34;, I am convinced that most, if not all, of the highly positive reviews are as bogus as the claims the manufacturer makes for their product!</li>
            <li>I am also a makeup wearer and I apply the serum on first before I apply my make up and BOOM!!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use for sure another thumbs up is for the customer service that is great, not only they shipped very fast</li>
            <li>Very nice, cooling, non-irritating gel for both upper and lower eyelids.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s goes on great, feels really soothing, and makes the skin under my eyes look better - more even toned, less wrinkled, and more moisturized.</li>
            <li>Very, very pleased so far!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I received this eye gel free for review purposes.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice product that feels nice and cool upon application, so I don&#x27;t mind having to have it as part of my daily regimen.</li>
            <li>Fast absorbing and very lightly scented, kind of a light cucumber scent.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and easily applied evenly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good but really has no noticeable effect on my eyes.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really decrease the bags but nice cool feeling</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, quickly absorbs into skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No other products worked as good as this one.</li>
            <li>This company really cares for its customers buy providing them with effective yet more natural products for safe use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Love this eye cream, and it&#x27;s very reasonable</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping as well as amazing customer service.</li>
            <li>I admit, that when I used it alone, I only experienced mild burning and redness.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and I enjoy the fact that I&#x27;m looking younger.</li>
            <li>I really like InstaNatural products, and this eye gel is super effective.  </li>
            <li>well so far I do notice some change in a short time,InstaNatural make very good products I am definitely pleased with this one</li>
            <li>Hands down a very good product.  </li>
            <li>The best eye cream as far as plant stem ingredients go...noticed huge difference after second application...</li>
            <li>I think it will take more time to see real results!</li>
            <li>Very pleased, so far....</li>
            <li>This is ok, but I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable results even after using consistently for 3 months.  </li>
            <li>It does temporarily make my eyelid sticky in that it makes the eyelid higher and opens the eye more</li>
            <li>Very much worth the price!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this eye gel so far.</li>
            <li>I usually buy creams, so I was very happy to find how well this gel works.</li>
            <li>So excited that I found InstaNatural.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I notice the significant difference it is making when I have forgot to use it even one night--</li>
            <li>When applied, skin feels cool and smooth immediately.</li>
            <li>Such a great product with an impressive list of ingredients like Hyaluronic Acid and Peptide Complex.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth a try!</li>
            <li>- Couldn&#x27;t ask for more, fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>I do not think you will see any significant results from this however, I do use it because it has that &amp;#34;cooling effect&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used another brand, with similar ingredients, but this brand gives sooo much more product for the money with same great results!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product 2x a day for nearly 4 weeks and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to see to see the end result.</li>
            <li>I have tried many eye creams and this seems to be the first one that is making a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and I am very satisfied with the results so far.</li>
            <li>I noticed a change within the first couple of days of using this product and it has been getting better ever since.  </li>
            <li>In week long test period, I noticed that puffiness and redness around my eyes was greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>it is worth to spend money on their products!</li>
            <li>Love it firSt day using it</li>
            <li>I am pretty satisfied w/ the eye cream.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money!</li>
            <li>and I can tell that there is a significant change.</li>
            <li>Original review</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even explain it, I just know my entire eye area has undergone a transformation of some kind!</li>
            <li>InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel is pretty refreshing.</li>
            <li>So, I was excited to try out this eye gel and see how it worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally paid 20 bucks</li>
            <li>picture to post because this transformation of my eyes is nothing short of astounding!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it will change anything long term, but I&#x27;m happy to add it to the under eye concealer and brightener.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this about six months ago.</li>
            <li>This is the first thing that worked and I can&#x27;t tell you how pleased I am with the results!&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I have not seen a significant difference.</li>
            <li>I was excited to offer this product to my mother for her review.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and feels cool to the touch.  </li>
            <li>But I did see definite results at 3 weeks, which is remarkable.  </li>
            <li>After a month&#x27;s use, I have noticed it to be significantly reduced and some mornings, not even there.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if this was making a difference, but I believe it truly has.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>Feels cool and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>like the cool and smooth feeling of the gel though.</li>
            <li>so I was hesitant to use it anywhere else, but the ingredient list looked pretty safe</li>
            <li>This one has never bothered my skin and has significantly reduced the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Great product, and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>And it smells so fresh!</li>
            <li>So far, I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t affect my makeup foundation at all, in fact I feel like my foundation went on smoother and more evenly after having put this on first.  </li>
            <li>I will be interested in seeing how much more this will help over time.</li>
            <li>The fine lines are slowly disappearing which is awesome!  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be worth my money since it&#x27;s gotten such great reviews</li>
            <li>It goes on super smooth.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, smells good(!)</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Thanks for Insta Natural great eye gel.</li>
            <li>WOW, ok I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It seems to make  a huge difference rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love how refreshing the Insta Natural Youth Express Eye Gel is.</li>
            <li>Smells nice but perhaps better just as a night moisturizer only.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to go the (mostly) all natural, healthy route for skin care.</li>
            <li>This cooling silky eye gel goes on smooth, and absorbs quickly, leaving my eye area feeling supple and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Verdict: I don&#x27;t think is a miracle product, because I don&#x27;t believe such a thing exists, but I am absolutely impressed with this product so far and cannot wait to see how my skin looks with continued use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;These results fade somewhat and for a night out, clean up and re-application is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I honestly have no idea if it actually did anything for my skin, but it felt so refreshing on my eyes in the morning.</li>
            <li>So, I will continue to use their products and I am confident that I will be very pleased with the long term results.  </li>
            <li>but if your like me in the early stages I say this is a great product to keep you looking fresh and vibrant!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes a while to dry, so you&#x27;ll need to be patient, but it does feel good on my skin, very cool and soothing.</li>
            <li>this product is far superior (the serum is great for dark circles however)  </li>
            <li>Glad that it is pretty much fragrance free too!</li>
            <li>I have tried many eye gels for puffiness and dark circles and this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li>The price is great since its right in the middle of drugstore and department brands.  </li>
            <li>I also like the packaging; the pump is easy to use and keeps the product safe, and I particularly like the larger size that provides good value.</li>
            <li>I will say that it feels very silky and very light on your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s feels cool and clean on my skin.  </li>
            <li>just clean, cool and tightens the skin.  </li>
            <li>and I will most certainly continue to purchase their products.  </li>
            <li>However, these two are specially designed for under eye.  </li>
            <li>You get a generous amount of product in the large pump and it&#x27;s more sanitary than a mini-pot.  </li>
            <li>So I love that this has a pump (which even is flexible) and there is a large amount of product.</li>
            <li>but, I noticed a difference right away!  </li>
            <li>And, the price is right!</li>
            <li>I was right!</li>
            <li>I could also feel my skin tighten a bit right after application!  </li>
            <li>Great for tightening skin around the eyes, fine lines and dark circles.</li>
            <li>I can hardly wait to use it for 8 weeks like it suggests for best results.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural helped along with the coffee to make me feel more awake and ready to go right away with my kids too!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a difference right away and in the meantime I had purchased an under the eye cream for fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I do have one smallish fine line under my right eye I&#x27;ve been watching</li>
            <li>It is a gel formula that is very light on the skin and absorbs super fast into the skin.</li>
            <li>The bottle I am using right now is the older look which I liked a lot.  </li>
            <li>but so far, my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li>Especially to keep the circles from beneath the eyes, or the skin are around bright.</li>
            <li>Applies smoothly with a cool feeling and a fresh scent and tightens up the eye area.  </li>
            <li>Not only was the price great, the personal customer service is amazing.</li>
            <li>Great product at such a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>The darkness is lessened, and my whole appearance is fresher and more youthful.</li>
            <li>It dries really fast. :)</li>
            <li>I paid full price and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li>It is cooling, refreshing and works really well.</li>
            <li>absolutely cannot apply powdered makeup on top.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer has a light texture and is quickly absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li>but I like how cool it feels on my eyes 👀</li>
            <li>Nice clear face cream.</li>
            <li>plan to order more real soon.</li>
            <li>I most highly recommend that you give them a try!</li>
            <li>I am beyond THRILLED thus far with this product.</li>
            <li>Smells and feels like cool cucumbers.i would buy again.</li>
            <li>It feels comfortable around my eyes even when freshly applied.  </li>
            <li>Loved that even if if he was grossly exaggerating!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much crepiness under my eyes, yet the skin looks more taut after using for a month.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t gone but the improvement is good enough that I no longer feel upset with the way under my eyes look to me.</li>
            <li>However, when I contacted customer service, they immediately (no questions asked) issued a full refund.  </li>
            <li>so I started using it more often since it really works.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t say enough about this eye gel, it&#x27;s extremely good.</li>
            <li>Its true</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ll continue with it everywhere else as I really like how it makes my face feel, but will use something that is much more emollient under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.  </li>
            <li>the cool gel feel..</li>
            <li>The company does state on their website that most customers notice a real improvement after 2 months or so.</li>
            <li>It is soothing and cool feeling.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t seem to have had any good effects, either--that is, to actually reduce puffiness, wrinkles, or whatever.</li>
            <li>For the Price you are not going to be able to find one that&#x27;s got as much going for it as this one has.</li>
            <li>it is 75% organic, its not harsh but its still effective .</li>
            <li>You can read my FULL review by clicking this link  [...]</li>
            <li>Very cooling and moisturizing and the eyes look much better after applying it</li>
            <li>I will keep using this product because I think it needs more than 2 weeks to really judge it</li>
            <li>For those who wants more moisture go with eye cream not eye gel.</li>
            <li>This is a good product especially for the price.</li>
            <li>a product like this is most appreciated.  </li>
            <li>I did get this at a full promotional discount for unbias review in return.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I have only good things to say about this eye gel -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As many people have mentioned, this eye gel is VERY sticky.</li>
            <li>I was given this to try out for review and so far, It&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>I will most absolutely buy this product again.</li>
            <li>It feels cool on your skin and leaves your skin dewy.  </li>
            <li>and overall I like it and think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>and I did not find that to be true.</li>
            <li>Check out my full review here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;LYDpRId5puw</li>
            <li>I love that you use it on your eyes, cheeks and forehead (per the instructions), but you can also use it on your whole face if you choose.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I love it; I read most of the reviews and it does what everyone says, which is more than I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool feel &amp; sticky but effect my skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to put much at all on my skin during this time.</li>
            <li>I tried it because a friend of mine gave up on trying it and passed it to me, so the bottle was not even full.....</li>
            <li>and I was ready to try anything, and already they look better.  </li>
            <li>I have a drawer full of retired eye cream and eye gel products that I need to just throw.</li>
            <li>The pump is very touchy and always dispenses more than I would like.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 60 and am religious about taking good care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>am 27 years old with reasonably nice skin.</li>
            <li>I am so delighted especially since this is the 50th class reunion of my HS class.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The folks at InstaNatural say this is good for the entire face and the package size will allow for that without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li>Feels cool and soothing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay product but doesn&#x27;t really do anything for my eyes.</li>
            <li>I struggled through many days without having gotten much sleep.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the seller who deserves more than five stars in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I off tan get to much liquid for my face, which still isn&#x27;t that much more</li>
            <li>It is an effective moisturizer, and seems to decrease the puffiness of the old eye bags.</li>
            <li>I really have enjoyed the process of getting to know about InstaNatural</li>
            <li>It is just refreshing to find something that really does what it says it can do.  </li>
            <li>, it even felt cool when I put it on.  </li>
            <li>It works to refresh, tighten, and cool puffy eyes.</li>
            <li>The gel helped his eyes look more radiant and ready for the day.  </li>
            <li>it is better and I am real grateful for that .</li>
            <li>This eye gel does not allow my eye makeup (mascara or eye liner) to smear - a real problem with most brands.  </li>
            <li>I did not give rate this a full 5 star because of time frame.</li>
            <li>I love the gel just for its moisturizing quality since the areas around my eyes need intense  hydration as they age faster.</li>
            <li>This is a good eye gel in a big bottle.</li>
            <li>Product is really good, works well to eliminate puffy, dark circles and gives a more rested look.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s not bad.. but</li>
            <li>I am new at trying the Insta-Natural product line, but so far I&#x27;m very impressed by the natural ingredients and that they are chemical free.</li>
            <li>Very nice product, especially, my husband loves it very much.  </li>
            <li>very nice feel, absorbs quickly and has made a noticeable difference in my fine lines and dark circles.</li>
            <li>packaging is always super cute and they always keep things very sanitary by providing either droppers with their products or in this case, a pump.</li>
            <li>honestly thickness isn&#x27;t big deal with me if it works as well but unfortunately strongly I&#x27;m thinking about to return it because;&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>And the cream -- more of a gel really -- does temporarily tighten the skin around my mouth where I&#x27;m getting some significant smile lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This gel is light and absorbs right away.</li>
            <li>I was no less than thrilled with the results of this product</li>
            <li>Since it pretty much works on demand for my puffiness &amp; bags using it once a day in the AM is working out fine for me :)</li>
            <li>I started looking into their other products, which also have great reviews.</li>
            <li>I love my new Eye Cream!</li>
            <li>I like the clean fresh smell of this gel.</li>
            <li>It smells just like clean, fresh cucumbers.</li>
            <li>Works quickly in about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s translucent eye gel that absorbs quickly into your skin and wouldn&#x27;t irritate it.  </li>
            <li>it has no greasy feeling and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>The flesh looked more youthful and vibrant.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and I can feel the tightening under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Thanks you InstaNatural for making such a great product and</li>
            <li>and as I am getting older it&#x27;s not getting any better..</li>
            <li>I will be back in a week or two to report any more improvement if there is any, even if there isn&#x27;t I&#x27;m still extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>and I find that it helps tremendously.  </li>
            <li>InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel absorbs quickly into the skin, and there is no fragrance.</li>
            <li>It has a light cucumber fresh scent and is easily absorbed into and</li>
            <li>Still giving the product time to work, however, results are definitely noticeable--this is a lot more than can be said of most products claiming to do what InstaNatural does.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly without any stickiness or greasy</li>
            <li>Also making skin appear healthier and more vibrant.</li>
            <li>It actually makes them more prominent...</li>
            <li>I have to say, they have super customer service, and offered to send me an additional bottle at no charge.</li>
            <li>OZ Naturals eye gel at .5 oz has no water in the ingredients which would indicated a more potent product considering the exchange in very similar ingredients.  </li>
            <li>and you can feel mild tightening after applying.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s start telling you why I love this company, all their products have natural ingredients also their products are cruelty free.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many eye gels and after many years have finally found what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  </li>
            <li>Also, this gel did make my fine lines MORE not LESS visible.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to get a couple more for my mom and aunt to try, and will definitely be buying more for myself.</li>
            <li>and it goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am a African American and I am impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it</li>
            <li>, it applies well and dries quickly without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>Works great not only on your eyes but the whole faces.</li>
            <li>really great, I feel the skin tightening up, in a good way, not dry, firm.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The product came quickly, but did not work for me.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I didn&#x27;t really notice the results until I got ready for work a week after using it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t provide adequate moisture for me</li>
            <li>Once applied, it dries quickly so that I can apply make-up or head out the door and start my day.</li>
            <li>to mild rather quickly.</li>
            <li>and it absorbs quickly into your skin.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t get a quick fix.</li>
            <li>Then I use a similar product with the hyaluronic acid and vitamin C on the rest of my face, then my favorite moisturizer over the top before I apply my makeup.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m really pleased and couldn&#x27;t ask for better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been making sure he is using this morning &amp; night, you can tell that he looks so much more refreshed and younger even!</li>
            <li>Luckily for this.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>It does not irritate my eyes and it is non greasy, dries quickly, and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>No greasy feeling after applying  it to your face and eye area, it does absorb quickly.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of this cream very much (cucumber) and it goes on easily and is well absorbed.</li>
            <li>This is not a product I would highly recommend, although I do think if you have severe eye issues it would probably be more beneficial than for those who do not.</li>
            <li>like very much I&#x27;m using twice a day fantastic</li>
            <li>I excepted more from a product with high reviews and ratings.</li>
            <li>but I can honestly say that I see more fine lines around my eyes than before I started using this gel, and I&#x27;m only in my early 30&#x27;s!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE INSTA- NATURAL!!  </li>
            <li>It seems to smooth out the skin pretty quickly if you use it every morning and night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable after painted,and my black eyes are improved also,I love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is very first application</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s great on dark circles or not as at this time I do not have them.</li>
            <li>the very first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>and I find that it is becoming very visible on my face, specifically under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I had recently developed a bruised under eye look - more familiar terminology</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that I have products like InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel that can help reduce the look of my dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li>The dark circles under my eyes have greatly diminished.</li>
            <li>Great eye gel for dark circles and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Works great for reducing dark circles around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>It feels great on my face and my skin has never been so soft and smooth (though, like I mentioned, I&#x27;ve been using a lot of the InstaNaturals products daily, so it may be any one of them, or the combination).</li>
            <li>The bottle says it can be used on your face too, so I tried it and it was actually more effective than some of the other lotions I&#x27;ve used specifically for the face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this gel and will continue using it in the future.</li>
            <li>I started to see the lines fill in and smooth out within the first 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>With Matryxl 3000, hyaluronic acid, peptides, herbal extracts, and amino acids, this has a number of very effective active ingredients.</li>
            <li>I recieved this product for free for giving my honest opinion and will be ordering more in the near future</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this to review and love it!</li>
            <li>I use it with the other InstaNatural face products which are great, especially the Rose Hip Oil I can recommend.</li>
            <li>My new favorite find 💙</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and spreads easily, but not moisturizing enough for my skin.</li>
            <li>I originally got it for my boyfriend (who likes it very much), but I may end up buying myself a bottle</li>
            <li>Makes my eyes feel great and less puffy.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that this is by far the BEST eye cream that I have ever purchased and applied with visible results in terms of puffiness and dark circles as I always go to bed after 1am and get up at 7am.</li>
            <li>There is a slight scent of cucumber, which I like, and I am happy that it doubles as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This eye cream is very hydrating and it does not have any strong smell to it.</li>
            <li>They have been reduced so much that I go without concealer on most days for the first time in years.</li>
            <li>I have only used this product for a week and feel pretty good after applying.  </li>
            <li>This eye gel spreads easily and dries off fast.</li>
            <li>I love that it is full of natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>As an older woman, as a makeup artist, as a blogger, I have tried countless eye creams and this is by far the BEST one I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This gel absorbs quickly so your not feeling greasy and makes your skin feel fresh.</li>
            <li>It also has been good for my daughters dry eye lids.  </li>
            <li>Have&#x27;nt had it long enough for results, but I think it will be the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s easy to use and control how much I put on under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, plus it has a fresh cucumber scent.</li>
            <li>easy to work with very plesant.  </li>
            <li>However, the skin around her eyes is very sensitive and many products cause them to water and sting.</li>
            <li>Tried this based simply on the huge amount of positive reviews, and am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>Thanks to take your customers !!  </li>
            <li>Will definitely tell more women or men to buy this as it is proven to work!</li>
            <li>First use I noticed a difference!</li>
            <li>Very hydrating Eye Gel!!</li>
            <li>When I started using the product within the first couple weeks I noticed smoother, lighter skin, will keep using, I recommend!</li>
            <li>I noticed an improvement in the first week!</li>
            <li>Really have seen a difference!!</li>
            <li>and I use it in the morning under moisturizer - i really like it!!</li>
            <li>High praise!!!</li>
            <li>and I actually think that it&#x27;s helping :) !</li>
            <li>First I have to say this seller goes above and beyond to make sure you are satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I have bought many, many, MANY eye creams in the past with zero results.  </li>
            <li>It really, truly works!!</li>
            <li>Love it so far!</li>
            <li>It comes out of the bottle in a pump, its a clear gel that goes on very light.</li>
            <li>all that breathing HAHA has caused fine lines around the mouth...</li>
            <li>so I never had that fresh look , but after trying this, I&#x27;m coming back for more !</li>
            <li>also the fine lines are so much finer.</li>
            <li>Works very well to reduce puffiness and minimize fine lines.  </li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in fine lines or elasticity yet..  </li>
            <li>The company is super supportive as they emailed me to give me tips, see how it was working out and to send me a complimentary bottle for free (same size and all).</li>
            <li>this cream has proven to greatly improve the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes caused from under/over sleep and diet though!  </li>
            <li>They eye area is especially important and every little bit helps.</li>
            <li>After trying many other creams to reduce dark circles around my eyes, I am happy to have found the one!</li>
            <li>wrinkle,  I have dry skin , so  I will top it with another  oil  free eye cream at night in the winter only.&lt;br /&gt;Overall 5 stars , BIG bottle for only $20.00 , a happy customer !!!</li>
            <li>I also like very much that you get a full 1.7oz in this bottle.  </li>
            <li>Also, the gel is so incredibly sticky it was hard to sleep with it on without my face being stuck to my pillow.</li>
            <li>Wish it was a little more effective but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye cream, because it cheap.</li>
            <li>Bottle is huge of 1.7oz...takes up way too much space in my already cluttered bathroom...</li>
            <li>It took this Eye Gel a few weeks to show results but the results are great.</li>
            <li>great eye cream my wife uses everyday.</li>
            <li>Keep calm, it takes time.</li>
            <li>I use it for my dark circles under eyes and the results are amazing !</li>
            <li>Now on my second order and will stay faithful to this amazing eye gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and it feels really great on my skin.</li>
            <li>But really, what&#x27;s the point of being cheap when the product doesn&#x27;t work?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times and already in seeing great results.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast into skin, is light and moisturizes my under eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and absorb fast.</li>
            <li>,really helps smooth out lines...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, and am happy with the product and results I&#x27;m getting.  </li>
            <li>This goes on smoothly, without much of a scent, and is not sticky in the slightest.</li>
            <li>it makes me feel calm and relaxed before bed.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I am more than satisfied, and I will be back when I run out!&lt;br /&gt;Cheers to AJ, the rep that followed up with me, for the great service provided to me!</li>
            <li>So far really pleased -</li>
            <li>Using the eye cream was pretty cool.</li>
            <li>The opinion above is 100% my own.</li>
            <li>I like knowing that I am putting safe natural products on my face</li>
            <li>but I feel my eyes fresh in the morning</li>
            <li>Second order and loving it.</li>
            <li>The price is totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 46 years old and am not too embarrassed to say that I have tried product after product to try and maintain healthy, youthful looking skin.</li>
            <li>There is a degree of tightening, but it is not the unnatural look you get with some products that &amp;#34;cracks&amp;#34; the minute you smile or talk.</li>
            <li>AND SO FAR I LOVE THE WAY</li>
            <li>Thank you for such an effective product</li>
            <li>The product feels really nice when you put it on, especially if your eyes are tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>From their skin care, to hair care and body InstaNatural is by far my favorite company.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;InstaNatural Eye Gel has put a smile on my face not to mention my self-esteem since using there product.  </li>
            <li>My &amp;#34;problem area&amp;#34; is my smile lines and laugh lines</li>
            <li>And for the price, well worth it.</li>
            <li>My eyes are sensitive to most moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Powerful product I have teenagers and always loosing sleep because I worry about them</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about the product.</li>
            <li>The fresh cucumber scent is an added benefit.</li>
            <li>but it gave me a fresh look every time I use it.</li>
            <li>Well worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>I love this eye gel so far.  </li>

            <li>My skin feels fresh and moist immediately.</li>
            <li>I Like the cooling effect it leaves and the fresh look my face got.</li>
            <li>Makes you look refreshed and rested, even if your not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>But my eyes were sticking together and it felt wet for good amount of time after it is put on.  </li>
            <li>I am 70 years young and tried more creams than I can count.</li>
            <li>To me, this was a rather fun product.</li>

            <li>I love this product so far.</li>
            <li>I really liked this eye gel and used it on my entire face and neck because it was hydrating and firming.</li>

            <li>/&gt;So, there are so many things I like about this product, I am 30 years old</li>
            <li>ingredients don&#x27;t irritate my eyes and the gel is quickly absorbed without the feeling greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works well together and everything is easily absorbed by my skin.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t expect miracles when it comes to eye cream, and this product proves it.</li>
            <li>I am amazed at how fresh and plump my face</li>
            <li>So it maybe worth it to try the product</li>
            <li>this product.&lt;br /&gt;The container is high quality, the label, instructions and ingredients are easy to read.</li>
            <li>Even after washing my face my eyes look great and there are no fine lines.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and does not leave a sticky residue behind, and the light fresh scent and cool effect is really a nice way to wake up your skin in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I ordered two other products from them and plan to get more.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I have very sensitive skin in general.</li>
            <li>I have spent tons of money on eye creams this one by far works really good!</li>
            <li>No strong smell, great packaging.  </li>
            <li>This is a bigger container than most eye creams so I can make sure a put a decent amount on to keep my eye areas hydrated</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great just not working as fast as I would like there is  difference in the swelling due to my allergies.  </li>
            <li>The first thing i noticed about the Youth Express was the smell, it&#x27;s like a mild cucumber.</li>
            <li>They respond quickly to questions and appear truly interested in what their customers think.  </li>
            <li>results are pretty quick.</li>
            <li>I love make-up , electronics , toys for the kids just about really anything I am willing to try, incase a family member wants to know if its worth the price and does it work.</li>
            <li>Its cooling, and it feels nice when applied, but I didn&#x27;t notice any changes to dark circles or fine lines.</li>
            <li>My mom remarked how good my skin was looking, and it&#x27;s totally due to using this twice a day.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I have used continuously because I saw results on puffiness, circles and texture around my eyes within the very first applications.</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>The bottle is very travel friendly so you can take it with you when you are traveling.  </li>
            <li>I bought what I thought was this same product a couple of months ago and liked it very much.</li>
            <li>Works right away but is temporary.</li>
            <li>but right now, I cant</li>
            <li>I saw improvement right away but not as described.</li>
            <li>It made a difference right away on the puffiness of my undereye area.</li>
            <li>It comes in a pump bottle that dispenses the right amount of product.</li>
            <li>and if you are dissatisfied in any way, they make it right.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t happen right away</li>
            <li>but I can tell a notorious difference right now</li>
            <li>To apply, I use this in the morning right after I shower.</li>
            <li>but hey, who would like to wake up to puffy eyes right?</li>
            <li>I would say that you shouldn&#x27;t expect drastic results right away</li>
            <li>and I saw improvement right away.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>and it has always shown right underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li>The price is right and the portion size is generous.</li>
            <li>I apply the eye cream at night right before bed.</li>
            <li>I can feel it tightening right after putting it on.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Did I expect to see results right away?</li>
            <li>Youth Express Eye Gel has lots of ingredients that are on the skin care &amp;#34;hit-list&amp;#34; right now.</li>
            <li>Works well, noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>price is right.</li>
            <li>I must not be using it right????  </li>
            <li>fragrance is light and very pleasant, much like the other InstaNatural products I have been privileged enough to try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already receiving some positive comments !</li>
            <li>This product matches well versus many other well known, highly advertised and candidly, pricy alternatives.</li>
            <li>Clear gel feels cool and smooth on my eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased to have finally found a product that works for me and ultimately, at a very affordable price point.  </li>
            <li>since I did not see any difference using it the first week, then low and behold by end of week two, amazing....</li>
            <li>Excellent product, I see a big difference in my eyes, they are not as dark as they used to be and</li>
            <li>It feels so lovely and cool on, and never stings at all; I use it on upper and lower kids.  </li>
            <li>I think my eyes look far better than when I first used this product.</li>
            <li>ran out of this product about a week ago, the red mark is coming back, so this is not a permanent fix, which is more than fine, will have to order more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products for my dark circles and this has made the most impact.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to believe that it would improve my fine lines, especially after reading such great reviews</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product because it&#x27;s more natural than the other options and very effective.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and break out easily but not with this gel.</li>
            <li>We have under eye problems for so many reasons, but I think this product would generally help anyone if used as directed!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this eye gel; it is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>If you just want to keep your skin moisturized and smooth - this product is okay, but if you want something more, go get a more expensive cream.</li>
            <li>acid serum is my favorite serum for my face since it works well in softening my skin, erasing fine lines, and providing an excellent base for my make-up.  </li>
            <li>It smells very natural spa-like scent that is not overwhelming and very pleasant.</li>
            <li>Needless to say I am super impressed!  </li>
            <li>It does apply nice however that is the only positive.</li>
            <li>I find it much more effective, finer and preferable to more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>My dark circles seem lighter, and as an added bonus, I think it acts as a really good primer for undereye concealer.</li>
            <li>I am a (retired) biochemist and I am familiar with pretty much everything in this.</li>
            <li>I loved it, i tried it faithfully twice a day and my dark circles and puffy eyes were visibly reduced.</li>
            <li>Better still, their customer service reached out to me a little while after purchasing to ensure I was completely satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li>It does have a little burning sensation once I put it on as well as a nice cooling effect which I enjoy.  </li>
            <li>Although I have not found this to be amazingly effective on my dark circles after a month, I do find that I love using this as a light facial cream.</li>
            <li>I could see a difference in the bags under my eyes right away after I first used this product.</li>
            <li>In addition to using it as an eye gel, I also actually use this as an all over daytime facial moisturizer, and it works great for my oily/combo skin.</li>
            <li>and  this being a quick drying gel, doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin much</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and works fast.</li>
            <li>In comes in an easy to dispense pump action bottle.</li>
            <li>and then when I move my eyes around once it&#x27;s dry, that it kind of cracks</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and leaves the area feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Going to try a different product   update:  great customer service after my initial review.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty good treatment for people with dark circles and puffiness under their eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although it can be used on the entire face, I&#x27;m using for my eyes, and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Will update, if this version is equally good, better or worse after I have been using a while.</li>
            <li>Amazing, this stuff actually works thanks</li>
            <li>the black circles under my eyes-so I&#x27;m delighted with it.</li>
            <li>Came quick but didn&#x27;t see much difference at all.</li>
            <li>I must say that I  am pleased with the results so far I am not as swollen and puffy around the eyes as much and the results have been gradual.</li>
            <li>I have purchased multiple different products from InstaNatural and have experienced nothing but quality</li>
            <li>I feel like this product has brightened up my eye area although I have to say I don&#x27;t have bags at all, and the darkness under my eyes was probably normal or better than normal.</li>
            <li>I have been applying the product twice a day, and definitely love it, my dark circles (always my big problem )are getting better and better, I just have enough gel for a few more days, so I have to get more :)</li>
            <li>First of all, this gel comes in a very large package for an eye gel.  </li>
            <li>I really notice improvements  the very first morning after using this gel.</li>
            <li>MY FACE IS LOOKING SMOOTH AND CLEAR!</li>
            <li>I really notice improvements  the very first morning after using this gel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is so much about this company that speaks to the kind of dedication to their craft that should be evident in ANY company that produces beauty products such as this one.</li>
            <li>, it was so smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li>I have found other products that address the puffiness under my eyes more quickly and effectively and only need to be used as needed.</li>
            <li>It is clear, cool and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>very good until now dark circles becoming less but still not gone</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable for the bottle size.  </li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that if I have it on, and then try to put liquid makeup (or a moisturizer) over it - I have to be very gentle where this product is.</li>
            <li>push the pump very gently to dispense the product.  </li>
            <li>It does come out of the pump as a gel, it doesn&#x27;t take very much at all to cover the eye, cheek and forehead area.  </li>
            <li>very much - been using for almost 2 months now.</li>
            <li>My eyes seem to be sensitive to other products but this doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation and not to mention my eyes look great.  </li>
            <li>and I am so glad that the shipping is really quick, because I ran out and the shipping being so fast that I only went 3 days without it!!!</li>
            <li>This works really well, but you have to consistent!</li>
            <li>I chose it mostly for the anti-aging and fine line reduction properties, I don&#x27;t have issues with bags under my eyes or dark circles.</li>
            <li>My 2 older girls are sorta a hassle when its bed time , but mostly my 8 month old she used to sleep through the night</li>
            <li>This skin cream not only works well in reducing fine likes around the eye, it also is effective in improving skin complexion in the entire face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is very faint and pleasant, the gel is on the thicker side, but it applies nicely and dries up quick.</li>
            <li>THIS IS VERY EASY TO APPLY AND IT DOESNT LEAVE A MESS TO CLEAN UP.</li>
            <li>I did not see the improvement the first week, but after a couple weeks I could tell.</li>
            <li>But if you are willing to put up with it</li>
            <li>I have tried several, but this one stands out as having more noticeable improvement than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>so they are mostly from smiling and not deep).</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone in need of some extra love and care for their eyes.</li>
            <li>Gentle, effective and fast acting!</li>
            <li>Haha got you even before you started appearing!</li>
            <li>Be consistent.</li>
            <li>This product works very well!</li>
            <li>For those rare days I forget to apply it, I can really feel the difference.  </li>
            <li>I will qualify this by saying that I&#x27;ve never tried just a regular moisturizer, so I don&#x27;t know if this is better than moisturizer or not.</li>
            <li>I received the Insta Natural Eye Gel free and for review.  </li>
            <li>Thanks instanatural!</li>
            <li>He reminded me that he&#x27;s been using this gel, and I really can&#x27;t believe the results!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I do have to re-touch up at the end of the day, but that is better than having to do it mid morning.</li>
            <li>Circles gone first, bagginess diminished first week.</li>
            <li>It took me pressing about 10 times to get the gel to come up the first time</li>
            <li>This might happen for you to when you first use it.</li>
            <li>So this is my first review of a product.</li>
            <li>That being said i didnt like this product at first</li>
            <li>Will continue use for sure to see further results.</li>
            <li>Recently my efforts have been more concentrated in the eye area.</li>
            <li>Further, the overall effect on my entire face is wonderful...</li>
            <li>Fast results!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had such great customer service in a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, I am 2weeks on my second purchase of this product.</li>
            <li>IT DOES EXACTLY</li>
            <li>Applied to my eyes, got instant dryness and felt that my skin would get more wrinkles this way.</li>
            <li>I am really liking this eye gel!</li>
            <li>but for now it does give me a smooth and soft skin.</li>
            <li>that will only reflect even more on their products.  </li>
            <li>and I look more awake overall.</li>
            <li>I bought this randomly too but am happy to have found it!</li>
            <li>He is using morning and night and there continues to be improvement, his under eye area is so much lighter and smoother!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this product!</li>
            <li>my first time that i used i can see different,CUSTOMER SERVICE IS EXCELENT I WANT CONGRATULATION FOR THIS ITEM AND TO SELLER</li>
            <li>I was hoping this product would work for my under eye puffiness, but it did nothing for me, even after consistent use for a month.  </li>
            <li>The first time using this product I agreed with a reviewer that it was sticky and not something I would want to use during the day.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it</li>
            <li>It has a cooling, tightening sensation when first applied.  </li>
            <li>I used this product consistently for months with no hint of change in my under eye area.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, non-drying, has no fragrance, no chemicals and absorbs completely.  </li>
            <li>Did not really see a lot of difference, it was an nice moisturizer though.</li>
            <li>I have seen results since the first week.</li>
            <li>and I can tell my upper eye lids are looking better already.</li>
            <li>My eyelids feel soft and smooth now.  </li>
            <li>The first week I just noticed a decrease in &amp;#34;saggyness&amp;#34; in my eyes</li>
            <li>This product is $20, I get way more, and IT ACTUALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li>This is made in the U.S. in an FDA-registered and regulated facility, which means top quality is always first and foremost, but also means that hoarding of their products wouldn&#x27;t be necessary.</li>
            <li>This product is almost exactly as another one I purchased.</li>
            <li>Was hoping for a bit more of a miracle but have been using for just under a month (religiously twice/day), so time will tell as to whether or not results continue to improve.  </li>
            <li>be aware of the side effects that it doesnt list because of the plant stem cells.</li>
            <li>Even as a woman in my mid 50&#x27;s, I love this eye gel.  </li>
            <li>this is my first time, I must say I love this product and is only been 2 weeks .</li>
            <li>I am 29 and This is the first Eye cream I purchased.</li>
            <li>I preferred to use it at night, more then day, but that is my personal preference.</li>
            <li>Please stay aware.</li>
            <li>I lost the first bottle</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t even funny.</li>
            <li>I use it every morning and my first bottle has lasted 7 months.</li>
            <li>Their eye gel has definitely made my eyes look more youthful and brighter.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference in my laugh lines</li>
            <li>I personally have many issues with scent and this one doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>And, I am still on my first jar.</li>
            <li>And, I am still on my first jar.</li>
            <li>Ive been getting alot of compliments from family telling me how pretty I got</li>
            <li>This product at 1.7 oz first ingredient is &amp;#34;D&amp;#34; (abbrev.)  </li>
            <li>and I could see results within the first 4 to 7 days.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product for my fiancé based on the reviews, but unfortunately it&#x27;s not what presented here at all!&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>Such a simple and effective product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already reordered it before using up the first bottle I got about a month ago.</li>
            <li>I love this cream before I used different brand</li>
            <li>This eye cream works very well!</li>
            <li>but this gel is only ok.</li>
            <li>There is just something about the gel that really is refreshing and helps give me that extra something that</li>
            <li>applied this first thing in the morning, under all my makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested to see what this would do if I my eyes were puffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have been using this product consistently now for about 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like not being able to see how much is left.</li>
            <li>I would definitely reorder when I need more.</li>
            <li>This is not the first product by this company that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m pretty please with this</li>
            <li>One of the first things that I noticed is that although this gel says it is an eye gel, the directions say you can use it on your face.</li>
            <li>I love using this as a daily moisturizing treatment before my makeup.</li>
            <li>I can actually feel this eye cream cooling and tightening after application, which I love.  </li>
            <li>Yes it does, it goes on a tad sticky at first but</li>
            <li>Not to mention that it is too hot for the area around the eye</li>
            <li>but there also was no irritation or redness when I first began using the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Saw improvement after my first bottle and ordered another.</li>
            <li>I have used this eye cream consistently for two weeks without results.  </li>
            <li>I have just started to get eye gels and creams to test out different ones and see which ones I like the most.</li>
            <li>This is the first eye cream/gel that I bought that works.  </li>
            <li>if you filter by: &amp;#34;VERIFIED PURCHASES ONLY&amp;#34; there is absolutely NONE!</li>
            <li>I really like this eye gel!</li>
            <li>Gel is pretty sticky.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe it first, so I continued another week.  </li>
            <li>Started noticing a difference in the first week.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the real praduct!</li>
            <li>This is the first eye product I have used that has produced noticeable results.</li>
            <li>I made my husband sit still and applied it under his eyes first to see what happened.</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>my first eye cream.</li>
            <li>cause I just got it, but the pump broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get enough to be able to tell.</li>
            <li>So glad I&#x27;ve found the InstaNatural facial products!</li>
            <li>Some eye creams work upon first use at reducing puffiness this one does not.  </li>
            <li>On those occasions I use it on my entire face and the results are astonishing.  </li>
            <li>Bought this product and used the first one up in no time.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is I wish it was more moisturizing</li>
            <li>The shipping was pretty fast too and the packaging quality was also 5 star!</li>
            <li>Just got it and used for the first time today.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more once I run out.</li>
            <li>This is the first application.</li>
            <li>I have a problems with bags under my eyes and have tried so many different products I can&#x27;t even count them all.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed when I applied this gel is that it has a cooling feeling.</li>
            <li>I noticed firmer skin under my eyes and my eyes looked more refreshed overall.</li>
            <li>I love the results I&#x27;m getting, especially with the puffiness.  </li>
            <li>This is a miraculous formula , will definitely keep buying more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a miracle, not &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; but for the first time in my life I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I love how cooling the gel is too, definitely helps to keep me awake in the morning.</li>
            <li>I really like this!</li>
            <li>Ok, maybe it&#x27;s not a confession because maybe it&#x27;s obvious.</li>
            <li>but it is safe to be used on your entire face.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product because it has great ingredients for the delicate area around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Stellar product.</li>
            <li>While the puffiness under my eyes seems about the same, the skin itself seems more moist and hydrated.</li>
            <li>After using it for a month I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>The first week I was convinced because I felt it working</li>
            <li>After 3 days of use, the darkness around my eyes diminished so much that I forgot to apply my concealer!</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the first day I put this on and</li>
            <li>Try this to see if your eyes look more refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be adding a littke extra moisturizer under my eyes for awhile to help seal in all of that goodness.</li>
            <li>So much I purchased one for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day!</li>
            <li>I also enjoy that it is made of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love to put this on at night and sit back and relax and literally feel a change in the hydration under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>Mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>got it first day and can feel it tightening the puffy areas around my eyes.</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work at all and actually makes eye bags and darkness more defined.</li>
            <li>And this is my first time leaving comment</li>
            <li>cliniqe all about eyes and more recently</li>
            <li>a week is more than enough.  </li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thankful that I tried this now while the problems are mostly perceptible to me, and hopefully with continued use they will not become a bigger issue as I age.</li>
            <li>As soon as I used this product for the first time I noticed an improved difference in how my eyes looked.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to apply as much concealer under my eyes!</li>
            <li>I’ve tried many eye products that promise to reduce puffy eyes and have tried several home remedies.</li>
            <li>Absolutely sold on this product!  </li>
            <li>I like this product better than higher priced products I&#x27;ve used with similar ingredients.  </li>
            <li>That is the first thing I look for in all products that I put on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for that elixir that would bring back some elasticity from inside my skin not just superficially as most creams do.  </li>
            <li>If the company gives me my money back $ 19 plus the shipping I would love to do it ASAP.</li>
            <li>This one really works!</li>
            <li>It felt tacky on my skin and it&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve used that broke me out around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase again:)</li>
            <li>The gel feels really refreshing, especially in the a.m.</li>
            <li>After the first application I realized this.  </li>
            <li>Even though I have very big under eyes bags, I can see how this eye gel is helping my eyes look better.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>I personally get from this Company, they actually send personal emails with instructions on how to get the best results from their products and follow up with your progress.  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly as it&#x27;s described.</li>
            <li>It has hyaluronic acid which is a great moisturizer (that Iâ€™m already using) and it uses all natural and organic ingredients to protect your skin from sun damage, dark circles, puffiness and more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>You only require a small drop of gel twice a day for best results.  </li>
            <li>reduction actually started within the first use, however now it&#x27;s much much better than I could have ever hoped.  </li>
            <li>I will purchase this when first bottle when I&#x27;m finished.</li>
            <li>(First of all I&#x27;ve been using  this product almost 5 days</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Be sure to allow product to set for a while prior to applying shadow.</li>
            <li>but unfortunately I&#x27;m not one of them, maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>This eye gel is very soothing!  </li>
            <li>I actually saw results in 2 days but wasn&#x27;t quite sure</li>
            <li>but by end of first week the darkness was almost gone</li>
            <li>I really like this system!  </li>
            <li>This eye gel is so refreshing and actually reduced my puffiness.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s a first for me on Amazon...</li>
            <li>This procudt deflate puffy eyes and the skin around your eyes is soft  and smooth.</li>
            <li>When I first applied the gel, I did notice immediately that it was working in the lines.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>I received a coupon to try this product at a deeply discounted price and I was so glad that I took advantage of the offer .</li>
            <li>and I also used it above my top lip.  </li>
            <li>This seems to really work!</li>
            <li>Also seems to pair well with most of my facial moisturizers.</li>
            <li>This one leaves my under eye smooth and clear, works just as well as prescription.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer too, not too heavy for the eye area.</li>
            <li>gel goes on very smooth, is easy to gently work onto the tender thin skin areas under and around the eyes with light finger tip pats, dries quickly and no stickiness.</li>
            <li>I was buying Clarins serum super lift advanced extra firming eye countour serum for twice the price for 1/3 the product.</li>
            <li>But most important, the fines lines and wrinkles around my eyes are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!!!!  </li>
            <li>After many other attempts, this is by far my favorite eye gel.</li>
            <li>It absorbs rather fast and you can feel the skin under your eyes tightening right away.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s always best to start early before it&#x27;s too late!</li>
            <li>When I first tried the Insta Natural Eye Gel, I noticed that it had a thicker consistency, which is not a bad thing, since I would love some extra moisture around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>But they are for more drastic situations that simply being of a certain age.</li>
            <li>All the other reviews say this product works and is amazing......</li>
            <li>The product was here before it was due and that was amazing.</li>
            <li>I use it day and night with gentle massage, less fine lines and my eye concealer applies better too.</li>
            <li>One great thing about Instanatural is that they provide 100% money back if you are not satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>What I&#x27;m loving about this product, is that it&#x27;s lightweight, and doesn&#x27;t feel tacky, due to the fact that its a gel.</li>
            <li>My problem has always been puffiness and, to be honest, NOTHING will cure this other than surgery, which I am not going to do at this point.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s inexpensive compared to other products, it smells nice and it works.</li>
            <li>My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.</li>
            <li>My skin feels kind of dry shortly after applying the gel.&lt;br /&gt;No improvement with the fine lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li>After trying this by itself and seeing nice results, I looked into other anti-aging products to improve the rest of my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The skin indeed becomes more smooth, but this cream doesn&#x27;t treat frim lines and wrinkes as the other more expensive products to (i&#x27;m very satisfied with clarins eye balm).</li>
            <li>Best eye gel I have ever bought, I also use on my face, feels good, wrinkles, dark circles and bags is disappear little by little after using  months.</li>
            <li>and although it doesn&#x27;t completely remove lines (nothing really does at my age), it does make the skin feel youthful and smooth.</li>
            <li>, my face is radiant and the company selling this product really cares about you and your experience with the product, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ll stick with what works for my delicate skin and great customer service.</li>
            <li>The previously darker areas are more a red/pinkish hue that looks much more natural.</li>
            <li>It absorbs so naturally and feels incredibly clean without a residue.</li>
            <li>The first time I applied it really stung and got hot.</li>
            <li>I really appreciated The customer service and will definitely be trying to more of these products.</li>
            <li>When she orders more she wants to get a size larger</li>
            <li>Their ingredients are simple, natural, and incredibly effective.</li>
            <li>Really feels good when applied...not a heavy product at all</li>
            <li>I do let it soak in for a few minutes before applying an oil free lotion moisturizer on top</li>
            <li>Works fair if you apply multiple times daily</li>
            <li>I actually use it over my whole face under my moisturinzer (also from InstaNatural) and I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li>Great product compared to the wide variety I&#x27;ve tried-- significant reduction in dark circles in addition to elimination of wrinkles and puffiness around the eyes.</li>
            <li>I love how the cream sinks right into your eye tissue under and over the eye.</li>
            <li>liked the serum a little more than the cream only because it glides on easier.</li>
            <li>As a sufferer of dark circles for many years, this product helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>I bought two bottles, I will keep trying to see if there are any positive results.</li>
            <li>I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li>I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>This product showed positive results in just over a week.  </li>
            <li>The number of positive reviews speak for themselves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not noticed a huge difference physically, but perhaps it helps more psychologically.</li>
            <li>This cream is really effective and my daughter is pleased with it after only a few uses.</li>
            <li>I still have dark circles under my eyes but the texture is amazing , I can notice improvement .</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this long, but I love the texture</li>
            <li>but I have noticed significant reduction is puffiness, skin feels smoother and more firm around the sockets.</li>
            <li>Pretty much I use it wherever I need to, twice a day.</li>
            <li>Pretty much I use it wherever I need to, twice a day.</li>
            <li>First of all, this is a real review.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much difference in my skin although I must say I haven&#x27;t been consistent.</li>
            <li>After trying several very pricey products, with minimal results, I did some research I saw that this eye cream had great reviews.  </li>
            <li>did notice the skin under my eyes seems a bit drier (showing fine lines that I don&#x27;t have when it&#x27;s not dry)</li>
            <li>I have tried other eye creams that worked great but had no lasting results or are no longer on the market.  </li>
            <li>Really does reduce under eye bags consistently.</li>
            <li>I was pretty much a zombie during the day</li>
            <li>Makeup goes easily on top of the gel, as long as you give it sufficient time to absorb.</li>
            <li>Have only been using this cream for a few days but so far it is great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional blogger that writes my true opinion.</li>
            <li>The cream is all natural and full of organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>honestly does make a difference to the amount of puffiness and helps to lighten the dark circles.</li>
            <li>As a swimmer I wear tight goggles that have started to create more wrinkles (being 49 adds to this!)</li>
            <li>I am 30 and have fine lines and wrinkles as well as pretty significant dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>The Eye gel is primarily for use under your eyes, to reduce dark circles, fine lines &amp; wrinkles, puffiness, but I am using it all over my face.</li>
            <li>This has helped my dark circles a lot, but I even noticed help with some fine lines that were looking like they were getting comfortable.</li>
            <li>First off, I will say that I got this for fine lines, not puffiness, but it definitely seemed to help!</li>
            <li>Next time, I&#x27;ll save my $20 and put it towards something with more realistic ratings.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to know the price has gone down....</li>
            <li>This product has actually convinced me that it is high time to use an under eye serum - an effective and natural one at that!</li>
            <li>By the first full week, twice a day, I saw a major difference in my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different creams, gels, serums, etc - including high end brands - but nothing worked.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this for dark circles and the price is very friendly!</li>
            <li>To be clear, this isn&#x27;t a facelift, so you will see lines when you smile very largely, but when your face is at rest; not so much.    </li>
            <li>I was very skeptical, but so happy I listened to the many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>but I think that will take a little more time!</li>
            <li>and it makes your skin look fresh, shiny and new...</li>
            <li>slight smell of cucumber, but it feels amazingly hydrating as soon as it touches your face.</li>
            <li>However, since I&#x27;ve been using this gel, I have noticed a huge difference in the hydration of my skin as well as a huge fix in my under-eye dark circles.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that after using this for a week, my skin has tightened and the under eye sagging has been less.</li>
            <li>I did not see a great big difference in the dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li>I am much more aware of fine lines and wrinkles that are slowly making an appearance.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quick and leaves a soft feel to my eyelids.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quick and leaves a soft feel to my eyelids.</li>
            <li>really were pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>The gel flows on easily and has definitely smoothed the skin under and around my eyes in addition to also reducing the puffy appearance under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I am very realistic when it comes to skin care products</li>
            <li>The owner actually was nice enough to send me out a complimentary free bottle just to assure me that the product actually works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a dramatic reduction...but noticeable nonetheless.</li>
            <li>Not dramatic results.  </li>
            <li>Gentle clear gel is easy to apply - odorless and non-irritating to my very sensitive eyes &amp; skin.</li>
            <li>It certainly makes my skin feel and look smoother.</li>
            <li>I have sleeping problems and that results in large bags under my eyes...</li>
            <li>I certainly did.  </li>
            <li>have noticed a drastically large change in the puffiness.  </li>
            <li>The 1.7 ounce bottle is large and the gel spreads well.</li>
            <li>So she got a large bra based on the sizes that they suggested.</li>
            <li>(she got a large).</li>
            <li>I have to say that I&#x27;m very satisfied with your product this far and have noted very interesting improvements in the area around my eyes even when the main purpose of my purchase was to get an excellent moisturizer as I suffer from dry skin in the area that just got worst after two eye surgeries.</li>
            <li>I see a significant reduction in fine lines &amp; dark circles.</li>
            <li>The formula is also rich and absorbs quickly, so I don’t have to wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because I really thought this product was going to work considering all of the positive feedback it recieved.</li>
            <li>and I hope to see more and more improvement in my dark circles....and believe me, they are definitely there!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite facial care product.</li>
            <li>I can definitely  see less  bag, Great price for  </li>
            <li>I actually put it further down into my t zone under makeup and it looks perfect!  </li>
            <li>Feels like it&#x27;s working and keeps everything nice and tight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really thick, but it does build up easily if you accidentally put too much amount on your under eyes and it tends to dry quickly, too.</li>
            <li>Definitely reduces fine lines.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for a week, and I do think I see some improvements in the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>, the only thing bothers me is some fine lines underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have been using Shiseido&#x27;s eye cream, and it always provides a temporary relief, but once the make up is on, the fine lines show up instantly.</li>
            <li>Although I do not see any difference with fine lines and wrinkles just yet, I do like the gel and use it daily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m well into my 30s and the fine lines and crows feet are really starting to show up.</li>
            <li>I see the fine lines around my eyes smoothing out, and the puffy upper eyelids literally shrinking.</li>
            <li>In 2 weeks I totally noticed a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li>It did actually reduce fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes</li>
            <li>Pretty decent.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty decent product to relieve eye-puffiness and circles.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is big enough that you wouldn&#x27;t be running out quickly if you used it on more than your undereyes.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing eye cream for dark circles and puffiness!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mfg did send a little inquiry to see how I liked it and said to keep trying it as it eventually would work.  </li>
            <li>Feels nice and it helps a little bit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little on the thicker side, but it rubs in nicely.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for around 3 weeks now and have not noticed much difference in my fine lines or wrinkly eyelids (and I&#x27;m only 23).  </li>
            <li>This eye gel has really helped with the fine lines around the crows feet area - but what I really have noticed is a big improvement on the eyelid under the brow area where I have started having some crepe-ness.  </li>
            <li>I now have very high hopes that after the recommended 8 weeks of applying this gel that my bags will really improve.</li>
            <li>The easy to use pump is great, but I only need to depress it about 1/4 the way down to get the amount I need for my undereyes</li>
            <li>I love their products and agree with other positive feedbacks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bought this due to so many positive reviews</li>
            <li>I have only used it a coulple times, so I have not seen a huge difference</li>
            <li>The cream is clear and soft and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a great product and as all my skin issues get under control after a few weeks of constant usage, I&#x27;ll post some pictures.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few weeks and can see an amazing difference in the circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Youth Express Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer Cream, which is non-greasy, very hydrating and does smooth wrinkles, and their Vit. C serum which has faded sun spots over the one month period I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks manufacturer of promotional activities, the price is cheaper.</li>
            <li>It works very well, and I have no complaints with it at all.</li>
            <li>I do like InstaNatural products as a whole.</li>
            <li>however I don&#x27;t really notice anything taking place with this product yet....</li>
            <li>I really like this eye gel</li>
            <li>It somehow stays very hydrating through the night.  </li>
            <li>my eyes went to very puffy to almost nonexistent.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t stand to do it anymore.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>BETTER than expected.</li>
            <li>I use this cream on my whole face in the morning (I ordered the night cream for evenings) and it&#x27;s really soothing, and cooling, and it &amp;#34;plumps&amp;#34; up the skin</li>
            <li>but it very lightweight &amp; non-greasy.</li>
            <li>I really do like the way this goes on...</li>
            <li>Still waiting to see the result, very hydrating.</li>
            <li>I like to apply it, then apply my foundation because it really helps to blend around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>As you can see in the photos there really wasn&#x27;t any change</li>
            <li>It had a very cooling and soothing effect around the eye area.  </li>
            <li>These reviews were so promising</li>
            <li>The product seems straight to the point without any bs.</li>
            <li>Have not noticed much of a difference yet.</li>
            <li>This gel feels like you did not even put it on, very lightweight.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensative skin and a lot of skin allergies, as well as wear contacts.  </li>
            <li>IT is very hydrating and soothing to my eyes.</li>
            <li>I do not have to worry about re-checking my under eyes so much.</li>
            <li>thank u so much.  </li>
            <li>Thanks .</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect the result to happen so fast</li>
            <li>dont really notice a difference after using one month</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>I am really wanting to to a difference.</li>
            <li>I really want to kick the use of a concealer</li>
            <li>It got almost 5 stars but very greasy and didn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
            <li>in all a very satisfactory purchase.  </li>
            <li>I really like this gel, and have seen improvement over the month I have been using.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference on the bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I find that when I put too much it does burn but</li>
            <li>I also feel like my whole eye area has tightened up</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>This works very well</li>
            <li>Everyone else is telling me that I look really rested....</li>
            <li>REally does help to reduce under eye puffiness.  </li>
            <li>but it has really been bothering me.</li>
            <li>I was really getting discouraged.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much improvement yet.  </li>
            <li>Basically, I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very drying.  </li>
            <li>Did so much more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I kinda gave up on it after a week as I didn&#x27;t really see any results.</li>
            <li>I used this for a month and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>it hasn&#x27;t helped much if at all.  </li>
            <li>I even want to apply it over my entire face for a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>So, I either recommending waiting much longer or doing this at night.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>I got this product for reduced price to do a review, Thanks</li>
            <li>I know it will take using it longer to see a real difference.</li>
            <li>Yet, since having her, I have noticed myself ageing, whereas I really hadn’t before.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, it exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and the gel stays on all day and keeps the eye area tender and protected.  </li>
            <li>I really like the feel , texture and smell</li>
            <li>Really did nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>I am very please with this product.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really tell that it&#x27;s done much of anything.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>,, It really does work.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very displeased.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>It really isn&#x27;t a hassle to apply so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking this eye gel.  </li>
            <li>and I can use it on my whole face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li>This is a lifetime, 100% money-back guarantee-something that, in my experience, is absolutely unheard of.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very cooling and hydrating.  </li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because the pump dispenses too much product.  </li>
            <li>it dries fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used dozens of eye creams, and this is absolutely one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery  </li>
            <li>I no longer use the concealer and only a light powder to blend in with my makeup.</li>
            <li>I really do like this gel eye cream</li>
            <li>BUT THIS ONE REALLY TAKES THE STARS.  </li>
            <li>I really like this eye gel.  </li>
            <li>it really helped in the morning for puffy eyes and The cooling effect that happen when you apply it</li>
            <li>Thanks InstaNatural</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and it truly softens and smooths the skin around your eyes.</li>
            <li>and very generous amount of product for the price.</li>
            <li>After I put it on, I just go about my morning routine, having breakfast, getting ready, etc.</li>
            <li>I did how ever, knock off one star because I expected to see more improvement in my skin texture underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gel.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use as much concealer now.  </li>
            <li>I really like the product itself.</li>
            <li>I got it before but not as much as I do now.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t helped the puffiness as much.</li>
            <li>but this really work</li>
            <li>I use as directed and really don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li>After a couple months of use, I really haven&#x27;t seen any change.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles around the eyes, so I can&#x27;t comment on the anti-wrinkle effectiveness.</li>
            <li>The cooling effect of the gel is also very calming.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a gel like cream that really absorbs well .</li>
            <li>shipping is fast and its packaged up really well .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have resolved to drinking coffee with lots of creamer in order to keep up with my kiddos who are ready to go as soon as they wake up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is working very well for me.  </li>
            <li>It is very inexpensive and you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Insta Natural definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>does it really do all of those things?</li>
            <li>I am always looking for something to help, but really don&#x27;t hold out much hope.</li>
            <li>I read that this was non-comedogenic and can be used on the whole face</li>
            <li>but I do apply BB cream over it and that works very well.  </li>
            <li>However, it really doesn&#x27;t seem to be like glue under the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I was much happier with Khiels recovery eye.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very soothing</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product 1 week ago and it has arrived 3 days ago so the shipping was quite fast.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>very concerned with satisfaction.</li>
            <li>so I could see how much is still in the container.  </li>
            <li>no matter how much sleep he gets.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I use this on my whole face.as</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this once a day for about a year on my whole face.</li>
            <li>My dark circles are pretty damn prominent as I work 2 very strenous jobs</li>
            <li>and this really helps.  </li>
            <li>and it really works.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on my whole face, my neck and on my decollete.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much for allowing me to review it.</li>
            <li>I also started putting it on a spot on my neck where my skin was looking very wrinkly</li>
            <li>This product has helped smooth out my skin and made it look younger and healthier.  </li>
            <li>I really like the eye gel.  </li>
            <li>This bra obviously doesnt fit me in the video.</li>
            <li>Its really work thanks guys</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it for it to work.</li>
            <li>I used this around my eyes, as well as over my whole face.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>REALLY, TRULY W0RK.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t figure out how this could work so fast.</li>
            <li>If you get too much on, it dries and can peel off like a mask.</li>
            <li>I would even put it on par with some high end creams that cost $80 and up!</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>For real.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The only reason that I gave two stars instead of one is because it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in so much pain</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>it is very gooditem  and</li>
            <li>I like that it can be used on the eye area or on your whole face.</li>
            <li>Really works well.</li>
            <li>I apply after cleansing my skin and the area feels smooth throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying this out for a while, my wrinkles are still present</li>
            <li>I can really feel the difference and tightening in the skin.</li>
            <li>I really like and will be ordering again.</li>
            <li>Organic and animal free testing is enough to make me use this product but the product will stand alone for it&#x27;s quality.  </li>
            <li>This eye cream has really helped with my under eye puffiness.</li>
            <li>I did receive this product for free to try and even if I had paid for it my review would have been the same.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t cause issues with eye makeup, and seems to be helping in the overall appearance of the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>and it honestly doesn&#x27;t appear to be getting any different even after using twice a day, but I&#x27;ll wait til I have used the entire bottle to make a real decision.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had way too much to spread out before.</li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes have become so much smoother</li>
            <li>It took a whole bottle before I started getting compliments on my looks.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>it despite my gentle skin.</li>
            <li>i am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll say it is working very well</li>
            <li>It is very sticky, and has a smell of cucumber I believe,  </li>
            <li>but if you use to much it gets sticky and stays sticky on your skin</li>
            <li>Where this eye gel really shines is reducing puffiness.</li>
            <li>would really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to believe this would be the product for me, but it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very exited to see the ingredient of this eye gel</li>
            <li>and it is really working.</li>
            <li>Used the whole bottle but nothing changed.</li>
            <li>I have really noticed a difference, in the look and feel of my undereye skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using an eye cream that costs twice as much</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think this product helps my bags much at all.  </li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t see any immediate differences</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product......it actually works!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve personally only been using it under my eyes because that is my primary problem area</li>
            <li>I use it on my whole face including under the eyes.  </li>
            <li>In my case, they are starting to smooth out from the inside by the nose and working its way out.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and the item was well packaged.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It is really working.</li>
            <li>graveyard(wasted money)......finally a product that really works.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really seem to notice much change in my skin.</li>
            <li>Did not see much difference</li>
            <li>Also, the substance is cloudy-looking cream and it&#x27;s very creamy.</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>seems to work really well</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really see a difference</li>
            <li>My job requires me to work all kinds of hours and staring at a computer screen for the whole shift.</li>
            <li>and I used the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>same as the cheap stuff at walmart.</li>
            <li>if u do this U will see fast result.  </li>
            <li>The label says you can treat your whole face to it.  </li>
            <li>Used for 2 weeks, haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in color or puffiness but it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>so that I can put what&#x27;s left on my finger lightly all over my face</li>
            <li>Wish I&#x27;d taken before photo because it really is a noticeable improvement.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li>i really like this product it does really works.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>and I really struggled with taking care of my skin the way I was supposed to.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>did absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li>it feels very sticky like glue on your face and you cannot put makeup over it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet...</li>
            <li>as I use, for me after one week, I could see reasonable improvement under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Very upset that I did not take pictures.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need much to cover under the eye area.</li>
            <li>Texture is light and can definitely be worn under concealer.</li>
            <li>lets you control how much you need.</li>
            <li>it looks like I am well rested and under eye makeup goes on really well.</li>
            <li>If you use too much</li>
            <li>, I do not get much sleep therefore, I also have the undereye puffies....</li>
            <li>really like the plesant odor the eye gel has</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I needed something that would really work.</li>
            <li>I have really seen a difference.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really experience it to be sticky which I like.  </li>
            <li>Really worked well for me.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend InstaNatural products!</li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>I just finished the whole bottle before I give my review about this product.</li>
            <li>It smells as if it has a bit of cucumber in it and very cooling even though I do not keep it in the refrigerator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>HE REALLY DONT LIKE FOR ME TO BE PUTTING STUFF ON HIS FACE</li>
            <li>I like this product because it is gentle.  </li>
            <li>Seems to take years off the skin, highly recommended !</li>
            <li>Works reasonably well for just the 2 weeks I have been using it.  </li>
            <li>I expected more after reading all the reviews.  </li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anybody who wants to try it .</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it has any scent really.</li>
            <li>I think this could really help with any under eye issues you may have.</li>
            <li>However I do have to say that this is very hydrating.</li>
            <li>doesnt really do anything, used as directed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cooling on the eye, and plumps up the skin under your eye.</li>
            <li>so you really can’t tell but some of the time you can see the circles through the make</li>
            <li>really up close.</li>
            <li>It does not do much for me.</li>
            <li>The better products are more expensive but they get absorbed in skin well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of those issues that really bothers me.</li>
            <li>As for wrinkles it really has not helped with that either.</li>
            <li>Before bed  I apply this to my face it drys fast</li>
            <li>I did not see much if any of a difference between the before and after pictures I took.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>, don&#x27;t feel anything, can&#x27;t real tell much.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I noticed much of a difference from using this product.</li>
            <li>like that this Eye Gel comes in a pump because that lets me control how much I use.  </li>
            <li>The gel doesn’t seem to really have a smell to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Saw absolutely zero improvement after two weeks of routine use.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really see any difference.</li>
            <li>formula is also very sticky.</li>
            <li>Do you really want that in a skin cream?  </li>
            <li>It really helps with puffiness.</li>
            <li>to preserve it longer and give a cooling effect that really brightens your skin tone.</li>
            <li>I also didn’t see much of a difference in the amount of redness on my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the size of the container, this is truly a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I have noticed my skin does not seem to break out as much either.</li>
            <li>But it does make the skin under the eyes much smoother and nicer, so I plan to keep using.</li>
            <li>It absorbs really well and doesn&#x27;t ruin my makeup application.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t have much of these to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>but after 6 weeks I don&#x27;t see much of a difference, and I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day, in the morning and evening.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>But I really haven&#x27;t had a skin care routine before this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This seems to be really helping.</li>
            <li>I even used this gel for my whole face once.</li>
            <li>How nice to finally find something that actually does what it says it will do!</li>
            <li>Ok wow... I can&#x27;t believe the stuff actually works!</li>
            <li>It also imparts a kind of natural looking glow without looking wet or shiny.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give the product a fair trial at least using for a month.  </li>
            <li>looks good, but not effective</li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin and have trouble finding a good natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that the ingredients are specific to what the skin requires to be healthy, plumped, and naturally glowing.</li>
            <li>And any little bit helps, right? :)</li>
            <li>I like this eye gel - it is cool as it goes on and it is easy to use a little or a lot -</li>
            <li>The eye gel seemed to moisturize my whole face so everything seemed to exfoliate all the stiff wrinkly layer leaving a healthy smooth and soft skin.  </li>
            <li>I have become more concerned with my skincare routine over the last couple of years, especially since 30 is right around the corner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love with two children already and pregnant with twins I am never able to sleep and it is very noticeable.</li>
            <li>{ and half the price] I will be ordering more very soon!</li>
            <li>I imagine the most important thing I can say is this; I was in the ladies room at work the other day, and as I walked by the mirror, I actually did a double-take.</li>
            <li>, is that the consistency is not so good, because it shows when you put it on, I mean, is not so absorbable,</li>
            <li>I had high hopes because of positive reviews</li>
            <li>I am always willing to try something new</li>
            <li>/&gt;The packaing and pump system is good, no loss of the eye cream with use / execess left on the bottle like some other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, unlike many other companies, this company is very responsive and has reached out to me a couple of times to see how I like their product.</li>
            <li>And let me tell you, it really does banish dark circles and fine lines!</li>
            <li>possibly a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container, contents and sellers are all top notch and professional, this is not a dollar store product, but somewhere in between a prescription and high end salon items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She loved to play with my eyes lately, and I think it’s because they are looking less tired, and more like happy eyes, instead of sleepy eyes.  </li>
            <li>The main thing is that this gel seems to be good for the health of the delicate skin around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, dry skin (70+ in age) that doesn’t “like” many of the products on the market.  </li>
            <li>Some other creams cause my makeup to separate or crease more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other products, but am not as satisfied as I am with this one.</li>
            <li>but after continuous use, I could see an extreme change for the better under eyes.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE TRIED MANY OTHER PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>You get much more product for your money than other brands too.</li>
            <li>Always looking for the so called &amp;#34;best cream ever.&amp;#34; I ordered their face mask which I love, so I decided to explore their other products.</li>
            <li>Have it two stars instead of one because I love the company and there other products.</li>
            <li>As a women my appearance when I look in the mirror affects my mood for this as well as many other reasons I was eager to try this product</li>
            <li>you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful</li>
            <li>I applied this the night I got it and in the morning, and by the following evening my wrinkles had diminished significantly.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this to use just under my eyes, but by the second night I decided to wear it all over</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered this instead of reordering the other thing.</li>
            <li>After a month of usage, I can say this product works better than other eye creams I have tried.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product based on other reviews on Amazon, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>they should give lessons to other companies :)</li>
            <li>I purchased this based on reviews and it being much more affordable than other products.</li>
            <li>it is a better buy than other eye products I&#x27;ve tried, too.  </li>
            <li>Suffering from dark circles under my eyes at times, I was super excited to put this product to the test.  </li>
            <li>Leading into the new year, I have made a conscious effort recently to pay more attention to my skin.</li>
            <li>I have those dreaded eye bags/dark circles that make you appear 10 years older than you really are.</li>
            <li>Plant stem cells, another main ingredient, don’t have much to show for themselves besides hype, but the others are good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on fast and dries quickly, so it doesn&#x27;t take much to add it to your daily</li>
            <li>My dark circles are becoming much lighter!</li>
            <li>skin under my eyes is much firmer, the dark circles are almost not noticeable any more</li>
            <li>and I will absolutely be repurchasing this product until I&#x27;m much, much older.</li>
            <li>like the way it feels immediately after I&#x27;ve applied it for several hours afterward, it&#x27;s a cool and tighter feeling that has a gentle smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I guessed the eye cream is so strong for my skin type that the skin underneath and around my eyes became swollen and turned into dry patches.</li>
            <li>Ok, i have to give a 5 although it really has done nothing for the dark circles.</li>
            <li>Feels cooling and refreshing and really minimizes the dark circles.</li>
            <li>This handy little gel is versatile too!</li>
            <li>It is not greasy or heavy and it soaks into your skin very easily.</li>
            <li>The gel can sometimes make my face feel tight but the next morning, my skin feels soft and looks great.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure not going to waste all these amazing plant stem cells, and peptides, why not get an entire facial treatment?)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why there are so many good reviews, I got this because I have dark circles under my eyes and so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I started using this Eye Cream on December 9th, 2014 and while only using a green pea size amount it covered both eye areas, top and lower lip areas, fine laughing lines and my frown lines between my eye brows.  </li>
            <li>This product is fine and gentle on sensitive skin under eyes, forehead  as well as the entire face.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry smooth, very sticky</li>
            <li>and I think that what makes it work better , it did reduce the black under my eyes too much</li>
            <li>It reduces puffiness rather quickly (almost instantly for me) and has been a real life saver when I&#x27;ve had sleepless nights and needed to look my best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product after a late night out with friends, and have been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t given this product for free, I purchased it about 9 months ago and waited this long to post my review.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working pretty well.</li>
            <li>I felt like I was getting some small lines under my eyes and honestly they are gone.  </li>
            <li>See difference in appearance for the better, However, my Dark Circles aren&#x27;t going away.</li>
            <li>Insta Natural was one of the first companies I had the pleasure to review a product for.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better products I&#x27;ve used for the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I was especially interested in the &amp;#34;diminishes dark circles&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>When I first tried is the for day or two - it was WOW.  </li>
            <li>My dark colored bags are getting lighter, so now they&#x27;re able to be covered by makeup.</li>
            <li>I love it because it reduced the look of my dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li>Then I get an email from the seller saying the results would happen in 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m giving it an extra star because it&#x27;s cool, soothing, and there&#x27;s no sticky residue afterwards.</li>
            <li>The skin under my eyes is a bit more firmer, and I have noticed the dark circles disappear when i wear</li>
            <li>Wow exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>It tightens around my eyes taking away most of the puffiness, and visibly reduces the dark circles  under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was happiest about the dark circles under my eyes, which have mostly disappeared.</li>
            <li>After a couple days my under eye bags were somehow tightening up, the puffy was gone and so were most of the dark circles.</li>
            <li>This eye cream (it is actually a gel), feels cool and soothing under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My eyes are looking much better, my dark circles and puffiness are disappearing.</li>
            <li>The rest of my face now matches under my eyes, smooth, and firm, and even better, the lines on my forehead and on my upper lip are almost gone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually pretty damn surprised.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works to reduce dark circles but it sure doesn&#x27;t reduce puffiness and bags.  </li>
            <li>It has helped with the puffiness under my eyes and I&#x27;ve noticed my dark circles are getting better.  </li>
            <li>&gt; eliminate dark circles and give my eyes a more youthful appearance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t have many issues with regard to puffiness or dark circles, I didn&#x27;t expect to see the results that I did.  </li>
            <li>For most of my life I&#x27;ve noticed that I have puffiness and dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Well, Insta Natural emailed me asking if I would be interested in trying out 2 of their products.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t allowed it to work to its full potential.</li>
            <li>It does seem to reduce the appearance of dark circles and puffiness, but it is not my favorite eye cream.</li>
            <li>I am 50 years old and an avid eye gel/cream user.  </li>
            <li>Overall she said its not a bad bra.</li>
            <li>I will order more when i get my credit card bill down a bit.  </li>
            <li>I feel confident that this particular product can help minimize my dark circles and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>You need to make sure to use this every day and use it with the other product  (the InstaNatural Eye SERUM!)</li>
            <li>My circles aren&#x27;t enormously bad but they are more intense than I&#x27;d like them to be; after a lot of research most websites indicate that many of these things don&#x27;t really work well, so I may try an ice mask next.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend trying it out first thing in the morning and right before bed and giving it a few weeks for full results.</li>
            <li>I felt a little more youthful after I got completely ready with my make up and everything.</li>
            <li>it really does a lot of applications I have tried a lot of dark circle treatment products this one is my favorite so far!</li>
            <li>I love this cream because it&#x27;s gentle on my eyes and doesn&#x27;t hurt my overly sensitive skin like other eye creams.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed it must be doing something, because…if you let it sit wrongly…you can created a new line in your face that really shows when you put on make up.  </li>
            <li>I was almost out of the eye cream I had been using, and it wasn&#x27;t helping much, so I went searching for something new to try.</li>
            <li>I love the way this leaves the skin around my eye feeling, and I have seen a slight difference but nothing too drastic.</li>
            <li>cuz your eyes don&#x27;t look as black more brown</li>
            <li>The circles are more than half gone.</li>
            <li>I bought this more or less just to see any improvement.</li>
            <li>I took some pics on my cell at 2 weeks intervals (more or less) and transferred them to the computer</li>
            <li>The puffiness under her eyes is slightly reduced, which makes her look younger--with more vitality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels slightly sticky at first, but the sticky feeling leaves pretty quickly after putting it on your skin.</li>
            <li>The product is much better than what I had been using previously (L&#x27;Orel Men).</li>
            <li>Absolutely no skin or eye irritation, easy to dispense and use.  </li>
            <li>Seems every morning my eyes looks less swolllen more youthful .</li>
            <li>While this product really helped diminish the dark circles and fine lines around my eyes, it has really helped reduced the &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; under my eyes after 5 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>I cant speak for any older wrinkles though.</li>
            <li>did work really great for those days that I stay up to late and have puffy eyes the next morning.</li>
            <li>I am able to notice a difference after such a short period of time.  </li>
            <li>It dried my skin out so much, that I felt like it made line more visible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that using this will also prevent wrinkles as I become older.</li>
            <li>I used to have really puffy eyes because of lack of sleep but after just a few weeks of using it I was already able to see a difference.</li>
            <li>but mainly it&#x27;s my fault for staying up</li>
            <li>No, my eye area is not perfect, but it sure looks better than it did.</li>
            <li>they look open,  I just ordered a second bottle just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>I would say they were mild to moderate in intensity.</li>
            <li>This is even much better than the expensive eye creams that I used before for many years.</li>
            <li>I, too, thought this must be some kind of crazy scam because how could there POSSIBLY be so many five-star reviews ??  </li>
            <li>It makes my puffy, tired looking eye area and makes me look like I am wide awake after a wonderful nights sleep.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly and has this light and subtle fresh/cucumber scent.</li>
            <li>My review of just 3 stars might not be fair as I only used it a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My main issue is that it just didn&#x27;t appear to do anything for my wrinkles or dryness around my eyes.</li>
            <li>This product not only does NOT work but it actually made my eyes MORE puffy than they were before.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li>If I ever hear even a hint of this product being discontinued, I will stock pile it to make sure that I have enough to last for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>deeper wrinkles are going to need longer use, I was lucky enough to get a discount on this when i bought it.</li>
            <li>Used many before and a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, after about six weeks I began to see an improvement in under-eye puffiness and the overall youthfulness of the skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I started a week of experience and satisfied with it , i will write the final result in the future</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m near sighted, so I&#x27;ve squinted pretty much my entire life), as well as the very beginnings of crow&#x27;s feet on the outer parts of my eyes, so I apply this pretty much all over the face, including the eyelids themselves.</li>
            <li>I am only on day 6 and cannot believe how quickly the skin around eyes tightens.</li>
            <li>I have used this gel mainly at night, and I have seen some  results</li>
            <li>But the up side to this product is it smells decent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There really is a small scent to me its more of a flowery scent which does not bother me, I apply the gel on first then my make-up.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I&#x27;ve finished the entire bottle, taking it apart to get every last drop.</li>
            <li>I used both products, one on my left eye, one on my right, and the other product I used worked much better than this cream.</li>
            <li>I was really really excited for this product with all of its amazingly positive reviews and realistic pictures, but i didn&#x27;t really see a difference with the dark circles.</li>
            <li>honestly, I bought the cream more for the dark circles, figuring when I&#x27;m in my late 70&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back a little over two weeks later and have decided this product works best for me if I use it in the morning only.</li>
            <li>And like the fact that no one has ask me If I need some sleep,that happens at least twice a week (really frustrating).It&#x27;s perfect for travel since is small.</li>
            <li>I have very dark under eyes and this gel has made them very light.</li>
            <li>Feels very natural!</li>
            <li>Nice product I got for free, leaves a slightly sticks residue and smells a little like glue but noticing everyone improvement</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this those who get the &amp;#34;you look tired&amp;#34; remarks.  </li>

            <li>I have also started to notice a nice vertical wrinkle line down the center of my forehead that meets right in between my eyebrows</li>
            <li>,It has helped with my dark circles,I have also used it on my face and neck and it feels great my skin feels tight.</li>
            <li>Most of the positive and 5 star reviews are by people who received this product for free or at a reduced cost, maybe even fake reviews.  </li>
            <li>I have huge bags and dark circles under my eyes (thank you, genetics) and this stuff has actually minimized them significantly.</li>
            <li>my skib so soft!!</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>I actually saw results the first week of using the product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only use this for a couple weeks and it really works!!</li>
            <li>so my eye lines may take a little more time.</li>
            <li>Better to use a little and let it soak in.</li>
            <li>It makes me look a little better.  </li>
            <li>Would like to have seen a little bit more of a change.</li>
            <li>Either pay a little more and go to Sephora or go to the drug store.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised!!</li>
            <li>On the weekends when I usually do not wear make-up, I will apply once in the morning and once in the afternoon, for hydration!</li>
            <li>It only takes a very small amount, which makes this very cost effective!</li>
            <li>He wanted to find something that would work to make his eyes look a little better.  </li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>and I could really tell the difference with the fine lines and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I apply it all over my face and it has really hydrated my skin while seeing improvement to the dark circles and fine lines around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable, and I like that it is a natural product that strives for high standards.</li>
            <li>I realized this the hard way the first time I applied this, and then tried to apply foundation cream on top of the gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried MANY other eye creams/gels from other high end manufacturers that did nothing to help me whatsoever and were also full of concerning ingredients and synthetic fragrance that would irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>So far, I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Wow - this product really works.</li>
            <li>so I guess that I really didn&#x27;t give it a chance as far as results go.</li>
            <li>So far, I really like it.</li>
            <li>WOW did it really help heal my skin...</li>
            <li>It is clear and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>So far, I am really liking this gel.</li>
            <li>I really like this so far.</li>
            <li>Im surprised at how much I like it.</li>
            <li>This product goes on clear and you really don&#x27;t even feel like you have something on your face.</li>
            <li>Feels great on tired eyes!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really take the wrinkles away but makes your under-eye area feel ALIVE.  </li>
            <li>Gentle around the eye area, and its made from natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>So far I really like it</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t quite used it long enough to say for sure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping to see more results over the long term, especially once I&#x27;m using twice a day.  </li>
            <li>Along with looking brighter, my skin appears more plump and firm.</li>
            <li>I have used many different products to correct my dark circles but this one really works and the price is so reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Dried my eyes out and made them appear more wrinkled.  </li>
            <li>Aside from that, all of its other aspects are superior to other products.</li>
            <li>hope I get normal eyes</li>
            <li>has gotten close to normal again</li>
            <li>Satisfied with the quality, but not sure if you have to pay more for &#x27;eye&#x27;-only cream in smaller quantity.</li>
            <li>I truly can&#x27;t believe it because most products takes a few weeks to months to recognize any results.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to be careful not to give it a full pump because you&#x27;ll then have too much product for your eyes.</li>
            <li>The puffs under the eyes has also becomes normal</li>
            <li>so you actually get your dollars worth.</li>
            <li>More importantly, I&#x27;m not FEELING any results.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased that I may try the facial moisturizer in the near future.</li>
            <li>(an antioxidant made by combining two peptides, palmitoyl oligopeptide and palmitoyl tetrapepide-7), cucumber, a peptide complex Aloe,  and MSM (Methylsulfonylmethane - improves your body&#x27;s ability to make it own antioxidants).</li>
            <li>This is actually the first one I found that really absorbs into the skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky or greasy, and as soon as you give it a couple minutes to absorb, you can apply makeup on top and it won&#x27;t get messy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The way it has vastly improved the softness, and texture is worth continued use .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ve all had days where we were out of moisturizer or misplaced it and wished something else would work for the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite out of a few brands.</li>
            <li>In summary, I think that, with a few more weeks, the puffiness will continue to diminish.</li>
            <li>There have been few products that can reduce my problems, but none have been able to make such a difference that I find them to be worth it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Should I use it few days more?</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see what happens in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>I will update in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>I usually apply it daily after my evening bath and it feels sooo good on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a consistency like a lighter version of neosporen,  - nice and thick, but not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is nice, the gel is thick and</li>
            <li>It is a nice thick gel that will stay place when you put it on.</li>
            <li>I get good (not great) results.</li>
            <li>I do look less tired which makes me very happy!</li>
            <li>With having an almost 2 year old, I have found myself sleeping less and stressing more.  </li>
            <li>Having had previous experience with InstaNatural products, I was thrilled at receiving an offer to try this at a one-time promotional discount and of course, I instantly accepted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helped with the dark circles and diminished the fine lines that I am beginning to notice as I get older.</li>
            <li>Make sure to dry the product, before moving on to your next step.  </li>
            <li>I only use it at night as it tends to feel a bit dry around my eyes when I put it on and need to put night cream over top of it to help with that feel.</li>
            <li>I have mild under eye darkness, and a few laugh lines around my eyes</li>
            <li>On the bottle, it says it is safe to apply the eye gel to your entire face too so if your end up pumping too much you can put it on other parts of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first two days my eyes were a little puffy, but after that it felt good to apply, although  little sticky.&lt;br /&gt;try</li>
            <li>Also be sure to not pump out too much at once- start with a very small amount and see how much you need to cover all areas.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast  safety seal on first use it I see little improve but still on the first week!</li>
            <li>Instantly you can feel it working because the skin under your eyes will began to tighten right</li>
            <li>Right away I noticed firmness improvement, within a week, my skin has tightened up and has improved the overall &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>I decided to switch back and use this eye gel for two months instead of giving up right away.</li>
            <li>I have used this eye cream for half a year, the overall feeling pretty good, even better than what expensive large spleen.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, light freckles, uneven skin tone, small wrinkles, dark circles and puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Either way my dark circles are gone and the fine lines that were starting to appear around my laugh line are gone too.</li>
            <li>It feels cool on application, then solidifies like a dry sweat.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have huge dark spots, but as I&#x27;ve aged it&#x27;s become more apparent that there is some discoloration and sagging.  </li>
            <li>I not only look better than last year but in my opinion, look even younger than my age thanks to this eye gel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product is very watery and absorbs quickly, with no unpleasant perfume smell, however, is not particularly effective.</li>
            <li>The fine lines that were under my eyes are now gone, and the good results from the eye gel got even better - the skin is firmer and my dark circles are even less noticeable (I can tell because I&#x27;ve been using less and less concealer).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light on the skin and does not have any stickiness like some other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>on sides my nose or some other area that could use moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product for free to review, and share my thoughts on it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and not sticky like some other gels.</li>
            <li>Need a very small amount, nice gel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although it&#x27;s a little early to see any results, after about 1 week of use, the area around our eyes feels healthier and appears to have a better texture and pigment.</li>
            <li>so I looked for something new to try.  </li>
            <li>In addition to that, I find if I take a break from this for a couple days, the occurrence of new zits rises.</li>
            <li>These two gels are my new favs on days that I don&#x27;t use retinol products.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t noticed any new wrinkles around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I came across this eye gel while looking for a new eye cream.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the new smell.</li>
            <li>The new scent puts me off a bit.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>This product has the perfect mix of ingredients, including a peptide complex, which is hard to find</li>
            <li>I have tried product after product for years to help with the fine lines and dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>this product does want it says it will....remove dark circles, fine lines, etc.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to help with fine lines and dark circles.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to try with the instanatral eye serum and feel like they have helped with me dark puffy eyes, I have not seen any improvement in fine lines</li>
            <li>Opens up my eyes, reduces swelling, erases dark circles, and softens fine lines.</li>
            <li>I am 31, and have dark circles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>Didnt help with dark circles or fine lines .</li>
            <li>so the jury is still out as to whether it reduces fine lines and dark circles.</li>
            <li>Along with this product and the eye serum I believe it has reduced my dark circles and fine</li>
            <li>I noticed my dark circles and fine lines improved almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>I have dark circles and fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I did not notice any difference in the appearance of dark circles, puffiness, or fine lines around my eyes after 5 weeks of use 1x a day however.</li>
            <li>No change at all, nothing for fine lines, dark circles, puffiness.</li>
            <li>However, despite this being a gel, which appears to be quite thick when pumped out, it feels light and fresh when applied.  </li>
            <li>but then I only use an amount sufficient to cover the area), so depending on the products you use daily, you might need to take that into consideration.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free copy of this product courtesy of the company for purposes of review.</li>
            <li>There is absolutely no way of telling how much is left in the bottle and whether or not it is time to buy more.  </li>
            <li>The next day, when I applied my moisturizer, I realized that I had many rough patches around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I finally feel comfortable going out in public without putting any concealer under my eyes.</li>
            <li>This gel is a 9 out of 10 b/c of how quickly it starts to work, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, has done everything it said it would do for my skin.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, and if your under eye region is dry, you may need to apply eye cream atop this.</li>
            <li>This eye gel contains excellent ingredients like hyaluronic acid, plant stem cells, peptide complex, matrixyl 3000 and amino acid complex.  </li>
            <li>I only recommend products/services I use personally &amp; believe my readers will enjoy and/or benefit from.</li>
            <li>This of course didn’t last as I noticed the lines start to return 8 to 10 hours later, and then filled in again</li>
            <li>It goes on really smoothly and definitely brightens my overall complexion.</li>
            <li>I think people tend to see &amp;#34;#1 Bestseller&amp;#34; and assuming it will work for everyone, and it may work for lots of people but thus far it hasn&#x27;t worked particularly well for me.</li>
            <li>This is a third jar I ordered for him, he cannot live without it !!!</li>
            <li>My dark circles are still there thanks to having three babies, but this makes it seems more bright and less dull.</li>
            <li>Because I have dark circles under my eyes, I am always excited when I get the opportunity to try out a new eye gel!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received a long skinny bottle that Almost looks like the real one..and it BURNS MY EYE!!</li>
            <li>I have oily and combination skin and my skin around my eyes is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin and have had no adverse effects....highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I wear contact lenses and have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have problem skin which is acne prone, but also very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Doesn’t irritate my very sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The area around my eyes stay very soft and moisturized for the longest time.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to products with fragrance and this brand has nailed it.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural&#x27;s Youth Express Eye Gel does not irritate my eyelids and I have VERY sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Also, I have very, very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin which wasn&#x27;t bothered at all.</li>
            <li>Start with very little and add more if needed.  </li>
            <li>I did not notice a huge difference with dark circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 9 months and don&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the dark circles under my eyes, but I think that might have to do with my sleep and not the product.</li>
            <li>but I just have not seen a huge improvement in my dark circles.</li>
            <li>With consistent application, I began to see results in a relatively short time.</li>
            <li>This is the first eye cream on Amazon that actually worked on me.</li>
            <li>It works a lot better than several other products I have used over the years.</li>
            <li>I order from Amazon all the time and this is the first review I have ever left</li>
            <li>I actually noticed a difference in the first week of using it.</li>
            <li>Barely any scent, dries fast, and does not crumble.</li>
            <li>I have used several products, priced 5X higher.</li>
            <li>This is the first thing I have ever used that actually works.</li>
            <li>Im going to continue using until the product is done since it wont hurt, maybe then ill see more significant results.</li>
            <li>First impressions -- Terrific smell..like cucumbers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Puffiness: almost completely eliminated&lt;br /&gt;color: improved, retuned almost to normal</li>
            <li>For the first two weeks, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference but around week 3 I realized that the deep lines around my eyes</li>
            <li>not every skin needs the same thing but with the company guaranteeing their product it makes trying on a product much easier!  </li>
            <li>Better improvement for the past 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>There is a very small, light scent that disappears once absorbed.</li>
            <li>So far I like this!</li>
            <li>I use it in the morning and at night, (just a small amount), and I am really pleased with the change in my appearance.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think one actually works better than the other.</li>
            <li>This product has lightened the dark circles and help smooth wrinkles around her eyes.  </li>
            <li>However, my fine eye lines and jowel lines seem to be less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>5 stars for this company in general, I am absolutely in love!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you InstaNatural for naturally making my face breakout!</li>
            <li>First time writing actually on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and rosacea and after three weeks have no irritation!  </li>
            <li>I used it exactly as directed, twice daily for the 8 weeks they told me to use it, and I had zero results.</li>
            <li>I have tried so far!</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle, first one lasted about three months because I choose to apply the gel generously</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m perhaps a fourth of the way through my first container.</li>
            <li>Quite simply - it does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>I’ve used several other InstaNatural products and have been pleased with them</li>
            <li>Most of the under eye treatments that I’ve used in the past have been in the form of a serum or moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye wrinkle creams, but this is the first one that has actually worked for me.  </li>
            <li>The scent is extremely light, almost nonexistent, but has a subtle crispy fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>A little of the product goes a long way and it feels really nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Because they are made with all natural products, they are not stinking, sticking, greasy or chemically like so many other facial products out there.  </li>
            <li>decided to treat myself to a new lotion since the old one didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li>First few weeks i thought it was effective because of the tight feeling around the eyes but after a month i didn&#x27;t see any change.</li>
            <li>More importantly to me however, was that the second morning my eyes were impressively less puffy and dark.  </li>
            <li>My dark circles are still there since they are inherited but much, much better than last year.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin under my eyes sticky/tacky and if I smile real wide my skin sticks together and not putting to much on.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate their willingness to go the extra mile, which is not common these days.  </li>
            <li>The stickiness creates a shine that actually accentuates any bags or dark circles you may have making them seem even more visible.</li>
            <li>I had medium dark circles, mostly under my eyes, and moderate puffiness.</li>
            <li>I have only used about 1/2 of the first container and so far I see no difference.</li>
            <li>The scent of the product is faint and pleasant.</li>
            <li>I previously was using the more expensive Lucene eye day creams which was delightfully rich and alleviated dryness but almost made my eyes look visibly more tired.</li>
            <li>When i use those high end very rich eye creams, I will have little white bumps under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It does not irritate my very sensitive skin at all and it absorbs into my skin completely.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my forehead and upper lip line in combination with the Hyaluronic Acid serum which is hands down my favorite of all the InstaNatural products.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it with patience for the last 3 months to see if it would make any positive difference</li>
            <li>My results actually make me question the overwhelmingly positive reviews on this site.</li>
            <li>The cool feeling on application is wonderful and kicks those tired looking eyes in the behind!</li>
            <li>have put this product really close to my eyes since I was trying to cover the entire bottom dark circle under my eye and sometimes it gets in my eyes but does not burn which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my dark circles have gotten significantly lighter, they haven&#x27;t gone away</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It helps significantly with the puffiness under my eyes and in combination with InstaNatural Eye Serum, it has lessened my dark circles.</li>
            <li>But other than that, The gel feels cool when applied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used other night creams that claim to do this, but those seem to leave a burning sensation, this is simply cool and tight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wrinkles have gotten much better, the puffiness is gone and I only have slight darkness in two area under my eyes.</li>
            <li>My eyes look much less puffy, skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I did not expect to see such a big difference so quickly.</li>
            <li>Skin is tight and smooth.</li>
            <li>As with many serums, this one does need a few minutes to be fully absorbed and will feel sticky if you don’t wait long enough to put on your makeup after using</li>
            <li>I had some dry skin that kept peeling off right at my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few weeks now and it does minimize fine lines.</li>
            <li>It works on my puffed eyes and eases my dried fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t see a ton of difference from it other than my dark circles</li>
            <li>eye gel is thick, clear and has a pleasant hardly detectable fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I use it both under my eyes and especially to help tighten and smooth the loose skin under my eyebrows/above my lids.</li>
            <li>After only using the product for about a month, I noticed a large improvement in the condition of the skin beneath my eyes.</li>
            <li>I guess this works only on certain skins types.</li>
            <li>It was a bit tight so she suggest that you go up to the next size if you arent sure.</li>
            <li>Large size bottle considering it only is under her eyes.  </li>
            <li>I also put a little on my forehead to smooth out wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I have seen greater results with this in a few weeks, than with months of consistent usage of other products.</li>
            <li>I never would have believed that a product with most if not all of  todays &amp;#34;trendy miracle ingredients&amp;#34; could cost so little compared to the $200 products that have only one or two of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>, I just noticed the under eye area looking different and a little bit better than before applying.</li>
            <li>Easier to use than the last one I tried and seems to do a little better reducing puffiness around the lower eye areas.  </li>
            <li>but it really isn&#x27;t a big deal to put a little lotion on top.</li>
            <li>now will update review later once I use product a little more</li>
            <li>This dried out the skin around my eyes so much that it actually accentuated my fine lines.</li>
            <li>OK product - a little sticky to use under makeup so using it at night only</li>
            <li>You can see results rather quickly from this product compared to a lot of other products that are supposed to reduce puffiness.</li>
            <li>As far as the consistency goes, it&#x27;s similar to a gel shaving cream, but maybe a little more lightweight.</li>
            <li>First, it does not produce allergic reactions (I am a sensitive skin), secondly it reduces the large bags, but bags will not completely disappear.</li>
            <li>Made my under  eye Sticky, not worth the price, it doesn&#x27;t work, why positive reviews ??!!</li>
            <li>huge downfall is/was the fact that it came in messy as hell.</li>
            <li>I did see straight away, even after the first use, was a lessening of the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clear and unscented.</li>
            <li>twin 10 year old twin daughters, a 22 month old daughter and a 3 month old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I really like the consistency of this product and noticed the dark circles really evaporating!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m clearly sold.</li>
            <li>I eat organic so my skin is clear, but father time was taking a toll on my eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear and absorbs almost immediately.</li>
            <li>doesnt work another con stay clear</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it was cheap, the reviews were good, and I really hate going to the mall.</li>
            <li>It doesn’t have a smell and is clear.</li>
            <li>It is clear</li>
            <li>This is a clear gel</li>
            <li>I am 51 years old, male,  work too much</li>
            <li>InstaNatural Eye Cream is a clear gel that is to be used to fight the signs of aging.  </li>
            <li>I was kinda surprised because I almost never do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is also reasonable, so that will keep me coming back too.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Takes about 2 months to really notice difference, but patience it the key with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and so far no results whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I used to have really noticeable bags under my eyes and have been looking for a product that actually works.</li>
            <li>Its also all NATURAL.</li>
            <li>So I would keep on using the gel at least around my eyes for sure</li>
            <li>This really works to lessen puffiness and leave your face overall smoother and softer.  </li>
            <li>I would even go so far as to say my skin has</li>
            <li>I like natural ingredients used for this product.  </li>
            <li>I am using the whole line of facial products from InstaNatural and seeing quite a difference.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combination skin and no irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Get ready to give the skin around your eyes that extra boost!</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the results in what it did for my undereye puffiness.</li>
            <li>30 days into it, no noticeable effect thus far.</li>
            <li>It really hasn&#x27;t done anything, but it hasn&#x27;t given me a rash either, so I guess my verdict for this product is a solid &amp;#34;Meh&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fits my skin and soft</li>
            <li>So far, I see results in the color (darkness) of the circles under my eyes...</li>
            <li>NOT HARSH AT</li>
            <li>but so far, my skin feels amazing.llulite lotion.</li>
            <li>am in my early 30s</li>
            <li>Noticed considerable change in puffiness after about three to four weeks.  </li>
            <li>No cream or eye gel is going to completely get rid of your crows feet and puffiness--</li>
            <li>But it is still a bit early.</li>
            <li>It took about a week of dedicated use to make them completely disappear</li>
            <li>I had yo stop because I was sensitive to some ingredient</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 25 yrs old, I&#x27;m not struggling with wrinkles, but his product gives me the appearence that I do.</li>
            <li>I am looking brighter eyed every day, even though I am still the rundown mother of an almost two year old.  </li>
            <li>nothing will stop old age</li>
            <li>So far, A+, let&#x27;s see if this keep working.</li>
            <li>That purple/gray darkness has faded almost completely.</li>
            <li>This has really been the only product that has worked for my eye puffiness.</li>
            <li>Thus far my wrinkle lines are getting finer.</li>
            <li>You may be very pleasantly surprised like I was.  </li>
            <li>I am 63 years old and</li>
            <li>Work very well for me and last quite a while.</li>
            <li>There is only so much you can do as you age.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 26 yrs old</li>
            <li>I will not recommend this product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, this is not a fragranced product.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy on the skin</li>
            <li>Plus I look for all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>were so far out of my price range</li>
            <li>but it really gets the puffiness out.i especially like</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Probably because it&#x27;s a natural scent as opposed to man-made.</li>
            <li>Inferior to professional grade creams.</li>
            <li>So far, I like how this feels on my baggy eyes.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that it worked</li>
            <li>However the second time I bought the product, and started using it, it caused burning, itching, flakey skin and my eyes are VERY puffy and irritated.</li>
            <li>I am going to order second bottle thanks I recommend</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t cause any issues for me at all.</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase this product and appreciate the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>So much so that I&#x27;ve decided to apply it to my entire face.</li>
            <li>The product goes far.  </li>
            <li>nothing to much as to make you hesitant to use this product again just enough to let you know</li>
            <li>for the formula, my sensitive eyes didn&#x27;t even seem to notice I had it on.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference and this stuff cakes up near the corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li>One pump is enough for the whole face, not just eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Soft?</li>
            <li>* Very slight brightening of skin (fresher look) and reduction in fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>the natural ingredients contained, as opposed to harmful</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised..</li>
            <li>Completely reccomend this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they will go away completely since I have them by genetics.</li>
            <li>so far I have yet to find an eye cream that made any difference.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>I am 56 years old.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several and they haven&#x27;t really done what they claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever used after trying dozens, that truly works for puffiness, circles, lines, and makes my eyes look very youthful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised.  </li>
            <li>It did not firm or plump my skin around the eye area</li>
            <li>Got it yesterday and so far no change.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>/&gt;It didn&#x27;t work for people with sensitive skin like me</li>
            <li>As far as the product and if works I don&#x27;t know yet, after using it for awhile</li>
            <li>I have been using this eye cream for 6 weeks now; no results so far.</li>
            <li>I have tried different eye creams with massage my eye area to eliminate them but they are really stubborn.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and protected from the elements all day.</li>
            <li>so I was definitely surprised.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve seen some results.</li>
            <li>like this product so much that when I reordered, I purchased an extra to give to my sister!</li>
            <li>Works well so far.</li>
            <li>I am a mom of a 4 year old and</li>
            <li>let it try completely before applying any face creams or makeup over it.</li>
            <li>not irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Really would like to get my money back....</li>
            <li>- I did try it on the crease between my eyebrows (the one you get from frowning a lot) and it is now completely gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far this product has made my skin just feel healthier.</li>
            <li>, I received a follow up email enquiring about my impress thus far.  </li>
            <li>and I did notice a marked change, but I will continue to use it</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate or aggravate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Surprised.</li>
            <li>I am 23 years old</li>
            <li>I am surprised that the directions for this gel says to apply to the eye, four head, and cheek areas...  </li>
            <li>but so far I think it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>so I could have that extra cooling effect and it worked out very well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also a natural product.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>and wow.  </li>
            <li>So far I do like this gel.  </li>
            <li>I hope this company goes far because they can be a model for</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and had no reactions when I used it.</li>
            <li>I remember my Mom pointing this out to me when I was 16 years old.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>so far no sign of improved at all.</li>
            <li>Nothing so far</li>
            <li>I am 45 yrs old and this product helps me keep youthful skin.</li>
            <li>I really like that I can instantly feel the product working.</li>
            <li>I can really see a difference in the crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes and also the sagging upper lid.</li>
            <li>but I have to for all those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I used it for two months straight and the bags got bigger and the circles were not improved.</li>
            <li>, as far as results go, I did notice that the saggy part under my eye has faded a bit, which is why I&#x27;m giving this review a 3 star.</li>
            <li>and I always get about twice as much product as I feel necessary.</li>
            <li>The gel is so gentle that I use it on my entire face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I am 50 years old and people have asked me what cream I am using.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but so far I give it</li>
            <li>WOW  </li>
            <li>Oh yes, my eyes don&#x27;t seem to be old and</li>
            <li>I just happened to try this because I am a frequent Amazon customer and searched eye creams and the eye gel</li>
            <li>I like it so far.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still early</li>
            <li>I expect any eye product I use to help me wake to eyes not so old and weathered looking.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am completely amazed.  </li>
            <li>do not waste your time or money</li>
            <li>My face is extremely sensitive to products.</li>
            <li>(no need to wear makeup when the only people seeing you are two and could give really give a you-know-what).</li>
            <li>I will complete a review when I see results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I have sensitive eyes.)</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t completely make the darkness disappear, but it did help lighten and brighten my eye area.</li>
            <li>so far, I can tell after I have applied as it makes my skin tighter.</li>
            <li>I am 48 years old and have noticed that my skin is lacking elasticity and radiance.  </li>
            <li>Of course your mileage may vary, she must have been allergic to one of the ingredients, and of course the word natural in the name means nothing</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and no sensitivity at all to the gel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is some overall improvement after about a week, but not so much after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Second bottle for me and really like this product.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the first time I used it, can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results</li>
            <li>So far I see no difference.</li>
            <li>My under eye wrinkles are almost completely gone...</li>
            <li>do not waste your money on this item.</li>
            <li>I will update this review in about a month after I have been using it longer and let you know about how it does as far as my wrinkles are concerned.  </li>
            <li>It really lifts my upper eye area.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product from Insta Natural</li>
            <li>He likes that it&#x27;s made from natural products and it didn&#x27;t cause his skin or eyes irritation.  </li>
            <li>This hasn&#x27;t really helped my specific eye problems, sometimes it stings the skin.</li>
            <li>Could be do to sensitive skin.. or reaction to ingredients.</li>
            <li>Its Insta Natural Eye Gel.</li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes is sensitive and this product has no burn at all, not even a tingle.</li>
            <li>If your skin is sensitive then this is the eye gel for you.</li>
            <li>well maybe my skin is too sensitive?</li>
            <li>and it did not bother my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I put some of the gel around my eyes and I felt a firming action with this.</li>
            <li>a 51 year old guy is the reason I didn&#x27;t see any change.</li>
            <li>Its too early to see any improvements with wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This moisturizes her skin and makes it feels soft.</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue using this and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It had no harsh smell that hurt when I put it by my eyes.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin feel soft, refreshed, and taught.</li>
            <li>I go to bed early and get up early.</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin you may feel a bit of a sting.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>However, seller honored return policy and like that it has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>NOT heavy or sticky.  </li>
            <li>and so far I&#x27;ve had no problems.</li>
            <li>I tried the Eye Gel and after only one week I could see that my eye area is more firm and plump.</li>
            <li>The gel is thick and goes smoothly with ease absorbing</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t get to use the product long enough to determine if its claims hold true.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, and you can apply makeup on top in a few short minutes.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had quite a bit of sleep over the last few days, but my eyes look much better.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money and invest in something that actually works, even if more pricey.</li>
            <li>It also softens and hydrates the eye area, making those fine lines much less apparent.  </li>
            <li>The good reviews must be fake.  </li>
            <li>It is not too expensive and makes me feel good.</li>
            <li>, you don&#x27;t need very much at all so the bottle lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li>I wish it wasn&#x27;t so runny in terms of consistency but other than that it is pretty decent and my skin seems to like it.</li>
            <li>And while I can&#x27;t say it really got rid of the dark circles, it did seem to brighten up my eye area and make them a bit less noticible and much more refreshed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used some of the more expensive brands and thought I&#x27;d try this for the right price</li>
            <li>but later that night, the skin under my right eye started to turn red too.</li>
            <li>I experimented and applied only around my right eye and observed zero difference with my left.</li>
            <li>And buy sticky, I mean like after a hour or more after I applied it.</li>
            <li>Though there are many moisturizer creams, serums, and gels on the market they vary in the ability to perform, likely due to skin type and overall health condition of a well hydrated person.</li>
            <li>I apply the eye gel first and allow it to dry and then apply the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>it is a small pump bottle that can be easily tossed into an over night bag and taken along on trips or placed neatly in you vanity or bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li>Mine aren&#x27;t super dark</li>
            <li>The gel feels cool and slightly tingly after application, sensations which go away after a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is a slight cool</li>
            <li>Originally I purchased this eye gel for my husband who has very dark under eye circles and bagginess.  </li>
            <li>It diminishes fine lines and definitely decreases bags and dark circles.  </li>
            <li>Definitely works for dark circles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>I actually am going to get a bottle for my mother in law, this should be in every young women and older women’s beauty cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually am going to get a bottle for my mother in law, this should be in every young women and older women’s beauty cabinet.  </li>
            <li>It was super cooling and made my puffiness go down.</li>
            <li>Luckily the hives are going down now, but this cream will be going in the trash.</li>
            <li>Also, I was at my salon and when I looked in the mirror I was shocked at how good my under eyes looked!  </li>
            <li>Not only is the package HUGE for an eye gel - a teeny tiny bit can go a long way.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>Also, little goes a long way and make sure if you use ANY type of eye creams, you dab it, not slide or massage it.</li>
            <li>The only fly in the ointment is that the dispenser sometimes sticks - and the process of getting it unstuck usually results in wasted product.</li>
            <li>Since using this eye gel the darkness has faded drastically and I pretty much have no puffiness anymore despite the fact that my kids let me get little rest.</li>
            <li>As far as under eye wrinkles go, i have actually noticed a small difference, but more than anything I feel like i&#x27;m prventing wrinkles by using this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using a wet washcloth with hot water but that only does so much.  </li>
            <li>Been using this for a few months, haven&#x27;t seen any significant results.</li>
            <li>Let me begin by saying that I am 28 years old and have had some fairly noticeable under eye circles for the past few years.</li>
            <li>Being an older lady with very sensitive and dry skin, especially around my eyes, I found this eye gel very soothing and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Honestly didn&#x27;t see any dramatic change or improvement</li>
            <li>I mentioned that I did not see any diminishing of fine lines and wrinkles, and was told that it usually takes about 2 months to see a difference.  </li>
            <li>Seriously works magic.</li>
            <li>Try it first before you opt for a more expensive eye gel/creme.</li>
            <li>Whatever the case, as the years past, I’ve tried so many different products in hopes to try to reduce the puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I felt and looked ten years older.</li>
            <li>As we get older there is not enough we can do to help our eyes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how quickly this product begins to make improvements and you can&#x27;t beat the price- so much less than department store eye gels.</li>
            <li>I really believe this product does help with puffiness but don&#x27;t really see a difference with dark circles.  </li>
            <li>The product&#x27;s primary purpose is to be used under and around your eyes to diminish dark circles, wrinkles, and improve the overall appearance of your eye area.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change the first few days.</li>
            <li>I have tried several times to find a way to open the container to perhaps scrape the extra off my finger back into the bottle, but I haven&#x27;t been able to get it open.  </li>
            <li>I will keep using it as a part of my normal skin routine until it is out, but will probably go back to my old faithfuls.</li>
            <li>I stay up late and get some major dark circles this has reduced them greatly with daily use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent enough basic moisturizer but because the misleading advertising and high price tag</li>
            <li>The product is very easy to use and according to my husband it does help with tired eyes.  </li>
            <li>My eyes get very puffy overnight and the gel really helps bring down the puffiness</li>
            <li>but I am already using other products right now</li>
            <li>I dont understand how this eye gel has such a high rating.</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue to use it day and night and highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for people who do not want facial products with a chemical smell nor a lot of additives.</li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase from them again and highly recommend both the product and the seller.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product - it won&#x27;t give you back the sleep you missed, but it can help you look refreshed anyway!</li>
            <li>First of all I want to say that I was skeptical about buying this because of all the good reviews and not sure if they were real or not.</li>
            <li>It is fairly light and has a very subtle smell, but except for a tiny cool feelings it provides, I don&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
            <li>The product is priced right and lasts long as you only need a pea size drop for each eye.</li>
            <li>I had been using this gel little more then two weeks and compare to many expensive eye creams</li>
            <li>The product is a lightweight gel that has just the very faintest hint of cucumber scent; nothing strong or irritating.</li>
            <li>While my dark circles haven&#x27;t totally disappeared, they are less visible and my whole face radiates a softer and more even complexion.  </li>
            <li>Instant smoothness, blends into skin completely and very fast, brightens my tired eyes, and smoothed out my fine lines within seconds.</li>
            <li>the next morning, there is a HUGE mess inside the lid.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it for long because well, I didn&#x27;t really need it.</li>
            <li>Apparently, I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought this during a long trip to Vegas because I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be getting much sleep.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I recommend this to anyone seeking products for advanced signs of aging,  </li>
            <li>Take a small amount of the gel with your ring fingers, and lightly dab onto the eye area.</li>
            <li>Seller very helpful when I had a minor issue , send replacement....</li>
            <li>It has a natural cucumber scent that is barely there</li>
            <li>I am 41 years old and was starting to look older around the eyes but after using this for 3-4 months, look much more awake and definitely a slight reduction too in dark circles.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you experience puffiness or dark circles.</li>
            <li>No dark circles or puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Messed me up enough to write reviews when I normally don&#x27;t write reviews at all.</li>
            <li>I only use it on my eyes, though it says to also put on forhead and cheeks, my eyes don&#x27;t have that tired look anymore, the dc are getting lighter and it&#x27;s much firmer around my eyes, love it,</li>
            <li>I have no dark circles or puffiness.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I found the INSTANATURAL EYE CREAM FOR DARK CIRCLES, PUFFINESS, WRINKLES, AND BAGS to be quite effective and would recommend it to anyone looking to get rid of dark circles, puffiness, wrinkles, or bags around their eyes.</li>
            <li>So cool and hydrating without being heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this eye cream for approximately one month and have found it to be just as good as the more expensive eye creams.  </li>
            <li>All it seems to do it cool the skin for few mins</li>
            <li>I have always had super dark under eyes!</li>
            <li>Seems to calm down puffiness</li>
            <li>Lift, Firm, Tighten Facial Skin and Fade Fine Lines - 1.5oz]]  </li>
            <li>Gently pat it around the eye area and if there is extra, smooth it above brow line and over the small area between the brows which is prone to hold wrinkles.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much so this container lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li>I do recommend it to those looking to try something new that actually works!</li>
            <li>I will now have to get used to my new face - because I look very different!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit &amp; Planet&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;</li>
            <li>Truly a miracle product, especially for this night owl who started a new job that begins at 6am.</li>
            <li>gravity has lowered them to a new low.</li>
            <li>This is more of a softening effect and an improvement of the overall texture of the delicate eye area.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve used it long enough to really see any measurable results, but I think as I keep using it, I&#x27;ll see something!</li>
            <li>Only draw back is that often pump out to much of the gel, but</li>
            <li>People think I&#x27;m in my early to mid 30s, but lately I&#x27;ve noticed an area under my left eye near the top of my cheek that looks &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Especially the thinner, more delicate skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>so that meant can&#x27;t hide white flakes on my under eye bag as much as like female (can&#x27;t make up as like</li>
            <li>Now I have no darkness whatsoever under my eyes, my eyes look even younger and this product just makes me feel like I&#x27;m really nourishing my skin and preventing any of those issues from developing in the future.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural product comes as a clear gel and has a nice faint cucumber scent.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, with the pump it is easy to control the amount you need each time.</li>
            <li>These two came in packages similar to the store and was very professional.  </li>
            <li>At this rate, they will be gone before I use up this single reasonably priced container.</li>
            <li>Stress lack of sleep and health have caused the dark circles under my eyes to become even more noticeable over the last few months and as a result I have started to look much older and sickly/tiered</li>
            <li>No other product I have tried came even close.</li>
            <li>In addition to major discoloration under the eyes, I also have puffiness and this does help somewhat to decrease that.  </li>
            <li>I suspect one would need to use this product continuously and long-term for any major changes to be noticed.</li>
            <li>All the products are plumping (firming) and they compliment each other very well!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much of a problem with dark circles unless I stay up way too late for many nights in a row...</li>
            <li>The pump dispenses a little more than needed but other than that would recommend</li>
            <li>Will continue using to see if a major difference happens.</li>
            <li>Definitely keeps the area hydrated and my makeup goes on seamlessly over it!</li>
            <li>and i see a major differences.</li>
            <li>Item stung a bit when first put on and as other describe the does &amp;#34;pile&amp;#34; and leave a sticky residue.</li>
            <li>pump provides a generous amount of gel with a full pump; if using this around your eyes, a half pump is likely sufficient.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my under eyes feeling tight and fresh.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER- as a new mom with horrible bags and dullness not to mention a lifetime of sensitive skin and periodically stress-induced adult acne, it is a HUGE achievement for a product to not irritate my skin while simultaneously making it feel amazing.</li>
            <li>One pump supplies more than enough gel for a single application, so maybe just press the pump down half-way to make the quantity last longer.</li>
            <li>so I will continue to use it, and the bottle is huge, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I wish it had worked on my dark circles a little better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this at night only right now because I have some other eye product I need to use up.  </li>
            <li>It also would cause little red bumps if it was absorbed anywhere near my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple months, but it goes on smoothly, need very little</li>
            <li>In general I found this product to be somewhat helpful in regard to skin tone issues and puffiness under the eyes.</li>
            <li>I generally have problems with eye creams-</li>
            <li>It is also a very generous amount and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>It is clear and thinner than another gel I&#x27;ve used with similar ingredients (I like that one also).  </li>
            <li>Very soothing application that feels cool on tired under eye area.</li>
            <li>If I say one request, product with clear bottle otherwise you can not tell how much is left.</li>
            <li>The gel itself goes on smoothly and only requires a small squirt to cover under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The only thing this gel hasn&#x27;t done is clear up my under eye circles, but it has improved the tone a bit.</li>
            <li>After all, I had been using it for over a month, but when I decided to test by not using it for a couple days, by the second day my eyes were clear.</li>
            <li>I use contacts so I am constantly tugging and pulling at the sensitive area around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I was told by a lady that I should try some eye cream because old age is starting to catch up to me.</li>
            <li>If a zit got popped, it used to take up to 5-7 days for it to completely heal, but once you apply this, it only takes a day or two.</li>
            <li>My review is based on nearly 4 weeks daily usage.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Have not seen a big differrence so far; have been using it for a while now.</li>
            <li>I am a 60 year old male and when people took pictures of me it looked like my eyes are shut now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 66 years old and have lived with under eye bags for several years, considering surgery.  </li>
            <li>But I barely notice any improvement.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to using it all the way to my upper eyelashes as I never go that far with anything since lotions, etc.</li>
            <li>I am 69 years old and have big puffy, purple bags under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like that it is all natural ingredients, and they offer a 100% money back guarantee.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought 3 eye creams and facial creams so far</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even work without every 8th person asking me why I&#x27;m not in class and questioning if I&#x27;m old enough to sell cigarettes.</li>
            <li>As I mentioned I have only been using these products for three weeks, and it is recommended that you use them for two months before you see complete results.  </li>
            <li>I honestly never expected them to accommodate me the way that they did.</li>
            <li>Started using the cream for 3 weeks I have not noted much different As far as wrinkle/ lifting go.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it too because it&#x27;s not a heavy cream which I don&#x27;t like using, especially during the sticky summer months.</li>
            <li>BTW, i actually got the idea for putting it all over the face and neck from another reviewer, she said it made her skin soft.</li>
            <li>Works well with my bare minerals makeup.  </li>
            <li>I am 37 years old and am starting to see bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Left my skin soft.</li>
            <li>They might be developed by different teams...</li>
            <li>and I barely notice it.</li>
            <li>Really upset i  spent money on this</li>
            <li>I have used a whole bottle now and have noticed minimal results.</li>
            <li>I really have not really seen a difference under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 42 year old female and have been using this product for a week now.</li>
            <li>and I was starting to look old.  </li>
            <li>I am 46 years old and battle daily with under eye bags.  </li>
            <li>Since using this product, the circles and rings under my eyes have diminished considerably and I&#x27;ve only been using it for one month.  </li>
            <li>, I get sent tons of products, but Insta Natural actually works!</li>
            <li>and it was completely gone by second week.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference in my dark circles and wrinkles within 3 weeks, and my skin has continued to improve with the consistent use.</li>
            <li>I had pretty baggy eyes that were always puffy and dark.  </li>
            <li>I have the pleasure of being a victim of dark circles, so i was excited to try this product out.</li>
            <li>I’ve tried them all, from the cheapest to the most expensive (well almost the most expensive) with minor results, a lot of frustration, and a drawer full of leftovers.  </li>
            <li>Moderate success with my dark circles</li>
            <li>I have tested quite a few products when it comes to skin care and while I don&#x27;t have too many issues with puffy eyes or dark circles, I do get them from time to time.  </li>
            <li>The puffiness has definitely decreased and I look more wide-eyed, refreshed, and awake in the morning after applying this.  </li>
            <li>I do look more alert and not as tired.</li>
            <li>You get weird looks when you are 27 and  have reasonably nice skin and show up with bags under your eyes on a Tuesday.</li>
            <li>(I laugh a lot) were about half the depth they were and by week 4 they are gone!  </li>
            <li>Bought 3 InstaNatural products, used for 3 days (eye cream, moisturizer, and another serum) and made my perfect skin break out with very painful pimples all over my chin and neck.</li>
            <li>She is an active, troublemaking little buggar that I love to the moon and back.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel tighter, not uncomfortably tight but just enough that I can feel it’s working.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and really small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Insta Natural Under Eye Treatment on the other hand is more like a gel or ointment because it’s thick.</li>
            <li>First off you get so much product in this tube and a little definitely goes a long well.</li>
            <li>I am willing to get cosmetic procedures (botox etc) but not full on general surgery, to refresh my face.</li>
            <li>Notice a difference, it doesn&#x27;t take 20 years off or anything but the skin around my eyes is less puffy and above my eyelids is less droopy and more elastic</li>
            <li>Just a heads up though, you may experience a slight stingy feeling when you first apply it- doesn&#x27;t happen anymore but happened in beginning.</li>
            <li>My normal routine is to wash my face/neck with my Clarisonic in the evenings, apply NuFountain&#x27;s C20+Lightening vitamin C serum, allow that to dry and then use this eye gel.  </li>
            <li>two detriments are (a) it stings a little; I have pretty sensitive skin and that part of your face is very fragile, so</li>
            <li>The eye gel has minimized the fine lines around my eyes and around my lips enough that I now don&#x27;t feel the need for fillers, at least at this time.</li>
            <li>I hope to see lighter dark circles after a few more months of use, but within a month, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed and felt a difference in the texture of my skin</li>
            <li>There were no first day results to mention however after just two or three days of using this product I did see very noticeable results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dozens of other products that ranged from very pricey &#x27;high-end&#x27; brands to cheaper &#x27;low-end&#x27; brands.</li>
            <li>I use other products from the InstaNatural line, and I think all of them combined together have really helped my skin.</li>
            <li>I also found that no matter how little I used, the product left my eyes looking greasy even after it fully absorbed.</li>
            <li>Applied everyday as directed, noticed no signs of improvement, felt my face a little more moist that&#x27;s about it</li>
            <li>I would invest a little more money and get something that works, and don&#x27;t waste your time (or money) on this product.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve been using a little extra for between my eyes and in my smile lines.)</li>
            <li>The puffiness goes away instantly, the dark circles are looking better everyday.</li>
            <li>Right after you apply it, there is a faint cucumber-ish scent which is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping InstaNatural will keep manufacturing this gel for the next 20 yrs because I will sure be buying it for at least that long!</li>
            <li>I am finally looking well rested and refreshed even though I&#x27;m the complete opposite with my newest addition to the family</li>
            <li>THANKFULLY the only eye issues I have (which developed only this year) is bags and puffiness</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s the only product I have bought that actually works!</li>
            <li>At first you may feel that the result is just the drying of the gel that is contracting the bags and dark circles, but it persists and improves on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>One person actually didn&#x27;t recognize me and later told me she was thinking, &amp;#34;Who is that young women?&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I’ve spent much of my adult like working shift work, plus I’m a busy mother and freelancer.</li>
            <li>I noticed that I was starting to get puffy eyes and dark circles along with the first signs of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>My dark circles almost exactly the same as it was from the beginning.</li>
            <li>im a 26yr old african american and</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this stuff, but it burned my eyes like crazy.  </li>
            <li>I can apply powdered bronzer on top and it never flakes like some reviewers mentioned - you really only need a THIN layer.</li>
            <li>It really does help your skin look less tired and more youthful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not as moisturizing as some eye creams but is a gel and does not dry out the skin either.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, after 3 days, I developed a severe allergic reaction, causing a rash on most of my body.  </li>
            <li>reference, I&#x27;m 39 and starting to notice the tired eyes showing up more often.</li>
            <li>I have bought so many eye creams to try and decrease eye puffiness and an overall tired look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been a week so not sure of the long-term benefits, but eye area feels cool, toned and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>My face, and especially under my eyes, are so firm and plump, this is well worth your money...</li>
            <li>I think this product would work to resolve certain issues, but i think the cause of my dark circles aren&#x27;t something that this product can fix.  </li>
            <li>My eyes certainly show it with dark circles and puffiness, which I’ve sought a solution for years.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it - he has seen major improvements in over 2 - 3 weeks with daily use</li>
            <li>I used it consistently for a little over two months before giving up on it.</li>
            <li>I would use this all over my face if I had really thin, sensitive skin - or if I had really oily skin and didn&#x27;t want an oil-based serum sitting on top of an oil slick.  </li>
            <li>, if not for the entire face.&lt;br /&gt;It feels cool when applied and smells like cucumber, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I see less fine lines and less under eye circles.</li>
            <li>After applying the first time at night, when you wake up the next morning, you can see your eyes will be less puffy than if you didn&#x27;t use the InstaNatural Eye Gel.</li>
            <li>but when you let it dry and put concealer on, it goes back to normal.</li>
            <li>Hard to compare to other brands, but have been pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>and I find it hard to say which is better than the other.</li>
            <li>My under-eye area is noticeably (by feel and to the naked eye) more firm and overall less tired-looking.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really know about dark circles because i don&#x27;t have them.</li>
            <li>really helped with my dark circles and blemishes on my cheeks too.</li>
            <li>for the dark undereye circles and wrinkles, I have not seen much improvement in those aspects yet.</li>
            <li>Cannot really comment on the dark circles as that has not been an issue.</li>
            <li>Did nothing for my medium dark circles very dissapointed</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much of a difference yet in the dark circles.  </li>
            <li>It is working very well to conceal under eye bags and dark circles.</li>
            <li>It really works and the dark circles desappear.</li>
            <li>really like the way it soothes my eyes, and reduces the look of my dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li>It really improves my dark circle or eye puff.</li>
            <li>the bags, dark circles and lines are much diminished.</li>
            <li>but I do not think it is making much of a difference to my dark circles.</li>
            <li>and it pretty much gets dissolved into my dark circles after a few minutes</li>
            <li>This cream really works to reduce under eye puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t seen too much of a difference in the dark circles.</li>
            <li>They have included in this product, absolutely everything on the market that targets dark circles, puffiness, wrinkles, bags and &amp;#34;sorry looking&amp;#34; eyes and skin.</li>
            <li>It Really helps her dark circles.</li>
            <li>I have dark circles my whole life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to see what it can do in a month or so for the dark spots under and around my eyes.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really work teak of my dark circles</li>
            <li>It really does tighten and remove dark circles.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a problem with dark circles</li>
            <li>My under eyes get puffy in the morning from sleep and my dark circles are intense.</li>
            <li>This product really does help improve the looks of dark circles</li>
            <li>I may not actually be tired, but if I have dark circles under my eyes, it just makes me appear that way.</li>
            <li>This eye cream is really helping my dark circles go away.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I have dark circles or puffiness really.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really notice a difference with the dark circles or puffiness.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to alleviate the dark circles under my eyes, which I don&#x27;t feel like have been all that improved.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t done much for my dark circles</li>
            <li>My whole family has dark circles under our eyes, from my mother to my kids.</li>
            <li>In the beginning I was applying it only around eyes, but since i ran out of my other face cream, i decided to use the gel for the whole face and even the neck area.</li>
            <li>A very generous sized bottle compared to other products on the market with similar ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything I have listed above is not only the products that I have tested, but that is my complete daily skin care and hair care regimen.  </li>
            <li>I am 32 years old and started seeing minor wrinkles underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this for long, but I like it so far</li>
            <li>Apparently the word is out across the entire www that it was me.</li>
            <li>This product burned my eyes after putting it on consistently for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received and reviewed a few facial skin care products lately that I really liked.  </li>
            <li>When applied in large quantity it can feel really sticky like glue for a long time, so I use very little gel to cover my face and allow it to absorb after that I moisturize with my regular cream.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I have large bags under eyes and I have noticed a slight difference.  </li>
            <li>I believe part of the reason it was not effective is due to the very light consistency of the gel; it&#x27;s just not substantial enough to do much.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>recommendation is, if you do not mind stickiness for a few minutes and want to get rid of fine lines and dark circles give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A plump is always too much, and I have to press it all the way down to get the product out.</li>
            <li>Only been using a short time so hard to tell, but think this could work.&lt;br /&gt;I received free for review only.</li>
            <li>I like to be realistic, no matter what the other reviews said.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to putting this on every morning, the shading under my eye slowly improved from a full under circle around my eye to a half moon shape of darkness.</li>
            <li>eyes were certainly hydrated, as well as a reduction in my dark circles, but a small amount was left on the side of my nose and right under my tear duct.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen a significant difference in the dark circles but there is a slight difference.</li>
            <li>Love this product , I fell and hit my head this past year which has resulted in very dark circles under eyes, puffiness</li>
            <li>Highly recommend,  Time will tell on the wrinkle and other improvements.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and other products by this company.</li>
            <li>given how astronomically high other products with</li>
            <li>A high end product will maybe reach 1000 on occasion, but not this or any other items like this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used other eye cream products from other brands, many of them actually make the skin around my eyes feel dry after couple hours, but instanatural eye gel actually keep the skin moisturized for a long time, which is a plus besides diminishing puffiness!</li>
            <li>and my face seems a little tight but then feels fine, and when I apply this in the morning and want to apply makeup I have to use another lotion</li>
            <li>and so far it seems to be helping with dry skin and puffiness.</li>
            <li>The wrinkles under my eye are much softer and less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Morning and evening I dab the Eye Serum all around my eyes including the lids and let it dry completely.</li>
            <li>After using this product twice-daily for several weeks, I didn&#x27;t see any really noticeable difference in terms of puffiness, dark circles, or anything else.  </li>
            <li>and I am starting to really notice a reduction in the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s really doing anything as far as skin care yet</li>
            <li>It was strange seeing myself like this at first, because I was so use to seeing dark circles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After about 2 months of using Instanatural Eye Gel, the eye area feels plumper and more dewy/moist, the tear trough is shallower and the Niacinamide has lightened a few small sun damaged spots also.</li>
            <li>I do find it easy to use, non irritating, and works well with cover up makeup.</li>
            <li>The product literally glides on and absorbs quickly into the delicate undereye skin.  </li>
            <li>The tiny, little fine lines look softer and less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>The fine line that I was talking about has very obviously gotten smaller and less less deep!!</li>
            <li>Still waiting for the dark circles to disappear completely (probably will at the end of the second month), and my puffiness has disappeared completely.</li>
            <li>give it time, around six to eight weeks to start seeing wonderful results, don&#x27;t expect to see a dramatic change in a few days, that&#x27;s not realistic, but it DOES WORK!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been obsessed with the natural formulate and how totally easy and sanitary the packaging is.</li>
            <li>and I just felt like there had to be less expensive way to good skincare.</li>
            <li>I really does lessen the depth of the wrinkles around the eyes and doesn&#x27;t look tight and drawn.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve also noticed that when I use it under makeup it almost acts as a primer which is neat, but it does make my upper eyelid stick to my face a little right after applying but doesn&#x27;t last long and doesn&#x27;t hurt or anything.</li>
            <li>Easily absorbed even near your delicate eye area!</li>
            <li>Really helped my dark spots!</li>
            <li>I have serious dark circle and after two weeks I can see that is better than before.</li>
            <li>Love it no more dark circles!!</li>
            <li>I had extremely high expectations when I purchased and even though I cannot say my dark circles arent lighter</li>
            <li>I starting using this with little real feeling</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what I expected, but every morning I think that I will go back to my other product, but then by the end of the day, it seems to be better, so I decide to use it again the next day.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s terrific that this little company can make it, thanks to Amazon, in the jungle of cosmetic giants</li>
            <li>only need a little,  I also use it for my jowl lines in my face, I see an improvement there also.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks AJ for products that actually work, feels luxurious, and are really affordable.</li>
            <li>I always read a mix of all reviews before ordering a product and weigh the good against the bad.</li>
            <li>I received a discount for this product in return for my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad.</li>
            <li>This product is a natural 75% organic gel formula that claims to provide &#x27;absolute care to the eye area&#x27; and combats dark dark circles, puffiness,  and sagging skin. </li>
            <li>The only downside I&#x27;ve noticed is that the circles under my eyes ( caused by terrible seasonal allergies) are still pretty apparent, but I&#x27;ve never been able to find anything that really helps with that.</li>

            <li> Been using this product for a couple off weeks, and have been so far impressed with the results on my puffy eyes in the morning.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful and is working great on my dark circles.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say it&#x27;s working better than what I was using.  </li>
            <li> I am 42 years old and want to look my best.</li>
            <li> I honestly think I could do better by researching dieting changes that target the needs that this product claims to meet.</li>
            <li> Will keep using until the product is finished but not vey confident at this point that this product is effective in reducing eye bags</li>
            <li> Looked on amazon and decided to see what what was cheap or had good reviews.</li>
            <li> far I am very impressed with the impact this product has had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a company that offers excellent customer service.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product and the seller.&lt;br /&gt;The eye gel has a nice consistency</li>
            <li> My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product that works, is reasonably priced, and comes with a wonderful guarantee!  </li>
            <li> so far, great!!</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that it does tighten the skin on and around my eyes giving me a more awake look.</li>
            <li> Best eye treatment I have used so far (</li>
            <li> I do not feel that it nicely absorbs into my skin but rather a jelly layer on top on eye skin which dries in the morning, leaving a residue on my face.</li>
            <li> I need to be honest - I don&#x27;t feel overwhelmingly enthralled by this product, but I do like it.</li>
            <li> If not the product kind of peels off of my face like its not soaking into my skin but forming a layer on top.</li>
            <li> The best product that I have found so far.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it&#x27;s non-irritating,  The ingredients in this eye gel are natural and one of the best combination I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> The best eye product so far.</li>
            <li> I love this product, absolutely amazing....</li>
            <li> Love this gel, its texture is amazing and It softens and hydrates the eye so well.</li>
            <li> but after using this I kind believe it work better cus</li>
            <li> My eyes look nice and healthy</li>
            <li> So far I am LOVING this Eye Gel!!!</li>
            <li> It was nice to apply at night and let it set in to do its magic.</li>
            <li> The product is by far the best that I have used to&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I was expecting this one to be more effective but did not meet my expectations.  </li>
            <li> THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN</li>
            <li> real nice, works fast</li>
            <li> The manufacturer recommends using the product for two months to get full value!!  </li>
            <li> I had my doubts it was helping any, but I figured with all the great reivews, it MUST be doing something, right?  </li>
            <li> My eyes get irritated easily and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this!</li>
            <li> The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love love love it!  </li>
            <li> I am very impressed so far, and feel like this product is a really good step in the right direction!</li>
            <li> InstaNatural is definitely my &amp;#34;Fountain of Youth&amp;#34; I give InstaNatural 5 stars for amazing products and excellent customer service.  </li>
            <li> I have used many eye creams and gels regardless of cost and this one is by far the best!  </li>
            <li> This eye gel is honestly the best facial product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell, like a mild cucumber.</li>
            <li> I just can not tell you enough about this cream------------you will NEED to try it on your own to get the full benefits of it!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not something you should say lightly when you have tried hundreds of creams, but it really is the best eye cream out there!</li>
            <li> I was even more impressed when I received an email from the founder of the product, giving tips and assurance that complete satisfaction was guaranteed.</li>
            <li> Good product, happy with results so far</li>
            <li> The consistency is nice, not sticky and the fragrance is really light and nice too.</li>
            <li> did receive this for free to test out, but this review is honest and 100% my own.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> Great product - fast shipper!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it consistently around my eyes for 5 weeks and have experienced a visible improvement.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I look and feel better which makes me more confident.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever experienced any type of skin allergy.  </li>
            <li> This is another great quality product that really works!  </li>
            <li> As the saying goes, if it seems too good to be true....</li>
            <li> I do recommend this gel, and the price is almost too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I really love the easy application and effectiveness!</li>
            <li> Very attentive.</li>
            <li> Skin looks and feels very smooth and moisture after using..</li>
            <li> So to try some of &amp;#34; everything &amp;#34; to preserve my looks has been very important to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a light, fresh scent - but more importantly, it feels wonderful!</li>
            <li> It has a very light essence, but I didn&#x27;t bother me, I never got an allergic reaction neither my husband.</li>
            <li> and they do not do animal testing or use animal ingredients in this product which is very important to me.</li>
            <li> , it feels very light on your skin.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of this eye cream since it is very light.</li>
            <li> This eye gel  is one of the best products that I have ever tried[  I have tried most of all the top product lines, from  Murad,  Cindy Crawfords, to Perricone, and this is one of the most effective for not only  under the eyes, but for wrinkles on the face and neck as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This spreads nicely and then is easy to cover with make-up or with a night time moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell strong, but it does have a nice scent to it.  </li>
            <li> Hoped it would work great based on all the positive feedback and reviews.</li>
            <li> I have been using Eye Gel for about a month now and am very pleased that those bags have diminished significantly.  </li>
            <li> I love the convenience of the pump to be able to dispense the product and the products feels really good and cool eyes and puffiness</li>
            <li> It shows that the company stands by their products and that satisfying their customers is very important.  </li>
            <li> This Eye Gel has a nice light texture and goes on very smooth.  </li>
            <li> Trying this out has made a huge difference for me!</li>
            <li> By the way, this is a huge bottle!  </li>
            <li> With the combination of both eye gels, I have seen a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to all my girl friends, and they love it too.</li>
            <li> Now my eyes feel more alert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glad I bought the product.</li>
            <li> I got this item for free to try out for a promotion but all my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff  </li>
            <li> it would compress more out of the bottle overnight....</li>
            <li> Egh, I&#x27;ve used better creams.</li>
            <li> I find that it works some days better than others.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> In matter of days my skin looked significantly better.</li>
            <li> And the company is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li> I know as the days go by of using this product it will just fade even more.  </li>
            <li> I have had this product for bit more than three weeks</li>
            <li> ::)</li>
            <li> I felt like my eyes were aging faster than most of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> with this product. :)</li>
            <li> (in fact under eyes look better in my before)&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t say for sure if it is a 5 star product.  </li>
            <li> Love the price!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am pleased that the puffiness has been visibly reduced and feel I look that much better.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have seen noticeable changes around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> more thing</li>
            <li> and I gladly accepted.</li>
            <li> I really love this eye gel and will be buying more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to try more products from this brand soon.</li>
            <li> Probably better than using cucumber slices.</li>
            <li> product was provided free of charge for reviewing purposes in exchange with my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was too sticky for me and it felt like it was making my eye wrinkles even more visible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had better results from this eye gel then the $90 jar of eye cream recommended by a skin renewal dermatologist.</li>
            <li> goes on smooth and absorbs into the skin nicely...</li>
            <li> My favorite thing is that is does have a &amp;#34;cooling sensation&amp;#34; when you put it on.</li>
            <li> I just note that this product was received free for testing purposes, but I am planning to continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say I have seen a huge improvement in undereye puffiness.</li>
            <li> I am assuming that these will take a longer period of time to get better if it does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Company&#x27;s customer service is fabulous!  </li>
            <li> I see why its a top seller.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase and it is the best product I have ever had for eye use.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it perk my face up, it is an excellent cream to put on after a blemish on your skin.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love it and would recommend it to all age groups.</li>
            <li> /&gt;smooth, healthy, hydrated looking skin.</li>
            <li> and my lips look better.  </li>
            <li> the puffy eyes are getting better.</li>

            <li> Love it....</li>
            <li> With out going into explicit detail, most people would like it just giving it a try.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I love this product.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day because I love the results.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>

            <li> THIS IS SUCH A WONDERFUL PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> and I decided to take better care of myself.</li>
            <li> as well once I have a chance to use it more.</li>
            <li> as well once I have a chance to use it more.</li>
            <li> and I have some under eye puffiness/bags mostly in the morning.  </li>
            <li> that is my last purchase of products on Amazon with 2000-3000 reviews and headlines with words like &amp;#34;the best &amp;#34; or #1.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product, and I think you would too!</li>
            <li> Now, my eyes are my favorite part of my face.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Definitely the best under eye product I have used.</li>
            <li> I guess it works for most people, but I&#x27;m one of those that doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service is KEY!</li>
            <li> glad I purchased this because I immediately noticed results after like a week.</li>
            <li> but they are way better.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve heard how refreshing cucumber slices feel.  </li>
            <li> This eye gel is doing a lovely job at soothing out the puffiness around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend paying more for a better quality product.</li>
            <li> with this product. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many eye treatments over the years.  </li>
            <li> Takes the  puffiness away :)</li>
            <li> I do not get the puffiness and most eye products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d make sure you do your research and understand the cause of your eye issues before purchasing products like this.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin,  just sits on top of the skin.</li>
            <li> I top of.</li>

            <li> and my eyes will look better and better.</li>

            <li> Better price and better results.</li>
            <li> this was sent to me free to offer a honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I wonder if they pay for the reviews so they end up with more 4 and 5&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Love it..</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many creams over the years without any results and just gave up and used concealer.</li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now been able to use this product for a week</li>
            <li> so I applied it one more time before bed (it burned).</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, so</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> The more makeup and concealer</li>
            <li> I use to try and hide them, the more the wrinkles show up.</li>
            <li> I heard that people have seen more results the longer they use it</li>
            <li> , this is refreshing, and it works</li>
            <li> I think the area around my eyes appears to me more &amp;#34;rested&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> so be sure to check the amount when ordering.  </li>
            <li> The company is lovely to deal with.</li>
            <li> My reason for skipping this region is that at my age I need something with more moisture.  </li>
            <li> AND I JUST LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> I will try more to see how it is more better</li>

            <li> I find that if I put it on, and give it a bit of time to work before applying my makeup and heading out for work, it gives much better results.</li>

            <li> My under eye issues are hereditary, and I am looking more towards a derma filler now.</li>
            <li> More a gel than a cream</li>
            <li> this is a $3.00 product being marketed as something more and will not purchase again.</li>

            <li> i&#x27;m glad I took a chance and purchased.</li>

            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> but it seems to be working for most of buyers after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> to hear it may do so even more with continued use.</li>
            <li> :) buy buy buy</li>

            <li> Love this stuff</li>
            <li> I love the texture of it - it&#x27;s more of a gel than a cream</li>
            <li> I love that there is not parabens, sulfates or any alcohol in this product.</li>
            <li> I should have known better.  </li>
            <li> After three days of using this product my skin appeared brighter, more even in tone, and the puffiness under my eyes was drastically reduced.</li>
            <li> I have now used it for two weeks, day and night, and my skin has NEVER looked better.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many bag reducers for my eyes  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a dude) and most don&#x27;t work however,  this one does.  </li>
            <li> I will buy more of this</li>
            <li> I can tell you this: I love how the skin around my eyes are way firmer than they used to be.</li>
            <li> My eyes also seem tighter and more awake</li>
            <li> Will review in a week or so for a better review/opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this product&lt;br /&gt;Help</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering to try one of your facial moisturizers given the excellent results of this gel</li>
            <li> i recommend it and for sure i&#x27;ll gonna buy again.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results either, but they did say most people see results at the two month mark...  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to see more improvement. .</li>
            <li> I do wish there was more in the bottle</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of this eye gel.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having a stressful week or not getting much sleep, this product works great for making you look more alert and</li>
            <li> I am sure it will take awhile to see if it makes a noticeable change.</li>
            <li> This gel is a great moisturizer for your whole face.</li>
            <li> so most creams and lotions give me hives almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I have better results with a Hyaluronic Acid eye cream than this gel.</li>
            <li> Love eye gels, and this one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay $80 as the site indicated</li>
            <li> The results were even better.  </li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I love InstaNatural.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is one of my favorite products I have received for testing purposes from them.</li>
            <li> Okay as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> and this works better already.  </li>
            <li> Since eye issues were years in the making, it might take more time than a month to reduce.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t escape your genes but this stuff definitely makes the best of what you got.</li>
            <li> oh so many .  </li>
            <li> Thank you for being so personal with your replies and making me feel like I matter while making me look good !!</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many eye creams.</li>
            <li> It has a refreshing cucumber scent.  </li>
            <li> My eyes look more awake, and I notice that by the time I am out the door, the puffiness is just about gone.</li>
            <li> I just think some women hide it better than others.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll continue to use it until I find something better.</li>
            <li> Love how it feels on the skin and how it lays under my makeup.</li>
            <li> So glad I found these products.</li>
            <li> and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Uses it every day and can even be applied under her regular makeup.&lt;br /&gt;The best customer service experience</li>
            <li> Most ppl think I am in my 30s. :-)</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW: I was hoping to reduce under eye puffiness with this gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this more than 2 months now</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> my skin is getting better</li>
            <li> Love it ...</li>
            <li> The description says most people see improvement after 8 weeks</li>
            <li> I LOVE this gel...</li>
            <li> That really does create quite a great experience for someone who is just being introduced to a company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s magic to prevent more wrinkles as well --</li>
            <li> I love thisproduct</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel.</li>
            <li> I probably used it 3 X a day, however, which is more than recommended.  </li>
            <li> Most people don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m my age.  </li>
            <li> but I already know I love this product and will reorder it.</li>
            <li> I have seen incredible results with the Eye Gel in my eyes and complete face.  </li>
            <li> and it kinda makes my face look fuller and more plump.</li>
            <li> an okay</li>
            <li> I start getting itchy eyes and felt more line under my eye.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Im  57 and pleased with the results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now going to order more products.</li>
            <li> For 3 more months I used the Eye Serum.</li>
            <li> more dewy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My eyelids have become brighter and more even toned as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was hoping for better results.</li>
            <li> Will try it more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going to give it more time.</li>
            <li> Most eye creams or gels have .5 to 1 oz.</li>
            <li> This has 1.7 fl oz which is comparable to most face care products.</li>
            <li> I am SO glad I did.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what :)</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off using Vaseline or coconut</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I think this gave me more crows feet.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> My colleagues noticed the results on week 3, I was told that I look more rested and youthful.</li>
            <li> and I love it too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how moisturizing it is since it&#x27;s a drier gel, not a goopy cream, but it sure does the job on my puffiness.</li>
            <li> so it was wonderful to find something that actually works!</li>
            <li> People, mostly men, say that I look like 30, and that is a mood booster for any woman.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Eyes just got more puffy....</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I store it in the refrigerator; the added coolness enhances the refreshing effect.  </li>
            <li> Mmm I love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> This really works great.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to do this, but I feel more is better, though I realize this is not always the case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly pleased with the product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is simply fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to inform that this product has made me look more radiant and has made my skin plumper as I use it in my whole face.  </li>
            <li> I am 100% satisfied</li>
            <li> I think i&#x27;m better off drinking tons of water and flushing out the toxins in my body.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be purchasing more of this product.</li>
            <li> eh this product is okay</li>
            <li> I love this product and have noticed a difference in the area around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Use it daily to get the best result!</li>
            <li> Love the texture and silky feel.</li>
            <li> found it interesting that this uses hyaluronic acid, because I&#x27;ve had this substance injected into my knees for joint lubrication.</li>
            <li> Using it once or twice a day, the darkness went from medium (which most folks see on themselves as hideous and disfiguring. . .)</li>
            <li> The puffiness is a bit better, but just a bit.</li>
            <li> Importantly, it does not irritate the eyes, and has no obnoxious scent.i received a sample of this product in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> (Most eye gels burn and cause a rash.)  </li>
            <li> I did get my items for free for a review but have no issue saying when I do not care for a product!</li>
            <li> but this product and its accompanying products do that and more.</li>
            <li> Love the results, I don&#x27;t look like a walking zombie anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But, I also use Watts Hyaluronic Retinol Serums regularly, so I&#x27;m sure that boosts it...</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love every product I have tried from Instanatural.</li>
            <li> These are 100% better.</li>
            <li> I am well pleased and will recommend Youth Express Eye Gel to my friends</li>
            <li> This only validates the care they invest  into making this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Most eye products I have tried irritated my eyes and made them water.  </li>
            <li> Great for my sensitive eyes, and does the job of reducing under eye puffiness Honestly need more time to continue use of product..</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I got this one.</li>
            <li> that it didn&#x27;t burn the eyes or cause me any skin irritations which many products can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He wanted to use something that was safe for around his eyes and would help his eyes look</li>
            <li> for the last two weeks I have noticed an impressive reduction in puffiness and darkness under my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> - I was spending $$$&#x27;s, ok $$$$&#x27;s on products  annually</li>
            <li> Additionally, their customer service is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Wish I had better things to say about it.</li>
            <li> Love this not oily eye gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not gonna buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> OK let&#x27;s give it to more chance</li>
            <li> I love lovr love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for my sensitive skin and it feels good because it&#x27;s cooling.  </li>
            <li> It looks smoother and my eye-shadow goes on much better.  </li>
            <li> I love all of the InstaNatural products I have tried.</li>

            <li> I love having this eye gel in my beauty cupboard, and adding it to beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I got this product for free to try and give my honest opinion on.</li>
            <li> so I can get the make to blend better.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure that is the reason why I have not seen a drastic change.</li>
            <li> Ok I never write reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many products from</li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t wait to try out more of their products.</li>
            <li> so that is why I apply it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed my eyes are more hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Once it runs out, I plan to order more.</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> , i believe it will be better in time/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> this is perfect help to make you look younger</li>
            <li> I feel it removes the puffiness and bags and gives me a more &#x27;alert and awake&#x27; look every day.</li>
            <li> , the product caused my eyes to burn and to become inflamed and even more puffy.</li>
            <li> I tested to make sure it was this product by taking a couple days off then re-using.</li>
            <li> so I need more time to review the product.</li>
            <li> Eyes are looking better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product and would repurchase in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I had a compliment about how good I looked for my age that very day, and this never happens to me any more.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product right out of the shipping box and, aside from the nice cucumber scent, wasn&#x27;t thrilled.</li>

            <li> so I don&#x27;t have many fine lines or signs of age.</li>
            <li> Most of my fine wrinkles are almost gone, and my skin looks tighter too.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t be sure which one of the three has helped with the fine lines.</li>
            <li> More like a gel than a cream, and wear just fine under makeup.</li>
            <li> I got more pronounce fine lines under my eyes</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month, mostly as an eye cream for fine lines.  </li>

            <li> I love this product, I have recommended the InstaNatural The Best Eye Cream For Dark Circles</li>
            <li> I have written a more detailed review on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com.</li>
            <li> and I have def noticed a more smooth surface under/around my eye area as well as brighter smoother skin as I also use on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this refreshing gel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a great all natural product</li>
            <li> Also helps concealer apply more evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> So far I am extremely happy....</li>
            <li> I will report later to see how much more beautiful it makes me.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve done better at looking at at reviews instead of the ingredients (which aren&#x27;t fantastic anyway but for the price</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now as far as the results I have seen in the appearance in my own face I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> the tone is much more smooth and even.</li>
            <li> the price, you do get a lot of product and shipping was free, but I&#x27;ve had much better results from drugstore brands than with this.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my face soft.  </li>
            <li> it makes my skin smooth and better looking</li>
            <li> far, I am happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best money ever spent, and amazon has it the cheapest I could find anywhere.</li>
            <li> It is okay for dark circles but excellent for wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have been happy with all of the products I have tried so far by this company.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not what I expected after reading all the wonderful reviews.  </li>
            <li> This procuct is pretty awesome as far as depuffing the bags under my eyes that I get from insomia.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so happy with this eye gel so far.</li>
            <li> I love the light weight of this eye gel, and sometimes I do apply the eye gel on my face too.  </li>
            <li> As a first time user of this product, I am very pleased with my skin after one month.  </li>
            <li> So far I have found that this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have bought and tried a number of products to help alleviate puffiness, and found that the youth express eye gel has made an incredible difference, even over the last week or so.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural seems to have done its research and turned out a great line of products that are also natural.</li>
            <li> Somehow, I think the gel plumps your skin to create a more smooth appearance.</li>
            <li> it is just so cooling and soothing and more importantly</li>
            <li> did not notice anything great as far as reducing puffy eyes</li>
            <li> And most important drink lots water.  </li>
            <li> I also love the light cooling feeling it had when applied.</li>
            <li> After I read the ingredients, I was amazed at how many incredible and powerful natural items included in this gel...</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many different products and didn&#x27;t see any great results.</li>
            <li> After opening and testing out, I can say that the light cucumber smell is so refreshing</li>
            <li> received this gel complimentary  to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> Which makes the bottle go much faster, but I am already going to stock up, and give some as Christmas gifts because it is that good.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary sample of the eye gel and the opinion and review are my own.</li>

            <li> It is more effective on my morning puffy eyes than any product I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them, plus it softens my crows feet so that they aren&#x27;t nearly as noticeable as they were.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks I saw a huge difference in my eyes.</li>
            <li> Just getting rid of the puffiness though has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I used it for almost 7 weeks but could not tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference within 7 days of using this product.</li>

            <li> it is the perfect consistency for eye gel..not greasy or heavy</li>

            <li> /&gt;Product received free for review purposes</li>
            <li> Any type of cheap cream or lotion makes me break out</li>
            <li> Also, I was really surprised because of all the good reviews I&#x27;ve read about this product.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> This eye treatment is by far the most effective.</li>
            <li> love the fact that this is 100% natural, but the 75% organic kind of threw me.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural products are mostly plant based or natural, but they are also highly effective.</li>
            <li> I have loved the eye cream thus far.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> My circles have lightened significantly and the fine lines have improved as well.  </li>
            <li> Typically, I will never buy something with &#x27;The BEST&#x27; in the title or description because I know it&#x27;s being hyped and that is fully true of</li>
            <li> I love that right after applying this gel I can feel the tightening.</li>
            <li> Right away I saw improvement, but after a couple of weeks the result is even better.  </li>
            <li> After using the &amp;#34;InstaNatural Youth  Express Eye Gel&amp;#34;, I am convinced that most, if not all, of the highly positive reviews are as bogus as the claims the manufacturer makes for their product!</li>
            <li> I am also a makeup wearer and I apply the serum on first before I apply my make up and BOOM!!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use for sure another thumbs up is for the customer service that is great, not only they shipped very fast</li>
            <li> Very nice, cooling, non-irritating gel for both upper and lower eyelids.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s goes on great, feels really soothing, and makes the skin under my eyes look better - more even toned, less wrinkled, and more moisturized.</li>
            <li> Very, very pleased so far!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received this eye gel free for review purposes.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice product that feels nice and cool upon application, so I don&#x27;t mind having to have it as part of my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> Fast absorbing and very lightly scented, kind of a light cucumber scent.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and easily applied evenly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good but really has no noticeable effect on my eyes.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really decrease the bags but nice cool feeling</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, quickly absorbs into skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No other products worked as good as this one.</li>
            <li> This company really cares for its customers buy providing them with effective yet more natural products for safe use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream, and it&#x27;s very reasonable</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping as well as amazing customer service.</li>
            <li> I admit, that when I used it alone, I only experienced mild burning and redness.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and I enjoy the fact that I&#x27;m looking younger.</li>
            <li> I really like InstaNatural products, and this eye gel is super effective.  </li>
            <li> well so far I do notice some change in a short time,InstaNatural make very good products I am definitely pleased with this one</li>
            <li> Hands down a very good product.  </li>
            <li> The best eye cream as far as plant stem ingredients go...noticed huge difference after second application...</li>
            <li> I think it will take more time to see real results!</li>
            <li> Very pleased, so far....</li>
            <li> This is ok, but I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable results even after using consistently for 3 months.  </li>
            <li> It does temporarily make my eyelid sticky in that it makes the eyelid higher and opens the eye more</li>
            <li> Very much worth the price!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this eye gel so far.</li>
            <li> I usually buy creams, so I was very happy to find how well this gel works.</li>
            <li> So excited that I found InstaNatural.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I notice the significant difference it is making when I have forgot to use it even one night--</li>
            <li> When applied, skin feels cool and smooth immediately.</li>
            <li> Such a great product with an impressive list of ingredients like Hyaluronic Acid and Peptide Complex.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth a try!</li>
            <li> - Couldn&#x27;t ask for more, fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I do not think you will see any significant results from this however, I do use it because it has that &amp;#34;cooling effect&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used another brand, with similar ingredients, but this brand gives sooo much more product for the money with same great results!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product 2x a day for nearly 4 weeks and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to see to see the end result.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams and this seems to be the first one that is making a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and I am very satisfied with the results so far.</li>
            <li> I noticed a change within the first couple of days of using this product and it has been getting better ever since.  </li>
            <li> In week long test period, I noticed that puffiness and redness around my eyes was greatly reduced.</li>
            <li> it is worth to spend money on their products!</li>
            <li> Love it firSt day using it</li>
            <li> I am pretty satisfied w/ the eye cream.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money!</li>
            <li> and I can tell that there is a significant change.</li>
            <li> Original review</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even explain it, I just know my entire eye area has undergone a transformation of some kind!</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel is pretty refreshing.</li>
            <li> So, I was excited to try out this eye gel and see how it worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I originally paid 20 bucks</li>
            <li> picture to post because this transformation of my eyes is nothing short of astounding!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it will change anything long term, but I&#x27;m happy to add it to the under eye concealer and brightener.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this about six months ago.</li>
            <li> This is the first thing that worked and I can&#x27;t tell you how pleased I am with the results!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have not seen a significant difference.</li>
            <li> I was excited to offer this product to my mother for her review.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and feels cool to the touch.  </li>
            <li> But I did see definite results at 3 weeks, which is remarkable.  </li>
            <li> After a month&#x27;s use, I have noticed it to be significantly reduced and some mornings, not even there.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if this was making a difference, but I believe it truly has.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Feels cool and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> like the cool and smooth feeling of the gel though.</li>
            <li> so I was hesitant to use it anywhere else, but the ingredient list looked pretty safe</li>
            <li> This one has never bothered my skin and has significantly reduced the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Great product, and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> And it smells so fresh!</li>
            <li> So far, I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t affect my makeup foundation at all, in fact I feel like my foundation went on smoother and more evenly after having put this on first.  </li>
            <li> I will be interested in seeing how much more this will help over time.</li>
            <li> The fine lines are slowly disappearing which is awesome!  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be worth my money since it&#x27;s gotten such great reviews</li>
            <li> It goes on super smooth.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, smells good(!)</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Thanks for Insta Natural great eye gel.</li>
            <li> WOW, ok I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It seems to make  a huge difference rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love how refreshing the Insta Natural Youth Express Eye Gel is.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but perhaps better just as a night moisturizer only.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to go the (mostly) all natural, healthy route for skin care.</li>
            <li> This cooling silky eye gel goes on smooth, and absorbs quickly, leaving my eye area feeling supple and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Verdict: I don&#x27;t think is a miracle product, because I don&#x27;t believe such a thing exists, but I am absolutely impressed with this product so far and cannot wait to see how my skin looks with continued use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;These results fade somewhat and for a night out, clean up and re-application is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I honestly have no idea if it actually did anything for my skin, but it felt so refreshing on my eyes in the morning.</li>
            <li> So, I will continue to use their products and I am confident that I will be very pleased with the long term results.  </li>
            <li> but if your like me in the early stages I say this is a great product to keep you looking fresh and vibrant!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a while to dry, so you&#x27;ll need to be patient, but it does feel good on my skin, very cool and soothing.</li>
            <li> this product is far superior (the serum is great for dark circles however)  </li>
            <li> Glad that it is pretty much fragrance free too!</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye gels for puffiness and dark circles and this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li> The price is great since its right in the middle of drugstore and department brands.  </li>
            <li> I also like the packaging; the pump is easy to use and keeps the product safe, and I particularly like the larger size that provides good value.</li>
            <li> I will say that it feels very silky and very light on your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feels cool and clean on my skin.  </li>
            <li> just clean, cool and tightens the skin.  </li>
            <li> and I will most certainly continue to purchase their products.  </li>
            <li> However, these two are specially designed for under eye.  </li>
            <li> You get a generous amount of product in the large pump and it&#x27;s more sanitary than a mini-pot.  </li>
            <li> So I love that this has a pump (which even is flexible) and there is a large amount of product.</li>
            <li> but, I noticed a difference right away!  </li>
            <li> And, the price is right!</li>
            <li> I was right!</li>
            <li> I could also feel my skin tighten a bit right after application!  </li>
            <li> Great for tightening skin around the eyes, fine lines and dark circles.</li>
            <li> I can hardly wait to use it for 8 weeks like it suggests for best results.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural helped along with the coffee to make me feel more awake and ready to go right away with my kids too!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference right away and in the meantime I had purchased an under the eye cream for fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I do have one smallish fine line under my right eye I&#x27;ve been watching</li>
            <li> It is a gel formula that is very light on the skin and absorbs super fast into the skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle I am using right now is the older look which I liked a lot.  </li>
            <li> but so far, my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Especially to keep the circles from beneath the eyes, or the skin are around bright.</li>
            <li> Applies smoothly with a cool feeling and a fresh scent and tightens up the eye area.  </li>
            <li> Not only was the price great, the personal customer service is amazing.</li>
            <li> Great product at such a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> The darkness is lessened, and my whole appearance is fresher and more youthful.</li>
            <li> It dries really fast. :)</li>
            <li> I paid full price and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> It is cooling, refreshing and works really well.</li>
            <li> absolutely cannot apply powdered makeup on top.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has a light texture and is quickly absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li> but I like how cool it feels on my eyes 👀</li>
            <li> Nice clear face cream.</li>
            <li> plan to order more real soon.</li>
            <li> I most highly recommend that you give them a try!</li>
            <li> I am beyond THRILLED thus far with this product.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels like cool cucumbers.i would buy again.</li>
            <li> It feels comfortable around my eyes even when freshly applied.  </li>
            <li> Loved that even if if he was grossly exaggerating!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have much crepiness under my eyes, yet the skin looks more taut after using for a month.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t gone but the improvement is good enough that I no longer feel upset with the way under my eyes look to me.</li>
            <li> However, when I contacted customer service, they immediately (no questions asked) issued a full refund.  </li>
            <li> so I started using it more often since it really works.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t say enough about this eye gel, it&#x27;s extremely good.</li>
            <li> Its true</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll continue with it everywhere else as I really like how it makes my face feel, but will use something that is much more emollient under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.  </li>
            <li> the cool gel feel..</li>
            <li> The company does state on their website that most customers notice a real improvement after 2 months or so.</li>
            <li> It is soothing and cool feeling.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t seem to have had any good effects, either--that is, to actually reduce puffiness, wrinkles, or whatever.</li>
            <li> For the Price you are not going to be able to find one that&#x27;s got as much going for it as this one has.</li>
            <li> it is 75% organic, its not harsh but its still effective .</li>
            <li> You can read my FULL review by clicking this link  [...]</li>
            <li> Very cooling and moisturizing and the eyes look much better after applying it</li>
            <li> I will keep using this product because I think it needs more than 2 weeks to really judge it</li>
            <li> For those who wants more moisture go with eye cream not eye gel.</li>
            <li> This is a good product especially for the price.</li>
            <li> a product like this is most appreciated.  </li>
            <li> I did get this at a full promotional discount for unbias review in return.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I have only good things to say about this eye gel -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As many people have mentioned, this eye gel is VERY sticky.</li>
            <li> I was given this to try out for review and so far, It&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> I will most absolutely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> It feels cool on your skin and leaves your skin dewy.  </li>
            <li> and overall I like it and think it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> and I did not find that to be true.</li>
            <li> Check out my full review here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;LYDpRId5puw</li>
            <li> I love that you use it on your eyes, cheeks and forehead (per the instructions), but you can also use it on your whole face if you choose.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I love it; I read most of the reviews and it does what everyone says, which is more than I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool feel &amp; sticky but effect my skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to put much at all on my skin during this time.</li>
            <li> I tried it because a friend of mine gave up on trying it and passed it to me, so the bottle was not even full.....</li>
            <li> and I was ready to try anything, and already they look better.  </li>
            <li> I have a drawer full of retired eye cream and eye gel products that I need to just throw.</li>
            <li> The pump is very touchy and always dispenses more than I would like.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 60 and am religious about taking good care of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> am 27 years old with reasonably nice skin.</li>
            <li> I am so delighted especially since this is the 50th class reunion of my HS class.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The folks at InstaNatural say this is good for the entire face and the package size will allow for that without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> Feels cool and soothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product but doesn&#x27;t really do anything for my eyes.</li>
            <li> I struggled through many days without having gotten much sleep.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the seller who deserves more than five stars in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I off tan get to much liquid for my face, which still isn&#x27;t that much more</li>
            <li> It is an effective moisturizer, and seems to decrease the puffiness of the old eye bags.</li>
            <li> I really have enjoyed the process of getting to know about InstaNatural</li>
            <li> It is just refreshing to find something that really does what it says it can do.  </li>
            <li> , it even felt cool when I put it on.  </li>
            <li> It works to refresh, tighten, and cool puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> The gel helped his eyes look more radiant and ready for the day.  </li>
            <li> it is better and I am real grateful for that .</li>
            <li> This eye gel does not allow my eye makeup (mascara or eye liner) to smear - a real problem with most brands.  </li>
            <li> I did not give rate this a full 5 star because of time frame.</li>
            <li> I love the gel just for its moisturizing quality since the areas around my eyes need intense  hydration as they age faster.</li>
            <li> This is a good eye gel in a big bottle.</li>
            <li> Product is really good, works well to eliminate puffy, dark circles and gives a more rested look.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s not bad.. but</li>
            <li> I am new at trying the Insta-Natural product line, but so far I&#x27;m very impressed by the natural ingredients and that they are chemical free.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, especially, my husband loves it very much.  </li>
            <li> very nice feel, absorbs quickly and has made a noticeable difference in my fine lines and dark circles.</li>
            <li> packaging is always super cute and they always keep things very sanitary by providing either droppers with their products or in this case, a pump.</li>
            <li> honestly thickness isn&#x27;t big deal with me if it works as well but unfortunately strongly I&#x27;m thinking about to return it because;&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> And the cream -- more of a gel really -- does temporarily tighten the skin around my mouth where I&#x27;m getting some significant smile lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This gel is light and absorbs right away.</li>
            <li> I was no less than thrilled with the results of this product</li>
            <li> Since it pretty much works on demand for my puffiness &amp; bags using it once a day in the AM is working out fine for me :)</li>
            <li> I started looking into their other products, which also have great reviews.</li>
            <li> I love my new Eye Cream!</li>
            <li> I like the clean fresh smell of this gel.</li>
            <li> It smells just like clean, fresh cucumbers.</li>
            <li> Works quickly in about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s translucent eye gel that absorbs quickly into your skin and wouldn&#x27;t irritate it.  </li>
            <li> it has no greasy feeling and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> The flesh looked more youthful and vibrant.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and I can feel the tightening under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Thanks you InstaNatural for making such a great product and</li>
            <li> and as I am getting older it&#x27;s not getting any better..</li>
            <li> I will be back in a week or two to report any more improvement if there is any, even if there isn&#x27;t I&#x27;m still extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> and I find that it helps tremendously.  </li>
            <li> InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel absorbs quickly into the skin, and there is no fragrance.</li>
            <li> It has a light cucumber fresh scent and is easily absorbed into and</li>
            <li> Still giving the product time to work, however, results are definitely noticeable--this is a lot more than can be said of most products claiming to do what InstaNatural does.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly without any stickiness or greasy</li>
            <li> Also making skin appear healthier and more vibrant.</li>
            <li> It actually makes them more prominent...</li>
            <li> I have to say, they have super customer service, and offered to send me an additional bottle at no charge.</li>
            <li> OZ Naturals eye gel at .5 oz has no water in the ingredients which would indicated a more potent product considering the exchange in very similar ingredients.  </li>
            <li> and you can feel mild tightening after applying.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start telling you why I love this company, all their products have natural ingredients also their products are cruelty free.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many eye gels and after many years have finally found what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  </li>
            <li> Also, this gel did make my fine lines MORE not LESS visible.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to get a couple more for my mom and aunt to try, and will definitely be buying more for myself.</li>
            <li> and it goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am a African American and I am impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it</li>
            <li> , it applies well and dries quickly without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> Works great not only on your eyes but the whole faces.</li>
            <li> really great, I feel the skin tightening up, in a good way, not dry, firm.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The product came quickly, but did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I didn&#x27;t really notice the results until I got ready for work a week after using it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t provide adequate moisture for me</li>
            <li> Once applied, it dries quickly so that I can apply make-up or head out the door and start my day.</li>
            <li> to mild rather quickly.</li>
            <li> and it absorbs quickly into your skin.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get a quick fix.</li>
            <li> Then I use a similar product with the hyaluronic acid and vitamin C on the rest of my face, then my favorite moisturizer over the top before I apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m really pleased and couldn&#x27;t ask for better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been making sure he is using this morning &amp; night, you can tell that he looks so much more refreshed and younger even!</li>
            <li> Luckily for this.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my eyes and it is non greasy, dries quickly, and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> No greasy feeling after applying  it to your face and eye area, it does absorb quickly.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this cream very much (cucumber) and it goes on easily and is well absorbed.</li>
            <li> This is not a product I would highly recommend, although I do think if you have severe eye issues it would probably be more beneficial than for those who do not.</li>
            <li> like very much I&#x27;m using twice a day fantastic</li>
            <li> I excepted more from a product with high reviews and ratings.</li>
            <li> but I can honestly say that I see more fine lines around my eyes than before I started using this gel, and I&#x27;m only in my early 30&#x27;s!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE INSTA- NATURAL!!  </li>
            <li> It seems to smooth out the skin pretty quickly if you use it every morning and night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable after painted,and my black eyes are improved also,I love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is very first application</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s great on dark circles or not as at this time I do not have them.</li>
            <li> the very first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> and I find that it is becoming very visible on my face, specifically under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I had recently developed a bruised under eye look - more familiar terminology</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that I have products like InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel that can help reduce the look of my dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li> The dark circles under my eyes have greatly diminished.</li>
            <li> Great eye gel for dark circles and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Works great for reducing dark circles around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> It feels great on my face and my skin has never been so soft and smooth (though, like I mentioned, I&#x27;ve been using a lot of the InstaNaturals products daily, so it may be any one of them, or the combination).</li>
            <li> The bottle says it can be used on your face too, so I tried it and it was actually more effective than some of the other lotions I&#x27;ve used specifically for the face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this gel and will continue using it in the future.</li>
            <li> I started to see the lines fill in and smooth out within the first 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> With Matryxl 3000, hyaluronic acid, peptides, herbal extracts, and amino acids, this has a number of very effective active ingredients.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product for free for giving my honest opinion and will be ordering more in the near future</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this to review and love it!</li>
            <li> I use it with the other InstaNatural face products which are great, especially the Rose Hip Oil I can recommend.</li>
            <li> My new favorite find 💙</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and spreads easily, but not moisturizing enough for my skin.</li>
            <li> I originally got it for my boyfriend (who likes it very much), but I may end up buying myself a bottle</li>
            <li> Makes my eyes feel great and less puffy.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that this is by far the BEST eye cream that I have ever purchased and applied with visible results in terms of puffiness and dark circles as I always go to bed after 1am and get up at 7am.</li>
            <li> There is a slight scent of cucumber, which I like, and I am happy that it doubles as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is very hydrating and it does not have any strong smell to it.</li>
            <li> They have been reduced so much that I go without concealer on most days for the first time in years.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a week and feel pretty good after applying.  </li>
            <li> This eye gel spreads easily and dries off fast.</li>
            <li> I love that it is full of natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> As an older woman, as a makeup artist, as a blogger, I have tried countless eye creams and this is by far the BEST one I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This gel absorbs quickly so your not feeling greasy and makes your skin feel fresh.</li>
            <li> It also has been good for my daughters dry eye lids.  </li>
            <li> Have&#x27;nt had it long enough for results, but I think it will be the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s easy to use and control how much I put on under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, plus it has a fresh cucumber scent.</li>
            <li> easy to work with very plesant.  </li>
            <li> However, the skin around her eyes is very sensitive and many products cause them to water and sting.</li>
            <li> Tried this based simply on the huge amount of positive reviews, and am I glad I did!</li>
            <li> Thanks to take your customers !!  </li>
            <li> Will definitely tell more women or men to buy this as it is proven to work!</li>
            <li> First use I noticed a difference!</li>
            <li> Very hydrating Eye Gel!!</li>
            <li> When I started using the product within the first couple weeks I noticed smoother, lighter skin, will keep using, I recommend!</li>
            <li> I noticed an improvement in the first week!</li>
            <li> Really have seen a difference!!</li>
            <li> and I use it in the morning under moisturizer - i really like it!!</li>
            <li> High praise!!!</li>
            <li> and I actually think that it&#x27;s helping :) !</li>
            <li> First I have to say this seller goes above and beyond to make sure you are satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I have bought many, many, MANY eye creams in the past with zero results.  </li>
            <li> It really, truly works!!</li>
            <li> Love it so far!</li>
            <li> It comes out of the bottle in a pump, its a clear gel that goes on very light.</li>
            <li> all that breathing HAHA has caused fine lines around the mouth...</li>
            <li> so I never had that fresh look , but after trying this, I&#x27;m coming back for more !</li>
            <li> also the fine lines are so much finer.</li>
            <li> Works very well to reduce puffiness and minimize fine lines.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in fine lines or elasticity yet..  </li>
            <li> The company is super supportive as they emailed me to give me tips, see how it was working out and to send me a complimentary bottle for free (same size and all).</li>
            <li> this cream has proven to greatly improve the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes caused from under/over sleep and diet though!  </li>
            <li> They eye area is especially important and every little bit helps.</li>
            <li> After trying many other creams to reduce dark circles around my eyes, I am happy to have found the one!</li>
            <li> wrinkle,  I have dry skin , so  I will top it with another  oil  free eye cream at night in the winter only.&lt;br /&gt;Overall 5 stars , BIG bottle for only $20.00 , a happy customer !!!</li>
            <li> I also like very much that you get a full 1.7oz in this bottle.  </li>
            <li> Also, the gel is so incredibly sticky it was hard to sleep with it on without my face being stuck to my pillow.</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little more effective but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye cream, because it cheap.</li>
            <li> Bottle is huge of 1.7oz...takes up way too much space in my already cluttered bathroom...</li>
            <li> It took this Eye Gel a few weeks to show results but the results are great.</li>
            <li> great eye cream my wife uses everyday.</li>
            <li> Keep calm, it takes time.</li>
            <li> I use it for my dark circles under eyes and the results are amazing !</li>
            <li> Now on my second order and will stay faithful to this amazing eye gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and it feels really great on my skin.</li>
            <li> But really, what&#x27;s the point of being cheap when the product doesn&#x27;t work?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and already in seeing great results.</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast into skin, is light and moisturizes my under eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and absorb fast.</li>
            <li> ,really helps smooth out lines...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, and am happy with the product and results I&#x27;m getting.  </li>
            <li> This goes on smoothly, without much of a scent, and is not sticky in the slightest.</li>
            <li> it makes me feel calm and relaxed before bed.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am more than satisfied, and I will be back when I run out!&lt;br /&gt;Cheers to AJ, the rep that followed up with me, for the great service provided to me!</li>
            <li> So far really pleased -</li>
            <li> Using the eye cream was pretty cool.</li>
            <li> The opinion above is 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I like knowing that I am putting safe natural products on my face</li>
            <li> but I feel my eyes fresh in the morning</li>
            <li> Second order and loving it.</li>
            <li> The price is totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 46 years old and am not too embarrassed to say that I have tried product after product to try and maintain healthy, youthful looking skin.</li>
            <li> There is a degree of tightening, but it is not the unnatural look you get with some products that &amp;#34;cracks&amp;#34; the minute you smile or talk.</li>
            <li> AND SO FAR I LOVE THE WAY</li>
            <li> Thank you for such an effective product</li>
            <li> The product feels really nice when you put it on, especially if your eyes are tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> From their skin care, to hair care and body InstaNatural is by far my favorite company.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;InstaNatural Eye Gel has put a smile on my face not to mention my self-esteem since using there product.  </li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;problem area&amp;#34; is my smile lines and laugh lines</li>
            <li> And for the price, well worth it.</li>
            <li> My eyes are sensitive to most moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Powerful product I have teenagers and always loosing sleep because I worry about them</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about the product.</li>
            <li> The fresh cucumber scent is an added benefit.</li>
            <li> but it gave me a fresh look every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Well worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel so far.  </li>

            <li> My skin feels fresh and moist immediately.</li>
            <li> I Like the cooling effect it leaves and the fresh look my face got.</li>
            <li> Makes you look refreshed and rested, even if your not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> But my eyes were sticking together and it felt wet for good amount of time after it is put on.  </li>
            <li> I am 70 years young and tried more creams than I can count.</li>
            <li> To me, this was a rather fun product.</li>
            <li> Always looking for more natural products!)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Feels fresh and cooling, spreads well.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used exclusively yet,but I do love this so far.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve seen no change, but maybe it needs more time to work</li>
            <li> I love this product so far.</li>
            <li> I really liked this eye gel and used it on my entire face and neck because it was hydrating and firming.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary sample to try and review from BrandBacker.</li>
            <li> I will review it again, and see if it was worth it even tho the pump broke.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly worth a try to see if it works for you.  </li>
            <li> and WOW, I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> The tube is big too which is nice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is quite a powerful, 75% organic product.</li>
            <li> I recently made a video review on the product, feel free to look it up on Youtube under the username itsbmax :)</li>
            <li> I was provided a complimentary bottle of Eye Gel through my blog.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly see a big difference.</li>
            <li> Pleased, so far.</li>
            <li> not sticky, good for keeping skin wet.</li>
            <li> Most of them don&#x27;t do much, so I didn&#x27;t expect too much from this.  </li>
            <li> (I figured it would be ok since it was all natural) with the eye gel</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like how it crinkles when I smile -</li>
            <li> and I smile a LOT.  </li>
            <li> This is more than I&#x27;ve paid for an eye product, but so far it seems worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample.</li>
            <li> I will say that the tiny lines under my eyes have all but disappeared, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> This is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are safe and natural with no parabens, sulfates or alcohol.</li>
            <li> and it has a fresh scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> For me, this product is worth buying.</li>
            <li> like the product, I also have been using it on my smile lines.  </li>
            <li> So far my husband and are pleased with this eye gel.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and could not tolerate the product any more.</li>
            <li> I will repost in a few weeks but so far I am impressed with the product, the price and the results.</li>
            <li> So far I love this product.</li>
            <li> This by far makes the most difference.</li>
            <li> Really worth the money.</li>
            <li> So worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth it for the results you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free - for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I even applied the product to the smile wrinkles by my mouth and saw a difference (wrinkles beginning to diminish).  </li>
            <li> Been using it now for about a month and noticeable improvement around eyes (reduces puffiness and softens laugh lines).</li>
            <li> I use this gel on my crow&#x27;s feet,frownlines and laugh lines.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommended and with the money back guarantee, you can analyze your own photos.</li>
            <li> I use it around my eyes, on my forehead and smile lines.</li>
            <li> This product leans more on the natural side.</li>
            <li> FRESH CUCUMBER.I</li>
            <li> USE IT ON MY SMILE LINES TOO.</li>
            <li> definitely worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li> It is kind of an instant tightening cream</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, there are so many things I like about this product, I am 30 years old</li>
            <li> ingredients don&#x27;t irritate my eyes and the gel is quickly absorbed without the feeling greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works well together and everything is easily absorbed by my skin.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t expect miracles when it comes to eye cream, and this product proves it.</li>
            <li> I am amazed at how fresh and plump my face</li>
            <li> So it maybe worth it to try the product</li>
            <li> this product.&lt;br /&gt;The container is high quality, the label, instructions and ingredients are easy to read.</li>
            <li> Even after washing my face my eyes look great and there are no fine lines.  </li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and does not leave a sticky residue behind, and the light fresh scent and cool effect is really a nice way to wake up your skin in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I ordered two other products from them and plan to get more.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I have very sensitive skin in general.</li>
            <li> I have spent tons of money on eye creams this one by far works really good!</li>
            <li> No strong smell, great packaging.  </li>
            <li> This is a bigger container than most eye creams so I can make sure a put a decent amount on to keep my eye areas hydrated</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great just not working as fast as I would like there is  difference in the swelling due to my allergies.  </li>
            <li> The first thing i noticed about the Youth Express was the smell, it&#x27;s like a mild cucumber.</li>
            <li> They respond quickly to questions and appear truly interested in what their customers think.  </li>
            <li> results are pretty quick.</li>
            <li> I love make-up , electronics , toys for the kids just about really anything I am willing to try, incase a family member wants to know if its worth the price and does it work.</li>
            <li> Its cooling, and it feels nice when applied, but I didn&#x27;t notice any changes to dark circles or fine lines.</li>
            <li> My mom remarked how good my skin was looking, and it&#x27;s totally due to using this twice a day.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that I have used continuously because I saw results on puffiness, circles and texture around my eyes within the very first applications.</li>
            <li> other wise</li>
            <li> The bottle is very travel friendly so you can take it with you when you are traveling.  </li>
            <li> I bought what I thought was this same product a couple of months ago and liked it very much.</li>
            <li> Works right away but is temporary.</li>
            <li> but right now, I cant</li>
            <li> I saw improvement right away but not as described.</li>
            <li> It made a difference right away on the puffiness of my undereye area.</li>
            <li> It comes in a pump bottle that dispenses the right amount of product.</li>
            <li> and if you are dissatisfied in any way, they make it right.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t happen right away</li>
            <li> but I can tell a notorious difference right now</li>
            <li> To apply, I use this in the morning right after I shower.</li>
            <li> but hey, who would like to wake up to puffy eyes right?</li>
            <li> I would say that you shouldn&#x27;t expect drastic results right away</li>
            <li> and I saw improvement right away.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> and it has always shown right underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> The price is right and the portion size is generous.</li>
            <li> I apply the eye cream at night right before bed.</li>
            <li> I can feel it tightening right after putting it on.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> Did I expect to see results right away?</li>
            <li> Youth Express Eye Gel has lots of ingredients that are on the skin care &amp;#34;hit-list&amp;#34; right now.</li>
            <li> Works well, noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> price is right.</li>
            <li> I must not be using it right????  </li>
            <li> fragrance is light and very pleasant, much like the other InstaNatural products I have been privileged enough to try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already receiving some positive comments !</li>
            <li> This product matches well versus many other well known, highly advertised and candidly, pricy alternatives.</li>
            <li> Clear gel feels cool and smooth on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased to have finally found a product that works for me and ultimately, at a very affordable price point.  </li>
            <li> since I did not see any difference using it the first week, then low and behold by end of week two, amazing....</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I see a big difference in my eyes, they are not as dark as they used to be and</li>
            <li> It feels so lovely and cool on, and never stings at all; I use it on upper and lower kids.  </li>
            <li> I think my eyes look far better than when I first used this product.</li>
            <li> ran out of this product about a week ago, the red mark is coming back, so this is not a permanent fix, which is more than fine, will have to order more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products for my dark circles and this has made the most impact.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to believe that it would improve my fine lines, especially after reading such great reviews</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product because it&#x27;s more natural than the other options and very effective.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and break out easily but not with this gel.</li>
            <li> We have under eye problems for so many reasons, but I think this product would generally help anyone if used as directed!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this eye gel; it is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> If you just want to keep your skin moisturized and smooth - this product is okay, but if you want something more, go get a more expensive cream.</li>
            <li> acid serum is my favorite serum for my face since it works well in softening my skin, erasing fine lines, and providing an excellent base for my make-up.  </li>
            <li> It smells very natural spa-like scent that is not overwhelming and very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am super impressed!  </li>
            <li> It does apply nice however that is the only positive.</li>
            <li> I find it much more effective, finer and preferable to more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> My dark circles seem lighter, and as an added bonus, I think it acts as a really good primer for undereye concealer.</li>
            <li> I am a (retired) biochemist and I am familiar with pretty much everything in this.</li>
            <li> I loved it, i tried it faithfully twice a day and my dark circles and puffy eyes were visibly reduced.</li>
            <li> Better still, their customer service reached out to me a little while after purchasing to ensure I was completely satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li> It does have a little burning sensation once I put it on as well as a nice cooling effect which I enjoy.  </li>
            <li> Although I have not found this to be amazingly effective on my dark circles after a month, I do find that I love using this as a light facial cream.</li>
            <li> I could see a difference in the bags under my eyes right away after I first used this product.</li>
            <li> In addition to using it as an eye gel, I also actually use this as an all over daytime facial moisturizer, and it works great for my oily/combo skin.</li>
            <li> and  this being a quick drying gel, doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin much</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and works fast.</li>
            <li> In comes in an easy to dispense pump action bottle.</li>
            <li> and then when I move my eyes around once it&#x27;s dry, that it kind of cracks</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and leaves the area feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Going to try a different product   update:  great customer service after my initial review.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty good treatment for people with dark circles and puffiness under their eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although it can be used on the entire face, I&#x27;m using for my eyes, and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Will update, if this version is equally good, better or worse after I have been using a while.</li>
            <li> Amazing, this stuff actually works thanks</li>
            <li> the black circles under my eyes-so I&#x27;m delighted with it.</li>
            <li> Came quick but didn&#x27;t see much difference at all.</li>
            <li> I must say that I  am pleased with the results so far I am not as swollen and puffy around the eyes as much and the results have been gradual.</li>
            <li> I have purchased multiple different products from InstaNatural and have experienced nothing but quality</li>
            <li> I feel like this product has brightened up my eye area although I have to say I don&#x27;t have bags at all, and the darkness under my eyes was probably normal or better than normal.</li>
            <li> I have been applying the product twice a day, and definitely love it, my dark circles (always my big problem )are getting better and better, I just have enough gel for a few more days, so I have to get more :)</li>
            <li> First of all, this gel comes in a very large package for an eye gel.  </li>
            <li> I really notice improvements  the very first morning after using this gel.</li>
            <li> MY FACE IS LOOKING SMOOTH AND CLEAR!</li>
            <li> I really notice improvements  the very first morning after using this gel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is so much about this company that speaks to the kind of dedication to their craft that should be evident in ANY company that produces beauty products such as this one.</li>
            <li> , it was so smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li> I have found other products that address the puffiness under my eyes more quickly and effectively and only need to be used as needed.</li>
            <li> It is clear, cool and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> very good until now dark circles becoming less but still not gone</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable for the bottle size.  </li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that if I have it on, and then try to put liquid makeup (or a moisturizer) over it - I have to be very gentle where this product is.</li>
            <li> push the pump very gently to dispense the product.  </li>
            <li> It does come out of the pump as a gel, it doesn&#x27;t take very much at all to cover the eye, cheek and forehead area.  </li>
            <li> very much - been using for almost 2 months now.</li>
            <li> My eyes seem to be sensitive to other products but this doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation and not to mention my eyes look great.  </li>
            <li> and I am so glad that the shipping is really quick, because I ran out and the shipping being so fast that I only went 3 days without it!!!</li>
            <li> This works really well, but you have to consistent!</li>
            <li> I chose it mostly for the anti-aging and fine line reduction properties, I don&#x27;t have issues with bags under my eyes or dark circles.</li>
            <li> My 2 older girls are sorta a hassle when its bed time , but mostly my 8 month old she used to sleep through the night</li>
            <li> This skin cream not only works well in reducing fine likes around the eye, it also is effective in improving skin complexion in the entire face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is very faint and pleasant, the gel is on the thicker side, but it applies nicely and dries up quick.</li>
            <li> THIS IS VERY EASY TO APPLY AND IT DOESNT LEAVE A MESS TO CLEAN UP.</li>
            <li> I did not see the improvement the first week, but after a couple weeks I could tell.</li>
            <li> But if you are willing to put up with it</li>
            <li> I have tried several, but this one stands out as having more noticeable improvement than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> so they are mostly from smiling and not deep).</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone in need of some extra love and care for their eyes.</li>
            <li> Gentle, effective and fast acting!</li>
            <li> Haha got you even before you started appearing!</li>
            <li> Be consistent.</li>
            <li> This product works very well!</li>
            <li> For those rare days I forget to apply it, I can really feel the difference.  </li>
            <li> I will qualify this by saying that I&#x27;ve never tried just a regular moisturizer, so I don&#x27;t know if this is better than moisturizer or not.</li>
            <li> I received the Insta Natural Eye Gel free and for review.  </li>
            <li> Thanks instanatural!</li>
            <li> He reminded me that he&#x27;s been using this gel, and I really can&#x27;t believe the results!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I do have to re-touch up at the end of the day, but that is better than having to do it mid morning.</li>
            <li> Circles gone first, bagginess diminished first week.</li>
            <li> It took me pressing about 10 times to get the gel to come up the first time</li>
            <li> This might happen for you to when you first use it.</li>
            <li> So this is my first review of a product.</li>
            <li> That being said i didnt like this product at first</li>
            <li> Will continue use for sure to see further results.</li>
            <li> Recently my efforts have been more concentrated in the eye area.</li>
            <li> Further, the overall effect on my entire face is wonderful...</li>
            <li> Fast results!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had such great customer service in a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, I am 2weeks on my second purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> IT DOES EXACTLY</li>
            <li> Applied to my eyes, got instant dryness and felt that my skin would get more wrinkles this way.</li>
            <li> I am really liking this eye gel!</li>
            <li> but for now it does give me a smooth and soft skin.</li>
            <li> that will only reflect even more on their products.  </li>
            <li> and I look more awake overall.</li>
            <li> I bought this randomly too but am happy to have found it!</li>
            <li> He is using morning and night and there continues to be improvement, his under eye area is so much lighter and smoother!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for this product!</li>
            <li> my first time that i used i can see different,CUSTOMER SERVICE IS EXCELENT I WANT CONGRATULATION FOR THIS ITEM AND TO SELLER</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would work for my under eye puffiness, but it did nothing for me, even after consistent use for a month.  </li>
            <li> The first time using this product I agreed with a reviewer that it was sticky and not something I would want to use during the day.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it</li>
            <li> It has a cooling, tightening sensation when first applied.  </li>
            <li> I used this product consistently for months with no hint of change in my under eye area.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, non-drying, has no fragrance, no chemicals and absorbs completely.  </li>
            <li> Did not really see a lot of difference, it was an nice moisturizer though.</li>
            <li> I have seen results since the first week.</li>
            <li> and I can tell my upper eye lids are looking better already.</li>
            <li> My eyelids feel soft and smooth now.  </li>
            <li> The first week I just noticed a decrease in &amp;#34;saggyness&amp;#34; in my eyes</li>
            <li> This product is $20, I get way more, and IT ACTUALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> This is made in the U.S. in an FDA-registered and regulated facility, which means top quality is always first and foremost, but also means that hoarding of their products wouldn&#x27;t be necessary.</li>
            <li> This product is almost exactly as another one I purchased.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for a bit more of a miracle but have been using for just under a month (religiously twice/day), so time will tell as to whether or not results continue to improve.  </li>
            <li> be aware of the side effects that it doesnt list because of the plant stem cells.</li>
            <li> Even as a woman in my mid 50&#x27;s, I love this eye gel.  </li>
            <li> this is my first time, I must say I love this product and is only been 2 weeks .</li>
            <li> I am 29 and This is the first Eye cream I purchased.</li>
            <li> I preferred to use it at night, more then day, but that is my personal preference.</li>
            <li> Please stay aware.</li>
            <li> I lost the first bottle</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t even funny.</li>
            <li> I use it every morning and my first bottle has lasted 7 months.</li>
            <li> Their eye gel has definitely made my eyes look more youthful and brighter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference in my laugh lines</li>
            <li> I personally have many issues with scent and this one doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> And, I am still on my first jar.</li>
            <li> And, I am still on my first jar.</li>
            <li> Ive been getting alot of compliments from family telling me how pretty I got</li>
            <li> This product at 1.7 oz first ingredient is &amp;#34;D&amp;#34; (abbrev.)  </li>
            <li> and I could see results within the first 4 to 7 days.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for my fiancé based on the reviews, but unfortunately it&#x27;s not what presented here at all!&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> Such a simple and effective product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already reordered it before using up the first bottle I got about a month ago.</li>
            <li> I love this cream before I used different brand</li>
            <li> This eye cream works very well!</li>
            <li> but this gel is only ok.</li>
            <li> There is just something about the gel that really is refreshing and helps give me that extra something that</li>
            <li> applied this first thing in the morning, under all my makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m interested to see what this would do if I my eyes were puffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have been using this product consistently now for about 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like not being able to see how much is left.</li>
            <li> I would definitely reorder when I need more.</li>
            <li> This is not the first product by this company that I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m pretty please with this</li>
            <li> One of the first things that I noticed is that although this gel says it is an eye gel, the directions say you can use it on your face.</li>
            <li> I love using this as a daily moisturizing treatment before my makeup.</li>
            <li> I can actually feel this eye cream cooling and tightening after application, which I love.  </li>
            <li> Yes it does, it goes on a tad sticky at first but</li>
            <li> Not to mention that it is too hot for the area around the eye</li>
            <li> but there also was no irritation or redness when I first began using the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Saw improvement after my first bottle and ordered another.</li>
            <li> I have used this eye cream consistently for two weeks without results.  </li>
            <li> I have just started to get eye gels and creams to test out different ones and see which ones I like the most.</li>
            <li> This is the first eye cream/gel that I bought that works.  </li>
            <li> if you filter by: &amp;#34;VERIFIED PURCHASES ONLY&amp;#34; there is absolutely NONE!</li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel!</li>
            <li> Gel is pretty sticky.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe it first, so I continued another week.  </li>
            <li> Started noticing a difference in the first week.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the real praduct!</li>
            <li> This is the first eye product I have used that has produced noticeable results.</li>
            <li> I made my husband sit still and applied it under his eyes first to see what happened.</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> my first eye cream.</li>
            <li> cause I just got it, but the pump broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get enough to be able to tell.</li>
            <li> So glad I&#x27;ve found the InstaNatural facial products!</li>
            <li> Some eye creams work upon first use at reducing puffiness this one does not.  </li>
            <li> On those occasions I use it on my entire face and the results are astonishing.  </li>
            <li> Bought this product and used the first one up in no time.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is I wish it was more moisturizing</li>
            <li> The shipping was pretty fast too and the packaging quality was also 5 star!</li>
            <li> Just got it and used for the first time today.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more once I run out.</li>
            <li> This is the first application.</li>
            <li> I have a problems with bags under my eyes and have tried so many different products I can&#x27;t even count them all.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed when I applied this gel is that it has a cooling feeling.</li>
            <li> I noticed firmer skin under my eyes and my eyes looked more refreshed overall.</li>
            <li> I love the results I&#x27;m getting, especially with the puffiness.  </li>
            <li> This is a miraculous formula , will definitely keep buying more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a miracle, not &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; but for the first time in my life I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I love how cooling the gel is too, definitely helps to keep me awake in the morning.</li>
            <li> I really like this!</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe it&#x27;s not a confession because maybe it&#x27;s obvious.</li>
            <li> but it is safe to be used on your entire face.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product because it has great ingredients for the delicate area around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Stellar product.</li>
            <li> While the puffiness under my eyes seems about the same, the skin itself seems more moist and hydrated.</li>
            <li> After using it for a month I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> The first week I was convinced because I felt it working</li>
            <li> After 3 days of use, the darkness around my eyes diminished so much that I forgot to apply my concealer!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the first day I put this on and</li>
            <li> Try this to see if your eyes look more refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be adding a littke extra moisturizer under my eyes for awhile to help seal in all of that goodness.</li>
            <li> So much I purchased one for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day!</li>
            <li> I also enjoy that it is made of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love to put this on at night and sit back and relax and literally feel a change in the hydration under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> Mediocre at best.</li>
            <li> got it first day and can feel it tightening the puffy areas around my eyes.</li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all and actually makes eye bags and darkness more defined.</li>
            <li> And this is my first time leaving comment</li>
            <li> cliniqe all about eyes and more recently</li>
            <li> a week is more than enough.  </li>
            <li> Haha!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thankful that I tried this now while the problems are mostly perceptible to me, and hopefully with continued use they will not become a bigger issue as I age.</li>
            <li> As soon as I used this product for the first time I noticed an improved difference in how my eyes looked.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to apply as much concealer under my eyes!</li>
            <li> I’ve tried many eye products that promise to reduce puffy eyes and have tried several home remedies.</li>
            <li> Absolutely sold on this product!  </li>
            <li> I like this product better than higher priced products I&#x27;ve used with similar ingredients.  </li>
            <li> That is the first thing I look for in all products that I put on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for that elixir that would bring back some elasticity from inside my skin not just superficially as most creams do.  </li>
            <li> If the company gives me my money back $ 19 plus the shipping I would love to do it ASAP.</li>
            <li> This one really works!</li>
            <li> It felt tacky on my skin and it&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve used that broke me out around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase again:)</li>
            <li> The gel feels really refreshing, especially in the a.m.</li>
            <li> After the first application I realized this.  </li>
            <li> Even though I have very big under eyes bags, I can see how this eye gel is helping my eyes look better.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> I personally get from this Company, they actually send personal emails with instructions on how to get the best results from their products and follow up with your progress.  </li>
            <li> This product does exactly as it&#x27;s described.</li>
            <li> It has hyaluronic acid which is a great moisturizer (that Iâ€™m already using) and it uses all natural and organic ingredients to protect your skin from sun damage, dark circles, puffiness and more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> You only require a small drop of gel twice a day for best results.  </li>
            <li> reduction actually started within the first use, however now it&#x27;s much much better than I could have ever hoped.  </li>
            <li> I will purchase this when first bottle when I&#x27;m finished.</li>
            <li> (First of all I&#x27;ve been using  this product almost 5 days</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Be sure to allow product to set for a while prior to applying shadow.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I&#x27;m not one of them, maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> This eye gel is very soothing!  </li>
            <li> I actually saw results in 2 days but wasn&#x27;t quite sure</li>
            <li> but by end of first week the darkness was almost gone</li>
            <li> I really like this system!  </li>
            <li> This eye gel is so refreshing and actually reduced my puffiness.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s a first for me on Amazon...</li>
            <li> This procudt deflate puffy eyes and the skin around your eyes is soft  and smooth.</li>
            <li> When I first applied the gel, I did notice immediately that it was working in the lines.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> I received a coupon to try this product at a deeply discounted price and I was so glad that I took advantage of the offer .</li>
            <li> and I also used it above my top lip.  </li>
            <li> This seems to really work!</li>
            <li> Also seems to pair well with most of my facial moisturizers.</li>
            <li> This one leaves my under eye smooth and clear, works just as well as prescription.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer too, not too heavy for the eye area.</li>
            <li> gel goes on very smooth, is easy to gently work onto the tender thin skin areas under and around the eyes with light finger tip pats, dries quickly and no stickiness.</li>
            <li> I was buying Clarins serum super lift advanced extra firming eye countour serum for twice the price for 1/3 the product.</li>
            <li> But most important, the fines lines and wrinkles around my eyes are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!!!!  </li>
            <li> After many other attempts, this is by far my favorite eye gel.</li>
            <li> It absorbs rather fast and you can feel the skin under your eyes tightening right away.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s always best to start early before it&#x27;s too late!</li>
            <li> When I first tried the Insta Natural Eye Gel, I noticed that it had a thicker consistency, which is not a bad thing, since I would love some extra moisture around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> But they are for more drastic situations that simply being of a certain age.</li>
            <li> All the other reviews say this product works and is amazing......</li>
            <li> The product was here before it was due and that was amazing.</li>
            <li> I use it day and night with gentle massage, less fine lines and my eye concealer applies better too.</li>
            <li> One great thing about Instanatural is that they provide 100% money back if you are not satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m loving about this product, is that it&#x27;s lightweight, and doesn&#x27;t feel tacky, due to the fact that its a gel.</li>
            <li> My problem has always been puffiness and, to be honest, NOTHING will cure this other than surgery, which I am not going to do at this point.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s inexpensive compared to other products, it smells nice and it works.</li>
            <li> My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.</li>
            <li> My skin feels kind of dry shortly after applying the gel.&lt;br /&gt;No improvement with the fine lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li> After trying this by itself and seeing nice results, I looked into other anti-aging products to improve the rest of my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The skin indeed becomes more smooth, but this cream doesn&#x27;t treat frim lines and wrinkes as the other more expensive products to (i&#x27;m very satisfied with clarins eye balm).</li>
            <li> Best eye gel I have ever bought, I also use on my face, feels good, wrinkles, dark circles and bags is disappear little by little after using  months.</li>
            <li> and although it doesn&#x27;t completely remove lines (nothing really does at my age), it does make the skin feel youthful and smooth.</li>
            <li> , my face is radiant and the company selling this product really cares about you and your experience with the product, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ll stick with what works for my delicate skin and great customer service.</li>
            <li> The previously darker areas are more a red/pinkish hue that looks much more natural.</li>
            <li> It absorbs so naturally and feels incredibly clean without a residue.</li>
            <li> The first time I applied it really stung and got hot.</li>
            <li> I really appreciated The customer service and will definitely be trying to more of these products.</li>
            <li> When she orders more she wants to get a size larger</li>
            <li> Their ingredients are simple, natural, and incredibly effective.</li>
            <li> Really feels good when applied...not a heavy product at all</li>
            <li> I do let it soak in for a few minutes before applying an oil free lotion moisturizer on top</li>
            <li> Works fair if you apply multiple times daily</li>
            <li> I actually use it over my whole face under my moisturinzer (also from InstaNatural) and I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li> Great product compared to the wide variety I&#x27;ve tried-- significant reduction in dark circles in addition to elimination of wrinkles and puffiness around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I love how the cream sinks right into your eye tissue under and over the eye.</li>
            <li> liked the serum a little more than the cream only because it glides on easier.</li>
            <li> As a sufferer of dark circles for many years, this product helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles, I will keep trying to see if there are any positive results.</li>
            <li> I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li> I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> This product showed positive results in just over a week.  </li>
            <li> The number of positive reviews speak for themselves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not noticed a huge difference physically, but perhaps it helps more psychologically.</li>
            <li> This cream is really effective and my daughter is pleased with it after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I still have dark circles under my eyes but the texture is amazing , I can notice improvement .</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this long, but I love the texture</li>
            <li> but I have noticed significant reduction is puffiness, skin feels smoother and more firm around the sockets.</li>
            <li> Pretty much I use it wherever I need to, twice a day.</li>
            <li> Pretty much I use it wherever I need to, twice a day.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is a real review.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much difference in my skin although I must say I haven&#x27;t been consistent.</li>
            <li> After trying several very pricey products, with minimal results, I did some research I saw that this eye cream had great reviews.  </li>
            <li> did notice the skin under my eyes seems a bit drier (showing fine lines that I don&#x27;t have when it&#x27;s not dry)</li>
            <li> I have tried other eye creams that worked great but had no lasting results or are no longer on the market.  </li>
            <li> Really does reduce under eye bags consistently.</li>
            <li> I was pretty much a zombie during the day</li>
            <li> Makeup goes easily on top of the gel, as long as you give it sufficient time to absorb.</li>
            <li> Have only been using this cream for a few days but so far it is great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional blogger that writes my true opinion.</li>
            <li> The cream is all natural and full of organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> honestly does make a difference to the amount of puffiness and helps to lighten the dark circles.</li>
            <li> As a swimmer I wear tight goggles that have started to create more wrinkles (being 49 adds to this!)</li>
            <li> I am 30 and have fine lines and wrinkles as well as pretty significant dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> The Eye gel is primarily for use under your eyes, to reduce dark circles, fine lines &amp; wrinkles, puffiness, but I am using it all over my face.</li>
            <li> This has helped my dark circles a lot, but I even noticed help with some fine lines that were looking like they were getting comfortable.</li>
            <li> First off, I will say that I got this for fine lines, not puffiness, but it definitely seemed to help!</li>
            <li> Next time, I&#x27;ll save my $20 and put it towards something with more realistic ratings.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know the price has gone down....</li>
            <li> This product has actually convinced me that it is high time to use an under eye serum - an effective and natural one at that!</li>
            <li> By the first full week, twice a day, I saw a major difference in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different creams, gels, serums, etc - including high end brands - but nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this for dark circles and the price is very friendly!</li>
            <li> To be clear, this isn&#x27;t a facelift, so you will see lines when you smile very largely, but when your face is at rest; not so much.    </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but so happy I listened to the many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> but I think that will take a little more time!</li>
            <li> and it makes your skin look fresh, shiny and new...</li>
            <li> slight smell of cucumber, but it feels amazingly hydrating as soon as it touches your face.</li>
            <li> However, since I&#x27;ve been using this gel, I have noticed a huge difference in the hydration of my skin as well as a huge fix in my under-eye dark circles.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that after using this for a week, my skin has tightened and the under eye sagging has been less.</li>
            <li> I did not see a great big difference in the dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> I am much more aware of fine lines and wrinkles that are slowly making an appearance.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quick and leaves a soft feel to my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quick and leaves a soft feel to my eyelids.</li>
            <li> really were pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> The gel flows on easily and has definitely smoothed the skin under and around my eyes in addition to also reducing the puffy appearance under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I am very realistic when it comes to skin care products</li>
            <li> The owner actually was nice enough to send me out a complimentary free bottle just to assure me that the product actually works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a dramatic reduction...but noticeable nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Not dramatic results.  </li>
            <li> Gentle clear gel is easy to apply - odorless and non-irritating to my very sensitive eyes &amp; skin.</li>
            <li> It certainly makes my skin feel and look smoother.</li>
            <li> I have sleeping problems and that results in large bags under my eyes...</li>
            <li> I certainly did.  </li>
            <li> have noticed a drastically large change in the puffiness.  </li>
            <li> The 1.7 ounce bottle is large and the gel spreads well.</li>
            <li> So she got a large bra based on the sizes that they suggested.</li>
            <li> (she got a large).</li>
            <li> I have to say that I&#x27;m very satisfied with your product this far and have noted very interesting improvements in the area around my eyes even when the main purpose of my purchase was to get an excellent moisturizer as I suffer from dry skin in the area that just got worst after two eye surgeries.</li>
            <li> I see a significant reduction in fine lines &amp; dark circles.</li>
            <li> The formula is also rich and absorbs quickly, so I don’t have to wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because I really thought this product was going to work considering all of the positive feedback it recieved.</li>
            <li> and I hope to see more and more improvement in my dark circles....and believe me, they are definitely there!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite facial care product.</li>
            <li> I can definitely  see less  bag, Great price for  </li>
            <li> I actually put it further down into my t zone under makeup and it looks perfect!  </li>
            <li> Feels like it&#x27;s working and keeps everything nice and tight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really thick, but it does build up easily if you accidentally put too much amount on your under eyes and it tends to dry quickly, too.</li>
            <li> Definitely reduces fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a week, and I do think I see some improvements in the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> , the only thing bothers me is some fine lines underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been using Shiseido&#x27;s eye cream, and it always provides a temporary relief, but once the make up is on, the fine lines show up instantly.</li>
            <li> Although I do not see any difference with fine lines and wrinkles just yet, I do like the gel and use it daily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m well into my 30s and the fine lines and crows feet are really starting to show up.</li>
            <li> I see the fine lines around my eyes smoothing out, and the puffy upper eyelids literally shrinking.</li>
            <li> In 2 weeks I totally noticed a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> It did actually reduce fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes</li>
            <li> Pretty decent.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty decent product to relieve eye-puffiness and circles.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is big enough that you wouldn&#x27;t be running out quickly if you used it on more than your undereyes.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing eye cream for dark circles and puffiness!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The mfg did send a little inquiry to see how I liked it and said to keep trying it as it eventually would work.  </li>
            <li> Feels nice and it helps a little bit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the thicker side, but it rubs in nicely.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for around 3 weeks now and have not noticed much difference in my fine lines or wrinkly eyelids (and I&#x27;m only 23).  </li>
            <li> This eye gel has really helped with the fine lines around the crows feet area - but what I really have noticed is a big improvement on the eyelid under the brow area where I have started having some crepe-ness.  </li>
            <li> I now have very high hopes that after the recommended 8 weeks of applying this gel that my bags will really improve.</li>
            <li> The easy to use pump is great, but I only need to depress it about 1/4 the way down to get the amount I need for my undereyes</li>
            <li> I love their products and agree with other positive feedbacks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bought this due to so many positive reviews</li>
            <li> I have only used it a coulple times, so I have not seen a huge difference</li>
            <li> The cream is clear and soft and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a great product and as all my skin issues get under control after a few weeks of constant usage, I&#x27;ll post some pictures.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks and can see an amazing difference in the circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Youth Express Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer Cream, which is non-greasy, very hydrating and does smooth wrinkles, and their Vit. C serum which has faded sun spots over the one month period I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks manufacturer of promotional activities, the price is cheaper.</li>
            <li> It works very well, and I have no complaints with it at all.</li>
            <li> I do like InstaNatural products as a whole.</li>
            <li> however I don&#x27;t really notice anything taking place with this product yet....</li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel</li>
            <li> It somehow stays very hydrating through the night.  </li>
            <li> my eyes went to very puffy to almost nonexistent.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t stand to do it anymore.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> BETTER than expected.</li>
            <li> I use this cream on my whole face in the morning (I ordered the night cream for evenings) and it&#x27;s really soothing, and cooling, and it &amp;#34;plumps&amp;#34; up the skin</li>
            <li> but it very lightweight &amp; non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I really do like the way this goes on...</li>
            <li> Still waiting to see the result, very hydrating.</li>
            <li> I like to apply it, then apply my foundation because it really helps to blend around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> As you can see in the photos there really wasn&#x27;t any change</li>
            <li> It had a very cooling and soothing effect around the eye area.  </li>
            <li> These reviews were so promising</li>
            <li> The product seems straight to the point without any bs.</li>
            <li> Have not noticed much of a difference yet.</li>
            <li> This gel feels like you did not even put it on, very lightweight.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensative skin and a lot of skin allergies, as well as wear contacts.  </li>
            <li> IT is very hydrating and soothing to my eyes.</li>
            <li> I do not have to worry about re-checking my under eyes so much.</li>
            <li> thank u so much.  </li>
            <li> Thanks .</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the result to happen so fast</li>
            <li> dont really notice a difference after using one month</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> I am really wanting to to a difference.</li>
            <li> I really want to kick the use of a concealer</li>
            <li> It got almost 5 stars but very greasy and didn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
            <li> in all a very satisfactory purchase.  </li>
            <li> I really like this gel, and have seen improvement over the month I have been using.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference on the bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I find that when I put too much it does burn but</li>
            <li> I also feel like my whole eye area has tightened up</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> This works very well</li>
            <li> Everyone else is telling me that I look really rested....</li>
            <li> REally does help to reduce under eye puffiness.  </li>
            <li> but it has really been bothering me.</li>
            <li> I was really getting discouraged.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much improvement yet.  </li>
            <li> Basically, I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very drying.  </li>
            <li> Did so much more than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I kinda gave up on it after a week as I didn&#x27;t really see any results.</li>
            <li> I used this for a month and it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> it hasn&#x27;t helped much if at all.  </li>
            <li> I even want to apply it over my entire face for a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li> So, I either recommending waiting much longer or doing this at night.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> I got this product for reduced price to do a review, Thanks</li>
            <li> I know it will take using it longer to see a real difference.</li>
            <li> Yet, since having her, I have noticed myself ageing, whereas I really hadn’t before.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, it exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and the gel stays on all day and keeps the eye area tender and protected.  </li>
            <li> I really like the feel , texture and smell</li>
            <li> Really did nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> I am very please with this product.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really tell that it&#x27;s done much of anything.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> ,, It really does work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very displeased.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> It really isn&#x27;t a hassle to apply so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this eye gel.  </li>
            <li> and I can use it on my whole face.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> This is a lifetime, 100% money-back guarantee-something that, in my experience, is absolutely unheard of.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very cooling and hydrating.  </li>
            <li> but I really like it.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because the pump dispenses too much product.  </li>
            <li> it dries fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dozens of eye creams, and this is absolutely one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery  </li>
            <li> I no longer use the concealer and only a light powder to blend in with my makeup.</li>
            <li> I really do like this gel eye cream</li>
            <li> BUT THIS ONE REALLY TAKES THE STARS.  </li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel.  </li>
            <li> it really helped in the morning for puffy eyes and The cooling effect that happen when you apply it</li>
            <li> Thanks InstaNatural</li>
            <li> It is very soothing and it truly softens and smooths the skin around your eyes.</li>
            <li> and very generous amount of product for the price.</li>
            <li> After I put it on, I just go about my morning routine, having breakfast, getting ready, etc.</li>
            <li> I did how ever, knock off one star because I expected to see more improvement in my skin texture underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use as much concealer now.  </li>
            <li> I really like the product itself.</li>
            <li> I got it before but not as much as I do now.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t helped the puffiness as much.</li>
            <li> but this really work</li>
            <li> I use as directed and really don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> After a couple months of use, I really haven&#x27;t seen any change.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles around the eyes, so I can&#x27;t comment on the anti-wrinkle effectiveness.</li>
            <li> The cooling effect of the gel is also very calming.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a gel like cream that really absorbs well .</li>
            <li> shipping is fast and its packaged up really well .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have resolved to drinking coffee with lots of creamer in order to keep up with my kiddos who are ready to go as soon as they wake up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is working very well for me.  </li>
            <li> It is very inexpensive and you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Insta Natural definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> does it really do all of those things?</li>
            <li> I am always looking for something to help, but really don&#x27;t hold out much hope.</li>
            <li> I read that this was non-comedogenic and can be used on the whole face</li>
            <li> but I do apply BB cream over it and that works very well.  </li>
            <li> However, it really doesn&#x27;t seem to be like glue under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I was much happier with Khiels recovery eye.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very soothing</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product 1 week ago and it has arrived 3 days ago so the shipping was quite fast.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> very concerned with satisfaction.</li>
            <li> so I could see how much is still in the container.  </li>
            <li> no matter how much sleep he gets.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I use this on my whole face.as</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this once a day for about a year on my whole face.</li>
            <li> My dark circles are pretty damn prominent as I work 2 very strenous jobs</li>
            <li> and this really helps.  </li>
            <li> and it really works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my whole face, my neck and on my decollete.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you so much for allowing me to review it.</li>
            <li> I also started putting it on a spot on my neck where my skin was looking very wrinkly</li>
            <li> This product has helped smooth out my skin and made it look younger and healthier.  </li>
            <li> I really like the eye gel.  </li>
            <li> This bra obviously doesnt fit me in the video.</li>
            <li> Its really work thanks guys</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it for it to work.</li>
            <li> I used this around my eyes, as well as over my whole face.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> REALLY, TRULY W0RK.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t figure out how this could work so fast.</li>
            <li> If you get too much on, it dries and can peel off like a mask.</li>
            <li> I would even put it on par with some high end creams that cost $80 and up!</li>
            <li> fast shipping</li>
            <li> For real.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The only reason that I gave two stars instead of one is because it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in so much pain</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> it is very gooditem  and</li>
            <li> I like that it can be used on the eye area or on your whole face.</li>
            <li> Really works well.</li>
            <li> I apply after cleansing my skin and the area feels smooth throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying this out for a while, my wrinkles are still present</li>
            <li> I can really feel the difference and tightening in the skin.</li>
            <li> I really like and will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Organic and animal free testing is enough to make me use this product but the product will stand alone for it&#x27;s quality.  </li>
            <li> This eye cream has really helped with my under eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> I did receive this product for free to try and even if I had paid for it my review would have been the same.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t cause issues with eye makeup, and seems to be helping in the overall appearance of the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> and it honestly doesn&#x27;t appear to be getting any different even after using twice a day, but I&#x27;ll wait til I have used the entire bottle to make a real decision.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had way too much to spread out before.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes have become so much smoother</li>
            <li> It took a whole bottle before I started getting compliments on my looks.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> it despite my gentle skin.</li>
            <li> i am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll say it is working very well</li>
            <li> It is very sticky, and has a smell of cucumber I believe,  </li>
            <li> but if you use to much it gets sticky and stays sticky on your skin</li>
            <li> Where this eye gel really shines is reducing puffiness.</li>
            <li> would really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to believe this would be the product for me, but it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very exited to see the ingredient of this eye gel</li>
            <li> and it is really working.</li>
            <li> Used the whole bottle but nothing changed.</li>
            <li> I have really noticed a difference, in the look and feel of my undereye skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using an eye cream that costs twice as much</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think this product helps my bags much at all.  </li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t see any immediate differences</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product......it actually works!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve personally only been using it under my eyes because that is my primary problem area</li>
            <li> I use it on my whole face including under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> In my case, they are starting to smooth out from the inside by the nose and working its way out.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and the item was well packaged.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It is really working.</li>
            <li> graveyard(wasted money)......finally a product that really works.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really seem to notice much change in my skin.</li>
            <li> Did not see much difference</li>
            <li> Also, the substance is cloudy-looking cream and it&#x27;s very creamy.</li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> seems to work really well</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really see a difference</li>
            <li> My job requires me to work all kinds of hours and staring at a computer screen for the whole shift.</li>
            <li> and I used the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> same as the cheap stuff at walmart.</li>
            <li> if u do this U will see fast result.  </li>
            <li> The label says you can treat your whole face to it.  </li>
            <li> Used for 2 weeks, haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in color or puffiness but it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> so that I can put what&#x27;s left on my finger lightly all over my face</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d taken before photo because it really is a noticeable improvement.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li> i really like this product it does really works.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> and I really struggled with taking care of my skin the way I was supposed to.</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> Very soothing.</li>
            <li> did absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> it feels very sticky like glue on your face and you cannot put makeup over it</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet...</li>
            <li> as I use, for me after one week, I could see reasonable improvement under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Very upset that I did not take pictures.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need much to cover under the eye area.</li>
            <li> Texture is light and can definitely be worn under concealer.</li>
            <li> lets you control how much you need.</li>
            <li> it looks like I am well rested and under eye makeup goes on really well.</li>
            <li> If you use too much</li>
            <li> , I do not get much sleep therefore, I also have the undereye puffies....</li>
            <li> really like the plesant odor the eye gel has</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> I needed something that would really work.</li>
            <li> I have really seen a difference.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really experience it to be sticky which I like.  </li>
            <li> Really worked well for me.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend InstaNatural products!</li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> I just finished the whole bottle before I give my review about this product.</li>
            <li> It smells as if it has a bit of cucumber in it and very cooling even though I do not keep it in the refrigerator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HE REALLY DONT LIKE FOR ME TO BE PUTTING STUFF ON HIS FACE</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is gentle.  </li>
            <li> Seems to take years off the skin, highly recommended !</li>
            <li> Works reasonably well for just the 2 weeks I have been using it.  </li>
            <li> I expected more after reading all the reviews.  </li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anybody who wants to try it .</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think it has any scent really.</li>
            <li> I think this could really help with any under eye issues you may have.</li>
            <li> However I do have to say that this is very hydrating.</li>
            <li> doesnt really do anything, used as directed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cooling on the eye, and plumps up the skin under your eye.</li>
            <li> so you really can’t tell but some of the time you can see the circles through the make</li>
            <li> really up close.</li>
            <li> It does not do much for me.</li>
            <li> The better products are more expensive but they get absorbed in skin well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those issues that really bothers me.</li>
            <li> As for wrinkles it really has not helped with that either.</li>
            <li> Before bed  I apply this to my face it drys fast</li>
            <li> I did not see much if any of a difference between the before and after pictures I took.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t feel anything, can&#x27;t real tell much.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I noticed much of a difference from using this product.</li>
            <li> like that this Eye Gel comes in a pump because that lets me control how much I use.  </li>
            <li> The gel doesn’t seem to really have a smell to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Saw absolutely zero improvement after two weeks of routine use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really see any difference.</li>
            <li> formula is also very sticky.</li>
            <li> Do you really want that in a skin cream?  </li>
            <li> It really helps with puffiness.</li>
            <li> to preserve it longer and give a cooling effect that really brightens your skin tone.</li>
            <li> I also didn’t see much of a difference in the amount of redness on my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the size of the container, this is truly a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I have noticed my skin does not seem to break out as much either.</li>
            <li> But it does make the skin under the eyes much smoother and nicer, so I plan to keep using.</li>
            <li> It absorbs really well and doesn&#x27;t ruin my makeup application.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t have much of these to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> but after 6 weeks I don&#x27;t see much of a difference, and I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day, in the morning and evening.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> But I really haven&#x27;t had a skin care routine before this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This seems to be really helping.</li>
            <li> I even used this gel for my whole face once.</li>
            <li> How nice to finally find something that actually does what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> Ok wow... I can&#x27;t believe the stuff actually works!</li>
            <li> It also imparts a kind of natural looking glow without looking wet or shiny.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give the product a fair trial at least using for a month.  </li>
            <li> looks good, but not effective</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and have trouble finding a good natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that the ingredients are specific to what the skin requires to be healthy, plumped, and naturally glowing.</li>
            <li> And any little bit helps, right? :)</li>
            <li> I like this eye gel - it is cool as it goes on and it is easy to use a little or a lot -</li>
            <li> The eye gel seemed to moisturize my whole face so everything seemed to exfoliate all the stiff wrinkly layer leaving a healthy smooth and soft skin.  </li>
            <li> I have become more concerned with my skincare routine over the last couple of years, especially since 30 is right around the corner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love with two children already and pregnant with twins I am never able to sleep and it is very noticeable.</li>
            <li> { and half the price] I will be ordering more very soon!</li>
            <li> I imagine the most important thing I can say is this; I was in the ladies room at work the other day, and as I walked by the mirror, I actually did a double-take.</li>
            <li> , is that the consistency is not so good, because it shows when you put it on, I mean, is not so absorbable,</li>
            <li> I had high hopes because of positive reviews</li>
            <li> I am always willing to try something new</li>
            <li> /&gt;The packaing and pump system is good, no loss of the eye cream with use / execess left on the bottle like some other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, unlike many other companies, this company is very responsive and has reached out to me a couple of times to see how I like their product.</li>
            <li> And let me tell you, it really does banish dark circles and fine lines!</li>
            <li> possibly a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container, contents and sellers are all top notch and professional, this is not a dollar store product, but somewhere in between a prescription and high end salon items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She loved to play with my eyes lately, and I think it’s because they are looking less tired, and more like happy eyes, instead of sleepy eyes.  </li>
            <li> The main thing is that this gel seems to be good for the health of the delicate skin around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, dry skin (70+ in age) that doesn’t “like” many of the products on the market.  </li>
            <li> Some other creams cause my makeup to separate or crease more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products, but am not as satisfied as I am with this one.</li>
            <li> but after continuous use, I could see an extreme change for the better under eyes.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED MANY OTHER PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> You get much more product for your money than other brands too.</li>
            <li> Always looking for the so called &amp;#34;best cream ever.&amp;#34; I ordered their face mask which I love, so I decided to explore their other products.</li>
            <li> Have it two stars instead of one because I love the company and there other products.</li>
            <li> As a women my appearance when I look in the mirror affects my mood for this as well as many other reasons I was eager to try this product</li>
            <li> you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful</li>
            <li> I applied this the night I got it and in the morning, and by the following evening my wrinkles had diminished significantly.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this to use just under my eyes, but by the second night I decided to wear it all over</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I ordered this instead of reordering the other thing.</li>
            <li> After a month of usage, I can say this product works better than other eye creams I have tried.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on other reviews on Amazon, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> they should give lessons to other companies :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on reviews and it being much more affordable than other products.</li>
            <li> it is a better buy than other eye products I&#x27;ve tried, too.  </li>
            <li> Suffering from dark circles under my eyes at times, I was super excited to put this product to the test.  </li>
            <li> Leading into the new year, I have made a conscious effort recently to pay more attention to my skin.</li>
            <li> I have those dreaded eye bags/dark circles that make you appear 10 years older than you really are.</li>
            <li> Plant stem cells, another main ingredient, don’t have much to show for themselves besides hype, but the others are good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on fast and dries quickly, so it doesn&#x27;t take much to add it to your daily</li>
            <li> My dark circles are becoming much lighter!</li>
            <li> skin under my eyes is much firmer, the dark circles are almost not noticeable any more</li>
            <li> and I will absolutely be repurchasing this product until I&#x27;m much, much older.</li>
            <li> like the way it feels immediately after I&#x27;ve applied it for several hours afterward, it&#x27;s a cool and tighter feeling that has a gentle smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I guessed the eye cream is so strong for my skin type that the skin underneath and around my eyes became swollen and turned into dry patches.</li>
            <li> Ok, i have to give a 5 although it really has done nothing for the dark circles.</li>
            <li> Feels cooling and refreshing and really minimizes the dark circles.</li>
            <li> This handy little gel is versatile too!</li>
            <li> It is not greasy or heavy and it soaks into your skin very easily.</li>
            <li> The gel can sometimes make my face feel tight but the next morning, my skin feels soft and looks great.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure not going to waste all these amazing plant stem cells, and peptides, why not get an entire facial treatment?)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there are so many good reviews, I got this because I have dark circles under my eyes and so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I started using this Eye Cream on December 9th, 2014 and while only using a green pea size amount it covered both eye areas, top and lower lip areas, fine laughing lines and my frown lines between my eye brows.  </li>
            <li> This product is fine and gentle on sensitive skin under eyes, forehead  as well as the entire face.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry smooth, very sticky</li>
            <li> and I think that what makes it work better , it did reduce the black under my eyes too much</li>
            <li> It reduces puffiness rather quickly (almost instantly for me) and has been a real life saver when I&#x27;ve had sleepless nights and needed to look my best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product after a late night out with friends, and have been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t given this product for free, I purchased it about 9 months ago and waited this long to post my review.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working pretty well.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was getting some small lines under my eyes and honestly they are gone.  </li>
            <li> See difference in appearance for the better, However, my Dark Circles aren&#x27;t going away.</li>
            <li> Insta Natural was one of the first companies I had the pleasure to review a product for.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better products I&#x27;ve used for the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I was especially interested in the &amp;#34;diminishes dark circles&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> When I first tried is the for day or two - it was WOW.  </li>
            <li> My dark colored bags are getting lighter, so now they&#x27;re able to be covered by makeup.</li>
            <li> I love it because it reduced the look of my dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li> Then I get an email from the seller saying the results would happen in 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m giving it an extra star because it&#x27;s cool, soothing, and there&#x27;s no sticky residue afterwards.</li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes is a bit more firmer, and I have noticed the dark circles disappear when i wear</li>
            <li> Wow exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> It tightens around my eyes taking away most of the puffiness, and visibly reduces the dark circles  under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was happiest about the dark circles under my eyes, which have mostly disappeared.</li>
            <li> After a couple days my under eye bags were somehow tightening up, the puffy was gone and so were most of the dark circles.</li>
            <li> This eye cream (it is actually a gel), feels cool and soothing under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My eyes are looking much better, my dark circles and puffiness are disappearing.</li>
            <li> The rest of my face now matches under my eyes, smooth, and firm, and even better, the lines on my forehead and on my upper lip are almost gone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually pretty damn surprised.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works to reduce dark circles but it sure doesn&#x27;t reduce puffiness and bags.  </li>
            <li> It has helped with the puffiness under my eyes and I&#x27;ve noticed my dark circles are getting better.  </li>
            <li> &gt; eliminate dark circles and give my eyes a more youthful appearance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t have many issues with regard to puffiness or dark circles, I didn&#x27;t expect to see the results that I did.  </li>
            <li> For most of my life I&#x27;ve noticed that I have puffiness and dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Well, Insta Natural emailed me asking if I would be interested in trying out 2 of their products.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t allowed it to work to its full potential.</li>
            <li> It does seem to reduce the appearance of dark circles and puffiness, but it is not my favorite eye cream.</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old and an avid eye gel/cream user.  </li>
            <li> Overall she said its not a bad bra.</li>
            <li> I will order more when i get my credit card bill down a bit.  </li>
            <li> I feel confident that this particular product can help minimize my dark circles and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> You need to make sure to use this every day and use it with the other product  (the InstaNatural Eye SERUM!)</li>
            <li> My circles aren&#x27;t enormously bad but they are more intense than I&#x27;d like them to be; after a lot of research most websites indicate that many of these things don&#x27;t really work well, so I may try an ice mask next.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend trying it out first thing in the morning and right before bed and giving it a few weeks for full results.</li>
            <li> I felt a little more youthful after I got completely ready with my make up and everything.</li>
            <li> it really does a lot of applications I have tried a lot of dark circle treatment products this one is my favorite so far!</li>
            <li> I love this cream because it&#x27;s gentle on my eyes and doesn&#x27;t hurt my overly sensitive skin like other eye creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed it must be doing something, because…if you let it sit wrongly…you can created a new line in your face that really shows when you put on make up.  </li>
            <li> I was almost out of the eye cream I had been using, and it wasn&#x27;t helping much, so I went searching for something new to try.</li>
            <li> I love the way this leaves the skin around my eye feeling, and I have seen a slight difference but nothing too drastic.</li>
            <li> cuz your eyes don&#x27;t look as black more brown</li>
            <li> The circles are more than half gone.</li>
            <li> I bought this more or less just to see any improvement.</li>
            <li> I took some pics on my cell at 2 weeks intervals (more or less) and transferred them to the computer</li>
            <li> The puffiness under her eyes is slightly reduced, which makes her look younger--with more vitality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels slightly sticky at first, but the sticky feeling leaves pretty quickly after putting it on your skin.</li>
            <li> The product is much better than what I had been using previously (L&#x27;Orel Men).</li>
            <li> Absolutely no skin or eye irritation, easy to dispense and use.  </li>
            <li> Seems every morning my eyes looks less swolllen more youthful .</li>
            <li> While this product really helped diminish the dark circles and fine lines around my eyes, it has really helped reduced the &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; under my eyes after 5 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> I cant speak for any older wrinkles though.</li>
            <li> did work really great for those days that I stay up to late and have puffy eyes the next morning.</li>
            <li> I am able to notice a difference after such a short period of time.  </li>
            <li> It dried my skin out so much, that I felt like it made line more visible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that using this will also prevent wrinkles as I become older.</li>
            <li> I used to have really puffy eyes because of lack of sleep but after just a few weeks of using it I was already able to see a difference.</li>
            <li> but mainly it&#x27;s my fault for staying up</li>
            <li> No, my eye area is not perfect, but it sure looks better than it did.</li>
            <li> they look open,  I just ordered a second bottle just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I would say they were mild to moderate in intensity.</li>
            <li> This is even much better than the expensive eye creams that I used before for many years.</li>
            <li> I, too, thought this must be some kind of crazy scam because how could there POSSIBLY be so many five-star reviews ??  </li>
            <li> It makes my puffy, tired looking eye area and makes me look like I am wide awake after a wonderful nights sleep.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly and has this light and subtle fresh/cucumber scent.</li>
            <li> My review of just 3 stars might not be fair as I only used it a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My main issue is that it just didn&#x27;t appear to do anything for my wrinkles or dryness around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This product not only does NOT work but it actually made my eyes MORE puffy than they were before.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> If I ever hear even a hint of this product being discontinued, I will stock pile it to make sure that I have enough to last for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> deeper wrinkles are going to need longer use, I was lucky enough to get a discount on this when i bought it.</li>
            <li> Used many before and a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, after about six weeks I began to see an improvement in under-eye puffiness and the overall youthfulness of the skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I started a week of experience and satisfied with it , i will write the final result in the future</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m near sighted, so I&#x27;ve squinted pretty much my entire life), as well as the very beginnings of crow&#x27;s feet on the outer parts of my eyes, so I apply this pretty much all over the face, including the eyelids themselves.</li>
            <li> I am only on day 6 and cannot believe how quickly the skin around eyes tightens.</li>
            <li> I have used this gel mainly at night, and I have seen some  results</li>
            <li> But the up side to this product is it smells decent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There really is a small scent to me its more of a flowery scent which does not bother me, I apply the gel on first then my make-up.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve finished the entire bottle, taking it apart to get every last drop.</li>
            <li> I used both products, one on my left eye, one on my right, and the other product I used worked much better than this cream.</li>
            <li> I was really really excited for this product with all of its amazingly positive reviews and realistic pictures, but i didn&#x27;t really see a difference with the dark circles.</li>
            <li> honestly, I bought the cream more for the dark circles, figuring when I&#x27;m in my late 70&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back a little over two weeks later and have decided this product works best for me if I use it in the morning only.</li>
            <li> And like the fact that no one has ask me If I need some sleep,that happens at least twice a week (really frustrating).It&#x27;s perfect for travel since is small.</li>
            <li> I have very dark under eyes and this gel has made them very light.</li>
            <li> Feels very natural!</li>
            <li> Nice product I got for free, leaves a slightly sticks residue and smells a little like glue but noticing everyone improvement</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this those who get the &amp;#34;you look tired&amp;#34; remarks.  </li>

            <li> So far, this product has helped my eye area more than any of the other products..  </li>
            <li> This is the only product that has worked on my eye puffiness and dark circles and I&#x27;ve tried MANY!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment if it&#x27;s effective for dark circles and sagging skin because luckily, I don&#x27;t have dark circles or</li>
            <li> also want to mention that you need very little product and the gel is a nice thick formula that applies evenly and smoothly, this product also absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I have also started to notice a nice vertical wrinkle line down the center of my forehead that meets right in between my eyebrows</li>
            <li> ,It has helped with my dark circles,I have also used it on my face and neck and it feels great my skin feels tight.</li>
            <li> Most of the positive and 5 star reviews are by people who received this product for free or at a reduced cost, maybe even fake reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have huge bags and dark circles under my eyes (thank you, genetics) and this stuff has actually minimized them significantly.</li>
            <li> my skib so soft!!</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> I actually saw results the first week of using the product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only use this for a couple weeks and it really works!!</li>
            <li> so my eye lines may take a little more time.</li>
            <li> Better to use a little and let it soak in.</li>
            <li> It makes me look a little better.  </li>
            <li> Would like to have seen a little bit more of a change.</li>
            <li> Either pay a little more and go to Sephora or go to the drug store.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised!!</li>
            <li> On the weekends when I usually do not wear make-up, I will apply once in the morning and once in the afternoon, for hydration!</li>
            <li> It only takes a very small amount, which makes this very cost effective!</li>
            <li> He wanted to find something that would work to make his eyes look a little better.  </li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> and I could really tell the difference with the fine lines and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I apply it all over my face and it has really hydrated my skin while seeing improvement to the dark circles and fine lines around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> The price is reasonable, and I like that it is a natural product that strives for high standards.</li>
            <li> I realized this the hard way the first time I applied this, and then tried to apply foundation cream on top of the gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY other eye creams/gels from other high end manufacturers that did nothing to help me whatsoever and were also full of concerning ingredients and synthetic fragrance that would irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Wow - this product really works.</li>
            <li> so I guess that I really didn&#x27;t give it a chance as far as results go.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like it.</li>
            <li> WOW did it really help heal my skin...</li>
            <li> It is clear and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> So far, I am really liking this gel.</li>
            <li> I really like this so far.</li>
            <li> Im surprised at how much I like it.</li>
            <li> This product goes on clear and you really don&#x27;t even feel like you have something on your face.</li>
            <li> Feels great on tired eyes!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really take the wrinkles away but makes your under-eye area feel ALIVE.  </li>
            <li> Gentle around the eye area, and its made from natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> So far I really like it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t quite used it long enough to say for sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to see more results over the long term, especially once I&#x27;m using twice a day.  </li>
            <li> Along with looking brighter, my skin appears more plump and firm.</li>
            <li> I have used many different products to correct my dark circles but this one really works and the price is so reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Dried my eyes out and made them appear more wrinkled.  </li>
            <li> Aside from that, all of its other aspects are superior to other products.</li>
            <li> hope I get normal eyes</li>
            <li> has gotten close to normal again</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the quality, but not sure if you have to pay more for &#x27;eye&#x27;-only cream in smaller quantity.</li>
            <li> I truly can&#x27;t believe it because most products takes a few weeks to months to recognize any results.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to be careful not to give it a full pump because you&#x27;ll then have too much product for your eyes.</li>
            <li> The puffs under the eyes has also becomes normal</li>
            <li> so you actually get your dollars worth.</li>
            <li> More importantly, I&#x27;m not FEELING any results.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased that I may try the facial moisturizer in the near future.</li>
            <li> (an antioxidant made by combining two peptides, palmitoyl oligopeptide and palmitoyl tetrapepide-7), cucumber, a peptide complex Aloe,  and MSM (Methylsulfonylmethane - improves your body&#x27;s ability to make it own antioxidants).</li>
            <li> This is actually the first one I found that really absorbs into the skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky or greasy, and as soon as you give it a couple minutes to absorb, you can apply makeup on top and it won&#x27;t get messy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The way it has vastly improved the softness, and texture is worth continued use .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ve all had days where we were out of moisturizer or misplaced it and wished something else would work for the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite out of a few brands.</li>
            <li> In summary, I think that, with a few more weeks, the puffiness will continue to diminish.</li>
            <li> There have been few products that can reduce my problems, but none have been able to make such a difference that I find them to be worth it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Should I use it few days more?</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see what happens in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> I will update in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> I usually apply it daily after my evening bath and it feels sooo good on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a consistency like a lighter version of neosporen,  - nice and thick, but not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is nice, the gel is thick and</li>
            <li> It is a nice thick gel that will stay place when you put it on.</li>
            <li> I get good (not great) results.</li>
            <li> I do look less tired which makes me very happy!</li>
            <li> With having an almost 2 year old, I have found myself sleeping less and stressing more.  </li>
            <li> Having had previous experience with InstaNatural products, I was thrilled at receiving an offer to try this at a one-time promotional discount and of course, I instantly accepted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helped with the dark circles and diminished the fine lines that I am beginning to notice as I get older.</li>
            <li> Make sure to dry the product, before moving on to your next step.  </li>
            <li> I only use it at night as it tends to feel a bit dry around my eyes when I put it on and need to put night cream over top of it to help with that feel.</li>
            <li> I have mild under eye darkness, and a few laugh lines around my eyes</li>
            <li> On the bottle, it says it is safe to apply the eye gel to your entire face too so if your end up pumping too much you can put it on other parts of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first two days my eyes were a little puffy, but after that it felt good to apply, although  little sticky.&lt;br /&gt;try</li>
            <li> Also be sure to not pump out too much at once- start with a very small amount and see how much you need to cover all areas.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast  safety seal on first use it I see little improve but still on the first week!</li>
            <li> Instantly you can feel it working because the skin under your eyes will began to tighten right</li>
            <li> Right away I noticed firmness improvement, within a week, my skin has tightened up and has improved the overall &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I decided to switch back and use this eye gel for two months instead of giving up right away.</li>
            <li> I have used this eye cream for half a year, the overall feeling pretty good, even better than what expensive large spleen.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, light freckles, uneven skin tone, small wrinkles, dark circles and puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Either way my dark circles are gone and the fine lines that were starting to appear around my laugh line are gone too.</li>
            <li> It feels cool on application, then solidifies like a dry sweat.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have huge dark spots, but as I&#x27;ve aged it&#x27;s become more apparent that there is some discoloration and sagging.  </li>
            <li> I not only look better than last year but in my opinion, look even younger than my age thanks to this eye gel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product is very watery and absorbs quickly, with no unpleasant perfume smell, however, is not particularly effective.</li>
            <li> The fine lines that were under my eyes are now gone, and the good results from the eye gel got even better - the skin is firmer and my dark circles are even less noticeable (I can tell because I&#x27;ve been using less and less concealer).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light on the skin and does not have any stickiness like some other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> on sides my nose or some other area that could use moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product for free to review, and share my thoughts on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and not sticky like some other gels.</li>
            <li> Need a very small amount, nice gel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although it&#x27;s a little early to see any results, after about 1 week of use, the area around our eyes feels healthier and appears to have a better texture and pigment.</li>
            <li> so I looked for something new to try.  </li>
            <li> In addition to that, I find if I take a break from this for a couple days, the occurrence of new zits rises.</li>
            <li> These two gels are my new favs on days that I don&#x27;t use retinol products.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t noticed any new wrinkles around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I came across this eye gel while looking for a new eye cream.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the new smell.</li>
            <li> The new scent puts me off a bit.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> This product has the perfect mix of ingredients, including a peptide complex, which is hard to find</li>
            <li> I have tried product after product for years to help with the fine lines and dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> this product does want it says it will....remove dark circles, fine lines, etc.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help with fine lines and dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to try with the instanatral eye serum and feel like they have helped with me dark puffy eyes, I have not seen any improvement in fine lines</li>
            <li> Opens up my eyes, reduces swelling, erases dark circles, and softens fine lines.</li>
            <li> I am 31, and have dark circles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> Didnt help with dark circles or fine lines .</li>
            <li> so the jury is still out as to whether it reduces fine lines and dark circles.</li>
            <li> Along with this product and the eye serum I believe it has reduced my dark circles and fine</li>
            <li> I noticed my dark circles and fine lines improved almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> I have dark circles and fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any difference in the appearance of dark circles, puffiness, or fine lines around my eyes after 5 weeks of use 1x a day however.</li>
            <li> No change at all, nothing for fine lines, dark circles, puffiness.</li>
            <li> However, despite this being a gel, which appears to be quite thick when pumped out, it feels light and fresh when applied.  </li>
            <li> but then I only use an amount sufficient to cover the area), so depending on the products you use daily, you might need to take that into consideration.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free copy of this product courtesy of the company for purposes of review.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no way of telling how much is left in the bottle and whether or not it is time to buy more.  </li>
            <li> The next day, when I applied my moisturizer, I realized that I had many rough patches around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I finally feel comfortable going out in public without putting any concealer under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This gel is a 9 out of 10 b/c of how quickly it starts to work, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, has done everything it said it would do for my skin.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, and if your under eye region is dry, you may need to apply eye cream atop this.</li>
            <li> This eye gel contains excellent ingredients like hyaluronic acid, plant stem cells, peptide complex, matrixyl 3000 and amino acid complex.  </li>
            <li> I only recommend products/services I use personally &amp; believe my readers will enjoy and/or benefit from.</li>
            <li> This of course didn’t last as I noticed the lines start to return 8 to 10 hours later, and then filled in again</li>
            <li> It goes on really smoothly and definitely brightens my overall complexion.</li>
            <li> I think people tend to see &amp;#34;#1 Bestseller&amp;#34; and assuming it will work for everyone, and it may work for lots of people but thus far it hasn&#x27;t worked particularly well for me.</li>
            <li> This is a third jar I ordered for him, he cannot live without it !!!</li>
            <li> My dark circles are still there thanks to having three babies, but this makes it seems more bright and less dull.</li>
            <li> Because I have dark circles under my eyes, I am always excited when I get the opportunity to try out a new eye gel!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received a long skinny bottle that Almost looks like the real one..and it BURNS MY EYE!!</li>

            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin and have had no adverse effects....highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I wear contact lenses and have very sensitive skin</li>

            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The area around my eyes stay very soft and moisturized for the longest time.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to products with fragrance and this brand has nailed it.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural&#x27;s Youth Express Eye Gel does not irritate my eyelids and I have VERY sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Also, I have very, very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin which wasn&#x27;t bothered at all.</li>
            <li> Start with very little and add more if needed.  </li>
            <li> I did not notice a huge difference with dark circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 9 months and don&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the dark circles under my eyes, but I think that might have to do with my sleep and not the product.</li>
            <li> but I just have not seen a huge improvement in my dark circles.</li>
            <li> With consistent application, I began to see results in a relatively short time.</li>
            <li> This is the first eye cream on Amazon that actually worked on me.</li>
            <li> It works a lot better than several other products I have used over the years.</li>
            <li> I order from Amazon all the time and this is the first review I have ever left</li>
            <li> I actually noticed a difference in the first week of using it.</li>
            <li> Barely any scent, dries fast, and does not crumble.</li>
            <li> I have used several products, priced 5X higher.</li>
            <li> This is the first thing I have ever used that actually works.</li>
            <li> Im going to continue using until the product is done since it wont hurt, maybe then ill see more significant results.</li>
            <li> First impressions -- Terrific smell..like cucumbers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Puffiness: almost completely eliminated&lt;br /&gt;color: improved, retuned almost to normal</li>
            <li> For the first two weeks, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference but around week 3 I realized that the deep lines around my eyes</li>
            <li> not every skin needs the same thing but with the company guaranteeing their product it makes trying on a product much easier!  </li>
            <li> Better improvement for the past 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> There is a very small, light scent that disappears once absorbed.</li>
            <li> So far I like this!</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning and at night, (just a small amount), and I am really pleased with the change in my appearance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think one actually works better than the other.</li>
            <li> This product has lightened the dark circles and help smooth wrinkles around her eyes.  </li>
            <li> However, my fine eye lines and jowel lines seem to be less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> 5 stars for this company in general, I am absolutely in love!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you InstaNatural for naturally making my face breakout!</li>
            <li> First time writing actually on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and rosacea and after three weeks have no irritation!  </li>
            <li> I used it exactly as directed, twice daily for the 8 weeks they told me to use it, and I had zero results.</li>
            <li> I have tried so far!</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle, first one lasted about three months because I choose to apply the gel generously</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m perhaps a fourth of the way through my first container.</li>
            <li> Quite simply - it does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li> I’ve used several other InstaNatural products and have been pleased with them</li>
            <li> Most of the under eye treatments that I’ve used in the past have been in the form of a serum or moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye wrinkle creams, but this is the first one that has actually worked for me.  </li>
            <li> The scent is extremely light, almost nonexistent, but has a subtle crispy fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> A little of the product goes a long way and it feels really nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Because they are made with all natural products, they are not stinking, sticking, greasy or chemically like so many other facial products out there.  </li>
            <li> decided to treat myself to a new lotion since the old one didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> First few weeks i thought it was effective because of the tight feeling around the eyes but after a month i didn&#x27;t see any change.</li>
            <li> More importantly to me however, was that the second morning my eyes were impressively less puffy and dark.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles are still there since they are inherited but much, much better than last year.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin under my eyes sticky/tacky and if I smile real wide my skin sticks together and not putting to much on.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate their willingness to go the extra mile, which is not common these days.  </li>
            <li> The stickiness creates a shine that actually accentuates any bags or dark circles you may have making them seem even more visible.</li>
            <li> I had medium dark circles, mostly under my eyes, and moderate puffiness.</li>
            <li> I have only used about 1/2 of the first container and so far I see no difference.</li>
            <li> The scent of the product is faint and pleasant.</li>
            <li> I previously was using the more expensive Lucene eye day creams which was delightfully rich and alleviated dryness but almost made my eyes look visibly more tired.</li>
            <li> When i use those high end very rich eye creams, I will have little white bumps under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my very sensitive skin at all and it absorbs into my skin completely.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my forehead and upper lip line in combination with the Hyaluronic Acid serum which is hands down my favorite of all the InstaNatural products.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it with patience for the last 3 months to see if it would make any positive difference</li>
            <li> My results actually make me question the overwhelmingly positive reviews on this site.</li>
            <li> The cool feeling on application is wonderful and kicks those tired looking eyes in the behind!</li>
            <li> have put this product really close to my eyes since I was trying to cover the entire bottom dark circle under my eye and sometimes it gets in my eyes but does not burn which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my dark circles have gotten significantly lighter, they haven&#x27;t gone away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It helps significantly with the puffiness under my eyes and in combination with InstaNatural Eye Serum, it has lessened my dark circles.</li>
            <li> But other than that, The gel feels cool when applied.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other night creams that claim to do this, but those seem to leave a burning sensation, this is simply cool and tight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wrinkles have gotten much better, the puffiness is gone and I only have slight darkness in two area under my eyes.</li>
            <li> My eyes look much less puffy, skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I did not expect to see such a big difference so quickly.</li>
            <li> Skin is tight and smooth.</li>
            <li> As with many serums, this one does need a few minutes to be fully absorbed and will feel sticky if you don’t wait long enough to put on your makeup after using</li>
            <li> I had some dry skin that kept peeling off right at my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and it does minimize fine lines.</li>
            <li> It works on my puffed eyes and eases my dried fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t see a ton of difference from it other than my dark circles</li>
            <li> eye gel is thick, clear and has a pleasant hardly detectable fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I use it both under my eyes and especially to help tighten and smooth the loose skin under my eyebrows/above my lids.</li>
            <li> After only using the product for about a month, I noticed a large improvement in the condition of the skin beneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> I guess this works only on certain skins types.</li>
            <li> It was a bit tight so she suggest that you go up to the next size if you arent sure.</li>
            <li> Large size bottle considering it only is under her eyes.  </li>
            <li> I also put a little on my forehead to smooth out wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have seen greater results with this in a few weeks, than with months of consistent usage of other products.</li>
            <li> I never would have believed that a product with most if not all of  todays &amp;#34;trendy miracle ingredients&amp;#34; could cost so little compared to the $200 products that have only one or two of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> , I just noticed the under eye area looking different and a little bit better than before applying.</li>
            <li> Easier to use than the last one I tried and seems to do a little better reducing puffiness around the lower eye areas.  </li>
            <li> but it really isn&#x27;t a big deal to put a little lotion on top.</li>
            <li> now will update review later once I use product a little more</li>
            <li> This dried out the skin around my eyes so much that it actually accentuated my fine lines.</li>
            <li> OK product - a little sticky to use under makeup so using it at night only</li>
            <li> You can see results rather quickly from this product compared to a lot of other products that are supposed to reduce puffiness.</li>
            <li> As far as the consistency goes, it&#x27;s similar to a gel shaving cream, but maybe a little more lightweight.</li>
            <li> First, it does not produce allergic reactions (I am a sensitive skin), secondly it reduces the large bags, but bags will not completely disappear.</li>
            <li> Made my under  eye Sticky, not worth the price, it doesn&#x27;t work, why positive reviews ??!!</li>
            <li> huge downfall is/was the fact that it came in messy as hell.</li>
            <li> I did see straight away, even after the first use, was a lessening of the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s clear and unscented.</li>
            <li> twin 10 year old twin daughters, a 22 month old daughter and a 3 month old daughter.  </li>
            <li> I really like the consistency of this product and noticed the dark circles really evaporating!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m clearly sold.</li>
            <li> I eat organic so my skin is clear, but father time was taking a toll on my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear and absorbs almost immediately.</li>
            <li> doesnt work another con stay clear</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was cheap, the reviews were good, and I really hate going to the mall.</li>
            <li> It doesn’t have a smell and is clear.</li>
            <li> It is clear</li>
            <li> This is a clear gel</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old, male,  work too much</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Eye Cream is a clear gel that is to be used to fight the signs of aging.  </li>
            <li> I was kinda surprised because I almost never do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is also reasonable, so that will keep me coming back too.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Takes about 2 months to really notice difference, but patience it the key with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and so far no results whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I used to have really noticeable bags under my eyes and have been looking for a product that actually works.</li>
            <li> Its also all NATURAL.</li>
            <li> So I would keep on using the gel at least around my eyes for sure</li>
            <li> This really works to lessen puffiness and leave your face overall smoother and softer.  </li>
            <li> I would even go so far as to say my skin has</li>
            <li> I like natural ingredients used for this product.  </li>
            <li> I am using the whole line of facial products from InstaNatural and seeing quite a difference.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combination skin and no irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Get ready to give the skin around your eyes that extra boost!</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the results in what it did for my undereye puffiness.</li>
            <li> 30 days into it, no noticeable effect thus far.</li>
            <li> It really hasn&#x27;t done anything, but it hasn&#x27;t given me a rash either, so I guess my verdict for this product is a solid &amp;#34;Meh&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Fits my skin and soft</li>
            <li> So far, I see results in the color (darkness) of the circles under my eyes...</li>

            <li> am in my early 30s</li>
            <li> Noticed considerable change in puffiness after about three to four weeks.  </li>
            <li> No cream or eye gel is going to completely get rid of your crows feet and puffiness--</li>
            <li> But it is still a bit early.</li>
            <li> It took about a week of dedicated use to make them completely disappear</li>
            <li> I had yo stop because I was sensitive to some ingredient</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 yrs old, I&#x27;m not struggling with wrinkles, but his product gives me the appearence that I do.</li>
            <li> I am looking brighter eyed every day, even though I am still the rundown mother of an almost two year old.  </li>

            <li> There is only so much you can do as you age.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 yrs old</li>
            <li> I will not recommend this product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, this is not a fragranced product.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy on the skin</li>
            <li> Plus I look for all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> were so far out of my price range</li>
            <li> but it really gets the puffiness out.i especially like</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Probably because it&#x27;s a natural scent as opposed to man-made.</li>
            <li> Inferior to professional grade creams.</li>
            <li> So far, I like how this feels on my baggy eyes.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that it worked</li>
            <li> However the second time I bought the product, and started using it, it caused burning, itching, flakey skin and my eyes are VERY puffy and irritated.</li>
            <li> I am going to order second bottle thanks I recommend</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t cause any issues for me at all.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this product and appreciate the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> So much so that I&#x27;ve decided to apply it to my entire face.</li>
            <li> The product goes far.  </li>
            <li> nothing to much as to make you hesitant to use this product again just enough to let you know</li>
            <li> for the formula, my sensitive eyes didn&#x27;t even seem to notice I had it on.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference and this stuff cakes up near the corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li> One pump is enough for the whole face, not just eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Soft?</li>
            <li> * Very slight brightening of skin (fresher look) and reduction in fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> the natural ingredients contained, as opposed to harmful</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised..</li>
            <li> Completely reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they will go away completely since I have them by genetics.</li>
            <li> so far I have yet to find an eye cream that made any difference.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several and they haven&#x27;t really done what they claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever used after trying dozens, that truly works for puffiness, circles, lines, and makes my eyes look very youthful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised.  </li>
            <li> It did not firm or plump my skin around the eye area</li>
            <li> Got it yesterday and so far no change.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> /&gt;It didn&#x27;t work for people with sensitive skin like me</li>
            <li> As far as the product and if works I don&#x27;t know yet, after using it for awhile</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for 6 weeks now; no results so far.</li>
            <li> I have tried different eye creams with massage my eye area to eliminate them but they are really stubborn.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and protected from the elements all day.</li>
            <li> so I was definitely surprised.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve seen some results.</li>
            <li> like this product so much that when I reordered, I purchased an extra to give to my sister!</li>
            <li> Works well so far.</li>
            <li> I am a mom of a 4 year old and</li>
            <li> let it try completely before applying any face creams or makeup over it.</li>
            <li> not irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Really would like to get my money back....</li>
            <li> - I did try it on the crease between my eyebrows (the one you get from frowning a lot) and it is now completely gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far this product has made my skin just feel healthier.</li>
            <li> , I received a follow up email enquiring about my impress thus far.  </li>
            <li> and I did notice a marked change, but I will continue to use it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate or aggravate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Surprised.</li>
            <li> I am 23 years old</li>
            <li> I am surprised that the directions for this gel says to apply to the eye, four head, and cheek areas...  </li>
            <li> but so far I think it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> so I could have that extra cooling effect and it worked out very well.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also a natural product.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> and wow.  </li>
            <li> So far I do like this gel.  </li>
            <li> I hope this company goes far because they can be a model for</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and had no reactions when I used it.</li>
            <li> I remember my Mom pointing this out to me when I was 16 years old.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> so far no sign of improved at all.</li>
            <li> Nothing so far</li>
            <li> I am 45 yrs old and this product helps me keep youthful skin.</li>
            <li> I really like that I can instantly feel the product working.</li>
            <li> I can really see a difference in the crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes and also the sagging upper lid.</li>
            <li> but I have to for all those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I used it for two months straight and the bags got bigger and the circles were not improved.</li>
            <li> , as far as results go, I did notice that the saggy part under my eye has faded a bit, which is why I&#x27;m giving this review a 3 star.</li>
            <li> and I always get about twice as much product as I feel necessary.</li>
            <li> The gel is so gentle that I use it on my entire face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I am 50 years old and people have asked me what cream I am using.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but so far I give it</li>
            <li> WOW  </li>
            <li> Oh yes, my eyes don&#x27;t seem to be old and</li>
            <li> I just happened to try this because I am a frequent Amazon customer and searched eye creams and the eye gel</li>
            <li> I like it so far.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still early</li>
            <li> I expect any eye product I use to help me wake to eyes not so old and weathered looking.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am completely amazed.  </li>
            <li> do not waste your time or money</li>
            <li> My face is extremely sensitive to products.</li>
            <li> (no need to wear makeup when the only people seeing you are two and could give really give a you-know-what).</li>
            <li> I will complete a review when I see results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I have sensitive eyes.)</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t completely make the darkness disappear, but it did help lighten and brighten my eye area.</li>
            <li> so far, I can tell after I have applied as it makes my skin tighter.</li>
            <li> I am 48 years old and have noticed that my skin is lacking elasticity and radiance.  </li>
            <li> Of course your mileage may vary, she must have been allergic to one of the ingredients, and of course the word natural in the name means nothing</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and no sensitivity at all to the gel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is some overall improvement after about a week, but not so much after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Second bottle for me and really like this product.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the first time I used it, can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results</li>
            <li> So far I see no difference.</li>
            <li> My under eye wrinkles are almost completely gone...</li>
            <li> do not waste your money on this item.</li>
            <li> I will update this review in about a month after I have been using it longer and let you know about how it does as far as my wrinkles are concerned.  </li>
            <li> It really lifts my upper eye area.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product from Insta Natural</li>
            <li> He likes that it&#x27;s made from natural products and it didn&#x27;t cause his skin or eyes irritation.  </li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t really helped my specific eye problems, sometimes it stings the skin.</li>
            <li> Could be do to sensitive skin.. or reaction to ingredients.</li>
            <li> Its Insta Natural Eye Gel.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes is sensitive and this product has no burn at all, not even a tingle.</li>
            <li> If your skin is sensitive then this is the eye gel for you.</li>
            <li> well maybe my skin is too sensitive?</li>
            <li> and it did not bother my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I put some of the gel around my eyes and I felt a firming action with this.</li>
            <li> a 51 year old guy is the reason I didn&#x27;t see any change.</li>
            <li> Its too early to see any improvements with wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This moisturizes her skin and makes it feels soft.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue using this and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It had no harsh smell that hurt when I put it by my eyes.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin feel soft, refreshed, and taught.</li>
            <li> I go to bed early and get up early.</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin you may feel a bit of a sting.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> However, seller honored return policy and like that it has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> NOT heavy or sticky.  </li>
            <li> and so far I&#x27;ve had no problems.</li>
            <li> I tried the Eye Gel and after only one week I could see that my eye area is more firm and plump.</li>
            <li> The gel is thick and goes smoothly with ease absorbing</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t get to use the product long enough to determine if its claims hold true.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, and you can apply makeup on top in a few short minutes.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had quite a bit of sleep over the last few days, but my eyes look much better.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and invest in something that actually works, even if more pricey.</li>
            <li> It also softens and hydrates the eye area, making those fine lines much less apparent.  </li>
            <li> The good reviews must be fake.  </li>
            <li> It is not too expensive and makes me feel good.</li>
            <li> , you don&#x27;t need very much at all so the bottle lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so runny in terms of consistency but other than that it is pretty decent and my skin seems to like it.</li>
            <li> And while I can&#x27;t say it really got rid of the dark circles, it did seem to brighten up my eye area and make them a bit less noticible and much more refreshed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used some of the more expensive brands and thought I&#x27;d try this for the right price</li>
            <li> but later that night, the skin under my right eye started to turn red too.</li>
            <li> I experimented and applied only around my right eye and observed zero difference with my left.</li>
            <li> And buy sticky, I mean like after a hour or more after I applied it.</li>
            <li> Though there are many moisturizer creams, serums, and gels on the market they vary in the ability to perform, likely due to skin type and overall health condition of a well hydrated person.</li>
            <li> I apply the eye gel first and allow it to dry and then apply the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> it is a small pump bottle that can be easily tossed into an over night bag and taken along on trips or placed neatly in you vanity or bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> Mine aren&#x27;t super dark</li>
            <li> The gel feels cool and slightly tingly after application, sensations which go away after a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a slight cool</li>
            <li> Originally I purchased this eye gel for my husband who has very dark under eye circles and bagginess.  </li>
            <li> It diminishes fine lines and definitely decreases bags and dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Definitely works for dark circles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I actually am going to get a bottle for my mother in law, this should be in every young women and older women’s beauty cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually am going to get a bottle for my mother in law, this should be in every young women and older women’s beauty cabinet.  </li>
            <li> It was super cooling and made my puffiness go down.</li>
            <li> Luckily the hives are going down now, but this cream will be going in the trash.</li>
            <li> Also, I was at my salon and when I looked in the mirror I was shocked at how good my under eyes looked!  </li>
            <li> Not only is the package HUGE for an eye gel - a teeny tiny bit can go a long way.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Also, little goes a long way and make sure if you use ANY type of eye creams, you dab it, not slide or massage it.</li>
            <li> The only fly in the ointment is that the dispenser sometimes sticks - and the process of getting it unstuck usually results in wasted product.</li>
            <li> Since using this eye gel the darkness has faded drastically and I pretty much have no puffiness anymore despite the fact that my kids let me get little rest.</li>
            <li> As far as under eye wrinkles go, i have actually noticed a small difference, but more than anything I feel like i&#x27;m prventing wrinkles by using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using a wet washcloth with hot water but that only does so much.  </li>
            <li> Been using this for a few months, haven&#x27;t seen any significant results.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying that I am 28 years old and have had some fairly noticeable under eye circles for the past few years.</li>
            <li> Being an older lady with very sensitive and dry skin, especially around my eyes, I found this eye gel very soothing and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Honestly didn&#x27;t see any dramatic change or improvement</li>
            <li> I mentioned that I did not see any diminishing of fine lines and wrinkles, and was told that it usually takes about 2 months to see a difference.  </li>
            <li> Seriously works magic.</li>
            <li> Try it first before you opt for a more expensive eye gel/creme.</li>
            <li> Whatever the case, as the years past, I’ve tried so many different products in hopes to try to reduce the puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I felt and looked ten years older.</li>
            <li> As we get older there is not enough we can do to help our eyes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how quickly this product begins to make improvements and you can&#x27;t beat the price- so much less than department store eye gels.</li>
            <li> I really believe this product does help with puffiness but don&#x27;t really see a difference with dark circles.  </li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s primary purpose is to be used under and around your eyes to diminish dark circles, wrinkles, and improve the overall appearance of your eye area.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change the first few days.</li>
            <li> I have tried several times to find a way to open the container to perhaps scrape the extra off my finger back into the bottle, but I haven&#x27;t been able to get it open.  </li>
            <li> I will keep using it as a part of my normal skin routine until it is out, but will probably go back to my old faithfuls.</li>
            <li> I stay up late and get some major dark circles this has reduced them greatly with daily use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent enough basic moisturizer but because the misleading advertising and high price tag</li>
            <li> The product is very easy to use and according to my husband it does help with tired eyes.  </li>
            <li> My eyes get very puffy overnight and the gel really helps bring down the puffiness</li>
            <li> but I am already using other products right now</li>
            <li> I dont understand how this eye gel has such a high rating.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to use it day and night and highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for people who do not want facial products with a chemical smell nor a lot of additives.</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase from them again and highly recommend both the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product - it won&#x27;t give you back the sleep you missed, but it can help you look refreshed anyway!</li>
            <li> First of all I want to say that I was skeptical about buying this because of all the good reviews and not sure if they were real or not.</li>
            <li> It is fairly light and has a very subtle smell, but except for a tiny cool feelings it provides, I don&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
            <li> The product is priced right and lasts long as you only need a pea size drop for each eye.</li>
            <li> I had been using this gel little more then two weeks and compare to many expensive eye creams</li>
            <li> The product is a lightweight gel that has just the very faintest hint of cucumber scent; nothing strong or irritating.</li>
            <li> While my dark circles haven&#x27;t totally disappeared, they are less visible and my whole face radiates a softer and more even complexion.  </li>
            <li> Instant smoothness, blends into skin completely and very fast, brightens my tired eyes, and smoothed out my fine lines within seconds.</li>
            <li> the next morning, there is a HUGE mess inside the lid.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it for long because well, I didn&#x27;t really need it.</li>
            <li> Apparently, I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this during a long trip to Vegas because I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be getting much sleep.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I recommend this to anyone seeking products for advanced signs of aging,  </li>
            <li> Take a small amount of the gel with your ring fingers, and lightly dab onto the eye area.</li>
            <li> Seller very helpful when I had a minor issue , send replacement....</li>
            <li> It has a natural cucumber scent that is barely there</li>
            <li> I am 41 years old and was starting to look older around the eyes but after using this for 3-4 months, look much more awake and definitely a slight reduction too in dark circles.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you experience puffiness or dark circles.</li>
            <li> No dark circles or puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Messed me up enough to write reviews when I normally don&#x27;t write reviews at all.</li>
            <li> I only use it on my eyes, though it says to also put on forhead and cheeks, my eyes don&#x27;t have that tired look anymore, the dc are getting lighter and it&#x27;s much firmer around my eyes, love it,</li>
            <li> I have no dark circles or puffiness.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I found the INSTANATURAL EYE CREAM FOR DARK CIRCLES, PUFFINESS, WRINKLES, AND BAGS to be quite effective and would recommend it to anyone looking to get rid of dark circles, puffiness, wrinkles, or bags around their eyes.</li>
            <li> So cool and hydrating without being heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for approximately one month and have found it to be just as good as the more expensive eye creams.  </li>
            <li> All it seems to do it cool the skin for few mins</li>
            <li> I have always had super dark under eyes!</li>
            <li> Seems to calm down puffiness</li>
            <li> Lift, Firm, Tighten Facial Skin and Fade Fine Lines - 1.5oz]]  </li>
            <li> Gently pat it around the eye area and if there is extra, smooth it above brow line and over the small area between the brows which is prone to hold wrinkles.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much so this container lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li> I do recommend it to those looking to try something new that actually works!</li>
            <li> I will now have to get used to my new face - because I look very different!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit &amp; Planet&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;</li>
            <li> Truly a miracle product, especially for this night owl who started a new job that begins at 6am.</li>
            <li> gravity has lowered them to a new low.</li>
            <li> This is more of a softening effect and an improvement of the overall texture of the delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve used it long enough to really see any measurable results, but I think as I keep using it, I&#x27;ll see something!</li>
            <li> Only draw back is that often pump out to much of the gel, but</li>
            <li> People think I&#x27;m in my early to mid 30s, but lately I&#x27;ve noticed an area under my left eye near the top of my cheek that looks &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Especially the thinner, more delicate skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> so that meant can&#x27;t hide white flakes on my under eye bag as much as like female (can&#x27;t make up as like</li>
            <li> Now I have no darkness whatsoever under my eyes, my eyes look even younger and this product just makes me feel like I&#x27;m really nourishing my skin and preventing any of those issues from developing in the future.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural product comes as a clear gel and has a nice faint cucumber scent.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, with the pump it is easy to control the amount you need each time.</li>
            <li> These two came in packages similar to the store and was very professional.  </li>
            <li> At this rate, they will be gone before I use up this single reasonably priced container.</li>
            <li> Stress lack of sleep and health have caused the dark circles under my eyes to become even more noticeable over the last few months and as a result I have started to look much older and sickly/tiered</li>
            <li> No other product I have tried came even close.</li>
            <li> In addition to major discoloration under the eyes, I also have puffiness and this does help somewhat to decrease that.  </li>
            <li> I suspect one would need to use this product continuously and long-term for any major changes to be noticed.</li>
            <li> All the products are plumping (firming) and they compliment each other very well!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much of a problem with dark circles unless I stay up way too late for many nights in a row...</li>
            <li> The pump dispenses a little more than needed but other than that would recommend</li>
            <li> Will continue using to see if a major difference happens.</li>
            <li> Definitely keeps the area hydrated and my makeup goes on seamlessly over it!</li>
            <li> and i see a major differences.</li>
            <li> Item stung a bit when first put on and as other describe the does &amp;#34;pile&amp;#34; and leave a sticky residue.</li>
            <li> pump provides a generous amount of gel with a full pump; if using this around your eyes, a half pump is likely sufficient.  </li>
            <li> This leaves my under eyes feeling tight and fresh.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER- as a new mom with horrible bags and dullness not to mention a lifetime of sensitive skin and periodically stress-induced adult acne, it is a HUGE achievement for a product to not irritate my skin while simultaneously making it feel amazing.</li>
            <li> One pump supplies more than enough gel for a single application, so maybe just press the pump down half-way to make the quantity last longer.</li>
            <li> so I will continue to use it, and the bottle is huge, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I wish it had worked on my dark circles a little better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this at night only right now because I have some other eye product I need to use up.  </li>
            <li> It also would cause little red bumps if it was absorbed anywhere near my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple months, but it goes on smoothly, need very little</li>
            <li> In general I found this product to be somewhat helpful in regard to skin tone issues and puffiness under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I generally have problems with eye creams-</li>
            <li> It is also a very generous amount and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is clear and thinner than another gel I&#x27;ve used with similar ingredients (I like that one also).  </li>
            <li> Very soothing application that feels cool on tired under eye area.</li>
            <li> If I say one request, product with clear bottle otherwise you can not tell how much is left.</li>
            <li> The gel itself goes on smoothly and only requires a small squirt to cover under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The only thing this gel hasn&#x27;t done is clear up my under eye circles, but it has improved the tone a bit.</li>
            <li> After all, I had been using it for over a month, but when I decided to test by not using it for a couple days, by the second day my eyes were clear.</li>
            <li> I use contacts so I am constantly tugging and pulling at the sensitive area around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I was told by a lady that I should try some eye cream because old age is starting to catch up to me.</li>
            <li> If a zit got popped, it used to take up to 5-7 days for it to completely heal, but once you apply this, it only takes a day or two.</li>
            <li> My review is based on nearly 4 weeks daily usage.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Have not seen a big differrence so far; have been using it for a while now.</li>
            <li> I am a 60 year old male and when people took pictures of me it looked like my eyes are shut now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66 years old and have lived with under eye bags for several years, considering surgery.  </li>
            <li> But I barely notice any improvement.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to using it all the way to my upper eyelashes as I never go that far with anything since lotions, etc.</li>
            <li> I am 69 years old and have big puffy, purple bags under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like that it is all natural ingredients, and they offer a 100% money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 eye creams and facial creams so far</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even work without every 8th person asking me why I&#x27;m not in class and questioning if I&#x27;m old enough to sell cigarettes.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned I have only been using these products for three weeks, and it is recommended that you use them for two months before you see complete results.  </li>
            <li> I honestly never expected them to accommodate me the way that they did.</li>
            <li> Started using the cream for 3 weeks I have not noted much different As far as wrinkle/ lifting go.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it too because it&#x27;s not a heavy cream which I don&#x27;t like using, especially during the sticky summer months.</li>
            <li> BTW, i actually got the idea for putting it all over the face and neck from another reviewer, she said it made her skin soft.</li>
            <li> Works well with my bare minerals makeup.  </li>
            <li> I am 37 years old and am starting to see bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Left my skin soft.</li>
            <li> They might be developed by different teams...</li>
            <li> and I barely notice it.</li>
            <li> Really upset i  spent money on this</li>
            <li> I have used a whole bottle now and have noticed minimal results.</li>
            <li> I really have not really seen a difference under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 42 year old female and have been using this product for a week now.</li>
            <li> and I was starting to look old.  </li>
            <li> I am 46 years old and battle daily with under eye bags.  </li>
            <li> Since using this product, the circles and rings under my eyes have diminished considerably and I&#x27;ve only been using it for one month.  </li>
            <li> , I get sent tons of products, but Insta Natural actually works!</li>
            <li> and it was completely gone by second week.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in my dark circles and wrinkles within 3 weeks, and my skin has continued to improve with the consistent use.</li>
            <li> I had pretty baggy eyes that were always puffy and dark.  </li>
            <li> I have the pleasure of being a victim of dark circles, so i was excited to try this product out.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried them all, from the cheapest to the most expensive (well almost the most expensive) with minor results, a lot of frustration, and a drawer full of leftovers.  </li>
            <li> Moderate success with my dark circles</li>
            <li> I have tested quite a few products when it comes to skin care and while I don&#x27;t have too many issues with puffy eyes or dark circles, I do get them from time to time.  </li>
            <li> The puffiness has definitely decreased and I look more wide-eyed, refreshed, and awake in the morning after applying this.  </li>
            <li> I do look more alert and not as tired.</li>
            <li> You get weird looks when you are 27 and  have reasonably nice skin and show up with bags under your eyes on a Tuesday.</li>
            <li> (I laugh a lot) were about half the depth they were and by week 4 they are gone!  </li>
            <li> Bought 3 InstaNatural products, used for 3 days (eye cream, moisturizer, and another serum) and made my perfect skin break out with very painful pimples all over my chin and neck.</li>
            <li> She is an active, troublemaking little buggar that I love to the moon and back.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel tighter, not uncomfortably tight but just enough that I can feel it’s working.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and really small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Insta Natural Under Eye Treatment on the other hand is more like a gel or ointment because it’s thick.</li>
            <li> First off you get so much product in this tube and a little definitely goes a long well.</li>
            <li> I am willing to get cosmetic procedures (botox etc) but not full on general surgery, to refresh my face.</li>
            <li> Notice a difference, it doesn&#x27;t take 20 years off or anything but the skin around my eyes is less puffy and above my eyelids is less droopy and more elastic</li>
            <li> Just a heads up though, you may experience a slight stingy feeling when you first apply it- doesn&#x27;t happen anymore but happened in beginning.</li>
            <li> My normal routine is to wash my face/neck with my Clarisonic in the evenings, apply NuFountain&#x27;s C20+Lightening vitamin C serum, allow that to dry and then use this eye gel.  </li>
            <li> two detriments are (a) it stings a little; I have pretty sensitive skin and that part of your face is very fragile, so</li>
            <li> The eye gel has minimized the fine lines around my eyes and around my lips enough that I now don&#x27;t feel the need for fillers, at least at this time.</li>
            <li> I hope to see lighter dark circles after a few more months of use, but within a month, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed and felt a difference in the texture of my skin</li>
            <li> There were no first day results to mention however after just two or three days of using this product I did see very noticeable results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of other products that ranged from very pricey &#x27;high-end&#x27; brands to cheaper &#x27;low-end&#x27; brands.</li>
            <li> I use other products from the InstaNatural line, and I think all of them combined together have really helped my skin.</li>
            <li> I also found that no matter how little I used, the product left my eyes looking greasy even after it fully absorbed.</li>
            <li> Applied everyday as directed, noticed no signs of improvement, felt my face a little more moist that&#x27;s about it</li>
            <li> I would invest a little more money and get something that works, and don&#x27;t waste your time (or money) on this product.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been using a little extra for between my eyes and in my smile lines.)</li>
            <li> The puffiness goes away instantly, the dark circles are looking better everyday.</li>
            <li> Right after you apply it, there is a faint cucumber-ish scent which is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping InstaNatural will keep manufacturing this gel for the next 20 yrs because I will sure be buying it for at least that long!</li>
            <li> I am finally looking well rested and refreshed even though I&#x27;m the complete opposite with my newest addition to the family</li>
            <li> THANKFULLY the only eye issues I have (which developed only this year) is bags and puffiness</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s the only product I have bought that actually works!</li>
            <li> At first you may feel that the result is just the drying of the gel that is contracting the bags and dark circles, but it persists and improves on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> One person actually didn&#x27;t recognize me and later told me she was thinking, &amp;#34;Who is that young women?&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I’ve spent much of my adult like working shift work, plus I’m a busy mother and freelancer.</li>
            <li> I noticed that I was starting to get puffy eyes and dark circles along with the first signs of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My dark circles almost exactly the same as it was from the beginning.</li>
            <li> im a 26yr old african american and</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this stuff, but it burned my eyes like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I can apply powdered bronzer on top and it never flakes like some reviewers mentioned - you really only need a THIN layer.</li>
            <li> It really does help your skin look less tired and more youthful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not as moisturizing as some eye creams but is a gel and does not dry out the skin either.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after 3 days, I developed a severe allergic reaction, causing a rash on most of my body.  </li>
            <li> reference, I&#x27;m 39 and starting to notice the tired eyes showing up more often.</li>
            <li> I have bought so many eye creams to try and decrease eye puffiness and an overall tired look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a week so not sure of the long-term benefits, but eye area feels cool, toned and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> My face, and especially under my eyes, are so firm and plump, this is well worth your money...</li>
            <li> I think this product would work to resolve certain issues, but i think the cause of my dark circles aren&#x27;t something that this product can fix.  </li>
            <li> My eyes certainly show it with dark circles and puffiness, which I’ve sought a solution for years.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it - he has seen major improvements in over 2 - 3 weeks with daily use</li>
            <li> I used it consistently for a little over two months before giving up on it.</li>
            <li> I would use this all over my face if I had really thin, sensitive skin - or if I had really oily skin and didn&#x27;t want an oil-based serum sitting on top of an oil slick.  </li>
            <li> , if not for the entire face.&lt;br /&gt;It feels cool when applied and smells like cucumber, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I see less fine lines and less under eye circles.</li>
            <li> After applying the first time at night, when you wake up the next morning, you can see your eyes will be less puffy than if you didn&#x27;t use the InstaNatural Eye Gel.</li>
            <li> but when you let it dry and put concealer on, it goes back to normal.</li>
            <li> Hard to compare to other brands, but have been pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> and I find it hard to say which is better than the other.</li>
            <li> My under-eye area is noticeably (by feel and to the naked eye) more firm and overall less tired-looking.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really know about dark circles because i don&#x27;t have them.</li>
            <li> really helped with my dark circles and blemishes on my cheeks too.</li>
            <li> for the dark undereye circles and wrinkles, I have not seen much improvement in those aspects yet.</li>
            <li> Cannot really comment on the dark circles as that has not been an issue.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my medium dark circles very dissapointed</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much of a difference yet in the dark circles.  </li>
            <li> It is working very well to conceal under eye bags and dark circles.</li>
            <li> It really works and the dark circles desappear.</li>
            <li> really like the way it soothes my eyes, and reduces the look of my dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li> It really improves my dark circle or eye puff.</li>
            <li> the bags, dark circles and lines are much diminished.</li>
            <li> but I do not think it is making much of a difference to my dark circles.</li>
            <li> and it pretty much gets dissolved into my dark circles after a few minutes</li>
            <li> This cream really works to reduce under eye puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t seen too much of a difference in the dark circles.</li>
            <li> They have included in this product, absolutely everything on the market that targets dark circles, puffiness, wrinkles, bags and &amp;#34;sorry looking&amp;#34; eyes and skin.</li>
            <li> It Really helps her dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles my whole life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to see what it can do in a month or so for the dark spots under and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really work teak of my dark circles</li>
            <li> It really does tighten and remove dark circles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a problem with dark circles</li>
            <li> My under eyes get puffy in the morning from sleep and my dark circles are intense.</li>
            <li> This product really does help improve the looks of dark circles</li>
            <li> I may not actually be tired, but if I have dark circles under my eyes, it just makes me appear that way.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is really helping my dark circles go away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have dark circles or puffiness really.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really notice a difference with the dark circles or puffiness.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to alleviate the dark circles under my eyes, which I don&#x27;t feel like have been all that improved.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t done much for my dark circles</li>
            <li> My whole family has dark circles under our eyes, from my mother to my kids.</li>
            <li> In the beginning I was applying it only around eyes, but since i ran out of my other face cream, i decided to use the gel for the whole face and even the neck area.</li>
            <li> A very generous sized bottle compared to other products on the market with similar ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything I have listed above is not only the products that I have tested, but that is my complete daily skin care and hair care regimen.  </li>
            <li> I am 32 years old and started seeing minor wrinkles underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for long, but I like it so far</li>
            <li> Apparently the word is out across the entire www that it was me.</li>
            <li> This product burned my eyes after putting it on consistently for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received and reviewed a few facial skin care products lately that I really liked.  </li>
            <li> When applied in large quantity it can feel really sticky like glue for a long time, so I use very little gel to cover my face and allow it to absorb after that I moisturize with my regular cream.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I have large bags under eyes and I have noticed a slight difference.  </li>
            <li> I believe part of the reason it was not effective is due to the very light consistency of the gel; it&#x27;s just not substantial enough to do much.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> recommendation is, if you do not mind stickiness for a few minutes and want to get rid of fine lines and dark circles give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A plump is always too much, and I have to press it all the way down to get the product out.</li>
            <li> Only been using a short time so hard to tell, but think this could work.&lt;br /&gt;I received free for review only.</li>
            <li> I like to be realistic, no matter what the other reviews said.</li>
            <li> Fast forward to putting this on every morning, the shading under my eye slowly improved from a full under circle around my eye to a half moon shape of darkness.</li>
            <li> eyes were certainly hydrated, as well as a reduction in my dark circles, but a small amount was left on the side of my nose and right under my tear duct.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a significant difference in the dark circles but there is a slight difference.</li>
            <li> Love this product , I fell and hit my head this past year which has resulted in very dark circles under eyes, puffiness</li>
            <li> Highly recommend,  Time will tell on the wrinkle and other improvements.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and other products by this company.</li>
            <li> given how astronomically high other products with</li>
            <li> A high end product will maybe reach 1000 on occasion, but not this or any other items like this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other eye cream products from other brands, many of them actually make the skin around my eyes feel dry after couple hours, but instanatural eye gel actually keep the skin moisturized for a long time, which is a plus besides diminishing puffiness!</li>
            <li> and my face seems a little tight but then feels fine, and when I apply this in the morning and want to apply makeup I have to use another lotion</li>
            <li> and so far it seems to be helping with dry skin and puffiness.</li>
            <li> The wrinkles under my eye are much softer and less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Morning and evening I dab the Eye Serum all around my eyes including the lids and let it dry completely.</li>
            <li> After using this product twice-daily for several weeks, I didn&#x27;t see any really noticeable difference in terms of puffiness, dark circles, or anything else.  </li>
            <li> and I am starting to really notice a reduction in the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s really doing anything as far as skin care yet</li>
            <li> It was strange seeing myself like this at first, because I was so use to seeing dark circles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After about 2 months of using Instanatural Eye Gel, the eye area feels plumper and more dewy/moist, the tear trough is shallower and the Niacinamide has lightened a few small sun damaged spots also.</li>
            <li> I do find it easy to use, non irritating, and works well with cover up makeup.</li>
            <li> The product literally glides on and absorbs quickly into the delicate undereye skin.  </li>
            <li> The tiny, little fine lines look softer and less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> The fine line that I was talking about has very obviously gotten smaller and less less deep!!</li>
            <li> Still waiting for the dark circles to disappear completely (probably will at the end of the second month), and my puffiness has disappeared completely.</li>
            <li> give it time, around six to eight weeks to start seeing wonderful results, don&#x27;t expect to see a dramatic change in a few days, that&#x27;s not realistic, but it DOES WORK!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been obsessed with the natural formulate and how totally easy and sanitary the packaging is.</li>
            <li> and I just felt like there had to be less expensive way to good skincare.</li>
            <li> I really does lessen the depth of the wrinkles around the eyes and doesn&#x27;t look tight and drawn.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve also noticed that when I use it under makeup it almost acts as a primer which is neat, but it does make my upper eyelid stick to my face a little right after applying but doesn&#x27;t last long and doesn&#x27;t hurt or anything.</li>
            <li> Easily absorbed even near your delicate eye area!</li>
            <li> Really helped my dark spots!</li>
            <li> I have serious dark circle and after two weeks I can see that is better than before.</li>
            <li> Love it no more dark circles!!</li>
            <li> I had extremely high expectations when I purchased and even though I cannot say my dark circles arent lighter</li>
            <li> I starting using this with little real feeling</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I expected, but every morning I think that I will go back to my other product, but then by the end of the day, it seems to be better, so I decide to use it again the next day.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s terrific that this little company can make it, thanks to Amazon, in the jungle of cosmetic giants</li>
            <li> only need a little,  I also use it for my jowl lines in my face, I see an improvement there also.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks AJ for products that actually work, feels luxurious, and are really affordable.</li>
            <li> I always read a mix of all reviews before ordering a product and weigh the good against the bad.</li>
            <li> I received a discount for this product in return for my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad.</li>
            <li> This product is a natural 75% organic gel formula that claims to provide &#x27;absolute care to the eye area&#x27; and combats dark dark circles, puffiness,  and sagging skin. </li>
            <li> The only downside I&#x27;ve noticed is that the circles under my eyes ( caused by terrible seasonal allergies) are still pretty apparent, but I&#x27;ve never been able to find anything that really helps with that.</li>
            <li> The texture is a a bit thick, almost like a jelly consistency, but the effects are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product to review.</li>
            <li> Even though I did NOT place it directly below the lower eye and certainly not in the eye, after a month the inner corners of my eyes became tomato red.</li>
            <li> It creates this odd flaky film and is just highly unattractive.</li>
            <li> I did too the first time I used it, but I have since learned that if I let it dry for a few minutes and then apply my moisturizer I won&#x27;t have any issues.  </li>
            <li> It did go on smooth though, but as with the Serum I previously reviewed, it also took too long to dry, and left the unwanted stickiness and weight down my face after application.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t live up to its promise, just like every dark circle/puffiness product I have tried.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t see results right away use it for at least 2 months.  </li>
            <li> I do have slight puffy eyes in the morning but that seems to calm down about an hour after my morning application.  </li>
            <li> So far this is working well - larger bottle than expected for the price!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to get a small enough amount to apply, so I believe this will last many months,</li>
            <li> My  main issue is dark eye circles and the product is helping tons!</li>
            <li> The only tricky thing is not dispensing too much product (you only need VERY little).  </li>
            <li> Not sure how legitimate some of the positive reviews are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks,  but in a super short time I did notice fading of my very dark under eye circles.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long ways and does not feel cakey at all and dries fast.</li>
            <li> Maybe it’s due to my busy schedule and lack of sleep.</li>
            <li> Someone ask me the other day if I was my 18 yr old son&#x27;s sister-</li>
            <li> Of course it did nothing for the dark areas, if it lightens the dark areas under our eyes I am aware that will likely take weeks, if not longer (if at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I also use it under and with the other products from InstaNatural, facial moisturizer, I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference yet, but in due time it will tell.  </li>
            <li> I can’t see how much I have used, but I feel this bottle will last me a very long time because of how little I need to cover my eye area.</li>
            <li> I think this bottle will last me at least a couple of months, so the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> It is at first hard to imagine any skin product living up to its name, but this stuff actually does that.</li>
            <li> My dark circles are not nearly as dark as they were, and I surely am not getting any more sleep than usual.</li>
            <li> I had a couple of dark spots that have nearly gone away in just a short time.  </li>
            <li> The reason I would call it near perfection is that while it helps with my dark circles, nothing I have found totally eliminates them.  </li>
            <li> I have a big problem with natural dark circles no matter how I sleep or what I use.</li>
            <li> I have hereditary dark circles though I&#x27;m only in my early twenties...</li>
            <li> Since using it I have seen a difference and can not really tell my dark circles are there unless your really up close.</li>
            <li> By the end of second week dark circles were almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old and was constantly fighting pudginess and dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> There are only extremely minor changes but I can see that the darkness under my eyes are getting smaller.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks, mainly to minimize morning eye puff.</li>
            <li> I have a young child,  so I can look pretty tired sometimes.</li>
            <li> I was a little cranky at first because the bags and dark circles under my eyes did not magically vanish upon first application.  </li>
            <li> The product goes on smooth, but becomes sticky as it dries, causing the delicate skin on your eyelids to stick to itself... not very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I had very profound bags &amp; dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I use it all over my face, it makes my skin feel little tight after it is all absorbed, but than I follow with the Lancome Renergie ( which I have used for years</li>
            <li> His eyes had less of a tired look and a more alert look to them.</li>
            <li> I am a 38 yr old black female and this product has done wonders to the bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> The directions are specific and when followed properly (allow gel to dry before putting makeup on)</li>
            <li> Works to clear dark skin around eye...</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for puffiness around the eye area, so far no change for my dark circles.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and dark circles are disappearing</li>
            <li> M dark circle have disappeared completely.</li>
            <li> As far as it working for dark circles and wrinkles...</li>
            <li> Completely removed the dark bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> the Insta Natural help with the dark circles?</li>
            <li> So far I have not seen any improvements to my dark circles</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much difference from the OTC products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> A small amount applied gently around the eye in the morning and evenings is soothing and calming the bags that seem to appear in the mornings.</li>
            <li> No product I have tried in the past has helped much.</li>
            <li> It seems to help keep my eyes refreshed as far as bags and dark</li>
            <li> THIS INSTANATURAL EYE CREAM FOR DARK CIRCLES HELP MY EYE SO SOFT.  </li>
            <li> Delivered on time and so far this gel hasnt caused any irritations and seems to be getting rid of my dark circles.</li>
            <li> but it also sticks to my eyelashes and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Long lasting!</li>
            <li> This product left a strange film on the skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used long enough yet</li>
            <li> I will definitely be using this for a long time to come.  </li>
            <li> I would say the only con is when applying before bed, I sometimes wake up with crust all over my eye from it, which is strange as I don&#x27;t have that issue during the day.</li>
            <li> If I don’t wait long enough, I have noticed makeup around my eyes turns out blotchy</li>
            <li> I got little new ones.</li>
            <li> My wife and I noticed subtle improvement in the under-eye area right away, I mean , after the first application.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way to really rub it in, as it&#x27;s not lotion, so it looks a little wet underneath your eyes even when it dries.</li>
            <li> I am impress with the other reviews and highly recommend by other customer to try.</li>
            <li> The InstaNatural eye really does show fewer wrinkles and less puffiness than the other eye.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to order this because of all the positive reviews and the affordable price too bad</li>
            <li> Every time I had my makeup on my dry skin didn&#x27;t go away even with enough moisturizer</li>
            <li> Even though it felt dry on my face, once I got in the shower, it went back to gel/lotion consistency and started being sticky.</li>
            <li> I had better luck with Sudden Change Under Eye Smoother, much less expensive and it actually works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to deal with deep wrinkles and bags under my eyes for years and it&#x27;s been one of the more depressing skin care issues for me as nothing helped get rid of them.</li>
            <li> It actually is making my skin around my eye dry &amp; some what irritated....</li>
            <li> My upper eye lids have a dry or crepey look to them.</li>
            <li> Also, I do put this on the side of my nose and a bit on my forehead on extra dry days just for some added hydration and cooling feelings.</li>
            <li> I allow each product to dry before applying the next.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Allow it to absorb and dry several minutes, then you can put makeup on over it.</li>
            <li> Not only did this do absolutely nothing for my eyes, but it also stung and irritated the delicate skin I was trying to repair.  </li>
            <li> Did not irritate my skin which is typical sensitive.</li>
            <li> I can see slight improvement near my eyes, however, I have not been using it every morning and night</li>
            <li> Sometimes I get dry patches on my eyelids and I haven’t had that problem since starting this gel.  </li>
            <li> In any case i rated it 5 stars because i have used countless creams that gave me only minimal results.</li>
            <li> Recently I&#x27;ve lost a lot of weight which left my skin saggy and it seemed as if I aged overnight.  </li>
            <li> Now, I research a product thoroughly and read numerous reviews before actually making a purchase, so I had absolutely no expectations going into this.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long, long way.  </li>
            <li> And a tiny bit goes a long, long way...</li>
            <li> More annoyingly, (b), it makes under your eyes really shiny.</li>
            <li> Little sticky for the first half hour or so.  </li>
            <li> I do have to be careful not to press too hard on the pump to get the right amount of gel.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my entire face and neck and it definitely has made my skin younger in appearance as well as reduced the puffiness and dark circles under my eye.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an african American female with dark circles around my eye and this cream was a miracle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle cream, but the skin under my eyes was loose and sagging, and I definitely noticed a difference after using this a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a slight decrease in the puffiness under my eyes, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for the dark circles.</li>
            <li> I am only giving it 4 stars because I have not used it long enough to definitely say if it reduces dark circles, puffiness, wrinkles &amp; bags.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After only a few days of applying a minimal amount of this soothing gel there is a new immediate improvement.</li>
            <li> I used some expensive eye cream, but my fine line didn&#x27;t reduce.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just about finished with the first month, and I do detect a subtle improvement.  </li>
            <li> I feel that this is due to medical issues like low irion.  </li>
            <li> This has similar effect than the other eye cream I reviewed, which similar price</li>
            <li> Is not effective for large amount of puffiness under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> Usually when a products has a high number of Reviews AND Ratings</li>
            <li> so did my usual mo and bought a high in eye cream</li>
            <li> The gel is clear and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> After receiving this product for review my first thought was to give it a true hard test, my poor husband who works on average 70</li>
            <li> Made my sensitive skin feel tight and dry.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too bad sticky - kind of like applying aloe Vera gel on your face.</li>
            <li> The dark circles are almost gone, those horrible bags are greatly reduced &amp; I am getting compliments!!!  </li>
            <li> I have trouble with puffiness and dark circles under my eyes, and since I have been using this, the area has really brightened up.</li>
            <li> They recommended  keeping the eye gel in the refrigerator as it works better cold for puffiness.</li>
            <li> It was not a nice feeling while trying to get ready.</li>
            <li> I used to blindly trust the reviews from amazon but now, with all the power reviewers and people getting free merchandise, I can no longer do that.</li>
            <li> I read that some customers say to give it at least 3 weeks to start really noticing a difference</li>
            <li> at least I see one shade lighter and that makes me very</li>
            <li> Fortunately, dark circles are not something that I generally have to deal with.</li>
            <li> and now she is on a schedule waking up at least 2 times a night and wanting a bottle, and then after that she wants to watch cartoons so I am barley getting sleep.</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;ve never found it to be that big of a deal, but when I had the opportunity to sample INSTANATURAL EYE CREAM FOR DARK CIRCLES, PUFFINESS, WRINKLES, AND BAGS, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff I have come across that actually works for dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a month and only once a day (at night) because I use a different one to hide the dark circles.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it is really doing anything for my dark circles, it defiantly overall is beneficial to my skin health</li>
            <li> I am a male using this product to reduce the dark circles and puffiness above my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as I am a 42 yr old woman with small crow&#x27;s feet starting to form around my eyes...</li>
            <li> and when I apply my make-up my dark circles under the eyes are barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have not  seen any notable difference in the puffiness or dark circles.</li>
            <li> and I fully intend to continue buying this product as long as I can get it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a  31 yr old non-smoker and have been using Neutrogena retinol cream for a few years now</li>
            <li> not really seeing a big difference</li>
            <li> Hope this long review helps., and not just on my eyes.</li>
            <li> Hope this long review helps.</li>
            <li> It is just part of me and has been for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak to the long term effects</li>
            <li> I am a 30 year old woman that doesn&#x27;t get any sleep, so I have heavy Macy&#x27;s bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Have not been using this long but have already seen some benefit.</li>
            <li> My eyes were swollen and itchy all night long.</li>
            <li> A couple of months ago I noticed puffiness under my eyes and tried Insta Natural Eye Gel and noticed a difference in a few days.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t search too long for eye creams.</li>
            <li> The product size was a lot larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> I only give it a four because I have only been using it a few weeks now and haven&#x27;t seen a big change yet.</li>
            <li> only been 4 days and not really seeing a difference in eye bags.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to see what the final results will be after another month</li>
            <li> I literally looked like I had aged ten years and nothing from the drugstore or at home remedies seemed to work.</li>
            <li> Gel goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Just received product yesterday so I can not attest to any long term affects.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t been using it for that long</li>
            <li> REVIEWS - I SHOULD HAVE SPENT THE EXTRA MONEY AND GOT THE PRODUCT I&#x27;V EBEEN USING</li>
            <li> It reduces my baggy grey puffy eyes a lot too.</li>
            <li> They are not completely gone, but I no longer have the need to wear concealer under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this after all the great reviews, but I was very disappointed and felt like around my eyes looked way worse after using this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is a bit smoother and the gel is a good base for my moisturizer and makeup.  </li>
            <li> I also have a problem with unwanted facial hair, this product has actually slowed down the regrowth</li>
            <li> Tiny drop goes a long way, which will make this bottle last a VERY, VERY long time!!!!</li>
            <li> Noticed a big difference in my smins overall appearance after less than a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to only use about half a pump for my entire face and it seems to be plenty for my skin.</li>
            <li> The bags are shrinking, they are actually getting smaller, and are less puffy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used the product for approximately 2 months, but I started noticing a difference right away with diminished wrinkles around the eye area as well as on areas around the mouth.  </li>
            <li> am a mom so being tired is just part of life right now.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last a long time too because such a small amount goes such a long way.</li>
            <li> It did seem to be diminishing the puffiness over and under my eyes, but them I realized, no matter how long I waited for it to dry, that after I put my moisturizer and foundation on, the gel started caking up</li>
            <li> I like how it applies and you only need a little bit as it definitely goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so one bottle will last quite a long time as you only need to pump a little at a time.  </li>
            <li> ok, so I was a little doubtful at first</li>
            <li> Only needed a small dab and it covers very well - a little bit goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> While the ingredients are those that usually have beneficial results for my skin, this particular cream does not create the expected results.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying this as long as it&#x27;s around!</li>
            <li> I will definitely repurchase this and look into their other products.</li>
            <li> I thought that was a bit strange, but my eyelashes hadn&#x27;t gotten longer - my overhanging &amp;#34;hooded&amp;#34; eyelids had receded!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try their other skin care products after my current supply runs out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only a teenager; it&#x27;s a mix of no sleep due to school work and genetics.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this to lighten under my eyes but when I realized the reviews for lighting under the eyes were fake.</li>
            <li> Only two products I have ever used minimized the darkness and this one costs 1/5 what the other one costs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like nor dislike the smell.  </li>
            <li> it leaves me refreshed the only other downfall I had</li>
            <li> I am a 56 yo male with extreme baggy lower lids.</li>
            <li> I kept using my regular eye cream on one eye and used this on the other.  </li>
            <li> I love this eye cream, and it compares to some expensive creams I have purchased!</li>
            <li> After it&#x27;s soaked in, I only had a little sheen to my face, which actually just made my skin look</li>
            <li> I have also recently used two other InstaNatural  products that cause NO irritation:  </li>
            <li> I apply it every morning before my other facial products</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for very long</li>
            <li> I used to use creams thinking gels would dry me out.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> it tightens as it drys, but after its dry you can&#x27;t feel it on your face.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t tell if it will help with that, however, I do have dry skin</li>
            <li> Skin type: combination - dry except for the T-zone&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My eyes were so dry</li>
            <li> it reduces puffiness but it led to dry skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> My skin around eyes became dry.</li>
            <li> I have a ceiling fan in my room which makes my skin dry overnight.</li>
            <li> absolute only complaint I have is that it does tend to leave a bit of a sticky feeling until it completly dries (i just used less product to combat that issue.</li>
            <li> : It doesn’t add oil or dry the skin.</li>
            <li> Just started using this gel, it doesn&#x27;t dry me out</li>
            <li> Use on dry skin &amp; give it time to soak in.</li>
            <li> you do have to let it completely dry before applying  concealer.</li>
            <li> to relieve some of my dry winter skin this winter</li>
            <li> My eyes felt dry, too.</li>
            <li> I wait about five minutes for the gel to completely dry before applying anything over it.</li>
            <li> I use the C serum - let it dry - then use the eye cream.  </li>
            <li> I let it dry, then follow with my moisturizer..</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too dry for me.</li>
            <li> This makes me have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Allow to air dry for the product to absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li> In the month that I&#x27;ve been using this, I notice my contacts get dry close to the end of my work day</li>
            <li> It might only be a few millimeters, but I thought only a brow lift could help my droopy eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> its not instant but its only been a few weeks</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve only used this a few time because I only received it.  </li>
            <li> They say to give it a few months to work, but if it has done so much in a week, I can&#x27;t imagine what the results will be in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been using it long enough to help with dark circles.</li>
            <li> We mainly used this product with my husband because he complained about his eyes being puffy and looking like he had bags under his eyes.  </li>
            <li> I believe with continue use my &amp;#34;baggie&amp;#34; eyes will not be an issue or at least not a serious issue.  </li>
            <li> This one has almost no scent, if anything slight green scent from one of its main ingredients, aloe.  </li>
            <li> I am 29 years old and a mom to a 6 month old baby girl, which basically means that due to the lack of sleep and exhausting daily life I have been sporting dark circles and enormous puffy bags under my eyes ever since my baby was born.</li>
            <li> I am a single Mom</li>
            <li> every single day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this every single day for over two months, both morning and night.</li>
            <li> Almost everything irritates my skin or breaks me out, but I haven&#x27;t had a single problem with this gel.  </li>
            <li> I am a semi insomniac, I have to take something for sleep almost every single night.</li>
            <li> Seems to have limited effect</li>
            <li> I also have a birthmark under my right eye which makes my eye bags look even more terrible than they already do.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, this bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have also developed a small dry scaley patch under 1 eye.</li>
            <li> I was tired of having super defined dark circles &amp; this was the solution.</li>
            <li> I was under no impression that it would permanently remove my dark circles, but it has definitely helped take some of the puffiness and darkness away.</li>
            <li> Dark circles and puffines look the same, if any, skin around the eye</li>
            <li> but the dark circles remains same</li>
            <li> I have dark circles that run from inner eye to outer and puffy in the morning under eyes.</li>
            <li> I occasionally have dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day (morning &amp; night) and within a week I could instantly feel my dark circles began to lighten up.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell my dark circle&#x27;s changed, but I can definitely fell</li>
            <li> It took a couple days to get rid of the dark circles, but they&#x27;re gone despite my constant allergies.</li>
            <li> /gels this one works quite well when i  have puffy eyes or get dark circles on days when i don&#x27;t get enough sleep .</li>
            <li> but it definitely improved my dark circles for me, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> The only reason I wear concealer is to cover my dark circles</li>
            <li> I no longer look like I have dark circles, even when I don&#x27;t get enough sleep, this product makes me look refreshed!</li>
            <li> I got this product because I&#x27;m temporarily short on sleep and had noticed I was getting some dark circles under my eyes as a result.</li>
            <li> It actually works on both my dark circles and under-eye bags.</li>
            <li> but my dark circles looked the same.</li>
            <li> This eye gel actually helped in removing those dark circles.  </li>
            <li> This product does seem to actually work to reduce the dark circles and puffiness under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the puffiness under my eyes and it&#x27;s almost gone, also I have dark circles in around my eyes, and they have diminished too, the instructions on the product say that you probably need to wait until the second month to notice any changes</li>
            <li> so I’m not sure they can ever be completely eliminated.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this for someone who has dark circles under their eyes or just puffiness in general due to allergies.</li>
            <li> noticed the dark circles lighten and the skin looked brighter and felt tighter instantly.</li>
            <li> Bought for a teen that always has dark circles and puffiness under his eyes</li>
            <li> After the second month of use I have noticeably seen a firming of my skin around my eye area, puffy eyes, dark areas are gone.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get enough rest, leaving dark circles.</li>
            <li> I will update at a later date if I notice dark circles or freckles/skin spots getting lighter.</li>
            <li> It actually &#x27;reduces the look of lines and dark circles&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> my husband and i use it daily on our dark circles.</li>
            <li> This product has made a big difference in the dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I notice discoloration under my eyes after using this product which leads me to think it is actually helping with my dark circles.</li>
            <li> Definitely a god product, if you have dark circles.</li>
            <li> After continued use, I did see a decrease in the appearance of the dark circles under my eyes and my skin looked brighter and younger.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps with dark circles and tightens lines.</li>
            <li> It actually helped in reducing my dark circles.</li>
            <li> Noticed big improvement in my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I only use the product once per day and must admit it has done wonders on my puffy eyelids, dark circles and crows feet.</li>
            <li> I had an extremely stressful December,  and I developed harsh bags and circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> My under eye dark circles have definitely improved.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles are still the same.  </li>
            <li> For the past year I have been using creams prescribe by my dermatologist to help with my adult acne.  </li>
            <li> I have struggled with dark circles my entire life</li>
            <li> I bought this for the dark circles under my eyes &amp; it didn&#x27;t work at all &amp; actually made them all puffy!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely helps my dark circles from being so noticeable.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s here review: I have 2 small children that like to wake up way too early in the morning and through out the night.</li>
            <li> im still in the same boat with the dark cycles and crows feet...</li>
            <li> what contains to make the dark circles go away and your skin feel healthier and younger?</li>
            <li> So what contains to make the dark circles go away and your skin feel healthier and younger?</li>
            <li> Though i don’t deal with the majority of those problems yet, I can say I think it has helped my dark circles some for the short time I have been using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a week, so maybe the dark circles still will lighten up a bit.</li>
            <li> and I do notice my hands look softer and younger, much less dry.</li>
            <li> I also put it on my eyelids, but only about 1/2 way down.  </li>
            <li> It instantly takes down any puffiness within minutes.</li>
            <li> So it does last a long time as you use so little.</li>
            <li> So it does last a long time as you use so little.</li>
            <li> The InstaNatural helped a little with the dark circles, but they didn&#x27;t go away completely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this is not a fully organic 100% natural product, it relies on natural ingredients wherever possible to save skin from unnecessary harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> AND I still have enough product left to dab on other trouble spots on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I had terrible dark circles under my eye that were incredibly prevalent when I under slept.</li>
            <li> I have only had this stuff less than 24 hrs (been used 3xs)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, but I already see less puffiness around my eyes.</li>
            <li> My eye wrinkles are less obvious!</li>
            <li> Um.... I have to admit that after using this for less than 2 weeks, it&#x27;s actually doing something.</li>
            <li> So be careful when you apply the gel as you go because once it starts to dry, it&#x27;ll keep it that way.</li>
            <li> I used to work third shift for about a year and a half</li>
            <li> We still got to be practical in the sense that less or no cigarettes, limit your exposure to sunlight, no constant winking or rubbing your under eye.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> (purchased it a month ago)I bought the gel because my eye lids and skin under my eye were recently very dry and reddish.</li>
            <li> It makes the skin under my eyes feel very dry.</li>
            <li> I also have deep set eyes which makes my dark circles really stand out when I&#x27;m tired.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so this bottle will likely last me another few weeks.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no apparent difference, no change to bags, dark circles, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is not unpleasant to apply, and it does not seem to have had ill effects.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s potency isn&#x27;t just limited to your eye area though!</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t guarantee you will have exactly the same results as I had, I can definitely recommend this to boost the appearance of the thin, delicate skin around the eye</li>
            <li> It did reduce the puffiness under my eye, I  needed to use a little eye cream afterwards because I have very dry skin and the gel was not quite enough moisture.</li>
            <li> The package is a little larger than I was expecting for an eye cream as well.</li>
            <li> I put just a little white concealer over the eye gel and foundation!</li>
            <li> and you only need a little at a time.  </li>
            <li> I simply dab a little around my eyes using circular and upward motions.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product a little over a week</li>
            <li> and you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> This one I have only been using for a couple nights and it seems to make a little difference; my under-eye feels tighter.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the product is that it is a little sticky...</li>
            <li> Little results if any after using this daily just as the directions say to for over 4 months.</li>
            <li> It only takes one little dot of it to go around both eyes.</li>
            <li> I like to use a little extra for the rest of my face</li>
            <li> I don’t only use it around my eyes, but also on my forehead and my jowls, where a little sag is starting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long, long way.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find something that is this natural and healthful.</li>
            <li> The only negative about the product that I have is a minor one: the cream is a topical cream, but for something that has to be used so close to one&#x27;s eyes, you have to be very careful not to accidently rub any of the cream into your eyes.</li>
            <li> As a mommy to a toddler I feel like this eye cream was made especially for me and all other Mommy&#x27;s!!</li>
            <li> so I would remember to use it and the other one every single day.</li>
            <li> Love this item I have bad bags</li>
            <li> It says try for at least 2 months but there is no reason if i only have about 2 weeks left</li>
            <li> I shopped around for one but the ones that are promised to work very well are above my price range, $40+ for 10 mL. I bought this eye gel a week ago and totally addicted to it now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue wearing this for at least the next to see if I see any big, noticeable changes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought and returned at least 11 different eye creams in the last 6 months</li>
            <li> My only negative comment is when I received my bottle it looked like a 3rd grader applied the label.</li>
            <li> Not to mention a little goes a long long way!</li>
            <li> After only a few days I started to see a change around my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent tons of money trying to find an eye cream that even comes close to delivering the results they claim to.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> and it allowed for careful application in the correct amount.  </li>
            <li> I have only used for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Absolutely no difference in the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> and I will continue to used this for the next few months.</li>
            <li> Quit using it for a few weeks and tried it again and had the same results.  </li>
            <li> I can totally see a difference in my skin&#x27;s texture if I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days and cellulite doesn&#x27;t disappear overnight</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days and cellulite doesn&#x27;t disappear overnight</li>
            <li> However, the eyebag stays as expected.</li>
            <li> not much is needed at all.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the dispenser-poor design and always messy.</li>
            <li> and then one day it ran out on me faster than expected.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it religiously; 2ce a day, everyday.</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of InstaNaturals products including the Vitamin C toner, Vitamin C facial cleanser, Vitamin C serum, and Dead Sea Mud Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have had absolutely no issues with this cream.  </li>
            <li> Have been using around eyes for over a month, day and night with absolutely no result.</li>
            <li> THE WRINKLES AROUND MY EYES HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO DIMINISH AFTER ONLY A FEW DAYS OF USE.  </li>
            <li> Its helping but not as i expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been  a few weeks and the results are quite visible.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in the next few weeks.  </li>
            <li> It makes me really curious what ingredient in it wasn&#x27;t organic... and</li>
            <li> In only a few uses I saw a noticeable improvement under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Slippery and wet.</li>
            <li> Product was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent years &amp;#34;living&amp;#34; in the sun, squinting and damaging my face causing wrinkles around the eyes.</li>
            <li> but it does help them, my dark circles are minor and from lack of sleep so that also plays a part in them going away</li>
            <li> Works immediately in reducing puffiness, but within a few hours the puffiness is back.</li>
            <li> not intense result....</li>
            <li> Not fast results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a  few days</li>
            <li> Just a few of the key ingredients are hyaluronic acid, plant stem cells &amp; matrixyl 3000.</li>
            <li> Reduced the dark circles under my eyes and I have been wanting to get rid of it for a long time now.</li>
            <li> On the eye gel for about a month, no real improvement.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds trying to fix eye troubles and now aging eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds on creams that don&#x27;t make a difference like this one.</li>
            <li> I used the products according to instructions and there was absolutely no improvement.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t the experience I had expected</li>
            <li> Be careful with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled dark under eye circles and puffy eyes for a long time.</li>
            <li> When applying it to your face you need to be careful and use minimal force to push it out.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected from it.</li>
            <li> But no real noticeable changes yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though my dark circles have not completely gone, they have reduced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it until it&#x27;s finished since i already spent my money on it.</li>
            <li> As a lifetime allergy sufferer, I have had dark circles under my eyes for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product faithfully for 3 months and absolutely no improvement</li>
            <li> Followed instructions and see absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> This has had absolutely no effect on the under eye puffiness, or the darkness.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I was tired of looking tired, so I went online to see if I could find a better eye cream.</li>
            <li> The puffiness is down and the dark circles are diminished--and I have only been using it for about 2 weeks or so.  </li>
            <li> I have not seen and dramatic improvements since I have started (about two weeks), but I am optimistic that longer usage may yield positive results.</li>
            <li> so its like double clasps to ensure when you sit down it doesnt pop down.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with this product so far no changes.</li>
            <li> I also have always had dark bags under my eyes and slight wrinkles (I&#x27;m only 26</li>
            <li> Starting to see less dark circle, puffiness and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33 and have been noticing dark circles starting for about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> With that being said, I can see my dark circles are getting less obvious</li>
            <li> /&gt;For dark circle, I see a slight  improvement  , but it only  been 3 days</li>
            <li> which I&#x27;m certainly NOT....</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work - plain and simple.</li>
            <li> But I do feel a lot better just seeing myself in the mirror, and not look like I&#x27;m sick.</li>
            <li> I have genetic dark blackish eye circles, and a dry under eye area.</li>
            <li> But yet leaves your eye area, a big sticky shiny mess!</li>
            <li> So far this has been the only product which I saw dramatic results.</li>
            <li> and I usually end up adding a different lotion a few hours later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already developed dark circles under my eyes but they got so much worse during last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll go back to using my Yes! to Grapefruit Dark Circle corrector eye cream that was more moisturizing and cost less. :(</li>
            <li> I have noticed that I am getting dark circles under my eyes along with some loose skin (bags).  </li>
            <li> No positive effects, no adverse effects, nothing.</li>
            <li> There are less lines than usual,  and no dark circles.  </li>
            <li> a 4 months old - wich means I hardly sleep, I suffer from Dark circles, and puffiness..</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t  been using it very long, but my eyes don&#x27;t look any less puffy since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I typically apply just before my face cream, and before finsihing my hair, so I have plenty of time for these both to dry before applying makeup.  </li>
            <li> My eyes did appear to be less dry</li>
            <li> Im am 21 and have been looking for a natural product to help with the dark circles ive been getting lately.</li>
            <li> Since I am pretty tolerant to cold, I don&#x27;t even mind applying it to my entire face when it is chilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I thought this product would be able to do something to my dark circles, but I can&#x27;t even use it without getting the ugly bumps.</li>
            <li> It can be slightly sticky if you put it on your eyelids, so if you are using it in the morning before applying makeup, I would recommend waiting for it to fully dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks now, every morning &amp; night, and I am starting to see my dark circles fade!!</li>

            <li> While the creams help, they have left my skin dry and dull.  </li>
            <li> I had some high hopes on that front, but alas, it wasn&#x27;t to be.  </li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s problem is only the skin under his eyes, so I can&#x27;t comment on dark circles or any other problems, but I can tell you that his eyes are significantly less puffy even after tons of salt!</li>
            <li> You actually need very little product to cover the eye area.</li>
            <li> Makes under eye area feel tight and dry.  </li>
            <li> In comparison to some other very expensive competitors, try it, you won&#x27;t be out the huge cost to give it a chance.    </li>
            <li> Also has noticed a difference with the other issues.</li>
            <li> should I throw it out or try it on other body parts...?</li>
            <li> I saw InstaNatural&#x27;s eye cream and that it included among other things cucumber, and I thought, well women have always used cucumber around the eyes.</li>
            <li> And to respond to other comments, I was not paid, nor given the product to review.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have any adverse reaction other than it hurt.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience the miracle results that other reviewers reported.</li>
            <li> it is.&lt;br /&gt;I have seen the post that you can not wear under make up due to stickiness.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Eye Gel comes in a bottle with a pump mechanism, which I like because you aren&#x27;t sticking your fingers into a jar like other eye creams and risk contaminating it with germs.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering this again and again, as well as trying other InstaNatural product.</li>
            <li> only need to use a small amount</li>
            <li> And I have never been allergic to any other beauty products in my almost 40 years of life.  </li>
            <li> I use this about every other night or any morning</li>
            <li> But I get lazy sometimes and forget to put it on after I shower...and pay for it the next day!</li>
            <li> I used these because other reviewers said it works for them, but not for me.</li>
            <li> the other stuff is just a bonus.</li>
            <li> Just like other Eye Gels that i used..Doesn&#x27;t absorb my skin feels tacky and looks a bit shiny.</li>
            <li> A lot of other gels/creams have irritated my eyes, but this one hasn&#x27;t bothered me at all.  </li>
            <li> They are extremely proactive about seeking customer feedback</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after purchasing this product, ALL OF A SUDDEN I developed raccoon eyes!  </li>
            <li> but I gave it a try due to all their reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried a Garnier Dark Circle eye roller product and it only covered up my dark circles and was messy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to continue use due to discomfort.</li>
            <li> well comparing to other eye products that I have been used.  </li>
            <li> Goes on so smooth and smells very faintly of cucumber.</li>
            <li> other eye cream tingle in my eye,  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the eye cream and wanted to love it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product actually works.</li>
            <li> It has reduced some puffiness under my eyes due to allergies.  </li>
            <li> I have severe dark circles as a result of hereditary pigment and lifelong sinus/allergy problems.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using eye creams for the past 5 years but never saw a big difference.  </li>
            <li> Usually I need to wait several weeks to determine if a face product is going to work but not so this time.</li>
            <li> Every other eye cream  </li>
            <li> I have used other eye gels but none worked till I found Instanatural Eye Gel.  </li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed for application.</li>
            <li> It may work for other problems, but not for puffiness.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it basically doubled the puffiness under my eyes over the course of the first week of use.  </li>
            <li> In the past have not been big into eye gel&#x27;s or creams.</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying other products made by this company.</li>
            <li> She had uses other products and none have worked like this one.</li>
            <li> It feels sticky as the other reviews have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this every day or every other for 2 months</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have wrinkles due to oily skin but purchased for the bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> not sure if I notice anything different</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife who has dark circles under her eyes, partially do to heredity.  </li>
            <li> I was incredibly skeptical of this product, and was about to order a different more expensive product, but this did the job.</li>
            <li> do not notice immediate improvement in &amp;#34;questionable decision&amp;#34; eyes as compared with other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I have done that with other eye creams for years.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works for other but it didn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li> A gel that is not sticky and can be used on other parts of your face as well as eyes.</li>
            <li> I think I will use it on my lazy days when I just want to use one product for my entire face.</li>
            <li> I made it through my work day yesterday not looking as tired as I normally do.</li>
            <li> It worked well with my other skincare products and I like</li>
            <li> I tried 3 other &#x27;quality&#x27; products but never saw results.  </li>
            <li> Now i have to look for the other brand.</li>
            <li> One is called Youth Express Eye Gel and the other is called Youth express Eye serum.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll have to finish it off on other parts of my face or chest.</li>
            <li> I have severe eye puffiness, partially due to an underactive thyroid condition.  </li>
            <li> For weeks I tried coconut oil under one eye, and the eye cream on the other.  </li>
            <li> I apply a small amount around my eyes twice daily.  </li>
            <li> Compared to other eye products I have, this is just humongous for an eye product.</li>
            <li> it kept my skin firm and tight and I only been using it for 24 hours now</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long ways.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of time to dry, but once you put it on</li>
            <li> It stings a little when applied to dry skin at times.</li>
            <li> I was a smoker for 50 years and developed serious dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> And at $20 it&#x27;s way cheaper than the $40 I&#x27;ve spent on other eye creams!</li>
            <li> After a few days we did notice a slight improvement in the color under his eyes but minimal to no improvement in the puffiness, however I do want to point out that for him it is quite sever so not really surprised on that.</li>
            <li> I had a little trouble getting the pump started but that isn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li> I have had the product only a few days and even going on less sleep than average, I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> After the gel dries there is a very slight sticky tight filling which is why I only use it at night.</li>
            <li> I was committed to doing that even though after a month I was seeing absolutely no positive changes for dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> What a huge disappointment and waste of money.</li>
            <li> The product is slightly tacky after applied but eventually sinks in to the skin and is not a problem.</li>
            <li> Another cheap Chinese piece of crap that does not even clip onto the lens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for exactly one month now and sadly, I&#x27;ve seen no difference or change in my under eye dark circles or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My wife has dark circles and is always looking for an eye cream to help with that and all the other issues this cream helps with.</li>
            <li> Ive used other gels and while they may have helped with dark circles they werent hydrating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using it on two small horizontal lines above my eyes and they seem to already be less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I buy all-natural make-up because I&#x27;ve had such a hard time with extreme reactions.</li>
            <li> Did not complete my review due to a lazy computer touch tone screen.</li>
            <li> The cream itself was thick and not runny like some of the other facial creams that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The bottle does seem a little small, but the amount that&#x27;s used even on daily is basis is very minimal</li>
            <li> This product contains the hyaluronic acid as well as other ingredients that work together to increase skin elasticity while toning down dark circles and puffiness around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> You can firm, plump, improve the tone and elasticity of your entire face with this little treatment!</li>
            <li> suffers from insomnia and at 47 years of age is starting to look much older do to a life of hard work outside.</li>
            <li> In addition to making my eyes look less puffy, I use it on other parts of my face sometimes, too.</li>
            <li> My other half</li>
            <li> Have only had it for 2 days, hard to rate it</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to see how much is left in the bottle.  </li>

            <li> The bra itself is padded extra thick</li>
            <li> I like this product,  but you need to be real careful to not rib or it will burn.  </li>
            <li> Cool, thick cream, unfortunately I didn&#x27;t see results, which I would expect for the price.</li>
            <li> So far I have not seen any reduction in puffiness, however, my eyes do look brighter &amp; they don&#x27;t appear to look tired.</li>
            <li> was it left a sticky feeling behind until it was dry</li>
            <li> Just push down and a dime size will come out.</li>
            <li> Sometimes if I have been upset and cried or had allergies where my eyes are swollen, I apply this and it brings the swelling completely down.</li>
            <li> Then one day, I looked in the mirror and saw that the swelling was down</li>
            <li> it clips and then flattens down</li>
            <li> We never sit down to relax and rewind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doing its job by keeping my bags down.</li>
            <li> I have used may face products in my day and this is tops hands down.</li>

            <li> You can read other reviews on my blog at: surveysbystephanie.tumblr.com!</li>
            <li> I had to &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; my skin to get the two pieces to separate from each other!  </li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes, however, feels softer, and my dark circles have lightened ever so slightly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about a month and my dark circles and puffiness are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m using less makeup on my eyes to cover up my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I had slight dark circles under my eyes, which have started fading with the use of this cooling product.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles and crow&#x27;s feet are less visible also.</li>
            <li> Once dry, I put my usual foundaion on.  </li>
            <li> It helps to reduce the puffiness slightly, but I&#x27;ve yet to see any change in my dark circle.</li>
            <li> My dark circles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> The little wrinkles near the edges and under my eyes have decreased and my dark circles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Less puffy under eyes and less dark circles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically have an issue with dark circles, but when I don&#x27;t sleep well and have slight darkness, this helps lighten it up a bit.</li>
            <li> I think it is a little harder to review eye gels/creams than facial moisturizers, because you are using it on such a small area of skin, but this meets all of my criteria (except for finding something with SPF for when out in the sun, but that is hard to find and when you do find it the consistency can be too thick).</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for about half a year now.</li>
            <li> It has softened &amp; plumped up the skin around my eyes which makes the lines much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> In less than a week.  </li>
            <li> I will say tho that if i skip a day it seems like my eyes start to droop and puff slightly</li>
            <li> I think those who rated this with 3 stars or less probably used it for a week and stopped.</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference in the puffiness being much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles in corners less defined.</li>
            <li> and they just felt odd.  </li>
            <li> No tremendous difference</li>
            <li> I see no evidence of less puffiness under eyes...</li>
            <li> I used it all over my face, and not just my eyes as a previous customer had mentioned.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a month and half</li>
            <li> After using this for a couple of days, my eyes were visibly less puffy.  </li>
            <li> and they suggested that I use less of the product.  </li>
            <li> Upon application, you could feel a slight tingling and a tightening sensation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a month and a half since I started using this eye gel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to tell you , This product just waist of money , very standard eye gel , sooth for minutes only ..</li>
            <li> The flesh/skin under my eyes is less puffy and</li>
            <li> Wrinkles become less noticeable.</li>
            <li> , im having a lot less problems with creasing under eye makeup.</li>
            <li> less puffiness, less droopy lids.</li>
            <li> I noticed less wrinkles within days.  </li>
            <li> Do not expect it to perform to the level of the reviews previously written.</li>
            <li> This eye gel has visibly reduced the circles slightly, for which I would give it a 2 1/2-3/5.</li>
            <li> seen noticeable results in less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> It also has a slight cooling effect.</li>
            <li> It seems less puffy and saggy looking.</li>
            <li> I see a slight difference in the darkness under my eyes and</li>
            <li> It has been about a week and the lines (which were much less severe than around my eyes)</li>
            <li> there is a slight difference</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week and have less noticeable lines around my eyes and</li>
            <li> The gel is soothing and dries quickly, not leaving you feeling like you have a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; product on your face.</li>
            <li> It also does slightly sting.  </li>
            <li> I have found that after application, the area under my eyes are less puffy.</li>
            <li> I am noticing firming up in the eye area in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> It has made the lines around my eyes less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I also adored how the puffiness under my eyes are now less reduced and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, the star off is for the fact that the gel peels off like glue if you happen to rub it, however slightly, after it dries.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t see improvement and a whole month was wasted trying out this product.</li>
            <li> Makes the wrinkles around my eyes less noticable.</li>
            <li> My skin feels tighter and the bags are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to give such a low review</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using it for one and half a week</li>
            <li> My eyes seems brighter and much less puffiness in the morning.</li>
            <li> and I notice I now have less redness on my cheeks, too.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed less puffiness</li>
            <li> Within a week the skin around my eyes looked less wrinkled, firmer.  </li>
            <li> The skin is firmer, lines less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I know it is too soon to see results, as I just started using it a week ago, but I do notice a slight glow to my skin and the bags under my eyes are not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> I do notice a slight change in the appearance.</li>
            <li> Not much for the cost, but it does help my eyes get a little bit of a lift!</li>
            <li> Usually around my eyes is very dry and puffy.</li>
            <li> it has lightning my dark circles a little bit</li>
            <li> Takes a little bit of time but using it as directed dark circles are lighter.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell any difference with the the dark circles yet, but I&#x27;m still hoping...stings a little too.</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of them, from drug store brands to high end, extremely expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to any one with puffy, tired eyes (like me!).</li>
            <li> It did not weigh my skin down at all, but it was a little shiny immediately after the application.</li>
            <li> Are there artificial fragrances?): Very slight, fresh cucumber-like scent.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for just a few days and can notice the dark circles are lighter and lines less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I would highly discourage purchasing this product unless you have very tough skin, or don&#x27;t mind wasting money.</li>
            <li> It made my dark circles go away within a matter of a few days.</li>
            <li> Not impressed should have stuck with my normal eye cream teamine.</li>
            <li> I only buy eye gel a few times a year as the stuff lasts forever, so i usually forget who/where I bought from in the past.</li>
            <li> I think my problem was that I had incredibly thin skin under my eyes where the pooled blood was readily apparent.</li>
            <li> Not a huge difference in the dark circles,</li>
            <li> Since I have to get up at 6 am get the 2 older girls ready for school, I always look tired and have really bad dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little less scared after using this eye product.</li>
            <li> I have noticed the skin around my eyes is softer, and my crows feet a little less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It lightened my skin, and made my overall appearance look much less dull!</li>
            <li> It can be a bit tight on your skin, but I use it under moisturizer and that softens my face for make up.</li>
            <li> my skin feel sticky and tight.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel sticky and tight.</li>
            <li> Apparently it&#x27;s made from rooster combs, what will Tyson be selling next, chicken</li>
            <li> I have dark circles and when I am tired and do not get enough sleep, I needed something for those bags that form under my eyes.</li>
            <li> He repeated the steps each day and within a few days his eyes seems less puffy in the mornings and through out the day.  </li>
            <li> I have used other cremes and gels and saw very little difference after months and months and months of use, but with this product it literally changed my eyes within 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Puffiness is gone and the dark circles have already started to lighten up!</li>
            <li> I also dab a little on the cheeks and they even appear softer with improved texture &amp; appearance.  </li>
            <li> Bye bye dark circles and soon-to-be wrinkles!</li>
            <li> It takes little longer to fully absorb into my skin, during which time it&#x27;s a sticky.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Just dab a little under your eyes and let it sit and absorb.</li>
            <li> I used it just as instructed, I dabbed a little under my eyes every morning and every night.</li>
            <li> Just a little dab will do.</li>
            <li> I dab a little around my eyes, between my eyebrows, and all around my forehead.  </li>
            <li> I also did not like the fact that I could not put my foundation over the gel without it balling up into little pieces.</li>
            <li> I suggest keeping the little tab that comes inside of the pump because it keeps air from getting into the gel between uses.  </li>
            <li> I find that this comes out a little bit stickier when the tab isn&#x27;t used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dab a little pea size amount under my eyes and on my forehead every morning and night.  </li>
            <li> Depuffs, and gets rid of those pesky dark circles!</li>
            <li> This product has made the dark circles under my eyes visibly lighter!</li>
            <li> tends to be a little oily.</li>
            <li> so every little bit helps.  </li>
            <li> I was a little suspicious because of all of the rave reviews.  </li>
            <li> I am using the tiniest amount each time - just a little dot.</li>
            <li> I have to say that within just one week of use, this eye gel diminished my under eye dark circles by over 50%!  </li>
            <li> The lotion gets rid of the dark circles and puffy eyes within an hour!</li>
            <li> I think that this is working...but maybe a little too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> Also, i noticed the little wrinkles around my eyes started to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> It did not showed any little signs of getting rid of my eye bags</li>
            <li> Bye bye dark circles and wrinkles!</li>
            <li> This has got rid of my dark circles, as well as the puffiness!</li>
            <li> Dark circles are disappearing!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried it might make my eye makeup look cakey, but thankfully it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> You have to use just a little bit or else</li>
            <li> My dark circles and bags reduced dramatically!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also helping with the little wrinkles that are forming at my age of 43.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle, but you can see a little difference in a month.</li>
            <li> What you do is dab a little bit under your eyes and wait for it to absorb.</li>
            <li> Nothing has ever worked so well on my dark circles &amp; puffy bags under my eyes!</li>
            <li> I got a little daring and tried the bel essence</li>
            <li> You have to give the products a little time to work, some people here saw results after a week, took me between 2-3 to start seeing results that made a difference.  </li>
            <li> I started to feel disappointed until about day 10 when I noticed a significant difference in the color of the circles under my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> During the day, use a little because it does come off as looking greasy on your face.</li>
            <li> so i am a little bit concern about it</li>
            <li> It does stay a little sticky, so I use it under my moisturizer during the day, but alone at night.  </li>
            <li> and I even got some burning by using it a little close to my nose</li>
            <li> I have read the reviews for people that say they&#x27;ve  seen improvenments in as little as 3 days that is why I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> Proved that it reduces my dark rings under my eyes!  </li>
            <li> Not for dark circle!</li>
            <li> Also with a little massage your bags will diminish.</li>
            <li> Tingles a little once you put it on.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe a little improvement would start before that.  </li>
            <li> A little background.</li>
            <li> A little goes a looong way.</li>
            <li> It seems to be helping a little??</li>
            <li> so I bought this hoping for just a little improvement</li>
            <li> Helped the darkness under my eyes, but still a little puffy.  </li>
            <li> I use less and less under eye concealer every day!</li>
            <li> Maybe a little crows feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month</li>
            <li> Thought nothing would help but maybe this would just lighten it up a little.</li>
            <li> You just need a little.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes the eye area well, and it is early for results, but my eye area looks brighter and less tired!</li>
            <li> I also have incredibly dry skin which only makes my wrinkles look much worse!</li>
            <li> Tight?): Very slightly tight, very slightly sticky (often the case with moisturizing ingredients like hyaluronic acid and glycerin)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a well known, expensive product for a long time and was generally not please with the results.  </li>
            <li> I can say that I was a little worried it might be like glue because when it dried on the applicator, it was like glue.  </li>
            <li> but I will still continue to use and hope it continue to improve down the line!</li>
            <li> I have very dark circles and puffiness under both of my eyes.</li>
            <li> I get no irritation using this product unlike soms other eye creams!!</li>
            <li> I am always a little skeptical of putting cream near my eyes as all the ones that I have ever used</li>
            <li> and with 2 little kids, it&#x27;s only made things worse.</li>
            <li> I got it because I have pretty bad puffiness and dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> It did not work at all even though my dark circles are pretty bad, it still did nothing, no improvement</li>
            <li> I am one of those people who has 6 different jars of face cream in her bathroom, each one just as disappointing as the next.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who suffers from under eye puffiness when they wake up.</li>
            <li> My face seemed in dire need of some serious exfoliating or some thing as there seemed a dry wrinkly layer over my face.  </li>
            <li> will update this review after I&#x27;ve used the product for a few months.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t break me out, doesn&#x27;t weigh heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me, plus it dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> it actually seemed to make my eyes look a lil worse</li>
            <li> But i read the reviews saying to use it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> It does take a few weeks</li>
            <li> have been too heavy</li>
            <li> but I haven’t had that trouble at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used this eye cream for a few weeks, it made my eyes look as if I had lost a lot of sleep.  </li>
            <li> won&#x27;t waste money on it again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Within a few days, I saw a visible reduction of darkness under my eyes, and I wish now that I had taken photos to do a comparison.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now twice a day.  </li>
            <li> but after using it my face felt dried out.</li>
            <li> Have used it now for a few months; noticed immediate effects in just 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The last time I was there and looked in the mirror I saw tired baggy eyes.  </li>
            <li> use it everyday, it worths the price</li>
            <li> Surprisingly enough it made my under eye bags and puffy lids worse if I used it at night as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d wake up looking like I&#x27;d been crying all night.</li>
            <li> Within a few days I began to receive compliments</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this one</li>
            <li> It also leaves a white flakey residue behind.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money folks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye gel for a few days</li>
            <li> I see a small difference in my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind doing it twice a day everyday.</li>
            <li> Well, I have had this product just a few days</li>
            <li> i cannot notice any difference, waste of money</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for about a month, morning and night, everyday, but I see no results.</li>
            <li> I will keep going to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> heavy under.your.eyes.</li>
            <li> You could see a difference slightly in a few days.  </li>
            <li> used this cream every day for a few weeks and sort of forgot about</li>
            <li> I have been using it for just a few weeks</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and night.</li>
            <li> I hope to use it for a few months.</li>
            <li> I will post a follow-up review after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> but I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall for the gimmicky name and hype.</li>
            <li> I believe it takes a few applications to &amp;#34;kick in&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I noticed a reduction in puffiness around my eyes after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> Within a few days, I did notice a reduction in puffiness and the over all eye outline started to look firmer and healither.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few weeks now, and I have noticed my skin improving.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, I used it for a few weeks but found no noticeable difference resulted.</li>
            <li> I truly see a difference everyday when I put it on.</li>
            <li> and I have tried a few....)</li>
            <li> I like the way my eyes look now that I have been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> The site states that this helps to firm and plump up the skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I can feel it firming my eyes up within just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it works for dark circles, but I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Regarding its affect on the dark circles, I am not sure it has lessened yet,  though again this is genetics at play.</li>
            <li> I used this on my eye area for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I will alter my review to reflect that in a few months.</li>
            <li> but I saw no difference after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying an eye gel because I am extremely sensitive around the eye area.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t heavy.</li>
            <li> Caused pimples to form under my eyes where I used it after a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21 and unfortunately, wrinkles under my eyes are hereditary and something that I have always had to deal with, despite my young age.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that some people had trouble with it under their makeup.  </li>
            <li> I have not used everyday yet.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my mom to try out as she has trouble sleeping and often experiences under eye circles.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks of using the difference was noticeable and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I am 24 and scared I&#x27;ll look 50 in just a few years.</li>
            <li> I found it to burn for the few minutes that it was drying.</li>
            <li> It does firm well</li>
            <li> I use it everyday before using make up.</li>
            <li> Been using a few weeks now, twice a day.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using a moisturizer on your skin after the gel has dried as well.  </li>
            <li> He has also recommended the product to a few co-workers and family members.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using different eye creams for almost 15 years, but I still looked exhausted.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I use this everyday under makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday, and I can see the difference.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday just for THAT ;</li>
            <li> It got to the point that the skin is so dried out now that it hurts.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye gel, night and day, for a few weeks now...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have used product for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Been using it a few weeks</li>
            <li> I know some people had mentioned they had trouble with that.</li>
            <li> I hated it, they are much better than they were a month ago.  </li>
            <li> I did this 3x, each time suffering from puffy, burning eyelids and eyes a few hours after application.</li>
            <li> and I have been using this product everyday since I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that when I do not use I can tell a difference in just a matter of a few days.</li>
            <li> ive been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> However after that I started using very little - a small dime sized drop on one finger, blended it with my other finger and then applied under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Thus, give it a try, you can see the difference within less than one week!</li>
            <li> Less puffiness after just a couple of weeks!</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye gel for about a month and a half or so, and I have to say it works for me!</li>
            <li> I used it around my eyes but mainly on those horrible vertical lines above my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> It’s very thick gel so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have a very pale complexion as well as dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have dark circles and a little puffiness around my eyes and have for at least 15 years.</li>
            <li> It does feel a little sticky once it&#x27;s dried, but that&#x27;s what I usually put on moisturizer and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about everything from cheap drugstore crap to very expensive and this stuff really messed me up.</li>
            <li> I have not been getting much sleep due to taking care of my sick mom.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel very firm and gives a slight glow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a plain, lightweight gel, not a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> plain....</li>
            <li> It is a bit stiff under my lower eye lids after it dries so that make-up does not go on quite as well.  </li>
            <li> Used twice daily the results are dramatic.</li>
            <li> I have used numerous under eye products including very expensive brands such as la prairie and la mer.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not easy to apply foundation over the gel cream.</li>
            <li> and I knew I could not easily put makeup over it, so</li>
            <li> I am far past skeptical about things like this, but....</li>
            <li> Dark circles more like the worst saddle bags ever.</li>
            <li> but I do use it round my lips and on the lines from my nose down (commonly called marionette lines)  </li>
            <li> but if feel sticky when I leave it to dry, so I had to wash it white a cold water</li>
            <li> My bags are still pretty bad..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I saw any difference in the dark circles around my eyes, but those aren&#x27;t caused by stress or late hours, they&#x27;re hereditary, and may be immune to the effects of something like this.  </li>
            <li> This usually determines if I will continue to purchase or discontinue the use and throw the product away ( plenty of money wasted ).  </li>
            <li> My eyes seem brighter and the embarrassing dark circles under them are slowly lightening up and going away.</li>
            <li> I am looking for products that help slow down the wrinkles progression by adding hydration and elasticity.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re hard to get rid of and if you cover them up, you can still see the puffiness from where they&#x27;re hidden.</li>
            <li> Seems to firm up skin for awhile, only to leave weird film on skin after.</li>
            <li> I have dry and thin skin</li>
            <li> I use less concealer when putting on my make up lately.</li>
            <li> Please note that you must apply thinly or it will flake a bit when dry.  </li>
            <li> So just a little does the trick!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 40), so I add a little aquaphor and that seems to help a lot!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a little miracle!</li>
            <li> product solutions as I have tried so many and been very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My tissue looks less thin and with make up the dark areas are virtually invisible.  </li>
            <li> I have a serious problem with dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> As I grew older I became very insecure of my looks</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product hands down!!</li>
            <li> and I STILL get very little sleep.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to use very little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day for six months and have seen very little improvement.  </li>
            <li> It works just like promised and like all your other products I have purchased!!!</li>
            <li> My skin is tighter and looks less tired, and my color has slightly improved.</li>
            <li> Has helped me look less tired and less like the crypt keeper.</li>
            <li> My eyes are usually puffy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is working</li>
            <li> and I can see small results.  </li>
            <li> It is really difficult to get him to use anything both day and night, but I finally convinced him to try this product, and I can&#x27;t believe the difference.</li>
            <li> UNBELIEVABLE..</li>
            <li> Using an eye gel or cream, I&#x27;m always wary of introducing chemicals, especially chemicals which may end up burning or stinging my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have used this eye gel for the past 2-3 months</li>
            <li> but i rather just get a refund because i am not pleased</li>
            <li> I just use a small dot or two</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is working.</li>
            <li> I usually use algenist eye balm</li>
            <li> I was not really sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> I was not sure that it&#x27;s the eye cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the rave is about.</li>
            <li> I usually use the gel at night, but yesterday I tried it during the day</li>
            <li> The direction printing on the label is so small you would have to use a microscope to read it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of really expensive eye creams and gels and the only ones that worked</li>
            <li> so with the low price point I decided what the heck ill try it....</li>
            <li> THE LAST EYE GEL, ill ever buy.</li>
            <li> Im not sure about this product.  </li>
            <li> I get things done usually after the kids go to bed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this product is so well reviewed.</li>
            <li> It was soothing to begin with (with no real sign of immediate improvement) and then within a week, my tired lines started to fade.</li>
            <li> A small amount is all that is required to apply.  </li>
            <li> I have used it diligently in the past two months and have not seen visible result.</li>
            <li> they say to just dab on a little bit, they mean it.</li>
            <li> so I my expectations were low and boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> The first time I applied it before bed it possibly caused one of the poorest nights of sleep I&#x27;ve ever had including horrible night sweats.  </li>
            <li> I usually ending tossing the eye creams I&#x27;ve bought over the years, but not this one.  </li>
            <li> It usually takes about a month for any cream to start making a difference on my skin, except this one.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I pat a small amount of the InstaNatural eye gel around each eye.  </li>
            <li> I remained hopeful and tried it for a few weeks hoping that i would at least see improvement when i washed my face and the product wasn&#x27;t on.</li>
            <li> but I am not sure.</li>
            <li> The veins are not nearly as prominent as they were.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about this product yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product night and day for the past 3 weeks</li>
            <li> Not sure I see any difference after using this, however it may work for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also skeptical of claims to erase bags, lines or turn back the clock.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the small wrinkles are also getting smoother.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve rubbed a dab of this stuff under each eye twice a day for the past month or so.</li>
            <li> (My usual eye cream is $95.)</li>
            <li> They will refund you if it&#x27;s not satisfying to you.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> but i want to pass on cus it help unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> I wear it everyday under my makeup!</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I wouldn&#x27;t have thought I would use eye cream until I was middle-aged at least.</li>
            <li> after 2 days I have no more puffy eyes</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t be afraid to try it.  </li>
            <li> As usual, InstaNatural nailed it.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to shave everyday!</li>
            <li> I tried it but within 4 days of using the product I started getting small pimples below the eye.</li>
            <li> I have been using it almost every morning and night for the past month and the area around my eyes seem moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have done so in the past and would do so again if I feel an item does not meet standards</li>
            <li> Just a small press and</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with results.</li>
            <li> I used this 2-3 times a day for the past 6 months, and no results.</li>
            <li> Not cute.</li>
            <li> The directions say put a small amount around the eyes, forehead and cheeks.</li>
            <li> have seen a small difference since using the product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Not sure what they offer reviewers but let it go.</li>
            <li> not sure what all the rave reviews are about.  </li>
            <li> Ill pay an extra 20 .</li>
            <li> the size of a small pea covers both under eye areas.  </li>
            <li> My eyes look a little brighter and less tired.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mom of a very active one-year-old and my job requires very long days which leaves me looking very tired.  </li>
            <li> The morning puffiness seems to be cooled, calmed and reduced by the gel.&lt;br /&gt;The gel does leave a very slight sticky residue (it really is hardly noticeable,</li>
            <li> it seems like my dark circles have gotten progressively worse when they really weren&#x27;t that bad before using the product.  </li>
            <li> Do you know how I can tell if I look tired to other people?</li>
            <li> Sticky, bad and makes you look older if you stop using it.</li>
            <li> i have tried just about every eye cream &amp; serum that promised to remove dark circles &amp; puffiness, some of which have been quite expensive, with no success..  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel tired, I just constantly look tired.  </li>
            <li> I see a small difference as in bags are hardly there</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really impossible to turn back the clock, but at least this product doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes or burn my skin the way other products have.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on other expensive brands and just give this gel a try.  </li>
            <li> so I usually end up staying up too late.</li>
            <li> My eye area- wrinkles, dark circles and puff are markedly decreased.</li>
            <li> However, in the morning wake up, the dark circle is even worse.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was disappointed because the company is very communicative and helpful.   </li>
            <li> The dark circle that started to show up started to improve and he didn&#x27;t look tired all the time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so tired all of the time and have dark circles under my eyes from not sleeping well.  </li>
            <li> you are worried that the product will not work, then at least you know if it does not work for you they will immediately refund you your money since you were not completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> and get really tired, dark circled eyes.</li>
            <li> I no longer have the dark circles and that tired ragged look.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had a very bad year last year with so many bad things happening to us, from finding out our twins</li>
            <li> My eyes are looking way less tired than before.</li>
            <li> I do look refreshed and less tired.</li>
            <li> Even decreased the puffiness and slight bags I was developing.</li>
            <li> I usually use.&lt;br /&gt;You do not want to use but a very small amt.</li>
            <li> It is a very thick gel and feels a little sticky when applied</li>
            <li> All of my wrinkles and creases, even the ones around my mouth, are hardly noticeable now.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s in a pump bottle, although it&#x27;s sometimes hard to control the amount that comes out</li>
            <li> I find it hard to get the amount I want.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to force it too hard and risk breaking it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use hardly any under eye concealer now, which saves me time and money.</li>
            <li> and I have a hard time blending it in.</li>
            <li> I was blessed with horrible, deep under eye circles and this helped those seem not as deep and crows feet seemed less noticable as well.</li>
            <li> I applied for about 2 weeks and the little wrinkles around my eyes are gone!!</li>
            <li> Lines smoothed and dark circles gone!!!</li>
            <li> This is a little frustrating, as it means it is going to be used up faster than I would like.  </li>
            <li> It helps a little for tired under-eye circles</li>
            <li> Little bit of irritating</li>
            <li> So far I have had nothing bad happen, and it hasn&#x27;t upset my skin in any way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (hence at least 2 stars)</li>
            <li> I use it at least once a day but aim to use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> thou the selling company kept on sending me emails to leave a review I felt like at least I should try it longer to see</li>
            <li> It does not leave a sticky residue or cause my make up to get all wonky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at, my skin reacts in a negative fashion to any sort of cream.  </li>
            <li> This product is not effective in any way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have oily skin &amp; I am in my late twenties ever since adding this product to my skin care regime  </li>
            <li> I never liked to sleep at night and would stay up the enter night.  </li>
            <li> 2 stars because at least this didn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> Hope it works for you, sucks that it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I often stay up late</li>
            <li> My extremely delicate skin went from irritated and peeling to moisturized and supple.</li>
            <li> I have found that when the eye gel dries under my eyes it pulls at that delicate skin</li>
            <li> I have a delicate, Scandinavian type skin.  </li>
            <li> It reduces the puffiness in the eye area and moisturizes the delicate skin.</li>
            <li> 2x&#x27;s a day for at least a month, well to my surprise,</li>
            <li> Listen to the negative reviews folks.</li>
            <li> try to do a stringent exfoliating routine at least twice a week.  </li>
            <li> it sucks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always nervous about using face creams under my eyes, the skin is so delicate, so I looked into products specifically for under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> But around Day 10 I noticed the color of the &amp;#34;bruise&amp;#34; had lightened up at least one shade.</li>
            <li> I wish amazon offered negative star options.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid, Peptide Complex, Plant Stem Cells, Matrixyl 3000, Amino Acid Complex are listed on the front of the package.</li>
            <li> I just hope to at least maintain the status quo and Youth Express goes a bit beyond that.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I inherited puffy eyes that gets worse when I am  tired or with  allergies and now at  forty two (42) years old</li>
            <li> Thinking the reason was something else-a cold or fatigue, I did not initially think it was the product.</li>
            <li> Lately my husband has been fussing about the puffiness under his eyes.  </li>
            <li> pull out all of the stops when it comes to their quality ingredients: hyaluronic acid, plant stem cells, amino acid complex, peptide complex, and matrixyl 3000, vitamin e, and jojoba oil to name a handful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Peptide complex</li>
            <li> Peptide complex  4.Matrixyl 3000  5.</li>
            <li> Amino Acid Complex.</li>
            <li> spent so much on expensive products.</li>
            <li> Im in complete shocked that im on my 4th using it</li>
            <li> It leaves thick film on your face.  </li>
            <li> I always looked dead and tired even when I was well rested and wanted to see if this could work.</li>
            <li> It smooths every line,  moisturizes my skin and isn&#x27;t greasy or thick.  </li>
            <li> The consistency of the InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel is a bit thick and pasty</li>
            <li> , it is thick</li>
            <li> I did not look so tired after using this for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> But what I noticed is that the thick gel formula felt cakey around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> In just a few days my eyes looked brighter and not so tired.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Light cucumber scent, thick product but</li>
            <li> I haven’t used it under makeup during the day because it’s too thick.</li>
            <li> serum is thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit thick.</li>
            <li> no more dark circle!!!!  </li>
            <li> No more puffiness in the morning!</li>
            <li> The other expensive eye cream I have is forgotten in my closet immediately.</li>
            <li> and I thought well just like other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products was skeptical about the results with this product but thought I&#x27;d give it a try....</li>
            <li> It reduces the puffiness that I usually get when I am overtired!</li>
            <li> I had a small burn (red patch) about the size of a dime on my cheek from using a bad product, well it&#x27;s been there for about 3 years, make up covers it</li>
            <li> Dark circles always made my eyes look tired and made me look tired</li>
            <li> Cucumber hydrosol and aloe are two of the main base ingredients.</li>
            <li> :-( Was really hoping it would help, but alas</li>
            <li> A very small amount is all that is needed for under both eyes.  </li>
            <li> I am also, very lazy too</li>
            <li> I started getting very small blisters in my eyes after 3 days of use.</li>
            <li> I am 40 and over the past 5 years my  puffiness has increasingly gotten worse.</li>
            <li> With this, I saw less bagginess in 2 weeks!!!</li>
            <li> I recommend this gel to anyone who is exhausted with being disappointed over and over again from these high priced creams with no results!!!&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li> so maybe the improvement is too subtle for me to notice.</li>
            <li> It turns the skin red and raw and is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I am little obsessed about my face and body routine.</li>
            <li> I am always a little skeptical about skin care products and what they can do.</li>
            <li> the next morning my eyes are all puffy and it looks like I have a bad hangover.</li>
            <li> have two different behavioral disorders with developmental delays, my husband needing foot surgery on both feet with a bad insurance plan and two months no pay, getting skin cancer removed, my son needing two surgeries, and the list goes on.</li>
            <li> But anyway I got really bad bags from not getting enough sleep, so I went to check out amazon to see what I could find.</li>
            <li> Sorry but waste of money</li>
            <li> not good .. not as stated</li>
            <li> this no good, didn&#x27;t help me.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it for a month, in case I have something wrong, but totally wasted time.</li>
            <li> Not a good product.  </li>
            <li> Use sparingly - i think I used too much a few times and it gave the skin under my eyes a weird crepe-like texture.  </li>
            <li> I found that when I yawned, the skin under my eye would sort of &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to another part of my skin with some of the cream that had dried, which felt REALLY weird.</li>
            <li> I have been an esthetician for years and this is complete crap</li>
            <li> Countless times people have mentioned that I have very bad dark circles.</li>
            <li> the gel makes the skin around my eyes very tight and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> When you apply, it has a tiny bit of a cooling feeling, but nothing too weird or crazy.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t know why some people complained!</li>
            <li> Third week I ran out, and I was disappointed because I saw no results with this product.</li>
            <li> husband suffers from dark undereye circles, crows feet, and puffy/saggy skin.</li>
            <li> Called the company, they said you have to use it for several months before you see results. :(</li>
            <li> I noticed improvement in the mornings and throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with puffy under eye issues knows that this problem is very hard to correct.  </li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed in the eye gel not even a little change in the puffiness, still look tired......</li>
            <li> Very sad to have spent this money!</li>
            <li> well you can feel it getting tight and cold</li>
            <li> Another waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any improvement, which it says it can take a few weeks, but I have very painful burning and dry patches around my eyes.</li>
            <li> but alas, it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Gone was the dryness and the tired look.</li>
            <li> I feel that even when I am tired this eye gel helps in keeping me looked refreshed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m too tired.  </li>
            <li> The item is broken when delivered.</li>
            <li> It does as it says, the puffiness under my eyes is decreased, as the bags.  </li>
            <li> My eyes looked worse after three weeks</li>
            <li> After a series of fruitless efforts, I finally tired InstaNatural.</li>
            <li> but they haven&#x27;t gotten worse.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not any worse than anyhing I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I always felt like my eyes looked worse than everybody elses...</li>
            <li> In fact, over time it seemed like my issues got worse.  </li>
            <li> I was slightly annoyed because it felt sticky on my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to mothers who have infants as it will dramatically change the appearance of looking tired all the time.</li>
            <li> and it did absolutely nothing which was pathetic because it cost me $60.</li>
            <li> I have both brown pigment and thin skin that shows purple underneath.  </li>
            <li> For example, they stand behind their products no matter where you bought them or who you bought them from.</li>
            <li> So as you can tell my eyes stay tired looking.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a terrific base for all of your makeup.  </li>
            <li> My eyes still looks puffy and tired.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a tired look to them ..</li>
            <li> Still look tired</li>
            <li> People sometimes asking me if I am tired.</li>
            <li> All this does is leave a sticky residue all over my eyes which I feel compelled to wash off after a while because it&#x27;s so irritating.</li>
            <li> I have used for over a month &amp; the wrinkles around my eyes have decreased dramatically.  </li>
            <li> Did not help me I feel it makes it worse still have bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> it made my bags worse</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it is called &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34;, but based on the scientific sense, I think it is the worse</li>
            <li> My eyes looks worse.</li>
            <li> I discontinued as it was irritating my skin and making it turn</li>
            <li> I use it when I wake up tired.</li>
            <li> I used to have the always tired look with bags and darkness.</li>
            <li> Made my eyes look worse - had to wash it off.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles under my eyes got worse since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> The gel is so gluey making my under eye bag stick together.</li>
            <li> I use as directed on bottle, before bed time and in morning, I am not happy with the results of this product and will not be purchasing anymore.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve seen the difference it can make I can&#x27;t imagine waiting for the signs to get worse before using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took 2 weeks to see the result (I apply a thin layer, twice/day)</li>
            <li> I wanted to write a rave review saying it performed a miracle on my puffy, tired eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen visible results with decreased puffiness and bags.</li>
            <li> but I do with puffiness and tired eyes.  </li>
            <li> but it makes it worse in the morning.</li>
            <li> The smell is not great</li>
            <li> Been using for approximately 2 weeks with no difference.  </li>
            <li> My eyes always look puffy, tired, etc.</li>
            <li> Some days I think it made my eyes looks worse.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for it irritating and burning my eyes I would stick with it.  </li>
            <li> I do not look tired anymore.</li>
            <li> I have really bad dark circles</li>
            <li> I have notice a difference but my dark circles wasn&#x27;t that bad  </li>
            <li> No difference, and my dark circles and puffiness aren&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> I was shocked because I&#x27;ve used everything under the sun to try to get rid of the dark circles since I was a teenager</li>
            <li> When I started wearing contact lenses I was shocked to see the bags under my eyes that had been hidden by my glasses.  </li>
            <li> After 2 weeks, I&#x27;ve seen dramatic results.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be working, though I don&#x27;t see dramatic results yet.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy it because I see a dramatic change already and</li>
            <li> Nothing dramatic.</li>
            <li> I do have some issues with a slight burning around my eye if I get down almost to my cheek bone, but nothing horrible</li>
            <li> i stopped using this product and am still looking for a dark circle corrector.. :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing pressure did that during the shipping(I&#x27;m located military base overseas).&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> So, needless to say some days/nights, my eyes can be so exhausted and puffy.</li>
            <li> but it diminished my bags and eyelid puffiness by at least 50%!!</li>
            <li> I hate that I suffer from dark under eyes, and this happens from lack of sleep.</li>
            <li> Virtually worthless, does not reduce or eliminate dark circles or puffiness.</li>
            <li> I get the little balling up effect which I hate.  </li>
            <li> Late night online shopping gone bad.</li>
            <li> Too expensive.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fake</li>
            <li> it is really difficult to put on makeup over the gel</li>
            <li> My brother and I were having a random conversation about aging and how we notice the aging around our eyes.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> and i think some are fake.</li>
            <li> I will not be buying this again, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Definitely fake reviews.</li>
            <li> is that I was beginning to have the look of bags under the eye - but flattened with the look of tear drops - so broken capillaries!</li>
            <li> unfortunately</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it, but, not extremely impressed.</li>
            <li> This is quite sticky and difficult to apply makeup</li>
            <li> I was not impressed at all.  </li>
            <li> Sorry I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I have never heard of InstaNatural</li>
            <li> But, it wasn&#x27;t that expensive, so I decided to try it anyway.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Not really impressed with the consistency.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s game for trying stuff like this too!</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical of &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I think are fake.</li>
            <li> Even after chilling it in the fridge</li>
            <li> /&gt;She was skeptical, but I knew it would work all along.</li>
            <li> I am really sorry I did.</li>
            <li> Sorry but is the truth.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical,  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> No No! Not Happy!</li>
            <li> Its sad to have I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or leave a weird film.</li>
            <li> This is a can&#x27;t go wrong product and company.</li>
            <li> not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> If it works for all of these things, how can I go wrong trying it?</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
            <li> Not even under your eyes because it gives this weird outline.</li>
            <li> The next morning my eyes looked terrible.</li>
            <li> Ill use that</li>
            <li> sorry this gel did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I just couldn&#x27;t tolerate it.</li>
            <li> Not impressed!</li>
            <li> sad face</li>
            <li> Useless,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not have any results using the product.  </li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t look much tired!</li>
            <li> It is expensive and useless to buy this</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for the bags under my eyes sadly.</li>
            <li> i was sorry to have purchased it.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, the worst part was the RED EYES.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesnt work for me at all.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a mediocre product.</li>
            <li> It was truly weird.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, we both haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried creams from my doctor that were so expensive.</li>
            <li> These must be fake.</li>
            <li> The improvement under my eyes has been remarked upon by family, friends and even casual acquaintances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very bad dark circles and puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> My husband tried it as well hoping it would work for his dark circles and he was very disappointed that I spend my money in a product that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> But when I added it to my makeup and other skin products, my reaction was terrible.</li>
            <li> Recommend for elimination of those nasty dark spots under your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.</li>
            <li> do nothing for my dark circles which have been especially bad since I started law school.</li>
            <li> I have horrible dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> She has terrible dark circles under her eyes and we always attributed it to her having an iron deficiency.</li>
            <li> I have the worst dark circles under my eyes, i never sleep well.</li>
            <li> I was truly disappointed of the poor results.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed waste of money.</li>
            <li> and it does tingle, but nothing too crazy.</li>
            <li> So disappointing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear tons of makeup, but the puffiness under my eyes was driving me crazy.</li>
            <li> But, if I had to pick just one, I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;d pick this.....</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Very sad it did not work for me though.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the very faint smell of cucumber...</li>
            <li> I was soooo very skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at the beginning but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> Some were very expensive.  </li>
            <li> My night time cream is a very expensive Rx from my dermatologist</li>
            <li> It is very faint and does smell a bit like a cucumber.  </li>
            <li> My wife was VERY skeptical, so 4-Stars from her</li>
            <li> Useless crap.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this eye cream and thought it was a bit of a gimmick.</li>
            <li> Sounds impossible</li>
            <li> I suffer from bad allergies.</li>
            <li> I apply it in the morning and my swollen eyes don&#x27;t look as bad.  </li>
            <li> Bad eye genes?</li>
            <li> Bad idea for me.</li>
            <li> This cream is also bad advertising because it doesn&#x27;t do what it states.</li>
            <li> and I dd not have any bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad happened either using it</li>
            <li> This is helping already after about a week or so, I have really bad allergies and asthma from when I was a kid</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believer they weren&#x27;t even that bad before now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so shocked and stressed.</li>
            <li> Then I got sick and did nothing for almost 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I have not idea, but I am so sick of these cremes getting 3000 plus reviews on here.</li>
            <li> Horrified is what I am to say the least!!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed since it didn&#x27;t even hydrate his under eye area being that the consistency seemed like it would.</li>
            <li> This Eye gel caused me to break out. :(</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in the product because I bought it for puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m desperate!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying it again :(</li>
            <li> but I do apply a moisturizer to my face every morning after getting out of the shower, I was disappointed with how sticky if felt on my face</li>

            <li> I was doubtful but this product works.  </li>
            <li> Thought I could use this as a base under makeup</li>
            <li> It looks like silicon, or some gel base for safety.</li>
            <li> He would get up wash his face and then apply the gel under his eyes, on his forehead and on the base of his cheeks.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for about half a year now. I have oily and combination skin and my skin around my eyes is very sensitive. When i use those high end very rich eye creams, I will have little white bumps under my eyes. This eye cream is very hydrating and it does not have any strong smell to it. It absorbs quickly and easily applied evenly. I have recommended this product to all my girl friends, and they love it too. A little bit goes a long way, with the pump it is easy to control the amount you need each time. I use it day and night with gentle massage, less fine lines and my eye concealer applies better too.</li>
            <li> I used this crap every day, twice a day for over 6 weeks and it had zero effect on my dark circles. I thought it would be worth my money since it&#x27;s gotten such great reviews but alas, it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this eye cream for half a year, the overall feeling pretty good, even better than what expensive large spleen. First, it does not produce allergic reactions (I am a sensitive skin), secondly it reduces the large bags, but bags will not completely disappear. I really like this eye cream, because it cheap. I&#x27;ll keep using it. Thanks manufacturer of promotional activities, the price is cheaper.</li>
            <li> What a great product! It works very well, and I have no complaints with it at all. Better still, their customer service reached out to me a little while after purchasing to ensure I was completely satisfied with my order. Needless to say, I am more than satisfied, and I will be back when I run out!&lt;br /&gt;Cheers to AJ, the rep that followed up with me, for the great service provided to me!</li>
            <li> I do like InstaNatural products as a whole. I do feel like this product helps eliminate my puffy eyes. I suffer from bad allergies. My eyes are usually puffy. Now my eyes feel more alert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one ingredient that I had to look up - Methylsulfonylmethane (I had to look this one up as I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of sulfates. MSM is a chemical found in plants, animals, and humans. People use it as a medicine. They don&#x27;t have any sulfates in their products. I&#x27;ve had no reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was given to me for review. I&#x27;m a professional blogger that writes my true opinion.</li>
            <li> Excellent  product- reduce eye puffiness. I rely like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is working but then I haven&#x27;t been using it every day.</li>
            <li> I like the cooling feeling I get 2hen i apply this serum to my eye area. In a week of use i have not seen any improvement in the dark circles under my eyes but i will keep trying. If i see improvements I will be back!</li>
            <li> Have not seen any difference in the bags under my eyes. Save your money. Try instantly ageless. Works right away but is temporary.</li>
            <li> Does not work for me. Been three weeks since using this product daily and I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable change. Too expensive.</li>
            <li> The product works as advertised,  I began seeing results within 4 weeks with application to my eyes twice a day.  I highly recommend this those who get the &amp;#34;you look tired&amp;#34; remarks.  The product lives up to its name,  and the company sent out an email with instructions on the most effective way to use the product,  which I thought was very professional.</li>
            <li> Truly fantastic. It dramatically reduced the dark circles around my eyes. I will keep on using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the Retinol moisturizing cream which is also very good....however I don&#x27;t really notice anything taking place with this product yet....have had and used for over a month 1/2 now.  I don&#x27;t have as much dark circle issues as puffiness and bags.  The Eye serum has a great consistency and I do notice a difference in wrinkles around the eye with the serum.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel,It has helped with my dark circles,I have also used it on my face and neck and it feels great my skin feels tight.It is going to be great to use during the summer as it is not greasy and it absorbs quick.I have spent tons of money on eye creams this one by far works really good!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. My fiancé tried it for awhile now (1.5 month min) and it has done literally nothing for his under eye bag. I&#x27;m disappointed since it didn&#x27;t even hydrate his under eye area being that the consistency seemed like it would. Just save your money.</li>
            <li> 5 weeks in and seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> So far really pleased - hope it gets better with time!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I noticed a difference in my dark circles within a couple weeks. Haven&#x27;t found another product I can say the same about. I keep it in the refrigerator and it feels very refreshing. Also this company has amazing customer service.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month now and can say I have seen improvement in the dark circles and wrinkles around my eyes. I did not see the improvement the first week, but after a couple weeks I could tell. A really great product.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle.  It somehow stays very hydrating through the night.  I don&#x27;t use during the daytime sine I use undereye cover up and tends to be too sticky.  Definitely reduces fine lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely reducing the puffiness under my eyes.  I use it 2x daily, morning and night.  Glad I bought the product.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a couple off weeks, and have been so far impressed with the results on my puffy eyes in the morning. my eyes went to very puffy to almost nonexistent. don&#x27;t really know about dark circles because i don&#x27;t have them. if it keeps working this good i will definitely purchase this item when it runs out. I got this item for free to try out for a promotion but all my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Something makes me puffy, might be the aloe</li>
            <li> I have just used it for about 2 weeks. I have a sensitive face to most cosmetics, but so far I have had NO reaction to this - very good - as by now any reaction would have shown up (usually within the first day or two). So, so far so good! It goes on very smoothly, dries quickly. I use the Baobab oil on top of it which works fine.</li>
            <li> After using it for a while, I have start getting the results I was looking for. I like the coolness I feel when I applied it to my eyes.  My eye&#x27;s puffiness are improving and I will continue to use it.    Dante</li>
            <li> I have been using this for around 3 weeks now and have not noticed much difference in my fine lines or wrinkly eyelids (and I&#x27;m only 23).  The skin around my eyes, however, feels softer, and my dark circles have lightened ever so slightly.  It has also helped with puffiness on nights I don&#x27;t get any sleep.  I&#x27;ll update my review in about 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully. Just ordered my second jar!</li>
            <li> So the pros:&lt;br /&gt;It seems like the product does work.  After only a few days I started to see a change around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;It suggests that you put it on at night and in the morning.  It leaves thick film on your face.  I tried putting it on thinner and thinner but it always felt like I had a gel mask on.  I gave up putting it on in the morning.  It was too annoying.  I eventually gave up putting it on at night too.  The feel of it was too gross for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it did make me break out some.  I was kinda surprised because I almost never do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Because I am a guy maybe I am not use to having stuff on my face all the time.  I really couldn&#x27;t stand to do it anymore.  But if you are willing to put up with it I think it would work for you.  I instead started washing my face twice a day with cerave and have gotten some good results with it.</li>
            <li> My wife has dark circles and is always looking for an eye cream to help with that and all the other issues this cream helps with. She seems very happy with this eye cream and states she’s noticed her eye area doesn’t seem to be as dark. Also has noticed a difference with the other issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am very satisfied with this product. It is good to know that Insta Natural are always thinking about people who needs healhty and beautiful skin !  Thanks to take your customers !!  I will buy this product again .</li>
            <li> Puffiness is gone and the dark circles have already started to lighten up! I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for about 2 weeks and have noticed a difference.  It has softened &amp; plumped up the skin around my eyes which makes the lines much less noticeable.  I do seem to see a difference in the puffiness too.  The overall texture &amp; moisture under the eye is improved.  I also dab a little on the cheeks and they even appear softer with improved texture &amp; appearance.  I will be buying this again and am very satisfied.  I have tried several, but this one stands out as having more noticeable improvement than others I&#x27;ve tried. The price is also reasonable, so that will keep me coming back too.</li>
            <li> This is the second time i have ordered this. I Love it very much! It makes my skin so so soft and silky. It is a good value too.</li>
            <li> Scam. Doesn&#x27;t work. Used it per the instructions.</li>
            <li> When I applied this product to the skin under my eyes, I felt this burning pain in the area of contact, and soon after, it turned red. I&#x27;ve never had a problem before with any of kind skin care product. Also, I was really surprised because of all the good reviews I&#x27;ve read about this product. Guess it&#x27;s just not for everyone. I don&#x27;t know what to do with this product now...should I throw it out or try it on other body parts...?</li>
            <li> It did not work for me at all. Another waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about a month and my dark circles and puffiness are less noticeable. The price is great, it&#x27;s all natural and they have awesome customer service. Very attentive. Definitely give it a try!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff  I can see its already working!!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my skib so soft!!</li>
            <li> I have only used it a coulple times, so I have not seen a huge difference but it feels nice. I think it will take more time to see real results!</li>
            <li> I was really really excited for this product with all of its amazingly positive reviews and realistic pictures, but i didn&#x27;t really see a difference with the dark circles. I did see a difference in the puffiness though! (hence at least 2 stars) every morning before my daily make up routine, i would put this on and within minutes, the morning puffiness would go away before i applied make up on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a huge downfall is/was the fact that it came in messy as hell. the eye cream kind of... exploded? in its package... so gooey and dirty.&lt;br /&gt;and when i tried pressing on it to squeeze out some gel.... the next morning, there is a HUGE mess inside the lid. it would compress more out of the bottle overnight.... -____- i stopped using this product and am still looking for a dark circle corrector.. :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any effect with my eye bag</li>
            <li> Love love love this eye cream!!  It&#x27;s a thicker formula that melds smoothly into your skin.  I combine this with another eye cream I&#x27;m almost out of and love my results!!!</li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t work for me, but the return process was extremely easy and was no hassle at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent tons of money trying to find an eye cream that even comes close to delivering the results they claim to. How nice to finally find something that actually does what it says it will do! I have huge bags and dark circles under my eyes (thank you, genetics) and this stuff has actually minimized them significantly. The darkness is lessened, and my whole appearance is fresher and more youthful. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using this twice a day since I received it and I&#x27;m already noticing an improvement!</li>
            <li> BETTER than expected. Bags and dark circles began fading within 1st week. No other product I have tried came even close. I have already ordered a second package</li>
            <li> Great for attacking those fine lines you start getting in your early 30s. I cant speak for any older wrinkles though. I will ask my mom to judge</li>
            <li> This is the best I have used. Go on smooth. I like that I can use it all over my face.</li>
            <li> I started using this eye gel over a month ago and I can see small results.  I was under no impression that it would permanently remove my dark circles, but it has definitely helped take some of the puffiness and darkness away.</li>
            <li> Egh, I&#x27;ve used better creams. I find that it works some days better than others. Sometime I use it all over my face because the silicone texture makes me glow. Still finishing the product because I hate being wasteful. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again thought.</li>
            <li> I use this every night and have not seen a difference.  Does give a nice cooling sensation under the eyes.  Maybe I need to use it longer</li>
            <li> Takes about 2 months to really notice difference, but patience it the key with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been switching off between the eye cream and eye serum and I can honestly say that after using this for a week, my skin has tightened and the under eye sagging has been less. I also use the cream for all over my face, which has also tightened it. I&#x27;d recommend this cream in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a month.  2 every day.  I ordered only to fight wrinkles.  (I am 28 so they are mostly from smiling and not deep). And was dissapointed no changes at all. The only thing I like its unscented.  Very sad it did not work for me though.</li>
            <li> Definitely noticing a difference under my eyes. Smells great!</li>
            <li> I was given this eye gel to try and review. Product is really good, works well to eliminate puffy, dark circles and gives a more rested look. Works quickly in about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> It goes on super smooth.  No strong smell, great packaging.  I will continue to use to see what the results are.</li>
            <li> My eyes have never been in better shape!  I am a single Mom so I don&#x27;t always get the rest I need.  This Gel Is EXCELLENT For puffiness. I see less fine lines and less under eye circles. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> So far so good.  This leaves my under eyes feeling tight and fresh.</li>
            <li> I was tired of looking tired, so I went online to see if I could find a better eye cream. I saw InstaNatural&#x27;s eye cream and that it included among other things cucumber, and I thought, well women have always used cucumber around the eyes. So I ordered a bottle, and tried it on. In matter of days my skin looked significantly better. Gone was the dryness and the tired look. I use this cream on my whole face in the morning (I ordered the night cream for evenings) and it&#x27;s really soothing, and cooling, and it &amp;#34;plumps&amp;#34; up the skin and although it doesn&#x27;t completely remove lines (nothing really does at my age), it does make the skin feel youthful and smooth. So, yes, I do recommend this product highly, for it does what it promises. And the company is fabulous! They sent me an e-mail asking me how I liked the product, and when I said I really liked it, they sent me a refill for free! It doesn&#x27;t get better than that!</li>
            <li> Used the product for a few weeks and product is great!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.  It goes on well and smooths out tiny creases and wrinkles around the eyes.  It is also a very generous amount and last a long time.  You only need a dab.</li>
            <li> scam.  do not listen to the reviews.  They&#x27;re fake</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t quite used it long enough to say for sure but it very lightweight &amp; non-greasy. It dries really fast. :)</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and it seems to be working.  So far I have had nothing bad happen, and it hasn&#x27;t upset my skin in any way.&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review after I&#x27;ve used the product for a few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using InstaNatural Eye Gel for 3 weeks and can say that it already has been allieving some of the puffiness under my eyes. Can&#x27;t wait to see what it may do with continued use! Thank you for a great product!</li>
            <li> I could never reduce the darkness of my dark circles.  But they started to bother me again so I looked for something new to try.  I stumbled upon this product and I&#x27;m so happy I did.  I have seen a a difference in my eyes and i&#x27;m using less makeup on my eyes to cover up my dark circles.  I know as the days go by of using this product it will just fade even more.  Happy I finally found something that works :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this at night only right now because I have some other eye product I need to use up.  I really do like the way this goes on...it absorbs very quickly and seems to smooth everything out.  In addition to major discoloration under the eyes, I also have puffiness and this does help somewhat to decrease that.  I&#x27;m hoping to see more results over the long term, especially once I&#x27;m using twice a day.  Very pleased, so far....</li>
            <li> Did not work for me I am 58 I used it for several weeks and nothing</li>
            <li> I have had this product for bit more than three weeks and I start to see diference in my eyes appearance.the dark circles start to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;I imagine everyone would have different effect and time when it does start to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very first application I try ft the dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good.::)</li>
            <li> I have tried product after product for years to help with the fine lines and dark circles around my eyes. I felt like my eyes were aging faster than most of my skin. I noticed this was the #1 best seller on amazon and decided to give it a try. I did not expect to see such a big difference so quickly. I have used other cremes and gels and saw very little difference after months and months and months of use, but with this product it literally changed my eyes within 2 weeks.  The little wrinkles near the edges and under my eyes have decreased and my dark circles are less noticeable. I am buying another bottle now, just so I don&#x27;t run out. I&#x27;m in love. And to respond to other comments, I was not paid, nor given the product to review. I paid full price and will continue to do so. It is that good.</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel! It is cooling, refreshing and works really well. I use it at least once a day but aim to use it twice a day. I feel that even when I am tired this eye gel helps in keeping me looked refreshed. I recommend this product to anyone in need of some extra love and care for their eyes.</li>
            <li> What a great product!  A little goes a long way.  Under eye bags, puffiness,  Dark circles go away within days.  Gentle, effective and fast acting!</li>
            <li> This Eye gel caused me to break out. :(</li>
            <li> This feels really cool to the eyes once you apply them, that&#x27;s what I love the most about this eye gel. Bye bye dark circles and soon-to-be wrinkles! Haha got you even before you started appearing! This gives me the protection I need from looking haggard.</li>
            <li> Tried this based simply on the huge amount of positive reviews, and am I glad I did! Love that this does not contain any silicones and glycols - just the good stuff... like matrixyl 3000, peptides, jojoba oil &amp; hyaluronic acid. Glad that it is pretty much fragrance free too! In addition to using it as an eye gel, I also actually use this as an all over daytime facial moisturizer, and it works great for my oily/combo skin. Doesn&#x27;t break me out, doesn&#x27;t weigh heavy on the skin. It pairs well with my sunscreen too - no pilling or any thing like that. LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> I use this for puffiness under my eyes.  It is not an instant cure, but it does seem to be helping.  What has amazed me is the InstaNatural Company customer service.  They truly care about whether their product is working.  I tried another product of theirs and they contacted me and I told them I  did not get the desired results and they  sent  me the Eye Gel to try  FREE.  They have  followed up after that.  This is the kind of service every company should have.</li>
            <li> I really notice improvements  the very first morning after using this gel. And after a week of use my friend noticed a huge difference. .my puffiness was gone!  Im really happy  with this product. :)</li>
            <li> Still waiting to see the result, very hydrating.</li>
            <li> Great product and excellent customer service.&lt;br /&gt;feels great on my eyes.  Reduces lines, puffiness and best of all non greasy so my makeup stays beautiful all day.  Amazing price too.</li>
            <li> I love the way this leaves the skin around my eye feeling, and I have seen a slight difference but nothing too drastic.</li>
            <li> Be consistent. This product works very well! Try it first before you opt for a more expensive eye gel/creme.</li>
            <li> I had a visible line in the middle between my eyebrows so I put a lil on it.  In less than a week.  The deep line was gone.  Couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> this product is wonderful.  It goes on smooth, and a little goes a long way.  For those rare days I forget to apply it, I can really feel the difference.  I like to apply it, then apply my foundation because it really helps to blend around my eyes.  Shipping was fast and the correspondence was excellent.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> After 3 days of using this product on the bags under my eyes, they are noticeably reduced, and my &amp;#34;smile lines&amp;#34; around my eyes appear to be reducing as well. I will qualify this by saying that I&#x27;ve never tried just a regular moisturizer, so I don&#x27;t know if this is better than moisturizer or not. Still, there&#x27;s enough for several months of 2x daily application.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much. I use it for my entire face. It brings the freshness back to my face. I just sent in my second order last week. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, smells good(!) and actually WORKS!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I used this for about a month and never saw any results. The first time I applied it really stung and got hot. Didn&#x27;t have any adverse reaction other than it hurt. As you can see in the photos there really wasn&#x27;t any change (in fact under eyes look better in my before)&lt;br /&gt;You absolutely cannot apply powdered makeup on top. It creates this odd flaky film and is just highly unattractive. I am still on the quest to find something that helps those bags</li>
            <li> After using this for a month, the product seems to take care the dark circles, crows feet and dryness.  I put it on in the morning and  evening. It is soothing and has a pleasant smell. A very small amount is all that is needed for under both eyes.  Good product and the company even keeps in touch via email wondering if the product is working or if you have questions.</li>
            <li> I am only giving it 4 stars because I have not used it long enough to definitely say if it reduces dark circles, puffiness, wrinkles &amp; bags.  So I can&#x27;t say for sure if it is a 5 star product.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks and it&#x27;s my own fault, but sometimes I don&#x27;t use it before bedtime.  No fault of the product.  It&#x27;s just that life gets in the way and I&#x27;m too tired.  Love the price!&lt;br /&gt;I think it has helped with the dark circles, but I still have bags under my eyes.  Sometimes they are suitcases!  I never get enough of sleep.  But I am going to make an effort every night to take off my makeup and use it before I start tossing and turning.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and so far no results whatsoever. Dark circles and puffines look the same, if any, skin around the eye looks dryer, also didn&#x27;t like the sticky feeling afterwards.... not a fan of this product.</li>
            <li> I received the Insta Natural Eye Gel free and for review.  It came in a generous sized pump.  The dispensing of the gel was so easy and it allowed for careful application in the correct amount.  I liked the fact that it came in a gel.  It had a very cooling and soothing effect around the eye area.  I use contacts so I am constantly tugging and pulling at the sensitive area around my eyes.  This was a soothing way of replenishing the elasticity and minimizing the fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> I had a problem with puffiness under my eyes and recently began using Eye Gel. I have noticed the puffiness has been reduced. I have only used for a few weeks so I could not give 5 stars yet.  I recommend this product for puffiness around the eye area, so far no change for my dark circles. I am pleased that the puffiness has been visibly reduced and feel I look that much better.Recommended for puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me, plus it dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working pretty well. I apply it in the morning and my swollen eyes don&#x27;t look as bad.  I&#x27;ll continue to use the product and update.</li>
            <li> I used to have really noticeable bags under my eyes and have been looking for a product that actually works. So far this has been the only product which I saw dramatic results. I use it daily before putting on my makeup and it has made a big difference for me. Its also all NATURAL. I started looking into their other products, which also have great reviews.</li>
            <li> Using the eye cream was pretty cool. I didn&#x27;t use it for long because well, I didn&#x27;t really need it. I have a youthful appearance already.&lt;br /&gt;It did work really great for those days that I stay up to late and have puffy eyes the next morning. I do recommend it to those looking to try something new that actually works!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time.  I love this product and have seen noticeable changes around my eyes.  I would feel very confident in recommending this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> The Eye gel is primarily for use under your eyes, to reduce dark circles, fine lines &amp; wrinkles, puffiness, but I am using it all over my face. It is a very thick gel and feels a little sticky when applied but as soon as it absorbs it is no longer sticky. When applied in large quantity it can feel really sticky like glue for a long time, so I use very little gel to cover my face and allow it to absorb after that I moisturize with my regular cream.&lt;br /&gt;It really helped with my dark circles and blemishes on my cheeks too. I do not have any wrinkle yet and I want to keep it that way. So I would keep on using the gel at least around my eyes for sure, if not for the entire face.&lt;br /&gt;It feels cool when applied and smells like cucumber, and a little bit goes a long way. It takes little longer to fully absorb into my skin, during which time it&#x27;s a sticky.&lt;br /&gt;One more thing it is really difficult to put on makeup over the gel so I use only at night as my night time skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is, if you do not mind stickiness for a few minutes and want to get rid of fine lines and dark circles give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product free for testing and reviewing. The opinion above is 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see an improvement of any kind so I quit using it! These reviews were so promising yet I didn&#x27;t get any results! Maybe I&#x27;ll try again. I found it to be sticky and drying though!</li>
            <li> This eye serum works well you can feel it getting tight and cold, i like that i was able to review these at a very discounted price in return that i give my honest and inbiased opinion. This has no smell goes on well and easy and you can feel the firming</li>
            <li> Dark circles have to be everyone&#x27;s nightmare. They&#x27;re hard to get rid of and if you cover them up, you can still see the puffiness from where they&#x27;re hidden. I was approached to review this product and I gladly accepted. Trying this out has made a huge difference for me! I absolutely loved it! My dark circles have significantly diminished and it&#x27;s so liberating! I don&#x27;t feel like that I need to cake on concealer or anything. Thanks instanatural!</li>
            <li> Absolutely no difference in the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Great product and great customer service. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for improvement in the lower eye area.</li>
            <li> I really love this eye gel and will be buying more.  Very happy with the product feel, ingredients, and quality. The product seems straight to the point without any bs. Along with looking brighter, my skin appears more plump and firm. I&#x27;m hoping to try more products from this brand soon.</li>
            <li> My wife and I noticed subtle improvement in the under-eye area right away, I mean , after the first application. Probably better than using cucumber slices. And it&#x27;s always great and reassuring when the people you are doing business with are thoughtful and conscientious, like the ones at InstaNatural.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye serum I have used yet. Took care of dark circles plus diminished wrinkles around the eyes. They wrote me letting me know the best way to use the eye serum then did a follow up to see how I was doing. They are awesome on customer service! Will definitely tell more women or men to buy this as it is proven to work! Thank you Phil for all your support!&lt;br /&gt;Shelia Drowatzky</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a week, twice a day (every morning and night) and don&#x27;t see any changes. I was using it for puffiness under the eyes. It&#x27;s not working for me.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for my dark circles at all. Dont waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> This really works to lessen puffiness and leave your face overall smoother and softer.  It can be a bit tight on your skin, but I use it under moisturizer and that softens my face for make up.</li>
            <li> Used a couple times. No irritation and no smell. So far so good.</li>
            <li> This product has the perfect mix of ingredients, including a peptide complex, which is hard to find but oh, so effective. With consistent application, I began to see results in a relatively short time. I am 64 and, although I have used Clinique Anti-Gravity Eye Lift Cream for years, I will buy InstaNatural from now on. And, by the way, the Company&#x27;s customer service follow-up is personal and welcome.</li>
            <li> In general I found this product to be somewhat helpful in regard to skin tone issues and puffiness under the eyes. I did not notice a huge difference with dark circles under the eyes. I missed using this product a few days in a row and found that there was not much difference than when I was using it. I suspect one would need to use this product continuously and long-term for any major changes to be noticed. This is not a product I would highly recommend, although I do think if you have severe eye issues it would probably be more beneficial than for those who do not. I have found other products that address the puffiness under my eyes more quickly and effectively and only need to be used as needed.</li>
            <li> The item is broken when delivered.</li>
            <li> They may have found a regular consumer of this product! I saw noticeable&lt;br /&gt;improvement after about 4 days of use, and my skin has gradually improved&lt;br /&gt;since then. I would even go so far as to say my skin has drastically&lt;br /&gt;benefited from EEG. I use it twice a day, morning and night over an organic&lt;br /&gt;mixture of Argan and Jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> Have not noticed much of a difference yet.</li>
            <li> First of all, this gel comes in a very large package for an eye gel.  It&#x27;s translucent eye gel that absorbs quickly into your skin and wouldn&#x27;t irritate it.  This one has almost no scent, if anything slight green scent from one of its main ingredients, aloe.  I like natural ingredients used for this product.  I have tested many eye gels over last year, and this remains my favorite and the one I would purchase with my own money.  I also think this is one of the best products made by InstaNatural.  I think it&#x27;s a great buy, and would recommend to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided free of charge for reviewing purposes in exchange with my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This is ok, but I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable results even after using consistently for 3 months.  It does temporarily make my eyelid sticky in that it makes the eyelid higher and opens the eye more but it also sticks to my eyelashes and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. smells wonderful and is working great on my dark circles. I have used many different products to correct my dark circles but this one really works and the price is so reasonable.  will order again.</li>
            <li> I saw no difference whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Even thou the selling company kept on sending me emails to leave a review I felt like at least I should try it longer to see if anything chances.&lt;br /&gt;It was too sticky for me and it felt like it was making my eye wrinkles even more visible.&lt;br /&gt;The end result, still puffy dark eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have puffy eyes, but I am getting dark circles and thinning of the skin under my eyes which makes them look saggy.  I am using the whole line of facial products from InstaNatural and seeing quite a difference.  All the products are plumping (firming) and they compliment each other very well!  Because they are made with all natural products, they are not stinking, sticking, greasy or chemically like so many other facial products out there.  I like knowing that I am putting safe natural products on my face and they are all Made In The USA.  I received a free trial of this product and after 14 days of nightly use it has no become my go to eye gel. By the way, this is a huge bottle!  Very much worth the price!</li>
            <li> Honestly didn&#x27;t see any dramatic change or improvement but I feel my eyes fresh in the morning but the dark circles remains same</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get all the great comments about this eye gel.  But then I didn&#x27;t get mine for free like a lot of reviewers did..Every time I used it and then apply make-up over it I get the little balling up effect which I hate.  I do like the feel of this gel so did not send it back but use it on the back of my hands instead.</li>
            <li> Love this product quick results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21 so I don&#x27;t have many fine lines or signs of age. But it&#x27;s always best to start early before it&#x27;s too late! I follow the direction instructions when applying this gel. Once applying on your face you get the chill sensation for around 4-5 seconds and dries on immediately. This gel feels like you did not even put it on, very lightweight. It does not remain sticky or feel like you have to wash your face sometime throughout the day. Feels like it&#x27;s working and keeps everything nice and tight. Love putting it on, don&#x27;t like going a day without using it!</li>
            <li> Ok wow... I can&#x27;t believe the stuff actually works! I bought it for my husband who has bags under his eyes. It is really difficult to get him to use anything both day and night, but I finally convinced him to try this product, and I can&#x27;t believe the difference. I had actually complimented him a couple of days ago telling him that the skin under his eyes should be puffy because we had sushi tonight before. He reminded me that he&#x27;s been using this gel, and I really can&#x27;t believe the results! My husband&#x27;s problem is only the skin under his eyes, so I can&#x27;t comment on dark circles or any other problems, but I can tell you that his eyes are significantly less puffy even after tons of salt! Thank you!</li>
            <li> So I waited two months before reviewing this. I had terrible dark circles under my eye that were incredibly prevalent when I under slept. Fast forward to putting this on every morning, the shading under my eye slowly improved from a full under circle around my eye to a half moon shape of darkness. The previously darker areas are more a red/pinkish hue that looks much more natural. I think my problem was that I had incredibly thin skin under my eyes where the pooled blood was readily apparent. I just placed my second order for this and I will continue to used this for the next few months. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I received  this in exchange of an honesy review. have been using this for about 2 weeks.  It does as it says, the puffiness under my eyes is decreased, as the bags.  I am able to notice a difference after such a short period of time.  My eyes look a little brighter and less tired. The cream feels good it has no greasy feeling and absorbs quickly.  I have VERY sensative skin and a lot of skin allergies, as well as wear contacts.  There is nothing in this product that bothers eitherer my contacts or my skin. I have had better results from this eye gel then the $90 jar of eye cream recommended by a skin renewal dermatologist.</li>
            <li> This gel has a light scent...to me it&#x27;s the very faint smell of cucumber...goes on smooth and absorbs into the skin nicely...I don&#x27;t have much of a problem with dark circles unless I stay up way too late for many nights in a row...so I can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s great on dark circles or not as at this time I do not have them. I do however like the gel...it makes me feel like I am doing something good for myself.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any difference.  Will try another product.</li>
            <li> My brother and I were having a random conversation about aging and how we notice the aging around our eyes.  In the midst of conversation, he whisked to the guest bedroom and returned with this product; urging me to try it.    As a chronic allergy sufferer, I tend to have dark circles under my eyes.  Those, in conjunction with the crow&#x27;s feet appearing; I figured I had nothing to lose, so I ordered the product from Amazon Prime.    I&#x27;ve been using it for almost three months and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in both the circles and the crow&#x27;s feet.  To be clear, this isn&#x27;t a facelift, so you will see lines when you smile very largely, but when your face is at rest; not so much.    In comparison to some other very expensive competitors, try it, you won&#x27;t be out the huge cost to give it a chance.    Lastly, I will agree that it doesn&#x27;t work overnight; give it a month or two before you become a doubter.</li>
            <li> This product does not work. My husband has been diligently applying this gel twice a day for a month but we don&#x27;t see any improvement of the puffiness under his eyes. Waste of money, really. Not sure how legitimate some of the positive reviews are.</li>
            <li> I have been using every day for over a month and I see no difference with puffiness, bags or wrinkles.  It doesn&#x27;t work for me al all, as a matter of fact the gel makes the skin around my eyes very tight and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I am finally looking well rested and refreshed even though I&#x27;m the complete opposite with my newest addition to the family ;) I have gotten lots of compliments and definitely refer them to this</li>
            <li> This has helped my dark circles a lot, but I even noticed help with some fine lines that were looking like they were getting comfortable. Too comfortable. Not anymore!</li>
            <li> After using this product twice-daily for several weeks, I didn&#x27;t see any really noticeable difference in terms of puffiness, dark circles, or anything else.  The product goes on smooth, but becomes sticky as it dries, causing the delicate skin on your eyelids to stick to itself... not very comfortable.  Overall, I am unimpressed.  I didn&#x27;t experience the miracle results that other reviewers reported.</li>
            <li> IT is very hydrating and soothing to my eyes. I especially like using it in the morning and under my makeup. It does not leave a sticky residue or cause my make up to get all wonky. Some other creams cause my makeup to separate or crease more. This absorbs quickly and makes me feel more confident since I know I do not have to worry about re-checking my under eyes so much. I do have to re-touch up at the end of the day, but that is better than having to do it mid morning. There is no scent and no burning to my eyes. I wa sent this for review, however it does not effect my opinions</li>
            <li> Worked as described. Circles gone first, bagginess diminished first week. On week 3 at this time and every day things improve! Softened the lines, evened tone, circles gone, puffiness lessens daily .....couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this eye gel so far. It absorbs well, and is perfect both with and without make-up. I usually buy creams, so I was very happy to find how well this gel works. My favorite thing is that is does have a &amp;#34;cooling sensation&amp;#34; when you put it on. I have sensitive, combination skin and no irritation whatsoever. I think it is a little harder to review eye gels/creams than facial moisturizers, because you are using it on such a small area of skin, but this meets all of my criteria (except for finding something with SPF for when out in the sun, but that is hard to find and when you do find it the consistency can be too thick). My skin looks great, good with or without make-up, no complaints! I just note that this product was received free for testing purposes, but I am planning to continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> very pleased. I have dark circles that run from inner eye to outer and puffy in the morning under eyes. I starting using this with little real feeling it would make a difference. Boy was I wrong. I use morning and evening and can see the dark recede with in 15 min. I thought &amp;#34; no this is not real&amp;#34; but it is.&lt;br /&gt;I have seen the post that you can not wear under make up due to stickiness. i do wear under makeup but did have to pat it on instead of the glide I usually use.&lt;br /&gt;You do not want to use but a very small amt. I did notice some tingling but this did not bother me and went away as it dried.&lt;br /&gt;I am really impressed and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that is helping the dark circles.</li>
            <li> Bad eye genes? Well, here&#x27;s a power packed product to reverse that. Get ready to give the skin around your eyes that extra boost! What I&#x27;m loving about this product, is that it&#x27;s lightweight, and doesn&#x27;t feel tacky, due to the fact that its a gel. This handy little gel is versatile too! It can be used around the eye area, or on the face and neck. And let me tell you, it really does banish dark circles and fine lines! It even works great as a makeup primer. I use this morning and night around the eyes, and in the t-zone area. Oh, and the scent smells amazing, it reminds me of cucumbers!</li>
            <li> I experienced excellent results with this product! As a sufferer of dark circles for many years, this product helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> The best eye cream as far as plant stem ingredients go...noticed huge difference after second application... UNBELIEVABLE.. thank u so much.  I turned 41 in June and I look at least five years younger</li>
            <li> it has lightning my dark circles a little bit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks,  but in a super short time I did notice fading of my very dark under eye circles.  I don&#x27;t know how it works, but I can say that this product does work.  I wish I had taken a photo when I started. I plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> great stuff.i use it every morning and it makes my eyes and face feel so refreshed. I see an improvement in the darkness under  my eyes also.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cooling eye gel.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the results in what it did for my undereye puffiness. I have only been using it for about a week and I can honestly say I have seen a huge improvement in undereye puffiness. After applying the first time at night, when you wake up the next morning, you can see your eyes will be less puffy than if you didn&#x27;t use the InstaNatural Eye Gel. It&#x27;s not going to give you immediate depuffing so just remember to apply it the night before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the dark undereye circles and wrinkles, I have not seen much improvement in those aspects yet. I am assuming that these will take a longer period of time to get better if it does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye gel does feel a bit sticky on your skin so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend people who wear makeup to use this underneath facial concealers or foundations because it will crease or get cakey. On the bottle, it says it is safe to apply the eye gel to your entire face too so if your end up pumping too much you can put it on other parts of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The InstaNatural Eye Gel comes in a bottle with a pump mechanism, which I like because you aren&#x27;t sticking your fingers into a jar like other eye creams and risk contaminating it with germs. It took me pressing about 10 times to get the gel to come up the first time and I thought my bottle was defective. This might happen for you to when you first use it. If the gel isn&#x27;t coming up, you just have to keep pressing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice a day (as recommended) and see no noticeable difference in the puffiness or dark circles under my eyes.  As the saying goes, if it seems too good to be true....</li>
            <li> It is very good. I used some expensive eye cream, but my fine line didn&#x27;t reduce.&lt;br /&gt;This product is cheap and I notice that better now. Thanks .</li>
            <li> Does not work for puffy eyes. I am so disappointed in the product because I bought it for puffy eyes. Does not work. One week later i have you guessed it puffy eyes</li>
            <li> my wife used it once. once she applied, she said, it sting. and her skin around/ under eyes became red. returned it immediately. customer service is great. refund the money+$10 extra. that&#x27;s enough to put another star.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me. It stings me too</li>
            <li> Super awesome and love it- have sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t break me out!</li>
            <li> like very much I&#x27;m using twice a day fantastic</li>
            <li> This works great. I was told by a lady that I should try some eye cream because old age is starting to catch up to me. I did some research here on Amazon and purchased this. I do notice the difference and I use this product daily.</li>
            <li> Product is great!  I will order again.  Company&#x27;s customer service is fabulous!  Love to buy from a company like this!!</li>
            <li> So this is my first review of a product. I read alot of reviews and i think some are fake. I want to give an honest opinion cause i have wasted so much money on products that didnt work. That being said i didnt like this product at first it actually seemed to make my eyes look a lil worse it seemed after a week. But i read the reviews saying to use it for a few weeks so i continued. After the 2nd week i noticed improvement. I had a lil puffiness and 2 fine line semi circles under each eye that i wanted to get rid of. Gradually by 3rd week i noticed a big difference. A coworker asked if i was using botox cause i looked younger. So i knew others saw a difference. I just ordered my 2nd bottle. I use twice a day. This is the best under eye i have used. I used to use creams thinking gels would dry me out. This stuff is awesome. I WISH i had taken before pic. I will say tho that if i skip a day it seems like my eyes start to droop and puff slightly but that could be my imagination. In any case i rated it 5 stars because i have used countless creams that gave me only minimal results. This gel after 2 months now has flattened the under part of my eye. Wrinkles are gone. Skin is tight and smooth. Im 37 and can pass for 25 (when i shave. Lol). I always read a mix of all reviews before ordering a product and weigh the good against the bad. I think those who rated this with 3 stars or less probably used it for a week and stopped. It does take a few weeks but it was a miracle gel for me. I see why its a top seller. Thanks for reading. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use it both day and at night. I can tell a difference in the puffiness being much less noticeable. Wrinkles in corners less defined.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Save your money. 30 days into it, no noticeable effect thus far.</li>
            <li> Bought this stuff cause I was getting worried about not having an under eye treatment, and this had some good review. Bad idea for me. It dried my skin out so much, that I felt like it made line more visible. I had to cake on the moisturizer if I put it on. I will not be buying this again, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase and it is the best product I have ever had for eye use.  I really does lessen the depth of the wrinkles around the eyes and doesn&#x27;t look tight and drawn.</li>
            <li> This says it is for the eyes, but I tried it all over my face. Not only did it perk my face up, it is an excellent cream to put on after a blemish on your skin. If a zit got popped, it used to take up to 5-7 days for it to completely heal, but once you apply this, it only takes a day or two. Brilliant! In addition to that, I find if I take a break from this for a couple days, the occurrence of new zits rises. Really impressed and I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> The Instanatural Youth Express Eye Serum is an eye gel that decreases puffiness, dark circles and wrinkles.  I am always a little skeptical of putting cream near my eyes as all the ones that I have ever used have been too heavy and they just felt odd.  However, despite this being a gel, which appears to be quite thick when pumped out, it feels light and fresh when applied.  You can use it all over your face but I am just using it around my eyes for now.  I love the cucumber smell and love the fact that this dries quite quickly.  I saw that some people had commented that the product flakes when make up is applied but I haven’t had that trouble at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review powered by Brandbacker!</li>
            <li> Feels great on the eyes.  You can feel your eyes tightening.  Will continue use for sure to see further results.</li>
            <li> You actually feel skin tighter and softer.  Love it</li>
            <li> Second order and loving it.</li>
            <li> This is a amazing eye moisturizer. This moisturizer has a light texture and is quickly absorbed into your skin. My eyes are brighter and my dark circles are fading with each time that I use this moisturizer. This moisturizer is loaded with some of the best anti-aging ingredients on the market today.I would highly recommend this moisturizer to everyone. This product was provided free for testing. Thank you</li>
            <li> Used this eye cream for a few weeks, it made my eyes look as if I had lost a lot of sleep.  Quit using it for a few weeks and tried it again and had the same results.  Did not notice any improvement in the eye area.</li>
            <li> All the other reviews say this product works and is amazing......I&#x27;m still waiting for the results after 1 month......</li>
            <li> I am a Amazon ordering addict yet, I never take the time out to actually write a review. But, this product deserves it. I went on Amazon actually looking for a Face Moisturizer and I came across this product. Usually when a products has a high number of Reviews AND Ratings I take a look at it and read the reviews. Countless times people have mentioned that I have very bad dark circles. They are always asking if I get enough sleep. Even with foundation or powder applied under my eyes it just wouldn&#x27;t go away. I am also, very lazy too so I am picky with how my products are dispensed. This one is very easy to access. Just push down and a dime size will come out. I have applied it night and day for only 3 days now. Once at night and once in the morning. I already can tell a difference. It even gives me confidence to walk around with no make-up applied. I didn&#x27;t expect the result to happen so fast but, it is NOTICEABLY working! The price is totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition since I was also looking for a moisterizer I got this http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PUSM2O4/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I apply the eye gel first and allow it to dry and then apply the moisturizer. My skin is soft and dark circles are disappearing and I STILL get very little sleep. :) still works!</li>
            <li> My eyes looked worse after three weeks</li>
            <li> I have never tried anything like this before.  It seems to be diminishing the fine lines around my eyes and also some acne scarring on my cheeks.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> packaging was easy on the eyes, product does what it says it does!&lt;br /&gt;the first two days my eyes were a little puffy, but after that it felt good to apply, although  little sticky.&lt;br /&gt;try it chilled, it feels great!</li>
            <li> I am 46 years old and am not too embarrassed to say that I have tried product after product to try and maintain healthy, youthful looking skin. Recently my efforts have been more concentrated in the eye area. After a series of fruitless efforts, I finally tired InstaNatural. I love it and would recommend it to all age groups. It certainly makes my skin feel and look smoother. Cannot really comment on the dark circles as that has not been an issue. The fine lines and crows feet however have greatly diminished. Further, the overall effect on my entire face is wonderful...&lt;br /&gt;smooth, healthy, hydrated looking skin.</li>
            <li> I started using this Eye Cream on December 9th, 2014 and while only using a green pea size amount it covered both eye areas, top and lower lip areas, fine laughing lines and my frown lines between my eye brows.  Used it AM/PM and I can honestly say it&#x27;s working better than what I was using.  I didn&#x27;t see an improvement until day 6 or 7... patience people... this product was what I was searching for my lip area and laughing lines... I&#x27;m a athletic type A in her 50&#x27;s and all that breathing HAHA has caused fine lines around the mouth... but this product stopped and softened those lines and my lips look better.  It worked for me!</li>
            <li> With continued use (have been using for close to 3 weeks now) the puffy eyes are getting better.</li>
            <li> First use I noticed a difference!</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes is firming up. When I put on my eyeshadow the skin on my eyelids doesn&#x27;t move. The  saggy dark circles under my eyes are disappearing. In all when my eyes look younger, I look and feel younger. I love this product!!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, ladies. Thousands of products promise to rid us of under eye circles, fine lines, and under eye puffiness. I have tried dozens of them, from drug store brands to high end, extremely expensive ones. This eye gel is great. My problem has always been puffiness and, to be honest, NOTHING will cure this other than surgery, which I am not going to do at this point. However, InstaNatural eye gel has definitely made a noticeable improvement. It instantly soothes and smoothes the entire eye area. There is a degree of tightening, but it is not the unnatural look you get with some products that &amp;#34;cracks&amp;#34; the minute you smile or talk. This is more of a softening effect and an improvement of the overall texture of the delicate eye area. It also imparts a kind of natural looking glow without looking wet or shiny. I will be ordering this again and again, as well as trying other InstaNatural product. Oh, did I mention what a GREAT value it is? The integrity of the product is excellent; none of the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; ingredients we all know are in most products, and the price point is amazing. All in all this is a wonderful product for the money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference but I like how cool it feels on my eyes 👀</li>
            <li> dont really notice a difference after using one month</li>
            <li> So far, I really like this product. My dark circles seem lighter, and as an added bonus, I think it acts as a really good primer for undereye concealer. I&#x27;ll order this again.</li>
            <li> Good product, is at your own risk</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of my puffy eyes but they haven&#x27;t gotten worse.</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel. It cools to depuff and smooths my lines wonderfully.  There has been a noticable improvement in the skin tone surrounding my eyes in the 6 weeks I have been using the product.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great product...really helps the darkness &amp; puffiness under the eyes...only need to use a small amount... will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed any changes. I have very dry skin and  this being a quick drying gel, doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin much and I usually end up adding a different lotion a few hours later. It really hasn&#x27;t done anything, but it hasn&#x27;t given me a rash either, so I guess my verdict for this product is a solid &amp;#34;Meh&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t waste money on it again.</li>
            <li> :&#x27;) I love this it&#x27;s a very nice eye cream. It&#x27;s light on the skin and does not have any stickiness like some other products I&#x27;ve used. It smells very natural spa-like scent that is not overwhelming and very pleasant. Skin looks and feels very smooth and moisture after using.. it kept my skin firm and tight and I only been using it for 24 hours now I already feel the difference I will be adding it to my daily regiment. Another great high quality product</li>
            <li> I cannot get enough of this eye gel. I know I use more per day than most people, though. It&#x27;s got a consistency like a lighter version of neosporen,  - nice and thick, but not greasy at all. Also, it seems like a cosmetic than a longer-term fix, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting it on every day. The package is a little larger than I was expecting for an eye cream as well. A!</li>
            <li> Made my under  eye Sticky, not worth the price, it doesn&#x27;t work, why positive reviews ??!!</li>
            <li> I occasionally have dark circles under my eyes. Part of this is because I don&#x27;t always get enough sleep. However, part of it is because of the genetics of my family genetics. Personally, I&#x27;ve never found it to be that big of a deal, but when I had the opportunity to sample INSTANATURAL EYE CREAM FOR DARK CIRCLES, PUFFINESS, WRINKLES, AND BAGS, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. After only using the product for about a month, I noticed a large improvement in the condition of the skin beneath my eyes. The flesh looked more youthful and vibrant. The only negative about the product that I have is a minor one: the cream is a topical cream, but for something that has to be used so close to one&#x27;s eyes, you have to be very careful not to accidently rub any of the cream into your eyes. Overall, I found the INSTANATURAL EYE CREAM FOR DARK CIRCLES, PUFFINESS, WRINKLES, AND BAGS to be quite effective and would recommend it to anyone looking to get rid of dark circles, puffiness, wrinkles, or bags around their eyes. I was provided a sample of this item from the manufacturer for examination and possible review.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt say the BEST but it&#x27;s not any worse than anyhing I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Only been using it for a week but I have seen some improvement</li>
            <li> My skin is way better!  My mom remarked how good my skin was looking, and it&#x27;s totally due to using this twice a day.</li>
            <li> Using an eye gel or cream, I&#x27;m always wary of introducing chemicals, especially chemicals which may end up burning or stinging my eyes.  I have not had any burning or stinging AT ALL with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump provides a generous amount of gel with a full pump; if using this around your eyes, a half pump is likely sufficient.  I typically apply just before my face cream, and before finsihing my hair, so I have plenty of time for these both to dry before applying makeup.  I don&#x27;t experience any flaking or caking, either, with this product - it goes on well and stays on well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a few days, I saw a visible reduction of darkness under my eyes, and I wish now that I had taken photos to do a comparison.  I used to need to dab makeup underneath my eyes to brighten them up, but now I don&#x27;t need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t paid attention to wrinkle reduction...honestly, I bought the cream more for the dark circles, figuring when I&#x27;m in my late 70&#x27;s, I&#x27;ll have wondered why I even bothered trying to stop the wrinkles...they&#x27;ll find me one way or another.</li>
            <li> I received  this product  in exchange  for  my honest  review. .I loved this cream..felt wonderful  rubbing  it into my skin..rejuvenation at its best.</li>
            <li> Dried my eyes out and made them appear more wrinkled.  I actually think I may have been allergic to it because it made my eyes itch.  And I have never been allergic to any other beauty products in my almost 40 years of life.  I stopped using it a month ago and still can&#x27;t seem to make the wrinkles it caused disappear.</li>
            <li> Great products, does what it says.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Is an excellent product. Fits my skin and soft I can feel that the skin is healing.</li>
            <li> I was soooo very skeptical about this product. I just had to write a review for those of you who are skeptics like me.  I was no less than thrilled with the results of this product the very first time I used it.  I have not been paid to say this and yes, I paid for the product.  It really does work.</li>
            <li> Fast results! I stay up late and get some major dark circles this has reduced them greatly with daily use.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL IT WORKS ON MY DARK CIRCLES, WILL PURCHASE AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I don’t know why, but for some reason I‘ve always had puffy eyes. Maybe it’s due to my busy schedule and lack of sleep. Whatever the case, as the years past, I’ve tried so many different products in hopes to try to reduce the puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately none of the products helped until I came across this one. This eye treatment is by far the most effective. I use it twice a day (morning &amp; night) and within a week I could instantly feel my dark circles began to lighten up. Just dab a little under your eyes and let it sit and absorb. Instantly you can feel it working because the skin under your eyes will began to tighten right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my eyes look and feel much better. My eyes seem brighter and the embarrassing dark circles under them are slowly lightening up and going away. Recommend for elimination of those nasty dark spots under your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the seller for evaluation purposes.</li>
            <li> Love it....the gel glides on and actually feels soothing.  Try it, you will like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now twice a day.  Already there is a noticeable difference.  My circles have lightened significantly and the fine lines have improved as well.  I have VERY sensitive skin and have had no adverse effects....highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This Product was very nice. It was super cooling and made my puffiness go down. It was a great treatment for the night time after you take your makeup off and your eyes get irritated. I recommend this product to anyone who gets puffiness and needs a cooling treatment.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my medium dark circles very dissapointed</li>
            <li> It actually works! It has helped reduce my undereye bags and circles greatly. Everyone is different so what works for me may not work for you but it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give this product a try. After my order the company owner actually personally emailed me and made sure that I was happy with the product. It meant a lot to me to receive that feedback from the owner. The owner actually was nice enough to send me out a complimentary free bottle just to assure me that the product actually works. I haven&#x27;t had such great customer service in a long time. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I received this finally, even with prime it took a while to get here... but after using it my face felt dried out. Wont be using again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, I am 2weeks on my second purchase of this product. I am really wanting to to a difference. If no change then I will move to something else. I have dark circles and a little puffiness around my eyes and have for at least 15 years. I am 42 years old and want to look my best. I really want to kick the use of a concealer but right now, I cant</li>
            <li> I BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR A WEEK NOW AND SO FAR I LOVE THE WAY MY FACE IS LOOKING SMOOTH AND CLEAR! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it for three days. I can&#x27;t tell my dark circle&#x27;s changed, but I can definitely fell my eye puffiness is getting much better! This is the first eye cream on Amazon that actually worked on me. I bought the queen bee eye cream from Amazon. It got almost 5 stars but very greasy and didn&#x27;t work on me.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It has a real nice feel to your face after application. With out going into explicit detail, most people would like it just giving it a try.  It claims to help dark circles, it did nothing for mine.  In my case I have yet to find anything that will improve my dark circles.  Aside from that, all of its other aspects are superior to other products.</li>
            <li> I do like this eye cream . Nice texture and feel good on skin. Been using for 3 weeks in mornig  and evening .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in the morning  I can definitely  see less  bag, Great price for  the  big  bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS ITEM WITH A DISCOUNT TO TRY, BUT MY OPINION IS UN BIASED AND HONEST.</li>
            <li> Works as good or better then anything I have tried - including products costing lots, lots more like Obagi, Lancome, Chantecaille.</li>
            <li> I was given a discount for this product for a review.  I did not see a great big difference in the dark circles under my eyes I feel that this is due to medical issues like low irion.  I gave what was left of product to daughter she stated that she loved the eye cream.</li>
            <li> No tremendous difference</li>
            <li> I love this product! The bags under my eyes are gone and the dark circles as well. I always felt like my eyes looked worse than everybody elses... not anymore.  Thank you for such an effective product</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for it.  Saw no difference.</li>
            <li> I see no evidence of less puffiness under eyes...too pricey to not have some results!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I love this product. It made my dark circles go away within a matter of a few days. I use it twice a day because I love the results.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a nice product. I haven&#x27;t noticed a lot of difference in dark circles, which is the reason I bought the product-- but I have only been using it for a month, and the manufacturer suggests that it might take two months to notice a difference, so I will reserve judgement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a reduction in crow&#x27;s feet, and skin feels smooth after product is applied. The product feels really nice when you put it on, especially if your eyes are tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as well as anything I&#x27;ve tried, and better than quite a few of the things I&#x27;ve tried, and the price is very good, so I will continue using this product.  In addition to being a nice product, there is very good customer service from the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a very satisfactory purchase.  If my dark circles go away, I&#x27;ll change my rating to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I used it for 4 weeks and nothing changed.</li>
            <li> I really like this gel, and have seen improvement over the month I have been using. Also the company followed up with me twice to see how it was going,that to me says a lot.</li>
            <li> I like the clean fresh smell of this gel. I have only been using it for a week, and I do think I see some improvements in the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Puffiness gone in minutes for me. It took a couple days to get rid of the dark circles, but they&#x27;re gone despite my constant allergies. I use this about every other night or any morning I wake up with puffy eyes. Smells a bit like cucumbers. Clear gel feels cool and smooth on my eyes. Dries quickly and works fast. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I neveerrrrrrr write a review and it&#x27;s after midnight I have really bad dark circles I get them from my dad &amp;#34;thanks dad&amp;#34; and even su time concelar wouldn&#x27;t cover them I&#x27;ve even used some stuff I payed over 150 dollars for and it didn&#x27;t start working till u bought it two or three times I&#x27;ve only had this for a week and it&#x27;s working already I&#x27;m truly amazed my friend told me yesterday u must be sleeping better cuz your eyes don&#x27;t look as black more brown so it&#x27;s improving I&#x27;m going to continue to use I hope I get normal eyes soon #fingers crossed</li>
            <li> So excited that I found InstaNatural.  Best bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> So far, I see results in the color (darkness) of the circles under my eyes...only 3 months into it.  A little goes a long, long way. An age spot is also fading!</li>
            <li> I have been using it as directed and I see no change!!</li>
            <li> I have had wonderful luck with this product! I put just a little white concealer over the eye gel and foundation! My Make up sticks to it well and it goes on easily, you don&#x27;t need very much at all so the bottle lasts a really long time! It is a great price -considering it really does a lot of applications I have tried a lot of dark circle treatment products this one is my favorite so far!</li>
            <li> Apparently, I have sensitive skin.  It seems that no matter what cream I try, or what price point I&#x27;m at, my skin reacts in a negative fashion to any sort of cream.  Except this one.  It&#x27;s soothing, my under eye circles, while not completely gone, have diminished with just about a month of us and best of all, my skin does not break out or have an adverse reaction.  I even use it on my forehead when I have extra on my fingers.  I&#x27;m very pleased to have finally found a product that works for me and ultimately, at a very affordable price point.  I will be buying this as long as it&#x27;s around!</li>
            <li> Forsure made my dark circles go away . Dark circles always made my eyes look tired and made me look tired so I never had that fresh look , but after trying this, I&#x27;m coming back for more !</li>
            <li> This is good! I am gradually seeing improvement! It is lightweight and soaks in nicely. It did not interfere with my concealer!</li>
            <li> I guess this works only on certain skins types. I&#x27;ve used to thing for 1 month+ still don&#x27;t see any results. My dark circles under my eyes haven&#x27;t lighten one bit.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or bags to begin with but I did have some puffiness and this got rid of it in a couple of days. When you put it on, you can actually feel it tightening on your skin but it doesn&#x27;t dry it out. I&#x27;m hoping that using this will also prevent wrinkles as I become older.</li>
            <li> for me not work allergy to make my eyes red</li>
            <li> I had been using this gel little more then two weeks and compare to many expensive eye creams/gels this one works quite well when i  have puffy eyes or get dark circles on days when i don&#x27;t get enough sleep . I would definitely repurchase this.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating Eye Gel!! I applied this cream to my eyes and face morning &amp; night. My make up goes on smoothly over it. Long lasting! Fast shipping &amp; Great Quality. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I can totally see a difference in my skin&#x27;s texture if I use it everyday. But I get lazy sometimes and forget to put it on after I shower...and pay for it the next day! Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Notice a difference, it doesn&#x27;t take 20 years off or anything but the skin around my eyes is less puffy and above my eyelids is less droopy and more elastic</li>
            <li> This is the best eye gel I have ever used and highly recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> Did not work for me so I returned</li>
            <li> THIS IS SUCH A WONDERFUL PRODUCT!  IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS I HAVE A LOT OF PUFFINESS AROUND MY EYES AND I&#x27;VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT WORKS. ITS NOT TOO STRONG FOR MY EYES I HAVE TRIED PRODUCTS WITH CHEMICALS IN THEM SO STRONG IT MAKE MY EYES WATER UP SO ITS NOT HARSH AT ALL ON MY SKIN. THIS IS VERY EASY TO APPLY AND IT DOESNT LEAVE A MESS TO CLEAN UP. MY PACKAGE ARRIVED ON TIME AND I DIDNT HAVE ANY DAMAGES SO I RATE THIS A 5 STAR PRODUCT!! THIS WAS A DISCOUNTED PRODUCT IN RETURN FOR MY HONEST REVIEW.\\&quot;[[ASIN:B00KCFAZTE EYE GEL THAT TAKES AWAY PUFFINESS]]\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Nice clear face cream. I use around my eyes but also rub into my face. A little goes a long way. it tightens as it drys, but after its dry you can&#x27;t feel it on your face. I like this product.</li>
            <li> Working wonders around my eyes. I notice the significant difference it is making when I have forgot to use it even one night--the next morning my eyes are all puffy and it looks like I have a bad hangover.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at the beginning but thought I&#x27;d give it a try. As everybody else, I&#x27;ve tried a million different lotions before until I found this gel. I absolutely love it. We&#x27;ve had a very bad year last year with so many bad things happening to us, from finding out our twins have two different behavioral disorders with developmental delays, my husband needing foot surgery on both feet with a bad insurance plan and two months no pay, getting skin cancer removed, my son needing two surgeries, and the list goes on. I felt and looked ten years older. I&#x27;ve already developed dark circles under my eyes but they got so much worse during last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to treat myself to a new lotion since the old one didn&#x27;t do anything for me. As the description says, it can take weeks to show the results you are looking for. I saw improvement right away but not as described. By the time my bottle was empty, I wasn&#x27;t completely convinced so I contacted InstaNatural. Customer service was great! They sent me a free bottle to show that their product will work if I just keep using it. I got it very quickly and have been using it ever since. I not only look better than last year but in my opinion, look even younger than my age thanks to this eye gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to use very little so it last 2-3 months for me. I use it on my entire face during the day and around the eyes and on the crease between my eyebrows at night. All of my wrinkles and creases, even the ones around my mouth, are hardly noticeable now. My dark circles are still there since they are inherited but much, much better than last year. I have very sensitive skin and break out easily but not with this gel. Another reason why I am so happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not being compensated for my review, in case anybody is wondering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life has gotten close to normal again and I decided to take better care of myself. I am now attacking my cellulite and noticed that InstaNatural has a cellulite lotion. So, again, I contacted them and asked if they could send me a free sample and they did, sending it immediately and I received it within 2 days of getting in touch with customer service. I will be leaving a review for that product as well once I have a chance to use it more. It&#x27;s only been a few days and cellulite doesn&#x27;t disappear overnight but so far, my skin feels amazing.llulite lotion.

            <li> Most of the positive and 5 star reviews are by people who received this product for free or at a reduced cost, maybe even fake reviews.  This product is not effective in any way.&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 30s and I have some under eye puffiness/bags mostly in the morning.  Will be requesting a refund.</li>
            <li> No difference at all. Most of these 5 star ratings seem so fake.</li>
            <li> Only been using a couple weeks, but already can tell a difference. Fine lines are going away under my eyes. Yay!!</li>
            <li> that is my last purchase of products on Amazon with 2000-3000 reviews and headlines with words like &amp;#34;the best &amp;#34; or #1. Definitely fake reviews. Very disappointed. Applied to my eyes, got instant dryness and felt that my skin would get more wrinkles this way. Product says can use for entire face, so I did. Same thing, gave me  feeling as if I would apply a face mask that should be removed.</li>
            <li> This product is very excellent. I am impress with the other reviews and highly recommend by other customer to try. I will re-purchase and tell my friends about this for the eyes. I wish they came out something for lips.</li>
            <li> Great eye puffiness remedy!  Noticed considerable change in puffiness after about three to four weeks.  Have ordered second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great ingredients and results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference</li>
            <li> Wanted to tell you I give this product 5 stars!!! I can see a remarkable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Works to clear dark skin around eye...However, the eyebag stays as expected. No product could remove the eyebag unless you go under the knife. Thanks\^^/</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the quality, but not sure if you have to pay more for &#x27;eye&#x27;-only cream in smaller quantity.</li>
            <li> Was hoping it would help my circles but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This item helped my puffy eyes. It lightened my skin, and made my overall appearance look much less dull! I used it all over my face, and not just my eyes as a previous customer had mentioned. I really enjoy this product, and I think you would too!</li>
            <li> The Best I have ever used on my eyes in years!!! first time user to this brand, But VERY HAPPY, 10 days now my eeyes look great</li>
            <li> Very good for dry skin around eyes.  Have itching flaking skin around my eyes and this is helping a great deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile now , the results are amazing . I&#x27;ve actually started using it all over my face before I use my facial oil. I have oily skin &amp; I am in my late twenties ever since adding this product to my skin care regime  I see a big difference in my skin ,</li>
            <li> Shipped very quick but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference on the bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am really liking this eye gel! I have been using it twice a day and have already noticed a big difference (purchased it a month ago)I bought the gel because my eye lids and skin under my eye were recently very dry and reddish. I also have always had dark bags under my eyes and slight wrinkles (I&#x27;m only 26 but I&#x27;ve always had this) and with 2 little kids, it&#x27;s only made things worse. I am happy to report that my skin around my eyes look and feel soo much better!! Just a heads up though, you may experience a slight stingy feeling when you first apply it- doesn&#x27;t happen anymore but happened in beginning. Also be sure to not pump out too much at once- start with a very small amount and see how much you need to cover all areas.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a diffrnce at tall.</li>
            <li> It works great and i am feeling more youth - love it</li>
            <li> My review is based on nearly 4 weeks daily usage.&lt;br /&gt;The eye gel is thick, clear and has a pleasant hardly detectable fresh scent. In comes in an easy to dispense pump action bottle. One pump gives enough eye-gel to treat both eyes, between brows and perhaps lines on the forehead.&lt;br /&gt;What I did see straight away, even after the first use, was a lessening of the dark circles under my eyes. The morning puffiness seems to be cooled, calmed and reduced by the gel.&lt;br /&gt;The gel does leave a very slight sticky residue (it really is hardly noticeable, but then I only use an amount sufficient to cover the area), so depending on the products you use daily, you might need to take that into consideration.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free copy of this product courtesy of the company for purposes of review.</li>
            <li> Bottle is huge of 1.7oz...takes up way too much space in my already cluttered bathroom...but I like the formula and the dispenser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a couple weeks and so far it seems to be helping with dry skin and puffiness.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this stuff, but it burned my eyes like crazy.  I tried it for about a week and just couldn&#x27;t take it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the eye gel for almost 2 months. I have noticed a difference in my dark circles, and the firmness of the skin in the outer corner of my eye. Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was real excited to get this after reading the reviews but I got no results at all.</li>
            <li> This eye gel does wonders for your under eye bags!  I love it and use it every morning!</li>
            <li> My eyes look great because of this eye cream. I used to have really puffy eyes because of lack of sleep but after just a few weeks of using it I was already able to see a difference. Now, my eyes are my favorite part of my face.</li>
            <li> This product works great and has a light smell!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months now and I love it.  My eyes seem to be sensitive to other products but this doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation and not to mention my eyes look great.  I felt like I was getting some small lines under my eyes and honestly they are gone.  Even after washing my face my eyes look great and there are no fine lines.  Definitely the best under eye product I have used.</li>
            <li> I received the Eye Gel just yesterday.Started using it last night and I think the product is working great. It absorbs quickly and I can feel the tightening under my eyes. I like it because it is not sticky and it is fragrance free.I have to use it for a longer period of time to see how effective it is but for now it does give me a smooth and soft skin.I will update my review after a month 😊</li>
            <li> See difference in appearance for the better, However, my Dark Circles aren&#x27;t going away.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to be working miracles in a very short time.....plan to order more real soon.</li>
            <li> I have these stubborn dark circles for years. I used these because other reviewers said it works for them, but not for me. I used the eye gel until it ran out. No improvements, whatsoever. I guess it works for most people, but I&#x27;m one of those that doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Insta Natural was one of the first companies I had the pleasure to review a product for. I was so impressed with there professionalism, and the eager to go over and beyond to make sure that I was a satisfied customer, that I just had to apply for all of there products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Excellent customer service is KEY! that will only reflect even more on their products.  It shows that the company stands by their products and that satisfying their customers is very important.  From their skin care, to hair care and body InstaNatural is by far my favorite company.  Their products are amazing.  Everything I have listed above is not only the products that I have tested, but that is my complete daily skin care and hair care regimen.  I have seen a big difference in the look of my skin and my hair.  InstaNatural is definitely my &amp;#34;Fountain of Youth&amp;#34; I give InstaNatural 5 stars for amazing products and excellent customer service.  I look forward to continue to do business with InstaNatural.  I most highly recommend that you give them a try!</li>
            <li> such great job on erasing wrinkles. I applied for about 2 weeks and the little wrinkles around my eyes are gone!! Doesn&#x27;t do a lot to the under eye darkness though, but mainly it&#x27;s my fault for staying up too much lol. When applied, skin feels cool and smooth immediately. Definitely will buy again and I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This works well with my skin.  I can feel the difference</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eye gel! I have tried so many products and once I tried this from reading so many great reviews, I loved it! I use it at night and in the morning.</li>
            <li> First of all I want to say that I was skeptical about buying this because of all the good reviews and not sure if they were real or not. Being a college student who also works, I never ever get enough sleep and I find that it is becoming very visible on my face, specifically under my eyes. I always looked dead and tired even when I was well rested and wanted to see if this could work. I figured why not, so I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I purchased this because I immediately noticed results after like a week. I used it just as instructed, I dabbed a little under my eyes every morning and every night. I didn&#x27;t use much as I little goes a long way. It smells like cucumbers which I like and it does tingle, but nothing too crazy. I find that when I put too much it does burn but like I said a little goes a long way and not much is needed at all. I&#x27;ve noticed my dark circles have gotten significantly lighter, they haven&#x27;t gone away but they are way better. I also feel like my whole eye area has tightened up and I look more awake overall. I would recommend this, it&#x27;s inexpensive compared to other products, it smells nice and it works. Wish I had a before picture but it definitely improved my dark circles for me, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This works just as well as the moisturizer, which is amazing. I will definitely keep these products in my skin care rotation from now on.</li>
            <li> I have used this eye gel for the past 2-3 months and I really like it. I am on my 2nd bottle. It lasts quite a while. I use it religiously in the morning and before bed. It works a lot better than several other products I have used over the years. For me, there were no side effects, no burning....just a light cooling sensation which is what you want. The smell is pleasant. The price is very reasonable for the bottle size.  I use this product at night along with InstaNatural Age-Defying Moisturizer. So far, so good. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, I use this eye gel primarily for puffy eyes as I have sinus/allergy issues and always seem to have &amp;#34;puffy eyes&amp;#34; in the morning....never fails.&lt;br /&gt;This InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel definitely helps the puffiness.....the other stuff is just a bonus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving the results.  I&#x27;m 64 and no longer have the &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; fine wrinkles around my eyes.  I religiously apply it in the morning and evenings.  I don&#x27;t see much of a difference yet in the dark circles.  Mine aren&#x27;t super dark but they&#x27;re still there.  I do have slight puffy eyes in the morning but that seems to calm down about an hour after my morning application.  Overall, I do like your product.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a month and half and i have not seen any results. It says try for at least 2 months but there is no reason if i only have about 2 weeks left but i rather just get a refund because i am not pleased</li>
            <li> It this tells you anything I will be reordering</li>
            <li> real nice, works fast</li>
            <li> Pretty decent.  Not much for the cost, but it does help my eyes get a little bit of a lift!</li>
            <li> Moisturizing but not necessarily a miracle-worker</li>
            <li> This eye gel is amazing!  I use it, my daughter uses it and my mom uses it!  It diminishes fine lines and definitely decreases bags and dark circles.  Also, the company is amazing to deal with.  I order from Amazon all the time and this is the first review I have ever left, that&#x27;s how good this gel works!</li>
            <li> I ordered it 10 days ago.  I have been using it under my eyes nights and days.  Most of my fine wrinkles are almost gone, and my skin looks tighter too.  I recommend it strongly.</li>
            <li> This works very well, I love the way it feels!</li>
            <li> Great product feels effective</li>
            <li> well I am giving it 4 stars but you just don&#x27;t know until you use it for a while. Hope it does what it claims.</li>
            <li> This product truly works.  The wrinkles under my eye are much softer and less noticeable.  My husband even noticed the improvement without me asking for his comments.</li>
            <li> No cream or eye gel is going to completely get rid of your crows feet and puffiness--However, this does improve them. Sometimes if I have been upset and cried or had allergies where my eyes are swollen, I apply this and it brings the swelling completely down. I am 41 years old and was starting to look older around the eyes but after using this for 3-4 months, look much more awake and definitely a slight reduction too in dark circles. I bought this randomly too but am happy to have found it!</li>
            <li> Great product, it worked well on me I love it</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Every time I had my makeup on my dry skin didn&#x27;t go away even with enough moisturizer but when I put this on all over my face it cleared all my dry skin and my skin looks perfect.</li>
            <li> this product does want it says it will....remove dark circles, fine lines, etc. I have been using this cream for about 4 weeks, i can see a big difference. Not oily. Just a little dab will do. Try it you will like it!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff right here! Noticed a big difference in my smins overall appearance after less than a week. Everyone else is telling me that I look really rested....which I&#x27;m certainly NOT....so something good is happening here</li>
            <li> this smells like cucumbers. feels great</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry smooth, very sticky</li>
            <li> I want to start this review out by saying InstaNatural is very lucky to have a customer service representative name Phil on there team.  This gentleman provided exceptional customer service and if I had to give him a rating five stars wouldn&#x27;t begin to explain his over and beyond attitude to keep their customers happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to my 1 week review:  Now I know your saying 1 week huh?  I am a 37 y.o female who has suffered from sleeping issues since I was a child around 5 y.o.  I never liked to sleep at night and would stay up the enter night.  I have some of the biggest bags that I have ever seen for a woman my age.  As I grew older I became very insecure of my looks cause I don&#x27;t wear makeup besides some mascara and a eyebrow tent.  So to try some of &amp;#34; everything &amp;#34; to preserve my looks has been very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural Eye Gel has put a smile on my face not to mention my self-esteem since using there product.  I am overly pleased in &amp;#34; 1 WEEK &amp;#34; from this gel!  I truly can&#x27;t believe it because most products takes a few weeks to months to recognize any results.  This usually determines if I will continue to purchase or discontinue the use and throw the product away ( plenty of money wasted ).  I am very happy a stumbled upon this company and I will most certainly continue to purchase their products.  I recommend this gel to anyone who is exhausted with being disappointed over and over again from these high priced creams with no results!!!&lt;br /&gt;To show you the difference a week has made in my life, I have uploaded pics to prove how awesome this product really works!  Thanks you InstaNatural for making such a great product and I will continue to revise my review as time progresses.</li>
            <li> Great product compared to the wide variety I&#x27;ve tried-- significant reduction in dark circles in addition to elimination of wrinkles and puffiness around the eyes. Have used it now for a few months; noticed immediate effects in just 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to get rid of the puffines under my eyes.  I have been using it for a month and seen no difference.  I bought two bottles, I will keep trying to see if there are any positive results.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I see a big difference in my eyes, they are not as dark as they used to be and the skin surrounding them looks fuller, they only complaint I have, is that the consistency is not so good, because it shows when you put it on, I mean, is not so absorbable,</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any result.  Sorry but waste of money</li>
            <li> I am little obsessed about my face and body routine. I have dry and thin skin and as I am getting older it&#x27;s not getting any better..I am always willing to try something new so I tried this one too. I use it all over my face, it makes my skin feel little tight after it is all absorbed, but than I follow with the Lancome Renergie ( which I have used for years..yeah..the price makes me think that it has to do something !) and L&#x27;Oreal gold cream (which I love). At 51 I am not expecting a miracle, but I like how my skin feels at the morning..I will order it again ( it would be 5 stars if the miracle would happen anyway).</li>
            <li> Great for tightening skin around the eyes, fine lines and dark circles. Great product. Used it daily at night time and twice a day on days off from work, morning and night after washing and cleansing face.</li>
            <li> Feels awesome around my eyes.  Seems to calm down puffiness</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE! It is unsafe!</li>
            <li> The Youth Express Eye Gel from Instanatural is so lightweight and cooling.  My eyes feel awake and refreshed just by applying it around my eyes and forehead.  My &amp;#34;problem area&amp;#34; is my smile lines and laugh lines so this is the perfect product for me.  I dab a little around my eyes, between my eyebrows, and all around my forehead.  You can apply the gel all over your face if you need it.  It feels great and absorbs quickly.  The scent is extremely light, almost nonexistent, but has a subtle crispy fresh scent.  Such a great product with an impressive list of ingredients like Hyaluronic Acid and Peptide Complex.  One great thing about Instanatural is that they provide 100% money back if you are not satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Originally I purchased this eye gel for my husband who has very dark under eye circles and bagginess.  He had immediate results after applying this gel.  He is using morning and night and there continues to be improvement, his under eye area is so much lighter and smoother! I was so impressed with the results I decided to try it even though I have remaining eye gel from another company that I wanted to finish up with first.  Honestly, I had a compliment about how good I looked for my age that very day, and this never happens to me any more.  Also, I was at my salon and when I looked in the mirror I was shocked at how good my under eyes looked!  The last time I was there and looked in the mirror I saw tired baggy eyes.  This time I saw smooth, bright and wrinkle free under eyes.  This product is amazing, I am hooked!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel religiously day and night. Hoped it would work great based on all the positive feedback and reviews. However, it didn&#x27;t work for my dark circles and sunken eyes.  Maybe their is a different version for ppl with sunken eyes?  If you come across anything please let me know! I&#x27;m desperate!</li>
            <li> It seems to smooth out the skin pretty quickly if you use it every morning and night. I am happy with the results. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the dispenser-poor design and always messy.</li>
            <li> LOVE this.  I&#x27;ve heard how refreshing cucumber slices feel.  Without having to shop at the produce aisle, my eyes feel refreshed.  I&#x27;ve been waking up to puffy eyes during allergy season.  After using this for a couple of days, my eyes were visibly less puffy.  I also want to give a shout out to the company.  They have sent e-mails to be sure I am happy with their products, each one personalized to address my comments.</li>
            <li> Have not seen a big differrence so far; have been using it for a while now. Dont know maybe in a while i will notice.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for almost 3 weeks. Starting to see less dark circle, puffiness and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I noticed results in under a week of usage. I feel like it brightened up my skin a lot. I am only 30 but I have always been plagued with deep set eyes. This gives me confidence that someone wont say, &amp;#34;You look tired&amp;#34; when I feel just fine.</li>
            <li> Just like other Eye Gels that i used..Doesn&#x27;t absorb my skin feels tacky and looks a bit shiny. Bought this based on great reviews but my experience  is this stuff is crap !!!</li>
            <li> Instant eye lift &amp; youth restoration! I had recently developed a bruised under eye look - more familiar terminology is that I was beginning to have the look of bags under the eye - but flattened with the look of tear drops - so broken capillaries! This eye gel took care of most of the dilema for me within a week! After all this time, I can safely say it is GONE! This eye gel was an excellent selection for me - fine lines also have diminished to being nonexistent! I am very happy! Thank you so much for this product! By the way I have also used this on the knuckle area of my hand - marvelous job! I am set for life with this product!</li>
            <li> REally does help to reduce under eye puffiness.  And for the price, well worth it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this long, but I love the texture, it&#x27;s really lightweight and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and goopy.  I actually have been using on neck, face and eyes, underneath my SPF moisturizer.  It is not greasy at all, and it is cooling on my chin (where I tend to have acne problems).  It&#x27;s well worth a try!</li>
            <li> Use it daily, didn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> I have used this on one side of my face for several weeks and have not noticed a difference as of yet.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is doing a lovely job at soothing out the puffiness around my eyes.  It is light and has a lovely scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Do not see any difference from before. Not bad, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for me.  I&#x27;ve used some of the more expensive brands and thought I&#x27;d try this for the right price but I don&#x27;t think its doing anything at all.  Doesn&#x27;t try all that well either.  I would recommend paying more for a better quality product.</li>
            <li> Used for a month, no change. The only thing for eye bags is a Blephoplasty....unfortunately</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help with fine lines and dark circles.  When I started using the product within the first couple weeks I noticed smoother, lighter skin, will keep using, I recommend!</li>
            <li> use it everyday, it worths the price</li>
            <li> I really notice improvements  the very first morning after using this gel. And after a week of use my friend noticed a huge difference. .my puffiness was gone!  Im really happy  with this product. :)</li>
            <li> M dark circle have disappeared completely. I love this product, I have recommended the InstaNatural The Best Eye Cream For Dark Circles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many eye treatments over the years.  Some were very expensive.  So far, this product has helped my eye area more than any of the other products..  No, my eye area is not perfect, but it sure looks better than it did.</li>
            <li> Takes the  puffiness away :)</li>
            <li> I have sleeping problems and that results in large bags under my eyes... It took this Eye Gel a few weeks to show results but the results are great. This is one of the better products I&#x27;ve used for the dark circles under my eyes. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the results of this product. I sometimes use it on my entire face. Great value and I am still using the same bottle for over 1 month..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week so the rating is up to this point. It makes my dark circles reddish. But I&#x27;ll keep using it and see what happens</li>
            <li> Fast absorbing and very lightly scented, kind of a light cucumber scent. It made a difference right away on the puffiness of my undereye area. I love this stuff and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff I have come across that actually works for dark circles. I do not get the puffiness and most eye products do nothing for my dark circles which have been especially bad since I started law school. This stuff started working after just one week and during finals when my sleep levels are at an all time low. The only reason I wear concealer is to cover my dark circles and now I can go without makeup! It is fantastic. I have been using it with the vitamin c serum and the age defying moisturizer so I can&#x27;t be sure which one of the three has helped with the fine lines. Either way my dark circles are gone and the fine lines that were starting to appear around my laugh line are gone too.</li>
            <li> I can see my eyelids!!!! I have only had this stuff less than 24 hrs (been used 3xs) but it diminished my bags and eyelid puffiness by at least 50%!! I am beyond THRILLED thus far with this product. I will be back in a week or two to report any more improvement if there is any, even if there isn&#x27;t I&#x27;m still extremely pleased with this product. THANKFULLY the only eye issues I have (which developed only this year) is bags and puffiness but it has really been bothering me. I was trying all kinds of eye creams, lotions and potions to no avail. I was really getting discouraged. I was trying all kinds of tricks with eye shadow etc with no succss. I found this online and was impressed with reviews. Everyone (but one) raved about the diminished bags and puffiness so I gave it a shot. I&#x27;m so glad I did!    I&#x27;m back a little over two weeks later and have decided this product works best for me if I use it in the morning only. Surprisingly enough it made my under eye bags and puffy lids worse if I used it at night as well. I&#x27;d wake up looking like I&#x27;d been crying all night. Since it pretty much works on demand for my puffiness &amp; bags using it once a day in the AM is working out fine for me :)</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, I use this around my eyes along with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum 2Fl Oz and it makes your skin look fresh, shiny and new...</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t seemed to work for me. I have dark circles under my eyes that I inherited from my father and was hoping this would clear it up and make me not look tired all the time.</li>
            <li> Noticing some changes around eyes. Too soon to tell if wrinkles going away. I do look less tired which makes me very happy!</li>
            <li> When I started wearing contact lenses I was shocked to see the bags under my eyes that had been hidden by my glasses.  I have been using Eye Gel for about a month now and am very pleased that those bags have diminished significantly.  As a bonus, when I use the Gel I find that it is soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li> Jury is still out.  Haven&#x27;t seen much improvement yet.  But it is still a bit early.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a month and can see and feel the results. I am a 60 year old male and when people took pictures of me it looked like my eyes are shut now they look open,  I just ordered a second bottle just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks my friend wanted to buy some for her mom!</li>
            <li> Eh....I used this for a couple months and didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  In fact, over time it seemed like my issues got worse.  I think this product would work to resolve certain issues, but i think the cause of my dark circles aren&#x27;t something that this product can fix.  I&#x27;d make sure you do your research and understand the cause of your eye issues before purchasing products like this.</li>
            <li> i want tell to everybody that this product is AMAZING and my first time that i used i can see different,CUSTOMER SERVICE IS EXCELENT I WANT CONGRATULATION FOR THIS ITEM AND TO SELLER THEY ARE THE BEST OF THE BETTER I RECOMEND TO ALL PEOPLE that want have beautiful skin and feel unique IS PERFECT MILLON STAR</li>
            <li> This is the best gel around. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I love it - Couldn&#x27;t ask for more, fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there are so many good reviews, I got this because I have dark circles under my eyes and so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li> nothing great, I&#x27;ve been using for 30 days, adds moisture but that&#x27;s about it</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would work for my under eye puffiness, but it did nothing for me, even after consistent use for a month.  I think my puffiness is genetic. I also did not like the fact that I could not put my foundation over the gel without it balling up into little pieces.</li>
            <li> great eye cream my wife uses everyday. She already notices as do I with the difference after using the product. It is great quality.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders! I am 32 years old and started seeing minor wrinkles underneath my eyes. I also have deep set eyes which makes my dark circles really stand out when I&#x27;m tired. The first time using this product I agreed with a reviewer that it was sticky and not something I would want to use during the day. It wasn&#x27;t too bad sticky - kind of like applying aloe Vera gel on your face. However after that I started using very little - a small dime sized drop on one finger, blended it with my other finger and then applied under my eyes. This helped a lot and now I use this product both day and night. I rub it in so that it&#x27;s entirely blended into my skin and then put my regular facial cream over it. I can apply powdered bronzer on top and it never flakes like some reviewers mentioned - you really only need a THIN layer. I have been using this for about a month now and already see that one of my larger wrinkles has almost entirely disappeared. I no longer look like I have dark circles, even when I don&#x27;t get enough sleep, this product makes me look refreshed! I have even been applying it to my forehead as a precaution because I have noticed that my skin under my eyes feels a bit firmer than it used to. Basically, I HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream .I have used. I just put it on and it does the rest.</li>
            <li> been using it and no difference at all.  i don&#x27;t have dark circles but puffiness.  it&#x27;s very drying.  will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Did so much more than I expected.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This felt drying, and the product &amp;#34;peeled&amp;#34; away if I would try and wear it under makeup, which is one of the recommended uses. I kinda gave up on it after a week as I didn&#x27;t really see any results. It smelled nice though, so points for that I guess.</li>
            <li> Very nice cooling,refreshing, light weight, and absorb-able eye gel. I&#x27;ve used this product after a late night out with friends, and have been very pleased with the results. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This makes my eyes look years younger! It takes the bags away and relaxed the wrinkles I have so they&#x27;re not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> Softens the skin around my eyes and reduces the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Eye Cream is okay, nothing special.</li>
            <li> Great product! Love it! will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the gel.  It doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin,  just sits on top of the skin.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend bought this for me because I thought this product would do what it claims. I was especially interested in the &amp;#34;diminishes dark circles&amp;#34; aspect. I used this for a month and it did absolutely nothing. No positive effects, no adverse effects, nothing. I dont understand how this eye gel has such a high rating. If you&#x27;re looking for some type of miracle gel/lotion/cream for your eyes I suggest you look elsewhere cause this eye gel definitely is not it. 2 stars because at least this didn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> it hasn&#x27;t helped much if at all.  it is nice and cool when you put it on...I will continue to use it, but, not extremely impressed.</li>
            <li> It is working very well to conceal under eye bags and dark circles. Within a few days I began to receive compliments like you look  well rested, younger. I also put a little on my forehead to smooth out wrinkles. I&#x27;ve stopped using another more expensive product and use only this gel under my foundation.</li>
            <li> helps reduce my dark circles. Good hydration. Helps with wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This product is a holy grail. I used to be plagued by dark circles and bags under my eyes and this product has gotten rid of those for me. It took about a week of dedicated use to make them completely disappear but I saw results as soon as I put it on.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this one</li>
            <li> My eyes are sensitive to most moisturizers. This works well and doesn&#x27;t irritate</li>
            <li> slight smell of cucumber, but it feels amazingly hydrating as soon as it touches your face.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I&#x27;m temporarily short on sleep and had noticed I was getting some dark circles under my eyes as a result. I would say they were mild to moderate in intensity. I started using this product and it resolved the issue in short order! You only need a tiny amount. So just a little does the trick!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this regularly (and according to directions), for over a month now. I&#x27;ve not noticed a huge difference physically, but perhaps it helps more psychologically. It feels cool on application, then solidifies like a dry sweat. I honestly think I could do better by researching dieting changes that target the needs that this product claims to meet. In fact, this product has motivated me to do just that...</li>
            <li> This is quite sticky and difficult to apply makeup I top of. It does seem to help with the immediate puffiness.</li>
            <li> This product left a strange film on the skin under my eyes. There may have been a temporary tightening, but it left a glue-like film and generally felt uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Works on puffy eyes. No other products worked as good as this one.</li>
            <li> It is a nice eye cream.</li>
            <li> I was using this for several weeks.  I had yo stop because I was sensitive to some ingredient and my eyes were quite itchy</li>
            <li> This is a pretty decent product to relieve eye-puffiness and circles.  Apply twice(morning and evening) evenly and monitor your progress.  My big issue is the tube itself!  There is absolutely no way of telling how much is left in the bottle and whether or not it is time to buy more.  It keeps pumping out product evenly and then one day it ran out on me faster than expected.  If I had to guess, I&#x27;d say it ran out on me after about 50-70 pumps, so a bottle should last you about two weeks if that, so price beings to factor in as well.</li>
            <li> Bought this for dark eye circles, after a month of use I see no results in that area, may work for anti aging but I&#x27;m only 20 so that wasn&#x27;t why I bought this product</li>
            <li> I like it. Haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet but keeps the eye area hydrated. Smells and feels like cool cucumbers.i would buy again. It&#x27;s a gel, not a cream. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice eye gel.  When I first started using it I was slightly annoyed because it felt sticky on my eyes.  I suggest keeping the little tab that comes inside of the pump because it keeps air from getting into the gel between uses.  I find that this comes out a little bit stickier when the tab isn&#x27;t used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this says that it can be used on the face, it was just too sticky and when I used it at night I felt like I was sticking to my pillow.  Although the texture was bothering me, the product itself did do a nice job.  I ended up topping it with a moisturizer to help get rid of the tacky feel and it stopped bothering me.  My eyes did appear to be less dry and my makeup applied so much better the morning after using this.  I highly suggest this if you don&#x27;t mind the sticky feel.  I did contact the company about my concern and they suggested that I use less of the product.  It did help with the texture, but I&#x27;m someone that likes to pile on the product.  This could just be me having this problem.  haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients listed are all great ingredients.  I&#x27;m assuming that the aloe is giving this product it&#x27;s texture.  It is very similar to the aloe gel that you use after having a sun burn.  You also get a TON of product for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me for review.  My thoughts are 100% honest.</li>
            <li> My redness and bags under my eyes are going away!</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 3 weeks ago and I&#x27;ve been using it religiously; 2ce a day, everyday. I have seen 0 progress. It leaves the skin under my eyes sticky/tacky and if I smile real wide my skin sticks together and not putting to much on. I&#x27;m 25 yrs old, I&#x27;m not struggling with wrinkles, but his product gives me the appearence that I do. It also leaves a white flakey residue behind. I&#x27;m going to try and return it. Dont waste your money folks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now.  I dab a little pea size amount under my eyes and on my forehead every morning and night.  It has definitely helped in the morning when I have puffy eyes! It has a cooling, tightening sensation when first applied.  It&#x27;s very pleasant and refreshing actually. The light cucumber scent is also pleasant.  I love it! It does feel a little sticky once it&#x27;s dried, but that&#x27;s what I usually put on moisturizer and the rest of my makeup and then the sticky feeling goes away.  After all, it&#x27;s a gel, guys.  As far as it working for dark circles and wrinkles... I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference in the skin under my eyes.  The tiny, little fine lines look softer and less noticeable.  The puffiness has definitely decreased and I look more wide-eyed, refreshed, and awake in the morning after applying this.  My skin feels more moisturized and I no longer have to use a ton of under eye concealer anymore.  I just use a small dot or two and I&#x27;m done! I wouldn&#x27;t say that this works miracles for dark circles as I think that my dark circles are still there and haven&#x27;t lightened up, but this gel does everything else it claims to do.  I hope to see lighter dark circles after a few more months of use, but within a month, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed and felt a difference in the texture of my skin and it&#x27;s great.  For under $30, this is a great eye gel to try.  A lot of other gels/creams have irritated my eyes, but this one hasn&#x27;t bothered me at all.  I&#x27;m impressed! I will definitely repurchase this and look into their other products.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many eye creams and gels and treatments over the years and this is the best one ever!  It smooths every line,  moisturizes my skin and isn&#x27;t greasy or thick.  I can wear it under make up.  I apply it night and day.  I even want to apply it over my entire face for a smooth finish.  And you cannot beat the price!  I would suggest this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> I do not think this does what it claims. I have dark circles and when I am tired and do not get enough sleep, I needed something for those bags that form under my eyes. So I wanted to give this I try. I do not think you will see any significant results from this however, I do use it because it has that &amp;#34;cooling effect&amp;#34; which FEELS nice but doesn&#x27;t make a difference. As a heads up, one day I had to go somewhere 2-3 hours after I put this on. Even though it felt dry on my face, once I got in the shower, it went back to gel/lotion consistency and started being sticky. So, I either recommending waiting much longer or doing this at night. Also, little goes a long way and make sure if you use ANY type of eye creams, you dab it, not slide or massage it. Hope it works for you, sucks that it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I have a very pale complexion as well as dark circles under my eyes.  As I move forward into my 40&#x27;s I am much more aware of fine lines and wrinkles that are slowly making an appearance.  I have been sampling a variety of products to try to reduce or eliminate these undesirable signs of aging.  I have been using this eye gel for a few days and I am starting to really notice a reduction in the dark circles under my eyes.  My tissue looks less thin and with make up the dark areas are virtually invisible.  I no longer need a concealer.  Just a light dusting of mineral foundation and I&#x27;m good to go.  I purchased this Eye gel during a promotion for trail and to share feedback.  I hope you found this review helpful.</li>
            <li> I have used this on and off.  When I first tried is the for day or two - it was WOW.  After that nothing.  I used it religious for a week - no big difference.  Then I took a break, and came back to it - nothing.  I don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> No signs of improvement</li>
            <li> Depuffs, and gets rid of those pesky dark circles! I love using this product as an eye-pick-me-up so I don&#x27;t look like a walking zombie!!!</li>
            <li> This product has made the dark circles under my eyes visibly lighter! I really love the easy application and effectiveness! I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! Amazing!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is working. My bags are still pretty bad..e</li>
            <li> I bought this to try with the instanatral eye serum and feel like they have helped with me dark puffy eyes, I have not seen any improvement in fine lines but I will still continue to use and hope it continue to improve down the line!</li>
            <li> I am all about the eyes. As we get older there is not enough we can do to help our eyes. Especially to keep the circles from beneath the eyes, or the skin are around bright. I can feel the skin getting more taught.This product is now being used by me always morning and night. PS I got this product for reduced price to do a review, Thanks</li>
            <li> This product worked well under makeup and did provide a good palate for the under eye concealer to stay put.  The only tricky thing is not dispensing too much product (you only need VERY little).  I think this feels more like a jell than a cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it, but like all eye creams, nothing is the miracles worker we all want it to be.</li>
            <li> ive been using this every night for 3 weeks and i got the results I wanted. I often stay up late so I started getting dark circles. Theyre gone. I no longer wear makeup. No need.</li>
            <li> Bought this because of the reviews. I used this product consistently for months with no hint of change in my under eye area. I also found that no matter how little I used, the product left my eyes looking greasy even after it fully absorbed. I have combination skin so I would not recommend this for someone who&#x27;s skin tends to be a little oily.</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel. I have been using it for about a couple months now and I could really tell the difference with the fine lines and dark circles under my eyes. Upon application, you could feel a slight tingling and a tightening sensation.</li>
            <li> Tried this out, but didnt notice any big difference. It is a bit sticky for a gel. I wont buy it again. It has alot of water in the gel.</li>
            <li> I love the way the Eye Cream makes my face feel.  I see a small difference in my dark circles.  I have only been using a couple of weeks.  I know it will take using it longer to see a real difference.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and reasonably priced.  I have used many eye creams and gels regardless of cost and this one is by far the best!  It goes on smoothly, non-drying, has no fragrance, no chemicals and absorbs completely.  I have used the product for approximately 2 months, but I started noticing a difference right away with diminished wrinkles around the eye area as well as on areas around the mouth.  I will definitely continue to use it day and night and highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Did not really see a lot of difference, it was an nice moisturizer though.</li>
            <li> I bought this during a long trip to Vegas because I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be getting much sleep. It fought back against my eyebags and managed to keep me from looking like a zombie, which is all I asked for. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about two months now, and I like the results. I have seen results since the first week. I apply it twice a day. Recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, but I already see less puffiness around my eyes. My dark colored bags are getting lighter, so now they&#x27;re able to be covered by makeup. The bottle has a squirt top so it&#x27;s easy to use.  The cream is clear and soft and goes on smoothly. It feels comfortable around my eyes even when freshly applied.  I got a free sample, but I expect to continue to use this eye cream and my eyes will look better and better.</li>
            <li> I like it but I am not in love with it. It is a gel formula that is very light on the skin and absorbs super fast into the skin. It dries matte and wears like a dream under makeup. It comes in a pump bottle that dispenses the right amount of product. A little goes quite a long way. I am a bit biased to the Serum but this is actually. I can&#x27;t attribute results solely to this product because I was using the eye Serum in conjunction with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was sent this product to try out and review. I have written a more detailed review on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com.</li>
            <li> The gel leaked outsides of the bottle. How do I return it?</li>
            <li> With having an almost 2 year old, I have found myself sleeping less and stressing more.  She is an active, troublemaking little buggar that I love to the moon and back.  Yet, since having her, I have noticed myself ageing, whereas I really hadn’t before.  I had slight dark circles under my eyes, which have started fading with the use of this cooling product.  I am looking brighter eyed every day, even though I am still the rundown mother of an almost two year old.  She loved to play with my eyes lately, and I think it’s because they are looking less tired, and more like happy eyes, instead of sleepy eyes.  I received a discount for this product in return for my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad. My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways.</li>
            <li> I use this with InstaNatural&#x27;s Retinol Serum, and the bag&#x27;s underneath my eyes have been reduced by 50%!!!! I use at night for maximum results. I highly recommend this product, it exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66 years old and have lived with under eye bags for several years, considering surgery.  This product has greatly reduced the under eye puffiness and helped eliminate upper eye saggy/crepy skin. I&#x27;ve used another brand, with similar ingredients, but this brand gives sooo much more product for the money with same great results!  I love it!</li>
            <li> The best natural eye gel! Beats all products I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> very good, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for 3 weeks or so and I can tell my upper eye lids are looking better already. I am excited to see how much better my eyes look by the end of two months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product 2x a day for nearly 4 weeks and am very pleased with the results. I haven&#x27;t had any puffiness. I really like the way it feels on my skin and works great under concealer.</li>
            <li> This suck doesn&#x27;t work sticki</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Very moisturizing and the gel stays on all day and keeps the eye area tender and protected.  It also works great under foundation makeup, both powder and liquid.  I saw gradual results in improving my dark circles too.  I have tried all kinds of eye creams and I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream. I use it during the day only. My night time cream is a very expensive Rx from my dermatologist so I can ration that out. With the combination of both eye gels, I have seen a huge difference! Someone ask me the other day if I was my 18 yr old son&#x27;s sister- Loved that even if if he was grossly exaggerating!</li>
            <li> BEST PRODUCT EVER!  I have tried many eye gels for puffiness and dark circles and this one is by far the best! I noticed an improvement in the first week! Customer service should also get 5 stars for their email and follow-up they gave me. Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I really like the feel , texture and smell, it works well under eyes</li>
            <li> Really terrible smells, stick on face and eyes also use my hands feel so stick too</li>
            <li> Been using this religiously for months, save your money. I see no change.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help eye puffiness</li>
            <li> I was not impressed at all.  I&#x27;ve used it nightly for several months and I have not noticed any difference in wrinkles or dark eye circles.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I apply it all over my face and it has really hydrated my skin while seeing improvement to the dark circles and fine lines around the eyes.  I see better results when I apply it morning and night.</li>
            <li> it actually helps with the bags under my eyes, but I have to use it twice a day nothing will stop old age</li>
            <li> Only my second month of use but I like it all over my face for a tightened feeling. S</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work for my puffy eyes and made my wife break out in acne!</li>
            <li> Really love this product works great</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my eyes</li>
            <li> I have been useing this product for alittle over a week and can already tell its working. It has a great sent andfeels amazing. I recieved this product for free for giving my honest opinion and will be ordering more in the near future</li>
            <li> Really did nothing for me.  Sorry I purchased it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a month and a half since I started using this eye gel.  This eye gel is very refreshing when applied.  It absorbs quick and leaves a soft feel to my eyelids.  I don&#x27;t have dark circles so I can&#x27;t tell if it will help with that, however, I do have dry skin and I find that it helps tremendously.  My eyelids feel soft and smooth now.  It works great under make-ups.  My make-ups look so much better now since the dryness is gone.  The fine lines are slowly disappearing which is awesome!  I am very please with this product.</li>
            <li> not good .. not as stated</li>
            <li> Great product!  I&#x27;ve only begun using it recently but I can already tell a difference.  My criteria for skin care products includes organic &amp; effective so I when I find something that is both I jump on itl  I buy a lot of InstaNaturals products including the Vitamin C toner, Vitamin C facial cleanser, Vitamin C serum, and Dead Sea Mud Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love this company!  They are extremely proactive about seeking customer feedback and if you are dissatisfied in any way, they make it right.</li>
            <li> I given this product a fair shot and I can&#x27;t really tell that it&#x27;s done much of anything.  I really wanted to like this and for it to work and do amazing things, but it is what it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 4 months and I was rooting for this to work but it didn&#x27;t for me. My mother also tried this and she had no results as well.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my under eye circles getting lighter.</li>
            <li> Another amazing product from a great company! I am now swearing by this brand. I use it all over my face, including my under eyes and I am in love. Makes my skin feel very firm and gives a slight glow. Love it. Will recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> The best cream I ever used. It really works and the dark circles desappear. Keep calm, it takes time.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference... Not very happy with this product so far no changes.</li>
            <li> First off, I will say that I got this for fine lines, not puffiness, but it definitely seemed to help! I like that it&#x27;s clear and unscented. Recommended it to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. It actually works on both my dark circles and under-eye bags. I thought the return policy was great if it didn&#x27;t work, but it does.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me after 8 weeks...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! When I recieved it I used it as soon as I got it and my eyes look brighter and younger each time I use it! I dab it all around my eyes and then I use what I have left all over my face! It nuat feels great on my skin! I will be purchasing this again! Can&#x27;twait to try more of their products!</li>
            <li> This eye cream did nothing at all.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a month now and I really like it. It has reduced puffiness under the eyes but it has not yet reduced the dark circles.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST eye cream I have ever used and my expectations at 45 yrs old were very low!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks of using this product, I was impressed with the line reduction and under-eye tightening effects, but after 1 month I noticed that my eyelashes appeared longer! I thought that was a bit strange, but my eyelashes hadn&#x27;t gotten longer - my overhanging &amp;#34;hooded&amp;#34; eyelids had receded! I can now see the edge of my upper eyelid without lifting my eyebrows. It might only be a few millimeters, but I thought only a brow lift could help my droopy eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 2 months of using Instanatural Eye Gel, the eye area feels plumper and more dewy/moist, the tear trough is shallower and the Niacinamide has lightened a few small sun damaged spots also. I am really pleased with the ongoing improvements to my eye area. (I use about a pea sized amount once daily).</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product -- so very happy I tried this wonderful product -- it made my skin look great almost immediately. I use it all over my face -- not just my eyes and I fully intend to continue buying this product as long as I can get it -- it is beyond wonderful. Thank you so much for making such a great product -- I absolutely love tis product!</li>
            <li> Powerful product I have teenagers and always loosing sleep because I worry about them but this produce is great it make your eyes look brighter and it starts to diminish the dark circles. I would recommend this to mothers who have infants as it will dramatically change the appearance of looking tired all the time.</li>
            <li> I am always a little skeptical about skin care products and what they can do. This is a great product.,, It really does work.  Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Out of all the products that I&#x27;ve tried from InstaNatural the Youth Express Eye Gel is my favorite! I love it because it reduced the look of my dark under eye circles. I hate that I suffer from dark under eyes, and this happens from lack of sleep. I&#x27;m happy that I have products like InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel that can help reduce the look of my dark under eye circles. Plus I love that it&#x27;s in a cool gel so it feels so soothing when you apply the gel under your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel absorbs quickly into the skin, and there is no fragrance. The ingredients are all safe and organic. I love that the InstaNatural Express Eye Gel is a versatile product. You can also use it on your face to even out your skin tone for a smoother complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the way it soothes my eyes, and reduces the look of my dark under eye circles. I will continue to use the InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel, and will purchase in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: Sent for review purposes via InstaNatural. However, the opinions expressed are my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I actually noticed a difference in the first week of using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a month and only once a day (at night) because I use a different one to hide the dark circles. I&#x27;m noticing my dark circles fading and the area below my eye firmer. I guess soon I may stop using the hiding product since my eyes are improving. So far, A+, let&#x27;s see if this keep working. In addition, is a lot of product for the price, so is a good deal.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a preventative method of use.  Dark circles around the eyes are hereditary within my family.  I had not begun to experience them and I wanted to be sure I never did.  Unfortunately after purchasing this product, ALL OF A SUDDEN I developed raccoon eyes!  Horrified is what I am to say the least!!!!  I wanted to give the product a fair trial at least using for a month.  When I went to return, I missed the 30 day return deadline.  So, yes:  I&#x27;m very displeased.  I purchased two; one for myself &amp; one for my mother.  She already has the darkness around her eyes.  The product did nothing to reduce the appearance of the darkness under and above her eyes.  Very disappointed :-(</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference in about a week. Going to continue to use. Thank you</li>
            <li> Does not irritate my skin or overly clog my pores, which are big concerns for me. Barely any scent, dries fast, and does not crumble. I use it on my chest, neck, and face morning and night.</li>
            <li> Good product for a great price.  I have been using it now for a couple of weeks and it seems to work well and soothe my eyes.</li>
            <li> It is at first hard to imagine any skin product living up to its name, but this stuff actually does that. I use the gel around my eye area, twice a day as recommended, and I see a noticeable difference in the purple shading under my eyes. That purple/gray darkness has faded almost completely. I&#x27;m a  31 yr old non-smoker and have been using Neutrogena retinol cream for a few years now so I don&#x27;t have much crepiness under my eyes, yet the skin looks more taut after using for a month. I am so satisfied with this product; great price, great results, EXCELLENT customer service. They have a customer for life. I&#x27;m going to try their other skin care products after my current supply runs out.</li>
            <li> It works. The dark circles under my eyes have greatly diminished. They aren&#x27;t gone but the improvement is good enough that I no longer feel upset with the way under my eyes look to me. Under my eyes are brighter and smooth. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Loved this. I have horrible dark circles and puffiness. It helped a lot. I usually use algenist eye balm but I prefer the instanatural. Better price and better results.</li>
            <li> This product works! I was not really sure what to expect. I have been using it for about 10 days now and my co workers have noticed the difference. this was sent to me free to offer a honest opinion. And It is a great addition to my daily skin care. I wish i had this years ago.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Seems to work very well. I have tried more expensive brands and this one seems to be just as good!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> No complaints.  No noticeable improvement either.  I&#x27;ve used twice daily for about a month.</li>
            <li> I have been using the InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel for almost 2 weeks and I love it! My eyes get very puffy overnight and the gel really helps bring down the puffiness and I have def noticed a more smooth surface under/around my eye area as well as brighter smoother skin as I also use on my face and neck. I see a difference and that&#x27;s what I look for in a quality product!</li>
            <li> I found this product on Amazon, since I couldn&#x27;t find anything for men at CVS to help with my dark circles. I&#x27;m only a teenager; it&#x27;s a mix of no sleep due to school work and genetics. I was skeptical because I have never heard of InstaNatural but I gave it a try due to all their reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the product and I have to say it&#x27;s great! It smells great and is easy to apply and dries in 10-15 minutes. The first week I just noticed a decrease in &amp;#34;saggyness&amp;#34; in my eyes but my dark circles looked the same. I have been using this for 2 weeks now, every morning &amp; night, and I am starting to see my dark circles fade!! I plan to use this longterm and I hope the excellent results continue. It really isn&#x27;t a hassle to apply so I don&#x27;t mind doing it twice a day everyday. I tried a Garnier Dark Circle eye roller product and it only covered up my dark circles and was messy. I also was using &amp;#34;BeautyCounter Eye Cream&amp;#34; for 2 months and it did absolutely nothing which was pathetic because it cost me $60. This product is $20, I get way more, and IT ACTUALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> This has really been the only product that has worked for my eye puffiness. My eye puffiness hereditary combined with allergies. I have used several products, priced 5X higher. I have seen greater results with this in a few weeks, than with months of consistent usage of other products. They have been reduced so much that I go without concealer on most days for the first time in years. I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this eye gel.  And I am seeing improvements in the skin and circles around my eyes.  I would definitely recommend and will continue to use.I&#x27;m almost 50 so every little bit helps.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Thus far my wrinkle lines are getting finer. Still waiting for the dark circles to disappear completely (probably will at the end of the second month), and my puffiness has disappeared completely. My friend saw my progression and I will be ordering one for her soon.</li>
            <li> The reason I write this review cause this eye gel is the only one that works for me ever. It really improves my dark circle or eye puff. Thus, give it a try, you can see the difference within less than one week!</li>
            <li> Skin type: combination - dry except for the T-zone&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have dark circles or puffiness, the only thing bothers me is some fine lines underneath my eyes. I have been using Shiseido&#x27;s eye cream, and it always provides a temporary relief, but once the make up is on, the fine lines show up instantly. After so many good reviews and photos, I decided to give this product a try. I have been using this product for about two weeks now, but it does almost nothing to my eyes, not even a temporary recovery. It is fairly light and has a very subtle smell, but except for a tiny cool feelings it provides, I don&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is very powerful and I love it. It moisturizes my eye area and at the same time firms the skin. I have trouble with puffiness and dark circles under my eyes, and since I have been using this, the area has really brightened up. I also apply the eye cream at the corner edges of my eyes where some small wrinkle lines have appeared the last few years. The cream seems to have definitely made them appear smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wonderful eye cream contains Hyaluronic Acid, Matrixyl 3000 and plant stem cells. The cream is all natural and full of organic ingredients. I was asked to test and review this item and give my honest opinion of it. I am really impressed with this eye cream. I highly recommend this InstaNatural Eye Cream for anyone that has an eye area that might need some help. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and already see a difference. The bags and dark circles are going away. I am so excited to see to see the end result.</li>
            <li> Love this gel !!! I use it for my dark circles under eyes and the results are amazing !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day for six months and have seen very little improvement.  I was a little suspicious because of all of the rave reviews.  But, it wasn&#x27;t that expensive, so I decided to try it anyway.  Next time, I&#x27;ll save my $20 and put it towards something with more realistic ratings.  I wonder if they pay for the reviews so they end up with more 4 and 5&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Love it.. Really helped my dark spots!</li>
            <li> I received product as promised.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT eye gel if you need to tighten the under eye area. As for me I have darkness so I switched to their eye serum.</li>
            <li> YOU WILL SEE THE RESULTS BY THE 3RD DAY! LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Really have seen a difference!! Would recommend it!! I love it. My eyes look brighter and my skin is truly radiant after the gel!! I would recommend this product hands down!!</li>
            <li> Hoping for a good results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dark circles for 40 years. I have both brown pigment and thin skin that shows purple underneath.  I&#x27;ve tried many creams over the years without any results and just gave up and used concealer. This is the first thing I have ever used that actually works. I have been using it before bed and then in the morning again for only 2 weeks and the improvement is very obvious!  The circles are more than half gone. At this rate, they will be gone before I use up this single reasonably priced container. I am using the tiniest amount each time - just a little dot. I wear contact lenses and have very sensitive skin and I have had absolutely no issues with this cream.  I could not be more pleased with this. I will now have to get used to my new face - because I look very different!</li>
            <li> Have been using around eyes for over a month, day and night with absolutely no result. Seems to firm up skin for awhile, only to leave weird film on skin after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now been able to use this product for a week and I think it&#x27;s wonderful! Specifically, I like how my eye area looks refreshed. I also like that it is a gel and I can use it on my whole face. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> VERY nice product! It has a light, fresh scent - but more importantly, it feels wonderful! Very refreshing, and you can feel it &#x27;tightening&#x27; the eye area as it dries. I put it on underneath my makeup in the morning, and also before I go to bed at night. I&#x27;ve tried many of these eye gels/creams, and this one&#x27;s the best! Exceptional customer service too. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have used numerous under eye products including very expensive brands such as la prairie and la mer.  I have to say that within just one week of use, this eye gel diminished my under eye dark circles by over 50%!  Needless to say I am super impressed!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on other expensive brands and just give this gel a try.  You may be very pleasantly surprised like I was.  I highly recommend this product to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> this no good, didn&#x27;t help me. Maybe it help others but not me.</li>
            <li> Well, I have had this product just a few days and I can already seen a difference in the puffiness.I have used lots f products, this inexpensive product is doing the trick..I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is honestly the best facial product I have ever used.  I have been applying as directed to my eye area, above upper lip and on cheeks for 2 months.  I am 63 years old and the bags, dark circles and lines are much diminished. My husband has even started using it around his eyes ! The fresh cucumber scent is an added benefit. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> 1 stars for the product, 5 stars for customer service. This product burned my eyes after putting it on consistently for a few weeks.  I also could not tell how effective it was as I did not notice any incremental benefits to it. However, when I contacted customer service, they immediately (no questions asked) issued a full refund.  All companies should be like this, regardless of the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> Completely removed the dark bags under my eyes. Definitely gonna buy it again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cool and refreshing when putting on.  But I barely notice any improvement.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used! Opens up my eyes, reduces swelling, erases dark circles, and softens fine lines. Gentle clear gel is easy to apply - odorless and non-irritating to my very sensitive eyes &amp; skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this eye cream because it&#x27;s one of the best sellers on Amazon with glowing five star reviews. However, I guessed the eye cream is so strong for my skin type that the skin underneath and around my eyes became swollen and turned into dry patches. I used the eye cream for three days, both day and night time. After the third day, I started to feel itchy around my left eye. I thought it just a mosquito bite or something but later that night, the skin under my right eye started to turn red too. I was not sure that it&#x27;s the eye cream so I applied it one more time before bed (it burned). The next day, when I applied my moisturizer, I realized that I had many rough patches around my eyes. I was so scared and just want to return this product.</li>
            <li> This I gel smells great. It has a light cucumber fresh scent and is easily absorbed into and around I area. I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet, however it&#x27;s only been two weeks. I would definitely buy this again</li>
            <li> I like this best for the bags under the eyes and stress lines</li>
            <li> Having had previous experience with InstaNatural products, I was thrilled at receiving an offer to try this at a one-time promotional discount and of course, I instantly accepted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is so much about this company that speaks to the kind of dedication to their craft that should be evident in ANY company that produces beauty products such as this one. For example, they stand behind their products no matter where you bought them or who you bought them from. This is a lifetime, 100% money-back guarantee-something that, in my experience, is absolutely unheard of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is light and very pleasant, much like the other InstaNatural products I have been privileged enough to try. The gel form is cooling and felt absolutely wonderful gliding onto my skin. In about ten days or so, the bags under my eyes were 95% gone and the moisture level in that area was the best that it has ever been. Incidentally, you don&#x27;t need to confine your usage of this product to the skin around your eyes. It can be used all over your face, neck, and decollete area. Why would you want to keep the astounding performance of this product confined to your eyes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There aren&#x27;t many beauty-related products that incite me to want to hoard them, but this is one of them! This is made in the U.S. in an FDA-registered and regulated facility, which means top quality is always first and foremost, but also means that hoarding of their products wouldn&#x27;t be necessary. I hope they are around for generations to come!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of eye creams/gels before and I like this one the best.  It is very cooling and hydrating.  It helps to minimize fine lines as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over a month but I am still not seeing any improvement. Will keep using until the product is finished but not vey confident at this point that this product is effective in reducing eye bags</li>
            <li> the worst eye gel ever. Does not make any difference, does not hydrate and irritates my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a short time-one week. I don&#x27;t notice any improvement, which it says it can take a few weeks, but I have very painful burning and dry patches around my eyes. It turns the skin red and raw and is very disappointing. I don&#x27;t want to continue use due to discomfort. Very sad to have spent this money!</li>
            <li> Not sure long term results but I really like it.</li>
            <li> I liked it!!! but if feel sticky when I leave it to dry, so I had to wash it white a cold water and I think that what makes it work better , it did reduce the black under my eyes too much but it gave me a fresh look every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fairly well.  Will have to see if it works more over time.</li>
            <li> This product is almost exactly as another one I purchased. It doesn&#x27;t do a thing for puffiness under the eyes. I never had darkness under the eyes so I can&#x27;t speak to that claim.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. It isn&#x27;t sticky and no funky odor.  Skin feels good and a bit smoother.</li>
            <li> Excellent gell! Everything is Fine!&lt;br /&gt;The best quality is that stop the puffiness of eye contour! Me and my friends are using it at Night and morning.</li>
            <li> like the feeling of it</li>
            <li> Still giving the product time to work, however, results are definitely noticeable--this is a lot more than can be said of most products claiming to do what InstaNatural does.  My under-eye area is noticeably (by feel and to the naked eye) more firm and overall less tired-looking.  My crow&#x27;s feet, which were still fine wrinkles, have diminished as well.  Was hoping for a bit more of a miracle but have been using for just under a month (religiously twice/day), so time will tell as to whether or not results continue to improve.  Absorbs quickly, easy to apply makeup over product if you wish. Would recommend.  Well worth what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these stuff..</li>
            <li> i cannot notice any difference, waste of money</li>
            <li> be aware of the side effects that it doesnt list because of the plant stem cells.</li>
            <li> I like this product as it&#x27;s one of my many preventive measures I take for my eyes.  I gave it 4 stars because the pump dispenses too much product.  You&#x27;ll have to be careful not to give it a full pump because you&#x27;ll then have too much product for your eyes.</li>
            <li> Work very well for me and last quite a while.</li>
            <li> Feels good as an eye cream. It gives a cooling effect but I do not think it is making much of a difference to my dark circles. I have been using it for over 3 months now.</li>
            <li> The InstaNatural Eye Cream for Dark Circles works wonderfully.  I have been using the eye cream for one week and it is already working.  I am a mother of 4...twin 10 year old twin daughters, a 22 month old daughter and a 3 month old daughter.  So as you can tell my eyes stay tired looking.  Since using this product I have gotten more and more compliments from people that know me staying that I look so good.  It is an awesome feeling  knowing that you are holding on to your youth the best way possible.  I love it!!!!  And HIGHLY recommend it to anyone.  I recieved this product in return for an honest and fair review.</li>
            <li> This cream is also bad advertising because it doesn&#x27;t do what it states. My eyes are still in the same state before I purchase this cream. Ive been using this for about a month, morning and night, everyday, but I see no results. Then I get an email from the seller saying the results would happen in 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m giving it an extra star because it&#x27;s cool, soothing, and there&#x27;s no sticky residue afterwards.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I actually use it all over my face and neck.  I had a couple of dark spots that have nearly gone away in just a short time.  This is a great product and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> No results seen after four weeks twice a day usage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in the dark shadows. There is only so much you can do as you age.</li>
            <li> Best eye gel I have ever bought, I also use on my face, feels good, wrinkles, dark circles and bags is disappear little by little after using  months. I love it a lot. I will keep going to use it everyday. This is even much better than the expensive eye creams that I used before for many years. Thanks for Insta Natural great eye gel. I just bought my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams and this seems to be the first one that is making a difference.</li>
            <li> it.did.not.work. and it&#x27;s.thick and.feels heavy under.your.eyes. money.wasted</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Reduced eye puffiness, bags, and dark circles within 3-weeks. In fact, my husband and brother did not know I use the product and commented that I look 10 to 15 years younger. It does not burn or sting so I started using it more often since it really works. I highly recommend product and am very impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> I like this eye gel!  The skin under my eyes is a bit more firmer, and I have noticed the dark circles disappear when i wear it.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice, the gel is thick and i like that it dries fast. It&#x27;s not sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work! I purchased the gel back in February.  I used it daily both in the morning and night for about 12 weeks and had no results what so ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye gel along with the youth express eye serum for two months and I can definitely tell a difference! No more puffiness in the morning! The gel can sometimes make my face feel tight but the next morning, my skin feels soft and looks great.</li>
            <li> Even as a woman in my mid 50&#x27;s, I love this eye gel.  It feels so lovely and cool on, and never stings at all; I use it on upper and lower kids.  I really appreciate the great ingredients for my skin, like the hyaluronic acid.  I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, so I&#x27;m watching how this does on my dark circles. My eyes do look brighter, and I&#x27;ve used this product for over a month.  I also like the packaging; the pump is easy to use and keeps the product safe, and I particularly like the larger size that provides good value. I&#x27;ve used dozens of eye creams, and this is absolutely one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Best eye creme I have used, it doesnt leave any sticky feeling and dries real quick</li>
            <li> I, too, thought this must be some kind of crazy scam because how could there POSSIBLY be so many five-star reviews ??  Well now I know why.  Because this stuff is incredible!!  Quantity is huge.  Method of delivery is perfect (nice easy pump.)  Great eye cream.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, especially, my husband loves it very much.  This is a third jar I ordered for him, he cannot live without it !!! It literally reduced his eye bags!!!  Try it you will like it !!!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used long enough yet but like it</li>
            <li> I decided to use a eye remover product from the drug store.HUGE mistake.My eyes were so dry I could not keep my eyes open. Looked on amazon and decided to see what what was cheap or had good reviews. I am glad I got the product with good reviews because not only are my eyes hydrated but look better than they did before. Highly Recommend this. Found a loyal costumer. :)</li>
            <li> Love this eye gel, how bought it twice and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the rave is about. This product makes my face feel sticky and gross. Would not buy again</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me. I have been wearing this eye cream for about a month now and I didn&#x27;t see any improvement at all. It has a very light essence, but I didn&#x27;t bother me, I never got an allergic reaction neither my husband. I got it because I have pretty bad puffiness and dark circles under my eyes however the puffiness is even worst. My husband tried it as well hoping it would work for his dark circles and he was very disappointed that I spend my money in a product that didn&#x27;t work.  Pros Smell nice Not allergies  Fast delivery  Cons Never saw improvement in puffiness and dark circles Doesn&#x27;t work as promises it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now, and I am very satisfied with the results so far. The bags under my eyes are visibly minimizing and the puffiness are visibly gone. I&#x27;ve used other products, but am not as satisfied as I am with this one. So glad I&#x27;ve decided to give this product a try, and was not disappointed. I will continue to buy this Eye Gel indefinitely.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  It is nothing short of a miracle. I have literally tried every product in stores or online that says it&#x27;s for dark circles and nothing has worked... until now. I have very dark circles and puffiness under both of my eyes. The more makeup and concealer I use to try and hide them, the more the wrinkles show up. I noticed a change within the first couple of days of using this product and it has been getting better ever since.  My wrinkles have gotten much better, the puffiness is gone and I only have slight darkness in two area under my eyes. I no longer use the concealer and only a light powder to blend in with my makeup. I no longer feel embarrassed without makeup on. I heard that people have seen more results the longer they use it but even if this is all the improvement I get, I am very happy and will be purchasing more. Try it - it works!</li>
            <li> OMG this is the best eye product I&#x27;ve used in my life, no kidding! I&#x27;m 26 yrs old and I decided it&#x27;s a good time for me to start using an eye cream. I shopped around for one but the ones that are promised to work very well are above my price range, $40+ for 10 mL. I bought this eye gel a week ago and totally addicted to it now! The lotion gets rid of the dark circles and puffy eyes within an hour! The price is great too, $15 per 50 ml is an awesome deal! I just can&#x27;t say enough about this eye gel, it&#x27;s extremely good. I let my mom try it too and she loves it. I&#x27;m hoping InstaNatural will keep manufacturing this gel for the next 20 yrs because I will sure be buying it for at least that long!</li>
            <li> I was a smoker for 50 years and developed serious dark circles under my eyes.  This eye gel actually helped in removing those dark circles.  didn&#x27;t happen right away but after continuous use, I could see an extreme change for the better under eyes.  Get it. you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> Great product - fast shipper!</li>
            <li> After many other attempts, this is by far my favorite eye gel. My extremely delicate skin went from irritated and peeling to moisturized and supple. My dark circles and crow&#x27;s feet are less visible also. Total win.</li>
            <li> worked and felt pretty good....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to tell you , This product just waist of money , very standard eye gel , sooth for minutes only ..</li>
            <li> I never write a reviews . this is my first time, I must say I love this product and is only been 2 weeks .</li>
            <li> I am 29 and This is the first Eye cream I purchased. This did not work well. Its true it reduces puffiness but it led to dry skin around my eyes. Eye lids and under eye started to blacken. I had to go for medical treatment. I will not recommend this product if you have sensitive skin. My husband tried the product later and it gave him the same results.</li>
            <li> buy twice, then change to another brand and I&#x27;m sorry, this is refreshing, and it works</li>
            <li> A really light gel type of eye cream that absorbs easily. As far as I can tell, this is not a fragranced product. This is a plus because fragrance could irritate the eyes. I really do like this gel eye cream however, I cannot tell if it made a difference for my dark under-eye circles hence it is getting a 4 star rather than 5. Also, I use all facial products as prevention products still so I cannot comment on whether they worked on wrinkles, sunspots and such.</li>
            <li> After a week of using this gel nightly on my eyes, I think I can definitely tell a difference in the darkness underneath my eyes. I think the area around my eyes appears to me more &amp;#34;rested&amp;#34;. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends!</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this refreshing gel. Love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I like the cooling sensation and smell of cucumber. Did see some improvement with some fine lines I had on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel so far.  I use it all over my face as the ingredients are primo for all of my skin, not just under my eyes.  The consistency is a medium gel that spreads easily anywhere you put it on your face and/or neck.  It is clear and thinner than another gel I&#x27;ve used with similar ingredients (I like that one also).  These two gels are my new favs on days that I don&#x27;t use retinol products.  I usually use the gel at night, but yesterday I tried it during the day so I could try it under makeup.  Once dry, I put my usual foundaion on.  No balling or rubbing off at all.  It&#x27;s a terrific base for all of your makeup.  I also put it on my eyelids, but only about 1/2 way down.  I can&#x27;t speak to using it all the way to my upper eyelashes as I never go that far with anything since lotions, etc. have a way of moving into my eyes over the course of a day or night.  I also like very much that you get a full 1.7oz in this bottle.  I&#x27;ve seen several bottles with similar ingredients with only 1 oz or even .5 oz so be sure to check the amount when ordering.  The company is lovely to deal with. They have sent me emails with information on how to use the gel and even an offer for a free bottle of hyaluronic acid.  Highly recommend,  Time will tell on the wrinkle and other improvements. Update:  I&#x27;m still using this eye gel, only for me it&#x27;s strictly used all over my face except under my eyes.  My reason for skipping this region is that at my age I need something with more moisture.  I have found that when the eye gel dries under my eyes it pulls at that delicate skin and then when I move my eyes around once it&#x27;s dry, that it kind of cracks and then highlights every fine line there.  So I&#x27;ll continue with it everywhere else as I really like how it makes my face feel, but will use something that is much more emollient under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful eye gel.  I am 57 and have some wrinkles along with puffiness under my eyes. I have had puffy eyes since I was young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my face, around my eyes and on my forehead lines.  You could see a difference slightly in a few days.  I am using it in the morning and at night.  It absorbs quickly without any stickiness or greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great all natural product and you only need a little at a time.  It gives my skin a cooling sensation and my skin feels tighter and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this gel complimentary  to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Very soothing application that feels cool on tired under eye area. Product has definitely made me look younger and smoothed lines and wrinkle areas. Also making skin appear healthier and more vibrant.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR MY HONEST REVIEW AND I JUST LOVE IT.  THE WRINKLES AROUND MY EYES HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO DIMINISH AFTER ONLY A FEW DAYS OF USE.  I HAVE TRIED MANY OTHER PRODUCTS BUT THIS ONE REALLY TAKES THE STARS.  I CAN&#x27;T WAIT TILL MY SISTER GETS HERE SO THAT SHE CAN TRY IT.</li>
            <li> Visible signs of improvement within one month of use. The flesh/skin under my eyes is less puffy and tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am very impressed with the impact this product has had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will report back after two months of use.</li>
            <li> I got this cream for free to test it and to leave my opinion. Well, here it is: I found this gel very pleasant for my skin. In week long test period, I noticed that puffiness and redness around my eyes was greatly reduced. I preferred to use it at night, more then day, but that is my personal preference. It is not heavy on the skin and I dd not have any bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I feel it make my darken eyes area becoming better, the Wrinkle around reduce....I will try more to see how it is more better</li>
            <li> I am 69 years old and have big puffy, purple bags under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I used this cream every day for a few weeks and sort of forgot about&lt;br /&gt;it. Then one day, I looked in the mirror and saw that the swelling was down&lt;br /&gt;a good bit and the purple color had faded appreciably. So it does really&lt;br /&gt;help with the swelling and discoloration. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel.  It is more effective on my morning puffy eyes than any product I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them, plus it softens my crows feet so that they aren&#x27;t nearly as noticeable as they were. The price on Amazon is very reasonable.  You get much more product for your money than other brands too.</li>
            <li> I actually use this all over my face and I feel like my skin is responding well. My skin is a bit smoother and the gel is a good base for my moisturizer and makeup.  The customer service is excellent.  They checked in to see how I liked the product and are even sending me a free bottle.  Good product and company!</li>
            <li> Works great, smells fresh and pleasant. The skin around my eyes is already smoother and my wrinkles are lessening.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have been using it for a few weeks, mainly to minimize morning eye puff. It has been working. Will continue. Great service as well. Plus I look for all natural ingredients. A nice product all around for my need.</li>
            <li> Wow - this product really works. I have been using it for just a few weeks and I already see an improvement in my skin around my eyes. Wonderful product, easy to use and great customer service. Give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I think that this is working...but maybe a little too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> perfect eye gel! just perfect! i aslo use this gel on my face after instanatural c cleanser and i have great results. will buy just instnatural products. it is worth to spend money on their products! love it! love it! love it!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff does an awesome job at fixing puffy, &amp;#34;tired&amp;#34; eyes in the morning. I&#x27;ll be getting another bottle soon.</li>
            <li> Im am 21 and have been looking for a natural product to help with the dark circles ive been getting lately. insta naturals has been working amazing i can see the difference in my dark circles, my skin feels refreshed after every time i put it on it is a gel and it pretty much gets dissolved into my dark circles after a few minutes i have made this product part of my daily skincare routine !</li>
            <li> Simply the best.  I purchased this product a couple of weeks ago and here I am again. I bought two additional ones for my family members.</li>
            <li> Horrible product. Do not buy.  Do not buy!!!! The good reviews must be fake.  Gave me more lines than what I had. Should not be sold. Feel like suing them!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for three weeks and it makes the skin smoother. Wrinkles become less noticeable.</li>
            <li> This skin cream not only works well in reducing fine likes around the eye, it also is effective in improving skin complexion in the entire face. The quality of the ingredients are unsurpassed and organic too!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different face creams with varied results. I think this one falls somewhere in the middle. It&#x27;s pretty good but really has no noticeable effect on my eyes. I wish it did. Good quantity and I may try for a while longer. Stay tuned</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream! It has been working well for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for puffy under eyes.  It works better than most products I&#x27;ve tried. I use it everyday and night. It goes on smoothly and is comfortable to use. Soon after purchasing the product the Seller contacted me to see if I was satisfied with the purchase and asked if I had any questions or concerns, I replied that I did like the item and explained that my issue was puffy under eyes.  They recommended  keeping the eye gel in the refrigerator as it works better cold for puffiness. I tried this and it helped.  I noticed improvement in the mornings and throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with puffy under eye issues knows that this problem is very hard to correct.  I am satisfied to see the improvement.The product is priced right and lasts long as you only need a pea size drop for each eye.</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for over a month and see no change.</li>
            <li> This product does nothing for my bags under my eyes or the puffiness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 4 months. First few weeks i thought it was effective because of the tight feeling around the eyes but after a month i didn&#x27;t see any change. My eyes still looks puffy and tired.</li>
            <li> Using this product took the bags from my eyes. I will purchase this product again and again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a drug store eye cream/ serum for the last 2 yrs.  I wanted to see what else wad out there, so after reading the reviews, I gave this a try.  I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple months, but it goes on smoothly, need very little and I haven&#x27;t noticed any new wrinkles around the eyes.  So far, I&#x27;ve been pleased.</li>
            <li> My skin around eyes became dry. It does work FOR wrinkles not against as was written. I got little new ones. I&#x27;m so shocked and stressed. Please, when you write your review, be really honest.  Don&#x27;t let them buy you by getting free stuff. Please stay aware.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother to try, and she is very happy with the results. Looking at her, I can see the difference too. I</li>
            <li> On time and good price.love it I&#x27;m never going back to a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing, no results after 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> I saw some improvement with my dark circles but it does nothing to moisturize the skin. My skin feels kind of dry shortly after applying the gel.&lt;br /&gt;No improvement with the fine lines around the eyes. It actually makes them more prominent...I wish this product worked for me but it didn&#x27;t. I won&#x27;t be buying it again :(</li>
            <li> The direction printing on the label is so small you would have to use a microscope to read it.  Why couldn&#x27;t they print in on a larger paper and include it in the box?</li>
            <li> It looks like working well!</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service.  I lost the first bottle so just now got a chance to try this eye gel.  I have only used this product for a week and feel pretty good after applying.  Work well comparing to other eye products that I have been used.  I do have to be careful not to press too hard on the pump to get the right amount of gel.  Good product, good price and great customer service.</li>
            <li> This eye gel spreads easily and dries off fast. I simply dab a little around my eyes using circular and upward motions. My skin feels fresh and moist immediately. It does not get red or agitated at all. I apply it over my hyaluronic acid or vitamin C serum before bed. It is recommended to use it twice daily though. It does not have any fragrance or any harmful chemicals. The ingredients are those that are highly recommended by beauty experts. The size is pretty good. I hope to use it for a few months. This product has been provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> In The short rime I have using this my eyes look great ..There isn&#x27;t a tired look to them ..So I can say this product has helped to transform my eyes a lot ..Will order again</li>
            <li> Love it firSt day using it and i feel a difference i recommened it</li>
            <li> I have been using the gel for over a month now. In the beginning I was applying it only around eyes, but since i ran out of my other face cream, i decided to use the gel for the whole face and even the neck area. :).  I Like the cooling effect it leaves and the fresh look my face got. Also, i noticed the little wrinkles around my eyes started to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am happy with the gel and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see visible result after using couple months.</li>
            <li> I love their products and agree with other positive feedbacks. If I say one request, product with clear bottle otherwise you can not tell how much is left.</li>
            <li> This product does seem to actually work to reduce the dark circles and puffiness under the eyes. It&#x27;s not a dramatic reduction...but noticeable nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for very long but I like the way it feels and also the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  Will not order again.  Hope it works for others.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the eye gel ..it really helped in the morning for puffy eyes and The cooling effect that happen when you apply it feels really nice.  In addition, when I left feedback through email they sent me a complementary eye gel at no charge.  I really appreciated The customer service and will definitely be trying to more of these products.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks I saw a huge difference in my eyes.</li>
            <li> did not notice any change</li>
            <li> Product does not produce any results, do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am 31, and have dark circles and fine lines. I bought this more or less just to see any improvement. I&#x27;ve used a lot of really expensive eye creams and gels and the only ones that worked were so far out of my price range it wasn&#x27;t even funny. then my mom calls me to tell me she found the eye gel of life!.... so with the low price point I decided what the heck ill try it.... WOW, ok I love this stuff. my circles are fading. not being covered but fading. its not instant but its only been a few weeks and I can see the difference. also the fine lines are so much finer. this works so well under makeup, im having a lot less problems with creasing under eye makeup. all I gotta say is this is it, THE LAST EYE GEL, ill ever buy. this is holy grail status for under eyes. its affordable, it works, it feels amazing and I love it. I&#x27;ve been trying a lot more from instanatural and I gotta say they do not disappoint. this brand is truly amazing. and thankfully it doesn&#x27;t have all the nasty chemicals (that break me out) best skin care! best value! best brand!</li>
            <li> A great product!  Applies smoothly with a cool feeling and a fresh scent and tightens up the eye area.  Also helps concealer apply more evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> I am pretty satisfied w/ the eye cream. My  main issue is dark eye circles and the product is helping tons! My eyes are looking way less tired than before. I will continue to use for sure another thumbs up is for the customer service that is great, not only they shipped very fast but they also check back on you for your feedback! Great service! Thanks a lot!! :))</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it - he has seen major improvements in over 2 - 3 weeks with daily use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving all the the products in this line a try... So far I am extremely happy.... It&#x27;s the same quality product as $150 bottle items for a tenth of the price... I will continue too purchase</li>
            <li> Have to say the eye cream works great. Wrinkles are disappearing and I&#x27;ve used it only 3 weeks. Thanks InstaNatural</li>
            <li> I love this gel! It is very soothing and it truly softens and smooths the skin around your eyes. I use it in the morning and at night and I can see the difference. It is worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now and I can tell that there is a significant change. I&#x27;ve been using this for the puffiness under my eyes and it&#x27;s almost gone, also I have dark circles in around my eyes, and they have diminished too, the instructions on the product say that you probably need to wait until the second month to notice any changes but I can tell a notorious difference right now and it&#x27;s not even a month, which I think it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> It just felt to tacky for me, I don&#x27;t wear makeup but I do apply a moisturizer to my face every morning after getting out of the shower, I was disappointed with how sticky if felt on my face so I guess that I really didn&#x27;t give it a chance as far as results go. And buy sticky, I mean like after a hour or more after I applied it.</li>
            <li> It did not showed any little signs of getting rid of my eye bags and I used for 2 weeks. I think it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> We will see how it works over time.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has worked on my eye puffiness and dark circles and I&#x27;ve tried MANY! I&#x27;m ordering my second bottle today. I use it every morning and my first bottle has lasted 7 months. I can truly see a difference every time I use it. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great customer service for sure! and very generous amount of product for the price. Seems to be a good product and they do not do animal testing or use animal ingredients in this product which is very important to me. This product seems to tighten the eye area and make it look refreshed. I have genetic bags under my eyes that only surgery will fix so this does not fix those, but nothing will (except surgery).</li>
            <li> Wow exactly as advertised.  Five Star Seller.  Thank You...</li>
            <li> I tried the Eye Gel and after only one week I could see that my eye area is more firm and plump. Bye bye dark circles and wrinkles!</li>
            <li> Has a very pleasant smell and is very cooling on the skin. I&#x27;ve only had it a few days, but your skin feels very refreshed and hydrated after applying it. Will update with results soon.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eye cream! Aside from this being a great product to add into your skincare routine, this is also a wonderful treat for your skin! Kinda like a spa treatment for your eye area!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefits that this cream gives is fantastic. It makes my puffy, tired looking eye area and makes me look like I am wide awake after a wonderful nights sleep. To apply, I use this in the morning right after I shower. I find that if I put it on, and give it a bit of time to work before applying my makeup and heading out for work, it gives much better results. After I put it on, I just go about my morning routine, having breakfast, getting ready, etc. By the time I am done with all that, it has had time to settle into my skin, and start doing its thing. Puffiness is gone, and the bags under my eyes are not as noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is a gel formula, kinda translucent in color. When you apply, it has a tiny bit of a cooling feeling, but nothing too weird or crazy. The smell is fairly light, with a hint of cucumber scent. Not greasy at all. Goes on easily and leaves the area feeling soft. A very generous sized bottle compared to other products on the market with similar ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great eye cream, definitely on my list of recommendations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that i came across this. I have been applying one pump in the morning after the shower, and one pump in the evening before bed. It has a pleasant smell, like a mild cucumber. I like that it is all natural ingredients, and they offer a 100% money back guarantee. This has got rid of my dark circles, as well as the puffiness! So pleased with the results. Makes you look refreshed and rested, even if your not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.  Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial.</li>
            <li> To my surprise all of the buyers have purchased almost the same items. How come? I was thrilled to purchase the item but not before checking out the buying history of the buyers. And they are truly impressive. Take a look!</li>
            <li> First off you get so much product in this tube and a little definitely goes a long well. I&#x27;ve been obsessed with the natural formulate and how totally easy and sanitary the packaging is. Unlike traditional eye creams this comes in a weightless gel consistency. Easily absorbed even near your delicate eye area! I&#x27;m still testing its results but I have noticed significant reduction is puffiness, skin feels smoother and more firm around the sockets. I bring this all around my eye area and its definitely cooling yet not sticky or clumpy in the slightest! Can&#x27;t wait to see what it can do for my discoloration but I think that will take a little more time!</li>
            <li> Another great product from InstaNatural. Their eye gel has definitely made my eyes look more youthful and brighter. I did how ever, knock off one star because I expected to see more improvement in my skin texture underneath my eyes. However I believe if, I continue using it religiously it&#x27;ll get there. InstaNatural definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year.  I don&#x27;t see much difference in my laugh lines but it really gets the puffiness out.i especially like the cool gel feel..</li>
            <li> Its helping but not as i expected</li>
            <li> It is a nice product.  Hard to compare to other brands, but have been pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> not really seeing a big difference</li>
            <li> I really like the consistency of this product and noticed the dark circles really evaporating!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Not really impressed with the consistency. It&#x27;s very gel. Makes your eye lids sticky until it drys. I do believe it has help some wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff. I alternate it with the eye serum from InstaNatural and they have worked together to tighten and yet soften the skin around my eyes. Yay!!</li>
            <li> Very very impressed. After applying I noticed eyes lifted and it seemed like collagen was injected into my wrinkles. This really plumps up your skin and gives it a firm lifted appearance. I recommend applying it all over the face. Not just for eyes. I plan on buying more!!!</li>
            <li> This eye gel is fabulous!  I have only used it for a couple weeks but, I noticed a difference right away!  It tightens around my eyes taking away most of the puffiness, and visibly reduces the dark circles  under my eyes.  I don&#x27;t need to use as much concealer now.  Love it, recommended it to my daughter, who just puchased some.&lt;br /&gt;I bought and paid for this product, not sponsored</li>
            <li> I love it. Dark circles are disappearing! Thank you.</li>
            <li> Goodbye my extra baggage of eye bags! This cream is a miracle worker and I am loving it. It&#x27;s only been  a few weeks and the results are quite visible. My co-workers ask me what ritual I performed to make my eyes look brighter and I just shrug them off and tell them to use this cream. (Hey! This is a free advertisement!)</li>
            <li> These guys make great products!!</li>
            <li> UPDATE 7/1/16: I&#x27;ve been wanting to post this...but, I noticed that my eyelashes have grown longer and thicker. When I re-read the ingredient, Lo &amp; Behold, one of the first few ingredients is Organic Aloe! That&#x27;s why.  I love my lashes.  I&#x27;ve bought 3 eye creams and facial creams so far and I will continue to use their products.  5/24/15: My skin has never been better. I have a ceiling fan in my room which makes my skin dry overnight. But, this eye cream has prevented the dryness and I wake-up refreshed and with supple skin; less puffiness, less droopy lids. I hope InstaNatural will keep making this cream because I am a fan for life. Same goes for their night cream and their Vitamin C moisturizer. 5 star is warranted (all three products).  Original review: I&#x27;ve only used this a few time because I only received it.  BUT, I can honestly say that my skin has never looked better at 51!!! I am a beauty cream junkie! Always looking for the so called &amp;#34;best cream ever.&amp;#34; I ordered their face mask which I love, so I decided to explore their other products. Lo and behold, their creams and serums have the highest stars on Amazon, so of course I decided to try. Well, well, well....I&#x27;m glad I did.  The price is justified for the amount of product you get. So, I will continue to use their products and I am confident that I will be very pleased with the long term results.  I will post a follow-up review after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Great eye gel for dark circles and wrinkles. Start your anti aging process now</li>
            <li> I came across this eye gel while looking for a new eye cream. Wow. Best decision in a long time! I really like the product itself. Goes on so smooth and smells very faintly of cucumber. I personally have many issues with scent and this one doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Probably because it&#x27;s a natural scent as opposed to man-made. I have those dreaded eye bags/dark circles that make you appear 10 years older than you really are. Plus, the purplish inner eye color that is caused by allergies. I&#x27;ve been using this for 10 weeks (I just looked that up!) along with the Youth Express Eye Serum, twice daily. At first I just liked the way it moisturized. I could feel it tightening the bags under my eyes immediately. I took some pics on my cell at 2 weeks intervals (more or less) and transferred them to the computer so I could magnify and look at them side by side. There is a definite difference, especially between 4 or 5 weeks ago and maybe two weeks ago ( I took the pictures without makeup on). I can see the wrinkles are softer and seem to be filling in somehow. My dark circles are not nearly as dark as they were, and I surely am not getting any more sleep than usual. My bags are not gone by any means (they are displaced fat-nothing short of surgery can take them away, alas), but the are not nearly as noticeable. I can&#x27;t even explain it, I just know my entire eye area has undergone a transformation of some kind! I imagine the most important thing I can say is this; I was in the ladies room at work the other day, and as I walked by the mirror, I actually did a double-take. I see my face every day, obviously, but I finally actually noticed the difference this product is making. I honestly cannot say enough good things about this eye gel. Try it, and make sure you give it a chance. The company does state on their website that most customers notice a real improvement after 2 months or so. I certainly did.  One more thing. As I had said, I&#x27;ve been using this twice daily for 10 weeks, and not just on my eyes. I use it on those lines that run from your nose to your mouth, and also on a couple of wrinkle on my forehead and especially on my neck. Pretty much I use it wherever I need to, twice a day. And, I am still on my first jar. So it does last a long time as you use so little. Hope this long review helps., and not just on my eyes.

            <li> The puffs under the eyes has also becomes normal so I recommend this gel.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this to lighten under my eyes but when I realized the reviews for lighting under the eyes were fake. I decided to still use it on my face in the areas they recommend. It brightened my face, looks healthier. Ive been getting alot of compliments from family telling me how pretty I got and my mom&#x27;s trying to figure out what I use. I&#x27;ve always had people think I&#x27;m younger than my age but since this product alot more people question my age. I can&#x27;t even work without every 8th person asking me why I&#x27;m not in class and questioning if I&#x27;m old enough to sell cigarettes. I got it before but not as much as I do now. So I like it.</li>
            <li> Would buy this again.  So far, I really like it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month.</li>
            <li> Inferior to professional grade creams. The skin indeed becomes more smooth, but this cream doesn&#x27;t treat frim lines and wrinkes as the other more expensive products to (i&#x27;m very satisfied with clarins eye balm). If you just want to keep your skin moisturized and smooth - this product is okay, but if you want something more, go get a more expensive cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using InstaNatural&#x27;s Youth Express Eye Gel and do like it.  Although I do not see any difference with fine lines and wrinkles just yet, I do like the gel and use it daily.  The gel is cooling and seems to smooth out my face temporarily so that my makeup goes on easily. I received an email from the company inquiring about my experience with their product. I mentioned that I did not see any diminishing of fine lines and wrinkles, and was told that it usually takes about 2 months to see a difference.  I have to say, they have super customer service, and offered to send me an additional bottle at no charge. I really appreciate their willingness to go the extra mile, which is not common these days.  Super company with great customer support..</li>
            <li> Applied everyday as directed, noticed no signs of improvement, felt my face a little more moist that&#x27;s about it</li>
            <li> I love this Eye Gell. It goes to work immediately!  A little goes a long way. I keep it in the refrigerator to give it a cooling effect!  Works great!</li>
            <li> This product at 1.7 oz first ingredient is &amp;#34;D&amp;#34; (abbrev.)  OZ Naturals eye gel at .5 oz has no water in the ingredients which would indicated a more potent product considering the exchange in very similar ingredients.  We chose OZ naturals because  the &amp;#34;listed&amp;#34; water in any product changes the molecular structure of a product.</li>
            <li> Love it no more dark circles!!#</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Easy to use and I could see results within the first 4 to 7 days.  This is a company that offers excellent customer service.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This product is fine and gentle on sensitive skin under eyes, forehead  as well as the entire face. It works well to vitalize the skin and reduce wrinkles. I find it much more effective, finer and preferable to more expensive brands. Therefore, I would recommend it without any reservation.</li>
            <li> It helps to reduce the puffiness slightly, but I&#x27;ve yet to see any change in my dark circle.</li>
            <li> great!  other eye cream tingle in my eye,  this one never.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product is doing anything, but it feels so good. It&#x27;s like the skin around your eyes is drinking a big glass of water (if that makes any sense).</li>
            <li> So far, I like how this feels on my baggy eyes. It is soothing and cool feeling. That&#x27;s a good thing. I will report later to see how much more beautiful it makes me. Keep your fingers crossed for great improvement. I will keep Amazon informed. Adding to my review, I like how this cream feels and have been using it for several days. I think I am noticing a difference in my baggy eyes. I will keep on using it and report again.</li>
            <li> The eye gel has minimized the fine lines around my eyes and around my lips enough that I now don&#x27;t feel the need for fillers, at least at this time. I am 54 and I have been using it about 3 weeks along with the vitamin C serum. I am going to start having my husband try it to see how it works for him.</li>
            <li> I have noticed the dark circles did get lighter under my eyes from this gel. It hasn&#x27;t helped the puffiness as much. I do find it easy to use, non irritating, and works well with cover up makeup.</li>
            <li> Not work for me i try and nothing happen</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my eyes. It left my skin under my eyes sticky, it does nothing to my wrinkles. I will not buy this product anymore.</li>
            <li> I received this along with the InstaNatural Eye Serum for Dark Circles.  I&#x27;ve received and reviewed a few facial skin care products lately that I really liked.  However, these two are specially designed for under eye.  I don&#x27;t have huge dark spots, but as I&#x27;ve aged it&#x27;s become more apparent that there is some discoloration and sagging.  I tested both out for 3 days and saw a difference.  Under my eyes seemed tighter and brighter.  I also have this nagging dermatitis spotted lightly around my eyes and I&#x27;ve tried everything to get rid of it.  This actually has helped it diminish and it&#x27;s almost gone.  Another thing I was impressed with was the packaging.  I review products here and there and mostly they come intact but just bubble wrapped.  These two came in packages similar to the store and was very professional.  The cream itself was thick and not runny like some of the other facial creams that I&#x27;ve used.  All in all, this is a great product and as all my skin issues get under control after a few weeks of constant usage, I&#x27;ll post some pictures.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I hear great things!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that it worked well my skin appears healthier &amp; quite a short time! Excellent product I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> The product is not unpleasant to apply, and it does not seem to have had ill effects. But it doesn&#x27;t seem to have had any good effects, either--that is, to actually reduce puffiness, wrinkles, or whatever. Basically it&#x27;s just sort of nice to put some soothing stuff on your face a couple of times a day. Would be great if there were an actual point, though.</li>
            <li> Went through one bottle, didn&#x27;t do anything for my eyes. Still look tired</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before, and I guess just got used to using in my daily and nightly rituals. I had my doubts it was helping any, but I figured with all the great reivews, it MUST be doing something, right?  However the second time I bought the product, and started using it, it caused burning, itching, flakey skin and my eyes are VERY puffy and irritated. It has now cost me the money for the product AND a trip to the doctor! Would NOT recommend!</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom because I&#x27;m the scientist in the family. I should&#x27;ve done better at looking at at reviews instead of the ingredients (which aren&#x27;t fantastic anyway but for the price it&#x27;s ok). It appears that a lot of eye creams on Amazon are getting reviews by giving away the product for free. My mom hasn&#x27;t noticed any changes in her dark circles after three months of continual use. I continue top search the market for a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; eye cream for a sustainable price.</li>
            <li> No results yet, but are still trying...</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my fiancé based on the reviews, but unfortunately it&#x27;s not what presented here at all!&lt;br /&gt;We wait almost 6 months with continuous usage to see an effect and we ended up with nothing... So disappointing</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eye cream.  It seems to make  a huge difference rather quickly.  I noticed less wrinkles within days.  I am not sure if it makes them go away or if after applying it they don&#x27;t appear as much, but all I care about is they aren&#x27;t showing on my face!  I highly recommend this and wish I would have found it years ago. Definitely stands up to its claim.</li>
            <li> I read so many reviews on many different kinds of products for under the eyes -- and this one was the best!  Customer reviews are most valuable when searching for a product or item.  I have noticed that I am getting dark circles under my eyes along with some loose skin (bags).  I bought this pump of InstaNatural eye cream and used it as instructed -- in the morning and before bed time. I love how the cream sinks right into your eye tissue under and over the eye. It feels so good and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;After one month of usage, I have noticed a lighter color under my eyes and they seem brighter!!  The manufacturer recommends using the product for two months to get full value!!  Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Such a simple and effective product!  You receive a generous amount of product, giving you optimal results before you need to buy more. And, the price is right!</li>
            <li> Have it two stars instead of one because I love the company and there other products. I was disappointed in the eye cream and wanted to love it. But my eyes were sticking together and it felt wet for good amount of time after it is put on.  It was not a nice feeling while trying to get ready.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. I started noticing results within a week. I was tired of having super defined dark circles &amp; this was the solution. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite facial care product. I&#x27;ve already reordered it before using up the first bottle I got about a month ago. I highly recommend it for people who do not want facial products with a chemical smell nor a lot of additives. Top quality.</li>
            <li> I love this cream before I used different brand but this really work I am going to order second bottle thanks I recommend</li>
            <li> I could see a difference in the bags under my eyes right away after I first used this product. I can&#x27;t wait to see how much better I can look over time.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product. I use it regularly at night. It has a great texture, so my face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy where I put it. I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t cause any issues for me at all.</li>
            <li> This is a nice light eye gel that I am loving! I have also tried the eye serum by the same company.  For my issues (fine lines and wrinkles) this product is far superior (the serum is great for dark circles however)  It is clear, cool and absorbs quickly.  I love that it is full of natural ingredients.  I think my eyes look far better than when I first used this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product and have already noticed a difference in just a week. I also use their stretch mark cream and have been very impressed with that as well. I would recommend!</li>
            <li> i just start useing it n feel great,, thnx</li>
            <li> This did nothing for me...  I tried it for weeks and saw no change.</li>
            <li> Im not sure about this product.  I had extremely high expectations when I purchased and even though I cannot say my dark circles arent lighter I feel they should be lighter than they are considering I have been using this product for about 2 months now. Im going to continue using until the product is done since it wont hurt, maybe then ill see more significant results. It does have a little burning sensation once I put it on as well as a nice cooling effect which I enjoy.  The scent is nice too.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product actually works. I use as directed and really don&#x27;t see a difference. Although, I do notice an increased amount of whiteheads around my eyes since using, as if it clogs the skin around the eye.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product a little over a week but the results have been good.  The eye gel feels good on and has a tightening effect on the eyes, forehead and cheekbones.  I will continue to purchase this product and appreciate the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Bought this to get rid of dark circles under my eyes. After a couple months of use, I really haven&#x27;t seen any change. I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles around the eyes, so I can&#x27;t comment on the anti-wrinkle effectiveness.</li>
            <li> This eye cream works very well! In addition to making my eyes look less puffy, I use it on other parts of my face sometimes, too. The cooling effect of the gel is also very calming.&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to mention, customer service is definitely great. 5++ stars to this company; they truly care about each consumer&#x27;s opinion. With that in mind, what&#x27;s to lose?</li>
            <li> Love it. It works fine and I have seen a difference.</li>
            <li> Love this eye gel. Soothing, non-irritating and definitely helps with puffiness. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I really love this product it is so easy to use and I also loved the way its packaged the pump bottle is very easy to control the amount you want to use. This is a gel like cream that really absorbs well . This product has so many great anti aging ingredients in it that I confess I use it on my whole face . For the Price you are not going to be able to find one that&#x27;s got as much going for it as this one has. That being said you also get the assurance that its really good for your skin and not invasive. it is 75% organic, its not harsh but its still effective . InstaNatural makes really wonderful products for all kinds of skin and hair care. This company really cares for its customers buy providing them with effective yet more natural products for safe use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a look at the wonderful ingredients in this product and compare them to others you will see that this eye cream has so much going for it  . shipping is fast and its packaged up really well .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with a free sample of this eye cream so I could make an informed review but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li> I love how this gel feels when you put it on. It is not greasy or heavy and it soaks into your skin very easily. It de-puffs my under eyes soon after applying it. It is also undoing some wrinkles under my eyes. I will continue to use this and see what the future brings. I am confident that I will continue to see improvement.</li>
            <li> Amazing results. I&#x27;ve been using it consistently around my eyes for 5 weeks and have experienced a visible improvement. So much so that I&#x27;ve decided to apply it to my entire face. Wow!! Great result for an amazing price. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love the brand but this gel is only ok. I stays sticky throughout the night. Doesn&#x27;t absorb as I would prefer.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel is pretty refreshing. It smells of cucumber which helped me perk and wake up instantly. I like how it feels like I was just at the spa: renewed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a mom so being tired is just part of life right now. I get things done usually after the kids go to bed so I usually end up staying up too late. I have resolved to drinking coffee with lots of creamer in order to keep up with my kiddos who are ready to go as soon as they wake up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The InstaNatural helped along with the coffee to make me feel more awake and ready to go right away with my kids too! There is just something about the gel that really is refreshing and helps give me that extra something that I need!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did the Insta Natural help with the dark circles? Well, I have those eyes that always have dark circles under them. It is just part of me and has been for as long as I can remember. The InstaNatural helped a little with the dark circles, but they didn&#x27;t go away completely. I was kinda hoping for a miracle, but like I said I have those eyes that no matter how well rested or whatever, I still have dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did feel it helped with the appearance of my skin. I felt a little more youthful after I got completely ready with my make up and everything. Overall I am happy with InstaNatural and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband and he seems to like it.</li>
            <li> This is the second product from InstaNatural I was provided to review and the second one that gets a five star rating from me.  I love the fact that it is not tested on animals and has 75% organic ingredients.  I love the way it works on my skin.  I even love the container because it is so easy to dispense the gel when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid serum is my favorite serum for my face since it works well in softening my skin, erasing fine lines, and providing an excellent base for my make-up.  This product contains the hyaluronic acid as well as other ingredients that work together to increase skin elasticity while toning down dark circles and puffiness around the eyes.  The reason I would call it near perfection is that while it helps with my dark circles, nothing I have found totally eliminates them.  I was told by an allergist years ago that my dark circles are “allergic shiners” so I’m not sure they can ever be completely eliminated.  Only two products I have ever used minimized the darkness and this one costs 1/5 what the other one costs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like nor dislike the smell.  It is very faint and does smell a bit like a cucumber.  The gel itself goes on smoothly and only requires a small squirt to cover under my eyes.  I have also tried the gel on my entire face and that only requires a slightly larger squirt.  The product goes far.  As with many serums, this one does need a few minutes to be fully absorbed and will feel sticky if you don’t wait long enough to put on your makeup after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice a precaution on the label - “Product contains tree nuts.”  My allergies do not include tree nuts, but if you have those allergies, I would not recommend this serum.  Otherwise, I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is working very well for me.  The texture of the gel is soothing and easy to apply.  It has reduced some puffiness under my eyes due to allergies.  I recommend this for someone who has dark circles under their eyes or just puffiness in general due to allergies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just about finished with the first month, and I do detect a subtle improvement.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in the next few weeks.  Otherwise, I&#x27;ve been using the cream/gel on my entire face and it feels great.  So cool and hydrating without being heavy or greasy.  I&#x27;m anticipating very good results.</li>
            <li> I love how refreshing the Insta Natural Youth Express Eye Gel is. While I am not a fan of the smell (cucumbers) it leaves me refreshed the only other downfall I had was it left a sticky feeling behind until it was dry then it went away! I will be using this for a good while. I am glad I was able to get to try this product out! Super fast shipping as well as amazing customer service. Hands down a very good product.

            <li> Sometimes, I wake up to puffy eyes. It&#x27;s not often but hey, who would like to wake up to puffy eyes right? So I tried the InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel around my eyes before I sleep and for a week now (I&#x27;ve been using it every night for a week now), I noticed that I haven&#x27;t woken up with puffy eyes yet. The consistency of the InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel is a bit thick and pasty but I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy around the eyes. It absorbs very quickly and has this light and subtle fresh/cucumber scent. I also like that I didn&#x27;t get any breakouts while using the eye gel. I like how it&#x27;s effective against my morning eye puffiness. I can&#x27;t comment if it&#x27;s effective for dark circles and sagging skin because luckily, I don&#x27;t have dark circles or sagging skin yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample to try and review. All opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> The “Under Eye Treatment Gel for Dark Circles, Puffy Eyes &amp; Sagging Skin” by “InstaNatural” works great! I have the pleasure of being a victim of dark circles, so i was excited to try this product out. First impressions -- Terrific smell..like cucumbers. Very refreshing and cooling. You actually need very little product to cover the eye area. The gel is thick and goes smoothly with ease absorbing quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the dark circles lighten and the skin looked brighter and felt tighter instantly. I am impressed and would recommend this product to anyone looking to enhance their skins look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> this product is very watery and absorbs quickly, with no unpleasant perfume smell, however, is not particularly effective. After reading the reviews on Amazon, I was eager to try this magnificent product at a great price!  Do not expect it to perform to the level of the reviews previously written. It is very inexpensive and you get what you pay for. I would invest a little more money and get something that works, and don&#x27;t waste your time (or money) on this product.</li>
            <li> Takes a little bit of time but using it as directed dark circles are lighter.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is very refreshing when applied. It absorbs quick and leaves a soft feel to my eyelids. It isn&#x27;t sticky and no funky odor. Skin feels good and a bit smoother. Insta Natural definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great eye gel, so soothing.</li>
            <li> Results not as claimed</li>
            <li> After receiving this product for review my first thought was to give it a true hard test, my poor husband who works on average 70+ hrs a week and suffers from insomnia and at 47 years of age is starting to look much older do to a life of hard work outside. After a few days we did notice a slight improvement in the color under his eyes but minimal to no improvement in the puffiness, however I do want to point out that for him it is quite sever so not really surprised on that. I do feel though that with continued use we may see results. The color and tone of the under eye area and the intensity of the fine lines around his eyes have improved however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as far as the results I have seen in the appearance in my own face I am very pleased. Stress lack of sleep and health have caused the dark circles under my eyes to become even more noticeable over the last few months and as a result I have started to look much older and sickly/tiered then I am. As a women my appearance when I look in the mirror affects my mood for this as well as many other reasons I was eager to try this product and I am glad I did. There were no first day results to mention however after just two or three days of using this product I did see very noticeable results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Puffiness: almost completely eliminated&lt;br /&gt;color: improved, retuned almost to normal&lt;br /&gt;tone: evened out with the rest of my face&lt;br /&gt;Brightness: look rested and awake&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to mention that you need very little product and the gel is a nice thick formula that applies evenly and smoothly, this product also absorbs quickly. However I do suggest being carful if you apply to both under eye and lid that you do not get the gel in the eye it will cause some irritation. nothing to much as to make you hesitant to use this product again just enough to let you know you got it &amp;#34;IN&amp;#34; your eye and to be more careful.&lt;br /&gt;the packaging is very nice it is a small pump bottle that can be easily tossed into an over night bag and taken along on trips or placed neatly in you vanity or bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> No effect after month use</li>
            <li> Let me introduce you to the InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel. This product is a natural 75% organic gel formula that claims to provide &#x27;absolute care to the eye area&#x27; and combats dark dark circles, puffiness,  and sagging skin. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But does it really do all of those things? While I can&#x27;t attest to the sagging skin claim, It does work wonders on the dark circles and puffy eyes. I applied,  dabbing and patting it, around my days twice daily. The gel consistency is nice and doesn&#x27;t require a large about of product to get the job done. It also has a lovely mild cucumber scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a drastically large change in the puffiness.  The cool feeling on application is wonderful and kicks those tired looking eyes in the behind! And while I can&#x27;t say it really got rid of the dark circles, it did seem to brighten up my eye area and make them a bit less noticible and much more refreshed looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The absolute only complaint I have is that it does tend to leave a bit of a sticky feeling until it completly dries (i just used less product to combat that issue. Don&#x27;t put a giant glob on your face!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give this an 8/10. I&#x27;m not sure if I recommend this to anyone seeking products for advanced signs of aging,  but if your like me in the early stages I say this is a great product to keep you looking fresh and vibrant!!</li>
            <li> This eye cream is the best ever. I am 70 years young and tried more creams than I can count. I ran out so did my usual mo and bought a high in eye cream yikes the puffy under eye problem came back. Now on my second order and will stay faithful to this amazing eye gel.</li>
            <li> I really liked the consistency of this gel. It wasn&#x27;t too runny or lotiony but went on very easy and felt rather cool on the skin. I do suffer from dark circles and I&#x27;m always trying to prevent them or cover them up (what mom isn&#x27;t?!). Thankfully I found a good cover-up but in all honestly, I&#x27;d just rather not have them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this first thing in the morning, under all my makeup. I was a little worried it might make my eye makeup look cakey, but thankfully it didn&#x27;t. I honestly didn&#x27;t see a ton of difference from it other than my dark circles really were pretty much gone. I&#x27;m interested to see what this would do if I my eyes were puffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that this is 100% natural, but the 75% organic kind of threw me. You either ARE organic, or AREN&#x27;T. It makes me really curious what ingredient in it wasn&#x27;t organic... and why!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the formula, my sensitive eyes didn&#x27;t even seem to notice I had it on. To me, this was a rather fun product. I like trying stuff like this. I&#x27;m going to continue wearing this for at least the next to see if I see any big, noticeable changes. If I don&#x27;t, I might just pass this onto my mom. She&#x27;s game for trying stuff like this too!</li>
            <li> First of all, this is a real review. I bought this product with my own money at full price. I have severe dark circles as a result of hereditary pigment and lifelong sinus/allergy problems. I am always looking for something to help, but really don&#x27;t hold out much hope. This eye gel has visibly reduced the circles slightly, for which I would give it a 2 1/2-3/5. HOWEVER...I have problem skin which is acne prone, but also very sensitive. So when I treat the acne, my face can suddenly become a dry, red scaly mess at random. I read that this was non-comedogenic and can be used on the whole face so I tried it. WOW did it really help heal my skin...the tone is much more smooth and even. No over-drying or break outs. For this use I would give it 5/5 stars, which is why I averaged these and gave it a 4/5 overall.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product consistently now for about 3 weeks.  I cannot tell any difference with the the dark circles yet, but I&#x27;m still hoping...stings a little too.</li>
            <li> Great! I have a big problem with natural dark circles no matter how I sleep or what I use. Three days of usin it and I can already see a big difference! I love this</li>
            <li> I have a delicate, Scandinavian type skin.  I work many hours and often don&#x27;t sleep well.  I get under eye bags that can be quite embarrassing. I tried a couple of moisturizers but was left feeling hopeless about my eyes.  After reading some of the great reviews for this product I decided to order it.  BOY IM SURE GLAD I DID!  In only a few uses I saw a noticeable improvement under my eyes.  I feel much more confident... prettier...and my eyes feel more relaxed.  I will definitely be using this for a long time to come.  Also, I just started using it all over my face as I read others do.  Looking forward to the results.  This is my first review ever, as I just love this product and HAD to share!</li>
            <li> I love,love,love it. Instant results</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. My eyes look a hundred times better when I wake up in the morning&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I purchased this eye gel three weeks ago and am very pleased with this product.  I have dark circles under my eyes as I suffer from insomnia.  I am always skeptical of &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product solutions as I have tried so many and been very disappointed.  I have been using this gel twice a day with the InstaNatural Vitamin B3 Niacinamide moisturizer.  While my dark circles haven&#x27;t totally disappeared, they are less visible and my whole face radiates a softer and more even complexion.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup over this product but I do apply BB cream over it and that works very well.  As I mentioned I have only been using these products for three weeks, and it is recommended that you use them for two months before you see complete results.  I am confident that in another month I will be even more satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> My review of just 3 stars might not be fair as I only used it a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I can say that I was a little worried it might be like glue because when it dried on the applicator, it was like glue.  However, it really doesn&#x27;t seem to be like glue under the eyes.  I wanted it for the bag or owl circles I have.  I didn&#x27;t notice a difference right away and in the meantime I had purchased an under the eye cream for fine lines.  I&#x27;ve been using that instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mfg did send a little inquiry to see how I liked it and said to keep trying it as it eventually would work.  But I haven&#x27;t done that yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update after I have finally used it for some time and given it a chance.</li>
            <li> Not impressed should have stuck with my normal eye cream teamine. Very disappointed waste of money.</li>
            <li> very good until now dark circles becoming less but still not gone but it is better</li>
            <li> I broke my own rule when I bought this product. Typically, I will never buy something with &#x27;The BEST&#x27; in the title or description because I know it&#x27;s being hyped and that is fully true of this product.&lt;br /&gt;The container is high quality, the label, instructions and ingredients are easy to read. The product is a lightweight gel that has just the very faintest hint of cucumber scent; nothing strong or irritating. The gel goes on well, it is light and easy to apply and spread. My main issue is that it just didn&#x27;t appear to do anything for my wrinkles or dryness around my eyes. I believe part of the reason it was not effective is due to the very light consistency of the gel; it&#x27;s just not substantial enough to do much.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you do get a lot of product and shipping was free, but I&#x27;ve had much better results from drugstore brands than with this. Don&#x27;t fall for the gimmicky name and hype. It&#x27;s just a plain, lightweight gel, not a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> Very cooling and moisturizing and the eyes look much better after applying it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change or improvement since using it for the last two months. Sometimes it makes white flakes around my eyes. I was much happier with Khiels recovery eye.</li>
            <li> Love it! seen noticeable results in less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s the only product I have bought that actually works!</li>
            <li> Used for 2 months as directed. No change at all.  All those 5 star reviews I read I think are fake.</li>
            <li> I  have that look. People sometimes asking me if I am tired. Call it genetics,  but I get enough sleep. I purchased this based on reviews. I don&#x27;t know if it is just  coincidence, but since using this for about two months, and consuming more water.  I have had not had any of the  &amp;#34;you look tired&amp;#34; comments.  I believe it takes a few applications to &amp;#34;kick in&amp;#34;. The bottle does seem a little small, but the amount that&#x27;s used even on daily is basis is very minimal so you actually get your dollars worth. Would I buy it again? I think I would...</li>
            <li> Going to try a different product   update:  great customer service after my initial review.  My under eye issues are hereditary, and I am looking more towards a derma filler now.</li>
            <li> More a gel than a cream, it&#x27;s very soothing and I use it in the morning under moisturizer - i really like it!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Works great on them fine lines and I have no under eye bags. Smells great and makes my face soft.  I also use it on my neck too. Definitely will buy this again!</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product and the seller.&lt;br /&gt;The eye gel has a nice consistency and you can feel mild tightening after applying. It really does help your skin look less tired and more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;Customer Service went above and beyond when there was a problem with my order. I honestly never expected them to accommodate me the way that they did. I would definitely purchase from them again and highly recommend both the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this product is so well reviewed. I don&#x27;t have lines or dark circles to worry about (yet), just a bit of morning puffiness to counteract. I tried this product right out of the shipping box and, aside from the nice cucumber scent, wasn&#x27;t thrilled. Even after chilling it in the fridge I&#x27;m not seeing any results in the mornings. More importantly, I&#x27;m not FEELING any results. A good eye gel will wake you up a bit and feel refreshing. All this does is leave a sticky residue all over my eyes which I feel compelled to wash off after a while because it&#x27;s so irritating. I have a feeling this is a $3.00 product being marketed as something more and will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my eyes!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product! Suffering from dark circles under my eyes at times, I was super excited to put this product to the test.  I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- drastically helped my dark circles&lt;br /&gt;- smells almost like cucumber to me (I don&#x27;t know why some people complained! It smells good to me).&lt;br /&gt;- a little bit goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;- 75% organic (that is awesome! Always looking for more natural products!)&lt;br /&gt;- Pricing is great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;- My eye lid puffed up a bit but only after one use not the others. I think it may have had something to do with my makeup remover not mixing with this product.&lt;br /&gt;- I don&#x27;t like not being able to see how much is left. Maybe add a thin clear spot on the container so customers can see what is remaining.</li>
            <li> I liked this product.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Started using the cream for 3 weeks I have not noted much different As far as wrinkle/ lifting go. How ever skin texture feel softer. I may continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have hereditary dark circles though I&#x27;m only in my early twenties... this cream has proven to greatly improve the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes caused from under/over sleep and diet though!  Highly recommend this product because it&#x27;s more natural than the other options and very effective.  I use this day and night with no irritation whatsoever!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and spreads easily, but not moisturizing enough for my skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference and this stuff cakes up near the corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li> So texted my wife today. My wife was VERY skeptical, so 4-Stars from her is like 10-Stars from someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 4 weeks of use, Mrs Bassocantor reports that yes, this product does indeed &amp;#34;seem to be doing something&amp;#34; -- something GOOD that is. The puffiness under her eyes is slightly reduced, which makes her look younger--with more vitality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was skeptical, but I knew it would work all along. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Feels good under the eyes but doesnt deliver the expectations. Didnt help with dark circles or fine lines .</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the results using this gel. As stated on the package it can be used all over your face which I often do before applying makeup. I did see a difference in reduced puffiness and and fine wrinkles around my eyes. I would recommend it too because it&#x27;s not a heavy cream which I don&#x27;t like using, especially during the sticky summer months. This gel is light and absorbs right away.</li>
            <li> How do you compare the hundreds of skin care products? I&#x27;m a regular tester, so I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these help you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance (does it smell good? Are there artificial fragrances?): Very slight, fresh cucumber-like scent. Cucumber hydrosol and aloe are two of the main base ingredients. No added fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: Slippery and wet. Feels fresh and cooling, spreads well. One pump is enough for the whole face, not just eyes.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption (Soft? Oily? Sticky? Moist? Tight?): Very slightly tight, very slightly sticky (often the case with moisturizing ingredients like hyaluronic acid and glycerin), so would make a good mineral makeup primer if you put your makeup on just before it finishes absorbing.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: It doesn’t add oil or dry the skin. Should be neutral as to skin type. Doesn’t irritate my very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* Very slight brightening of skin (fresher look) and reduction in fine wrinkles. Cosmetic effect is mild.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* With Matryxl 3000, hyaluronic acid, peptides, herbal extracts, and amino acids, this has a number of very effective active ingredients. Plant stem cells, another main ingredient, don’t have much to show for themselves besides hype, but the others are good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notes: The 1.7 ounce bottle is large and the gel spreads well. This is an excellent value, and I would suggest using it on your entire face, not just the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.eads well.

            <li> The Youth Express Gel is a perfect preparation for under the&lt;br /&gt;eyes and the forehead The light cream smells like a sweet&lt;br /&gt;cucumber. The preparation is enriched with plant stem cells,&lt;br /&gt;organic aloe, hyaluronic acid, vitamin E and jojoba oil to help&lt;br /&gt;with sagging skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are to dab around the cheek, eye and forehead&lt;br /&gt;once in the morning and at night. The preparation can be used as&lt;br /&gt;a face treatment and under makeup. A strength of the product is&lt;br /&gt;in the natural ingredients contained, as opposed to harmful inorganic&lt;br /&gt;ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is for external use only. In addition, the product has&lt;br /&gt;a tree nut derivative which you should discuss with your physician&lt;br /&gt;if you have allergy issues. Otherwise, the preparation appears to&lt;br /&gt;have a number of healthful ingredients. The reviewer asked for and&lt;br /&gt;received a free sample in order to test the product for review purposes.</li>
            <li> excellent result in two weeks,</li>
            <li> I have recently just ordered another bottle of this GREAT cream and I am so happy that the only thing they changed was the bottle shape!!!!!! It is GREAT stuff!!! People don&#x27;t believe that I am 10 years older than they guess me at thanks to this awesome cream!!!! I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!! I look in the mirror and I see the difference even not using it for 3 days makes and I am so glad that the shipping is really quick, because I ran out and the shipping being so fast that I only went 3 days without it!!! I just can not tell you enough about this cream------------you will NEED to try it on your own to get the full benefits of it!!!!!!!!!!! I would soooo recommend this product!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used the InstaNatural Eye Cream for one month now. I am a 56 yo male with extreme baggy lower lids. My lids have been this way for many years, to the point where I thought I needed surgical correction. I actually saw results the first week of using the product! Not only was the price great, the personal customer service is amazing. They contacted me to see if I liked the product or not. They truly wanted to be sure I didn&#x27;t have any questions or concerns. Thank you for a wonderful product and awesome follow up.</li>
            <li> I noticed a reduction in puffiness around my eyes after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for just a few days and can notice the dark circles are lighter and lines less noticeable.  Can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a month. The pump dispenses a little more than needed but other than that would recommend</li>
            <li> I love the eye gel:). I&#x27;ve ordered a backup because I can&#x27;t imagine running out &amp; now I have my sisters, mom &amp; grandmother hooked as well:). I&#x27;m very impressed at how good it makes the skin look under makeup.  I have never been a big fan of primers bc although the skin can look smooth, it makes me break out.  Not this eye gel!  I actually put it further down into my t zone under makeup and it looks perfect!  My new favorite find 💙</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good treatment for people with dark circles and puffiness under their eyes. I have purchased this product 1 week ago and it has arrived 3 days ago so the shipping was quite fast. Also, I have used this 2 times during the day and during the night. There are only extremely minor changes but I can see that the darkness under my eyes are getting smaller. Also, for some reason, my darkness under my eyes are become reddish, not that it is my concern because I trust that this product will give me good results. I am impressed with this product and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I saw that product was one of the &amp;#34;best sellers&amp;#34; so gave it a try. I really like it. It is not as moisturizing as some eye creams but is a gel and does not dry out the skin either. I would definitely reorder when I need more.</li>
            <li> Have not done anything for my dark circle but I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> i bought this i don&#x27;t like it at all so my husband stared to use it we have&#x27;t notice any difference i would no buy again</li>
            <li> This is not the first product by this company that I&#x27;ve purchased. I like this eye gel. It is light-weight and goes on smoothly, even under makeup. It reduces the puffiness in the eye area and moisturizes the delicate skin. I highly recommend it and other products by this company.</li>
            <li> Another product that does nothing as advertised, zero results after using for 3 months</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.. I&#x27;ve only use this for a couple weeks and it really works!!</li>
            <li> Amazing! I work graveyard shift 12 hours in the surgical ICU so the bags underneath my eyes are terrible. I use this along with Vitamin C Serum by Poppy Austin for the past couple weeks &amp; Im beyong happy to say Im seeing amazing improvement! Completely reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> Only used this for 2 weeks, but seems to be working as stated.  Will continue to use.  Little sticky for the first half hour or so.  Works well under makeup.  Great company....very concerned with satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start telling you why I love this company, all their products have natural ingredients also their products are cruelty free. The first thing i noticed about the Youth Express was the smell, it&#x27;s like a mild cucumber. I have used this for two weeks now and I can see how my dark circles have been going away gradually. I don&#x27;t think they will go away completely since I have them by genetics. But I do feel a lot better just seeing myself in the mirror, and not look like I&#x27;m sick. And like the fact that no one has ask me If I need some sleep,that happens at least twice a week (really frustrating).It&#x27;s perfect for travel since is small. And I know I will see more difference the more time I use it. So I&#x27;m pretty please with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*If you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate is as &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34;*&lt;br /&gt;*InstaNatural send me this product to review it, but my opinions are my own.*</li>
            <li> At the age of 30, I mostly use eye gels and creams as a prophylactic. I do however get puffy bags under my eyes sometimes when I don&#x27;t get enough sleep (which is often). So, I was excited to try out this eye gel and see how it worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This InstaNatural product comes as a clear gel and has a nice faint cucumber scent. One of the first things that I noticed is that although this gel says it is an eye gel, the directions say you can use it on your face. It can be used under makeup. As soon as I learned this, I cleaned my face and proceeded to slather on the gel. It feels slightly sticky at first, but the sticky feeling leaves pretty quickly after putting it on your skin. It also has a slight cooling effect. It leaves your skin feeling hydrated, silky and wonderful. I love using this as a daily moisturizing treatment before my makeup. It goes on fast and dries quickly, so it doesn&#x27;t take much to add it to your daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had to do the refrigerator test. Since this gel already had a cooling effect, I knew that it would feel amazing under my eyes after being cooled in the refrigerator. I was right! Since I am pretty tolerant to cold, I don&#x27;t even mind applying it to my entire face when it is chilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using this gel, I feel that my skin under my eyes looks better. It seems less puffy and saggy looking. I actually look like I get the proper amount of sleep! I have not had any irritation, breakouts or problems from using this product. It makes my skin feel extremely healthy and clean. I will continue to use it and I definitely recommend trying it out</li>
            <li> I can actually feel this eye cream cooling and tightening after application, which I love.  The worst part about skincare is waiting for results, so the immediate feeling this eye cream gives, just makes it feel like it is already working.  The texture is a a bit thick, almost like a jelly consistency, but the effects are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product to review.</li>
            <li> I like this eye gel.. It absorbs quickly. Skin feels good and a bit smoother. It seems to be working so I&#x27;ll be buying again.</li>
            <li> This thing works! I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2-4 weeks now and I cannot say enough about it.  no more dark circle!!!!  By the first full week, twice a day, I saw a major difference in my eyes. Heck, even my teenagers, who you all know have no filter between their brain and their mouth, said my face was different.  I looked younger. High praise!!! I will continue using this till the company goes out of business or I&#x27;m broke and can no longer buy it.  Keep up the great work!!!</li>
            <li> Ok, i have to give a 5 although it really has done nothing for the dark circles. Puffiness yes. BUT, I put this all over my face 2x&#x27;s a day for at least a month, well to my surprise, my just getting in light wrinkles around my mouth are gone. I had a small burn (red patch) about the size of a dime on my cheek from using a bad product, well it&#x27;s been there for about 3 years, make up covers it but i could not find anything that would take it away or minimize it, well this stuff has taken that mark away, i am now able to wear make up IF I WANT TO, not because i have to! I am thrilled with results that i didnt even know was an option!!  If this company happens to read these reviews, you need to start testing this stuff on wrinkles and marks!!! Although i just did that for you!  :)  I will order more when i get my credit card bill down a bit.  :)  BTW, i actually got the idea for putting it all over the face and neck from another reviewer, she said it made her skin soft. Yes it does, it goes on a tad sticky at first but after a minute or two, just softness! Love this stuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out of this product about a week ago, the red mark is coming back, so this is not a permanent fix, which is more than fine, will have to order more.</li>
            <li> I am 53 so my eye lines may take a little more time. The deep line in my forehead has lightened quite a bit. I will keep using this product because I think it needs more than 2 weeks to really judge it</li>
            <li> Great product! Much more benefits than the price. I have very bad dark circles and puffy eyes. Just a week, I can see the difference. Loveeee it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this products for about 2.5 weeks now. I see a slight difference in the darkness under my eyes and the puffiness does go away when I use it in the morning but I see some of it come back by the afternoon. I did not get this item as a promotional offer, I purchased thru the website. I like the way it goes on and it does not interfere with my make up. Will keep using until all gone to see if the darkness decreases any more and if it does I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I love it it makes my skin smooth and better looking</li>
            <li> For those who wants more moisture go with eye cream not eye gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month and I haven&#x27;t noticed any effect ! Not to mention that it is too hot for the area around the eye</li>
            <li> Have been using for about two weeks now. The product is much better than what I had been using previously (L&#x27;Orel Men). Within a few days, I did notice a reduction in puffiness and the over all eye outline started to look firmer and healither.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaing and pump system is good, no loss of the eye cream with use / execess left on the bottle like some other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is very easy to apply to the skin and does not leave an oily film / shine after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I am happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will no try some of their other products.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few weeks now, and I have noticed my skin improving. My skin is tighter and looks less tired, and my color has slightly improved. The only thing this gel hasn&#x27;t done is clear up my under eye circles, but it has improved the tone a bit. I have a feeling using this product a bit longer will show me more results. I am also extremely impressed with the customer service from the Instanatural company. They&#x27;ve emailed me to ask my opinion, and kept in touch. I&#x27;m a happy customer!</li>
            <li> I have become a regular user of this product. I find that it works as well as Clinique&#x27;s All About Eyes. The container and dispenser keeps the product from evaporating like the Clinique product tends to do over time. This was my fourth time ordering Eye Gel.</li>
            <li> I’m at that age now where skimping on sleep shows up all over my face the next day. Artfully applied make up can cover a lot but not puffy eyes with droopy lids. I’ve tried several remedies over the years for puffy eyes; ice, witch hazel, Tucks pads….yep, I said Tucks. They work! But they are for more drastic situations that simply being of a certain age. For day to day care I’m now trying InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has only been a couple of weeks since I began using this gel so I can&#x27;t speak to the long term effects but I have seen some lightening in the circles under my eyes and there is definite improvement in puffiness. I would say that you shouldn&#x27;t expect drastic results right away but there also was no irritation or redness when I first began using the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this is not a fully organic 100% natural product, it relies on natural ingredients wherever possible to save skin from unnecessary harsh chemicals. It is made in the USA and is NOT tested on animals. I&#x27;m clearly sold.</li>
            <li> Love the way this goes on. I use it on my face, neck and chest as well. Saw improvement after my first bottle and ordered another.</li>
            <li> This gel is fantastic – it performs as advertised.  I have very sensitive, dry skin (70+ in age) that doesn’t “like” many of the products on the market.  I’ve tried them all, from the cheapest to the most expensive (well almost the most expensive) with minor results, a lot of frustration, and a drawer full of leftovers.  I bought this gel based on the reviews and the ingredients.  It is a winner.  My eyes have always been my best feature, even at 71, so I try hard to “preserve” them as best I can.  Instanatural exceeded my expectations.  I love the pump, though I wish there were a window so I could see how much is still in the container.  The gel flows on easily and has definitely smoothed the skin under and around my eyes in addition to also reducing the puffy appearance under my eyes.  I just ordered another one since I don’t want to run out.  Thanks for a great product that works, is reasonably priced, and comes with a wonderful guarantee!  I am so pleased that I may try the facial moisturizer in the near future.</li>
            <li> Just started using this gel, it doesn&#x27;t dry me out and you only need a little bit. I only use it on my eyes.</li>
            <li> Love this item I have bad bags only 25 like my mom this has helped drastically for me, I wanted the surgery to have my bags removed I can wait for now.. Will buy again</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It works very well and is a great deal!</li>
            <li> Works very well to reduce puffiness and minimize fine lines.  A big fan of this brand.  I also orderd the Vit C serum and love the quality.</li>
            <li> Best eye gel ever!  I&#x27;ve tried so many eye gels and after many years have finally found what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  It truly works.  After 2 weeks, I&#x27;ve seen dramatic results.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in the next 2 weeks.  Truly incredible.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Cooling gel feels wonderful</li>
            <li> Works really nicely, but I find the squeezy part squeezes out too much at once - my paranoia tells me this is a business model to increase sales.</li>
            <li> Love this product , I fell and hit my head this past year which has resulted in very dark circles under eyes, puffiness swollen look that will not go away. I have tried any and every product out there. Roc etc nothing works until now. I use this day and night. Need a very small amount, nice gel. I put it on lids and under eye even alittle on my upper cheek area. The puffiness goes away instantly, the dark circles are looking better everyday.Works well with my bare minerals makeup.  I am ecstatic. Best money ever spent, and amazon has it the cheapest I could find anywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day (as recommended) around my eyes and forehead.  I&#x27;ve been using eye creams for the past 5 years but never saw a big difference.  This gel has erased most of my eye lines and forehead wrinkles!  For the first two weeks, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference but around week 3 I realized that the deep lines around my eyes (I laugh a lot) were about half the depth they were and by week 4 they are gone!  I started using it on my forehead lines after I saw the drastic improvements around my eyes.  It has been about a week and the lines (which were much less severe than around my eyes) are practically gone already.  Great product to look more rested!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this. She has been using it for several weeks and the lines in her face just disappeared. She was told by multiple people that she looks about five years younger than she actually is. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This cream really works to reduce under eye puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li> Bought for a teen that always has dark circles and puffiness under his eyes no matter how much sleep he gets. He is very pleased. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Though there are many moisturizer creams, serums, and gels on the market they vary in the ability to perform, likely due to skin type and overall health condition of a well hydrated person. This new product is rather dramatic. It contains hyaluronic acid, matrixl 3000  (an antioxidant made by combining two peptides, palmitoyl oligopeptide and palmitoyl tetrapepide-7), cucumber, a peptide complex Aloe,  and MSM (Methylsulfonylmethane - improves your body&#x27;s ability to make it own antioxidants). It is made in the USA in a FDA registered facility. The specs are all in order.  But does it work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only a few days of applying a minimal amount of this soothing gel there is a new immediate improvement. At first you may feel that the result is just the drying of the gel that is contracting the bags and dark circles, but it persists and improves on a daily basis. Used twice daily the results are dramatic. Recommended. July 14</li>
            <li> I have used this eye cream consistently for two weeks without results.  While the ingredients are those that usually have beneficial results for my skin, this particular cream does not create the expected results.  The bags under my eyes have not improved and may even have worsened slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because others have had good results, I wonder if the cream might have been ruined by the summer heat it was exposed to during shipping.  This review is based on a sample provided by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> dark circles &amp; puffiness have not gone away</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, I used it for a few weeks but found no noticeable difference resulted. It&#x27;s a decent enough basic moisturizer but because the misleading advertising and high price tag I bring myself to recommend it.</li>
            <li> I saw a reduction in the puffiness below my eyes immediately - after only 2 uses. The puffiness has continued to diminish but I haven&#x27;t seen too much of a difference in the dark circles. I am continuing to use it 2x a day and I will see how it goes. The product recommends that you use it for 45 days so I am hoping for a better fading of the circles the longer I use it. Just getting rid of the puffiness though has made a huge difference. This is a good product especially for the price. Some of the competitor products were $100 - $140.</li>
            <li> Usually I need to wait several weeks to determine if a face product is going to work but not so this time. I have been doing facial derma rolling to improve the puffiness and darkness under my eyes. I have achieved some degree of improvement and this gel has improved the rest. Is a good combination of herbs etc and I saw improvement right away. I am going to be 60 this year and am trying to counteract the effects of working nights and aging so a product like this is most appreciated.  I haven&#x27;t used it under makeup yet so I can&#x27;t comment on that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every skin type/need is different and not every skin needs the same thing but with the company guaranteeing their product it makes trying on a product much easier!  I am attempting to improve my skin from under the skin surface and this product has offered both under the surface and skin surface recovery for me personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel goes on very smooth, is easy to gently work onto the tender thin skin areas under and around the eyes with light finger tip pats, dries quickly and no stickiness. Has an earthy scent but doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and I plan on getting more before the price goes up. I have been impressed with the InstaNatural products. Good quality, affordable price and produces effects as promised.</li>
            <li> there is a slight difference</li>
            <li> I have just started to get eye gels and creams to test out different ones and see which ones I like the most. This one I have only been using for a couple nights and it seems to make a little difference; my under-eye feels tighter. I am looking forward to a further progression over the next couple weeks. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the product is that it is a little sticky... However, it is nice to use under lotion before I go to bed!</li>
            <li> Love this gel along with the eye serum. Doesn&#x27;t take much to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Product was not what I expected. I couldn&#x27;t use it under my makeup. Also, the gel is so incredibly sticky it was hard to sleep with it on without my face being stuck to my pillow. I have no use for it now. ORDER # 106-0178344-5889858. Would like refund.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. There are many great products on the market, but this is the most effective eye gel I&#x27;ve used to date. It took about eight weeks for me to see results. It was soothing to begin with (with no real sign of immediate improvement) and then within a week, my tired lines started to fade. My eyes looked younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happiest about the dark circles under my eyes, which have mostly disappeared. I&#x27;d recommend trying it out first thing in the morning and right before bed and giving it a few weeks for full results. I love it.</li>
            <li> The gel dries the skin under my eyes feeling like I just put some sort of gel mask on my face. Its definitely does not moisturize. If anything it makes me look as though I have more wrinkles under my eyes. This especially does not work under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for 2 weeks I gave up and threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping this would work since it looks like there are many good reviews.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used exclusively yet,but I do love this so far. goes on silky smooth. I use this on my whole face.as I use this more I will give another review. so far, great!!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference, but it did make me break out a bit where I used it</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the Youth Express Eye Gel from InstaNaturals.  It goes on very smoothly and does not leave a sticky residue behind, and the light fresh scent and cool effect is really a nice way to wake up your skin in the morning.  I have mild under eye darkness, and a few laugh lines around my eyes and I have noticed after one week of use that my eyes look brighter and fresher, and the under eye skin looks tighter. This product has actually convinced me that it is high time to use an under eye serum - an effective and natural one at that!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much difference in my skin although I must say I haven&#x27;t been consistent.</li>
            <li> it has a nice feel to it when you put it on, but it dont see any difference at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about three months. The texture is great, it smells really nice (cucumber), and my rough skin around my eyes is now very smooth and healthy feeling. It definitely reduced the bags under my eyes. A little bit goes a long way. I&#x27;m a guy.  Update - I&#x27;ve been using this once a day for about a year on my whole face. My skin wrinkles continue to fade away. I see a big difference since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I am a 30 year old woman that doesn&#x27;t get any sleep, so I have heavy Macy&#x27;s bags under my eyes. When I first started using the eye gel I knew from the first application that it was going to be a great serum. I am also a makeup wearer and I apply the serum on first before I apply my make up and BOOM!! Puffs be GONE! I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> good price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> Saw no difference in the puffiness under my eyes after using this cream twice a day. :-( Was really hoping it would help, but alas so far I have yet to find an eye cream that made any difference.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles and of course they get puffy, I bought this item hoping to save some money and get rid of my dark circles and puffiness but after using it for over a week now it hasn&#x27;t helped at all. My dark circles are pretty damn prominent as I work 2 very strenous jobs and I see them every morning still</li>
            <li> This is the first eye cream/gel that I bought that works.  I bought this for puffy eyes and dark circles from lack of sleep and this really helps.  This is a bigger container than most eye creams so I can make sure a put a decent amount on to keep my eye areas hydrated and it really works.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> No improvement when used as directed</li>
            <li> if you filter by: &amp;#34;VERIFIED PURCHASES ONLY&amp;#34; there is absolutely NONE! Someone is definitely handing these out for reviews. I&#x27;m sure it works great but having over 1000+ reviews by people that never purchased this worries me...and should worry you too.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel! Every other eye cream  I&#x27;ve used bother my eyes, this is the only eye gel I can use without a problem.</li>
            <li> I have used other eye gels but none worked till I found Instanatural Eye Gel.  Really works great.  Just need to let it soak into your skin before applying moisturizer.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> After the second month of use I have noticeably seen a firming of my skin around my eye area, puffy eyes, dark areas are gone.  This gel works great on my cheek and forehead areas too.  It&#x27;s feels cool and clean on my skin.  Best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  No greasy, shiny skin- just clean, cool and tightens the skin.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I was doubtful but this product works.  It is okay for dark circles but excellent for wrinkles. I have used for over a month &amp; the wrinkles around my eyes have decreased dramatically.  Use on dry skin &amp; give it time to soak in. You will see an improvement.</li>
            <li> Gel is pretty sticky. Thought I could use this as a base under makeup but it&#x27;s not easy to apply foundation over the gel cream. Smells nice but perhaps better just as a night moisturizer only. Haven&#x27;t see any dark circle changes yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my whole face, my neck and on my decollete. Works exactly as advertised. It does not irritate my very sensitive skin at all and it absorbs into my skin completely. The only fly in the ointment is that the dispenser sometimes sticks - and the process of getting it unstuck usually results in wasted product. This product is much to good to waste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for allowing me to review it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the difference. I been USING this product since January of last year. I still have dark circles under my eyes and I still have puffy circles. You guys be the judge for yourselves see picture below, I think I will try something else. If you like I can post another picture.</li>
            <li> Love the feeling and hydration and helps with puffiness. But does not help with sagging upper lids</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product. I used for 45 days  religiously and it did nothing to the bag and wrinkle in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old.  Recently I&#x27;ve lost a lot of weight which left my skin saggy and it seemed as if I aged overnight.  I wish I had taken a before picture - the results after only one week are incredible!  The bags under my eyes are 80% gone and the discoloration is totally gone.  I also started putting it on a spot on my neck where my skin was looking very wrinkly and it&#x27;s smooth again.  I want to buy enough of this to take a bath in it daily!  I will update again after a couple of months but I&#x27;m hooked - my skin quality on my face rolled back about 20 years!</li>
            <li> You have to use just a little bit or else you&#x27;ll see a white film under your eyes but once you get the hang of it, you&#x27;ll be happy with it.</li>
            <li> Seen no change at all used it twice a day</li>
            <li> I am 37 years old and am starting to see bags under my eyes. I have been looking for a good eye cream and thought I&#x27;d check out Amazon because you can read reviews. Seeing the price and the pics people posted I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. I use it almost every night. It&#x27;s been 2 months now and I have seen quite a difference! I am VERY happy with this product. It&#x27;s not one of those temporary fillers. After the gel dries there is a very slight sticky tight filling which is why I only use it at night. I&#x27;m sold! It&#x27;s nice to know the price has gone down....I originally paid 20 bucks but i still have alot left. Good product.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with this. It smells just like clean, fresh cucumbers. It was invigorating and refreshing. I had a little trouble getting the pump started but that isn&#x27;t a big deal. It isn&#x27;t greasy at all and feels awesome.</li>
            <li> A plump is always too much, and I have to press it all the way down to get the product out. It is clear and absorbs fast. Almost no smell. So far I have not seen any improvements to my dark circles but I have some red bumps under my eye. I have stopped using them and the bumps seem to have resided. After reading the reviews, I thought this product would be able to do something to my dark circles, but I can&#x27;t even use it without getting the ugly bumps. Please provide my refund.</li>
            <li> After using the &amp;#34;InstaNatural Youth  Express Eye Gel&amp;#34;, I am convinced that most, if not all, of the highly positive reviews are as bogus as the claims the manufacturer makes for their product! This product not only does NOT work but it actually made my eyes MORE puffy than they were before. I was looking for a gel specifically to reduce under eye puffiness and as this one came with the highest recommendations I though I would try it. I am really sorry I did. Also, this gel did make my fine lines MORE not LESS visible. Listen to the negative reviews folks. Do NOT buy the hype, because all you get with this product is hype. I had better luck with Sudden Change Under Eye Smoother, much less expensive and it actually works.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the amount of eye gel which lasted me over 6 months using the product both day and night.  A small amount is all that is required to apply.  I have under eye puffiness and this product helps with the puffiness and tightening the eye area.  Very pleased and will continue to purchase.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> “I love this product. I have seen such great results after continued use of it. One person actually didn&#x27;t recognize me and later told me she was thinking, &amp;#34;Who is that young women?&amp;#34; I&#x27;m 51!”</li>
            <li> Better improvement for the past 3 weeks. 70% improvement. I expect 90%..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye gel for some weeks now, and have yet to see any results. I like that it&#x27;s easy to apply. A little goes a long way. It also doesn&#x27;t irritate your eye area. It dries quickly. But yet leaves your eye area, a big sticky shiny mess! I only use this eye gel at night and when I&#x27;m around the house.</li>
            <li> I am amazed by how well this product has worked for me after only a month of use.  I have always had dark circles under my eyes and now have wrinkles as well.  This product has helped smooth out my skin and made it look younger and healthier.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of other creams and gels and like this one the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a well known, expensive product for a long time and was generally not please with the results.  After doing some research I discovered this product.  Although everything I read seem encouraging, I had no expectations, but was hopeful.  Within a week I saw a noticeable difference.  To date, I am quite pleased and will continue using this product; am even going to have my wife try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is - you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of $$$ to get an excellent product that really does what it says!!!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s too soon to tell. After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to give this a try. It&#x27;s been three weeks, and I&#x27;ve seen no improvements. My dark circles have not diminished at all. I plan to finish off the bottle in hopes that by then perhaps they&#x27;ll be some sort of improvement. Maybe my dark circles are just beyond help.</li>
            <li> I really like the eye gel.  I have large bags under eyes and I have noticed a slight difference.  Will continue using to see if a major difference happens.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy; moisturizing and does what it says. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Did not help me I feel it makes it worse still have bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This cream is really effective and my daughter is pleased with it after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week and have less noticeable lines around my eyes and the puffiness under my eyes is getting better.  A great product and it is all natural.&lt;br /&gt;**Product provided by company**</li>
            <li> This bra obviously doesnt fit me in the video. lol. I did the review based on what my best friends daughter told me (she was too embarrassed to do a video review). So she got a large bra based on the sizes that they suggested. It was a bit tight so she suggest that you go up to the next size if you arent sure. This one has really nice snaps on it-it clips and then flattens down so its like double clasps to ensure when you sit down it doesnt pop down. The bra itself is padded extra thick which is nice she said because if oyu are breast feeding sometimes you tend to have leakage. This helps in addition to breast pads. Overall she said its not a bad bra. When she orders more she wants to get a size larger (she got a large). I did get this at a full promotional discount for unbias review in return.</li>
            <li> I have no idea whether this product works or not.  So far I&#x27;ve seen no change, but maybe it needs more time to work</li>
            <li> Works well.  Especially when used @ three days or so.  Great price point, too.  I already bought another.</li>
            <li> So very glad I discovered this Eye cream.  I absolutely LOVE it!  It works better than any eye cream I have tried for puffiness and I have tried many! Also Customer Service is great!  Plan on trying more products from InstaNatural!</li>
            <li> So far this is working well - larger bottle than expected for the price!</li>
            <li> I love it. Its really work thanks guys</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a slight decrease in the puffiness under my eyes, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for the dark circles.</li>
            <li> love the product and easy to carry when you travel</li>
            <li> just so so, i could feel a tiny change for my wrinkles around my eyes, but i could not see the change at all.</li>
            <li> We try to buy this creams and shits because we believe is going to increase the look of our eyes...Bulls***. We have to accept how our dark circles look, and realize that this creams are not going to do anything. Sorry but is the truth.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and texture. Absorbs almost instantly. Can&#x27;t wait to see results</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample from InstaNatural for participating in a Tomoson campaign.  I was skeptical,  I am with all beauty products.  I&#x27;ve tried several and they haven&#x27;t really done what they claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all honestly, I didn&#x27;t read the claims of this product.  I just tried. it.  I kept using my regular eye cream on one eye and used this on the other.  After two weeks I can see a difference in the lines, wrinkles and puffiness of the eye receiving this eye cream treatment.  I didn&#x27;t believe it first, so I continued another week.  Yup!  The InstaNatural eye really does show fewer wrinkles and less puffiness than the other eye.  Now they both will be receiving this treatment!</li>
            <li> Wow! My dark circles and bags reduced dramatically! Others noticed it too, thank you</li>
            <li> I have used this about 2 weeks and I can honestly say that it does tighten the skin on and around my eyes giving me a more awake look. It is very lightweight and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it for it to work. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor. It takes a little bit of time to dry, but once you put it on but it&#x27;s not bad. It didn&#x27;t change my under eye circles but it did help with the puffiness. It didn&#x27;t burn or sting or irritate the eyes either. I received this free to do a review but now as always my opinions are my own. I would give this a 5 star and would recommend it to family and friends.</li>
            <li> Using it for over a week. Not impressed. No changes, hopefully I will see results soon.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Fantastic Seller in Instanatural!</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised&lt;br /&gt;Helped my bags under my eyes</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing. I truly see a difference everyday when I put it on. I haven&#x27;t had any problems wearing it under my makeup. I only use it under my eyes. It instantly takes down any puffiness within minutes. you do have to let it completely dry before applying  concealer.</li>
            <li> Best eye treatment I have used so far (and I have tried a few....)</li>
            <li> Ingredients: Deionized Water, Organic Aloe, Matrixyl 3000, Palmitoyl Tripeptide 3, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Plant Stem Cells, Cucumber Hydrosol, Organic Jojoba Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, MSM, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Silk Amino Acid Blend, Periwinkle, Organic Licorice, Wildcrafted Eye Bright, Wildcrafted Reishi, Organic Gotu Kola, Frankincense, Vitamin E, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethylhexyl Glycerin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Product: This gel goes on easily and smoothly. Only a small amount is needed for application. I used this around my eyes, as well as over my whole face. Gently pat it around the eye area and if there is extra, smooth it above brow line and over the small area between the brows which is prone to hold wrinkles. There is a very small, light scent that disappears once absorbed. Once applied the gel is cooling and soothing. Immediately, fine lines are smoothed and skin looks and feels hydrated. Once again, Hyaluronic Acid is the key ingredient to help moisturize and retain moisture in the skin. It is aided in doing this by the Matrixyl 3000 and MSM. Continued use kept my skin radiant and dewy. It is good to use this twice a day and can be worn under sunscreen and makeup. While I can&#x27;t guarantee you will have exactly the same results as I had, I can definitely recommend this to boost the appearance of the thin, delicate skin around the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product to test and review. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Very nice eye cream. The gel is soothing and dries quickly, not leaving you feeling like you have a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; product on your face. One pump supplies more than enough gel for a single application, so maybe just press the pump down half-way to make the quantity last longer. Will order again!</li>
            <li> BEST PRODUCT EVER!  Works instantly as you can feel as if your eyes are being awakened. I retain water terribly, often having swollen eyes. I don&#x27;t get enough rest, leaving dark circles. I&#x27;ve spent years &amp;#34;living&amp;#34; in the sun, squinting and damaging my face causing wrinkles around the eyes. This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever used after trying dozens, that truly works for puffiness, circles, lines, and makes my eyes look very youthful. I&#x27;ve been using for about 3 weeks and am amazed at results. AND no eye irritation even when sweating! I highly recommend this product and bought some for my mother this week. I can&#x27;t believe what a value is it!</li>
            <li> does not make a lot of difference. I used it for almost 7 weeks but could not tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  Started noticing a difference in the first week.  I use it on my entire face and neck and it definitely has made my skin younger in appearance as well as reduced the puffiness and dark circles under my eye.  Plan to keeping using  this product.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Made  my eyes swollen and itchy.</li>
            <li> Virtually worthless, does not reduce or eliminate dark circles or puffiness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the real praduct! I&#x27;ve received a long skinny bottle that Almost looks like the real one..and it BURNS MY EYE!! No No No! Not Happy!</li>
            <li> I have used it diligently in the past two months and have not seen visible result. I do not feel that it nicely absorbs into my skin but rather a jelly layer on top on eye skin which dries in the morning, leaving a residue on my face. I&#x27;d like my money back.</li>
            <li> I love this product so far. I use it day and night.  Makes my skin feel tighter and smooth on my forehead and frown lines and I use it for dark under the eye as well.  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I like this eye gel - it is cool as it goes on and it is easy to use a little or a lot - I like the way my eyes look now that I have been using it for a few weeks - this is a great product for under your eyes - I have dark circles and this is helping to keep those bags under control - I have only good things to say about this eye gel -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spreads nicely and then is easy to cover with make-up or with a night time moisturizer.  I would recommend this eye gel to any age -</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really decrease the bags but nice cool feeling</li>
            <li> This is the first eye product I have used that has produced noticeable results. The gel has tightened the skin and reduced the puffiness below my eyes. You do have to persist and use the gel faithfully for several weeks to see sustained results. I use the gel twice a day, in the morning and again at night. Excellent product--I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Bizarre stuff. I am a (retired) biochemist and I am familiar with pretty much everything in this. They have included in this product, absolutely everything on the market that targets dark circles, puffiness, wrinkles, bags and &amp;#34;sorry looking&amp;#34; eyes and skin. I have tried a ton of these type of products and have had so-so results. (as, no doubt, have you). But. I HAVE NEVER HAD A PRODUCT LIKE THIS REALLY, TRULY W0RK. UNTIL NOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have used this for a week now, twice a day. I noticed it was somewhat sticky and I knew I could not easily put makeup over it, so I used it when it I wasn&#x27;t going out anywhere. After a couple days my under eye bags were somehow tightening up, the puffy was gone and so were most of the dark circles. Forehead lines were almost gone and mouth lines were going away too. I thought it was the light from my makeup mirror that made my face look different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now is the time that I tell you that I&#x27;m 68. I eat organic so my skin is clear, but father time was taking a toll on my eyes. I am willing to get cosmetic procedures (botox etc) but not full on general surgery, to refresh my face. This may not fix the  crevice between my eyes, but I wish I had taken a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; picture to post because this transformation of my eyes is nothing short of astounding! I just can&#x27;t figure out how this could work so fast. They say to give it a few months to work, but if it has done so much in a week, I can&#x27;t imagine what the results will be in a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they say to just dab on a little bit, they mean it. If you get too much on, it dries and can peel off like a mask. Better to use a little and let it soak in. I never would have believed that a product with most if not all of  todays &amp;#34;trendy miracle ingredients&amp;#34; could cost so little compared to the $200 products that have only one or two of the ingredients. This product  is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> As an older woman, as a makeup artist, as a blogger, I have tried countless eye creams and this is by far the BEST one I have ever used. The BEST! That&#x27;s not something you should say lightly when you have tried hundreds of creams, but it really is the best eye cream out there! It&#x27;s a gel formula which makes it super light weight, it&#x27;s cool and refreshing as it goes on, and I love to use this all over my face now. Which makes the bottle go much faster, but I am already going to stock up, and give some as Christmas gifts because it is that good. Right away I noticed firmness improvement, within a week, my skin has tightened up and has improved the overall &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; appearance of my skin. It also brightens it took longer for the dark circles to go away but it does help them, my dark circles are minor and from lack of sleep so that also plays a part in them going away but I would say two weeks before noticing and still progressing to being totally gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is actually fantastic under makeup, plumps up the eyes (I&#x27;m using the youth serum for eye under it now, still testing that) I would say the only con is when applying before bed, I sometimes wake up with crust all over my eye from it, which is strange as I don&#x27;t have that issue during the day. You can use it all over the eye, but I only use it on the orbital bones. Never on my upper eyelid as I&#x27;m prone to milia, which I haven&#x27;t had yet from this product, but just taking precautions. At $20 it&#x27;s on par with drug store eye creams, and it is much better than any of them. I would even put it on par with some high end creams that cost $80 and up! Get some!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any improvement yet. Nothing bad happened either using it so I will try to update in the future. Feels like it is working so maybe the improvement is too subtle for me to notice.</li>
            <li> Useless crap.  Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in the dark circles under my eyes. I finally feel comfortable going out in public without putting any concealer under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I had very profound bags &amp; dark circles under my eyes.  After trying several very pricey products, with minimal results, I did some research I saw that this eye cream had great reviews.  I have been using Youth Express Eye Gel for a couple of weeks now &amp; my eyes have never looked better!  The dark circles are almost gone, those horrible bags are greatly reduced &amp; I am getting compliments!!!  I wish that I had discovered Youth Express Eye Gel years ago.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother in low! She got it two week ago. Today she tell me that she love it!  It Really helps her dark circles. Love to shop on Amazon !!!</li>
            <li> Another crappy cream that does not work! I used to blindly trust the reviews from amazon but now, with all the power reviewers and people getting free merchandise, I can no longer do that. What a shame!</li>
            <li> I purchased this eye gel in hopes that it would help with my under eye puffiness/bags  :(  and I actually think that it&#x27;s helping :) ! I&#x27;ve tried MANY other eye creams/gels from other high end manufacturers that did nothing to help me whatsoever and were also full of concerning ingredients and synthetic fragrance that would irritate my eyes. THIS eye gel is loaded with nourishing ingredients, is NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS and is 75% organic. There are no synthetic fragrances and it does not irritate my eyes. So far, I am really liking this gel. The product is slightly tacky after applied but eventually sinks in to the skin and is not a problem. I use this mainly at night and wake up to less puffy eyes. It&#x27;s also helping with the little wrinkles that are forming at my age of 43. I wake to a dewy complexion that looks better than it did before. It&#x27;s no problem to apply make up or tinted moisturizer over this product. I&#x27;ve also used a touch of it during the day. There is no \\&quot;rolling\\&quot; or product build up that might affect make up application. i&#x27;m glad I took a chance and purchased. great price too! fast shipping</li>
            <li> I bought it for my cousin and she love it!! she just started using it and she feels the difference.</li>
            <li> I read reviews with skepticism because I never get the results that others do - but I thought I would give this a try.  I am so glad I did.   I&#x27;ve only been using this for about 2 weeks and I have already seen improvement in the bags and dark circles under my eye.  I have also been using it on my &#x27;jowl&#x27; lines and have seen improvement.  I will definitely be reordering when this container is low.</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream. Ordered a second one already. Will order more.  Really good for the eyes, anti-aging!</li>
            <li> InstaNatural contacted me asking if I would like a sample of this product for testing so I could give an honest and unbiased opinion of their product. I have been happy with all of the products I have tried so far by this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The first thing I noticed about this eye cream was that it has a nice cucumber scent, I love it! This eye cream (it is actually a gel), feels cool and soothing under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I made my husband sit still and applied it under his eyes first to see what happened. :p The under eye puffiness did seem to diminish after about 10 minutes give or take. His eyes had less of a tired look and a more alert look to them. I put some under my eyes after I saw his, same results. Of course it did nothing for the dark areas, if it lightens the dark areas under our eyes I am aware that will likely take weeks, if not longer (if at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As for the puffiness I believe it works well enough to continue using this for an under eye gel. The site states that this helps to firm and plump up the skin around the eyes. I don&#x27;t know if it was just our under eye skin rehydrating from the moisturizers, or some of this firming and plumping the site claims to happen, I just noticed the under eye area looking different and a little bit better than before applying. And any little bit helps, right? :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m happy with this product and it feels great. I will update at a later date if I notice dark circles or freckles/skin spots getting lighter.</li>
            <li> Works immediately in reducing puffiness, but within a few hours the puffiness is back.</li>
            <li> It works.  I&#x27;m surprised.  It actually &#x27;reduces the look of lines and dark circles&#x27;.  For real.  I don&#x27;t think it will change anything long term, but I&#x27;m happy to add it to the under eye concealer and brightener.  It makes me look a little better.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> This really works! I have Graves&#x27; Disease and it causes puffy dark circles under my eyes. This is working great. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and it feels really great on my skin. I am VERY IMPRESSED with the ingredients organic aloe, plant stem cells, organic oils, and other nontoxic elements. It is hard to find something that is this natural and healthful. I notice that the area under my eyes looks firmer when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit &amp; Planet&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;Beyond Broccoli, Creating a Biologically Balanced Diet When a Vegetarian Diet Doesn&#x27;t Work</li>
            <li> I love it!!!  It has improved my wrinkles around my eyes and has lighten the dark circles under my eyes. Great Product!!</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream, and it&#x27;s very reasonable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable after painted,and my black eyes are improved also,I love it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> I have always had super dark under eyes! I dont know why but I do! Its sad to have I don&#x27;t like it. I am so glad to be able to test this product! I love it, it is thick a little goes a long ways and does not feel cakey at all and dries fast. I have noticed a huge difference within 7 days of using this product. I get no irritation using this product unlike soms other eye creams!!</li>
            <li> As many people have mentioned, this eye gel is VERY sticky. I&#x27;ve used it with patience for the last 3 months to see if it would make any positive difference but I can honestly say that I see more fine lines around my eyes than before I started using this gel, and I&#x27;m only in my early 30&#x27;s!  The only reason that I gave two stars instead of one is because it&#x27;s cheap. But really, what&#x27;s the point of being cheap when the product doesn&#x27;t work?  It did not firm or plump my skin around the eye area and because it was so sticky that I once caught myself in the mirror and saw that my skin under the eye were stuck together and formed a line. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Got it yesterday and so far no change.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue on and update my review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My box arrived in perfect condition and the cream was sealed inside box.&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the seal, the cream splashed all over my hand. About 1/4 lotion is stuck to the roof of cover.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing pressure did that during the shipping(I&#x27;m located military base overseas).&lt;br /&gt;Its my first eye cream. Took before picture yesterday and will follow up in 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;I can feel tingling on my skin so I guess its working&lt;br /&gt;Made in USA&lt;br /&gt;Not tested on animals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;package&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this due to so many positive reviews so we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting worst break out of my life with this cream.&lt;br /&gt;Acne whitehead on my cheek and neck. I&#x27;m in so much pain right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1/13/2015&lt;br /&gt;Customer service was nice to give me full refund.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t work for people with sensitive skin like me but it seems to be working for most of buyers after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend this to friends.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s minimized the puffiness of my eyes and I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;happy to hear it may do so even more with continued use. I appreciate the&lt;br /&gt;fair price, as well, given how astronomically high other products with&lt;br /&gt;similar claims are.</li>
            <li> Love this! My eye wrinkles are less obvious!</li>
            <li> works so good and feels great on skin its a blessing to have found this eye cream. my husband and i use it daily on our dark circles. def seeing improvements in youth. :) buy buy buy</li>
            <li> mother trying it now I just need sleep</li>
            <li> My esthetician recommended that I use an eye gel rather than a cream to prevent the formation of milia (whiteheads) around my eyes. The brand she recommended cost around $80. I was thrilled to find an eye gel from InstaNatural, a brand that I already love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel for just a couple of weeks so the jury is still out as to whether it reduces fine lines and dark circles. I use it both under my eyes and especially to help tighten and smooth the loose skin under my eyebrows/above my lids. I have found it to be effective for firming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel itself is lightweight but buildable. It feels cooling. I enjoy the light cucumber scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it can be used on the entire face, I&#x27;m using for my eyes, and so far so good. Like all InstaNatural products, it provides great value for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought and returned at least 11 different eye creams in the last 6 months so I my expectations were low and boy was I wrong. I applied this the night I got it and in the morning, and by the following evening my wrinkles had diminished significantly.  More importantly to me however, was that the second morning my eyes were impressively less puffy and dark.  Now, I put this on at night and as soon as I am out of the shower in the morning and no matter how puffy or dark it is under my eyes, I look refreshed within 15 min.  Truly a miracle product, especially for this night owl who started a new job that begins at 6am.</li>
            <li> I really liked this eye gel and used it on my entire face and neck because it was hydrating and firming. There&#x27;s cucumber in it so you can smell the lovely fresh cucumber scent. I liked the dewy, sealed glow it gave my complexion. It&#x27;s like the &amp;#34;Photo Finish&amp;#34; of eye gel. Left my skin soft. There&#x27;s also plant stem cells, hyaluronic acid, and aloe in it. This one&#x27;s a keeper. I received a complimentary sample to try and review from BrandBacker.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s not bad.. but not intense result....</li>
            <li> I have puffiness under one eye and decided to try this product based on the reviews. I have been using the product for two weeks as instructed, and there has been no noticeable difference. The puffiness remains the same. It may work for other problems, but not for puffiness.  I would not recommend this product for puffiness under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice cause I just got it, but the pump broke the first time I used it. So now the pump pops off when I go to use it. As far as the product and if works I don&#x27;t know yet, after using it for awhile I will review it again, and see if it was worth it even tho the pump broke.</li>
            <li> i have used it for a week a it made my bags worse</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for 6 weeks now; no results so far.</li>
            <li> I wished that I experienced benefits like others have published.  Unfortunately, it basically doubled the puffiness under my eyes over the course of the first week of use.  It also does slightly sting.  The first time I applied it before bed it possibly caused one of the poorest nights of sleep I&#x27;ve ever had including horrible night sweats.  I&#x27;m sending it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream, and it compares to some expensive creams I have purchased! It moisturizes the eye area well, and it is early for results, but my eye area looks brighter and less tired!</li>
            <li> I have dark circles my whole life. I have tried different eye creams with massage my eye area to eliminate them but they are really stubborn. I gave the eye cream a try and surprisingly noticed results in three days. My dark circles are becoming much lighter! The other expensive eye cream I have is forgotten in my closet immediately. I really recommend this for dark circles and the price is very friendly!</li>
            <li> It reduced my puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> it is very gooditem  and delivery is so fast&lt;br /&gt;i like it</li>
            <li> This eye gel is awesome. It&#x27;s versatile, because you can use it on your eyes, face, neck, and décolleté, too! It leaves my skin feeling soft and protected from the elements all day. It also is scent free, so it won&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so impressed with this product! I&#x27;ve only been using it for several days, but the results are definitely noticeable. My eye area- wrinkles, dark circles and puff are markedly decreased. I&#x27;m 58 and have tried so many useless creams, gels, etc. I was very skeptical, but so happy I listened to the many positive reviews. I was even more impressed when I received an email from the founder of the product, giving tips and assurance that complete satisfaction was guaranteed. Excellent service, excellent product for a fraction of the cost of all the other bogus stuff out there.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL eye cream! More like a gel than a cream, and wear just fine under makeup.</li>
            <li> As a mommy to a toddler I feel like this eye cream was made especially for me and all other Mommy&#x27;s!! I have never been a great sleeper and it has always shown right underneath my eyes. Corrective concealer helps but only a bit until I tried this eye cream! I have been using it religiously for about a month now and I&#x27;m getting compliments on my appearance. People say I look rested..HA I wish! I&#x27;m so glad I was picked to try out this eye cream. I can honestly say I look and feel better which makes me more confident.</li>
            <li> This eye gel has a nice refreshing smell to it kind of reminds me of cucumbers and it feels good putting it on my skin. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or leave a weird film. I like that it can be used on the eye area or on your whole face. I like to use it on my entire face. I like to use it after I wash my face, apply the youth express eye serum to my eye area then apply the eye gel over my entire face. I received a complimentary sample of the eye gel and the opinion and review are my own.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading its great reviews.  Unfortunately, after 3 days, I developed a severe allergic reaction, causing a rash on most of my body.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever experienced any type of skin allergy.  I won&#x27;t get to use the product long enough to determine if its claims hold true.  I hope it works for the rest of you.</li>
            <li> I need to be honest - I don&#x27;t feel overwhelmingly enthralled by this product, but I do like it. It does what it says it does and it feels amazing when you apply it. Your face feels moisturized and refreshed. I think it&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you experience puffiness or dark circles. I am going to use it over time and I hope to see more and more improvement in my dark circles....and believe me, they are definitely there!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Really works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to deal with deep wrinkles and bags under my eyes for years and it&#x27;s been one of the more depressing skin care issues for me as nothing helped get rid of them. I had a chance to try out InstaNatural&#x27;s Youth Express Eye Serum to see if it would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel has a light gel consistency. It&#x27;s clear and absorbs almost immediately. There&#x27;s a light fragrance similar to a cucumber body spray which I don&#x27;t mind as it helps refresh my tired eyes in the morning. Upon application, this eye serum immediately moisturizes the eye area. I have found that after application, the area under my eyes are less puffy. I&#x27;ve never had that result with any eye cream before so I was definitely surprised. I apply after cleansing my skin and the area feels smooth throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying this out for a while, my wrinkles are still present but there&#x27;s a reduction in puffiness under my eyes as well as dark circles. This eye serum isn&#x27;t going to break the bank so if you&#x27;re looking to try out something that will work for your dark circles and puffiness, I would recommend trying InstaNatural&#x27;s Youth Express Eye Serum.</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel for over a week now and I have noticed some results. I do not have dark circles but did notice some under eye wrinkles. This gel works wonders and I have experienced noticeable under eye wrinkles. Great product. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the difference.</li>
            <li> Easier to use than the last one I tried and seems to do a little better reducing puffiness around the lower eye areas.  I&#x27;m at the 3rd or 4th week level and it has made some improvements.  Nothing for me will do as well as surgery but it&#x27;s not that big a deal at my age.  It&#x27;s certainly worth a try to see if it works for you.  You&#x27;ll get enough to be able to tell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and have not seen my puffiness or dark circle improve.</li>
            <li> So far I like this! I was given this to try out for review and so far, It&#x27;s nice. I like how it applies and you only need a little bit as it definitely goes a long way. It makes the skin around my eyes feel nice and when I wake up after using this, it still looks nice an hydrated. I gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ve used it long enough to really see any measurable results, but I think as I keep using it, I&#x27;ll see something!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this about six months ago. I gave it a jolly good go for about a week, and noticed no result. Switched to another eye bag cream, did nothing. I decided to switch back and use this eye gel for two months instead of giving up right away. Bingo! If you use this product twice a day and have some patience with it, it will give you results you want. As an added treatment, I now use soy peptide anti aging cream underneath this product. Seriously works magic. I highly recommended it if you can be diligent in using and have patience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m well into my 30s and the fine lines and crows feet are really starting to show up. I was sent this product free to try from InstaNatural and I&#x27;ve been so pleased with the results. It really only takes a tiny dab to pat on the area around the eyes. I can really feel the difference and tightening in the skin. It also is improving my undereye circles. I can&#x27;t believe how quickly this product begins to make improvements and you can&#x27;t beat the price- so much less than department store eye gels. You can also use this product in your forehead and cheek areas and get the same results! This bottle will last a long time too because such a small amount goes such a long way. I use it in the morning and at night and wear makeup over it regularly. So glad I&#x27;ve found the InstaNatural facial products!</li>
            <li> Just tried this all I can say now is it is not an instant working cream.  Some eye creams work upon first use at reducing puffiness this one does not.  Might be a product that takes time.  Will report after a month or so.</li>
            <li> I really believe this product does help with puffiness but don&#x27;t really see a difference with dark circles.  The price is great since its right in the middle of drugstore and department brands.  I will for sure continue to purchase I use in the morning and evening.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve seen some results. I think with continued use, I will see more over time.&lt;br /&gt;Very moisturizing and I personally like to refrigerate for added benefits.&lt;br /&gt;Pics #3 before cream, #4 after cream application, #5 smiling, #6 resting face</li>
            <li> This product is more for me than just a very effective under the eye cream.  The improvement under my eyes has been remarked upon by family, friends and even casual acquaintances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to do a stringent exfoliating routine at least twice a week.  On those occasions I use it on my entire face and the results are astonishing.  The gel plumps and smoothens the wrinkles around my mouth and the rest of my face glows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product so much that when I reordered, I purchased an extra to give to my sister!</li>
            <li> Works great for reducing dark circles around the eyes.  Great product and excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected after reading all the wonderful reviews.  Have seen no difference in the bags under my eyes.  It does apply nice however that is the only positive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using it. Haven&#x27;t seen any results yet. Gonna use as the instructions say and then i will see what the outcome will be.</li>
            <li> It is not working for me. It looks like silicon, or some gel base for safety. Followed the instruction, I use it twice a day. However, in the morning wake up, the dark circle is even worse. I tried to use it for a month, in case I have something wrong, but totally wasted time. I don&#x27;t know how it is called &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34;, but based on the scientific sense, I think it is the worse one.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, for the &amp;#34;InstaNatural&amp;#34; products, I have 50/50 experience. They might be developed by different teams...anyway, forget it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this &amp;#34;InstaNatural THE BEST Eye Cream For Dark Circle&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is not for me, I don&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> Very good, works. Easy to use, seeing results.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye product that I&#x27;ve ever used-hands down.  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of other products that ranged from very pricey &#x27;high-end&#x27; brands to cheaper &#x27;low-end&#x27; brands. This is the first product that I have used continuously because I saw results on puffiness, circles and texture around my eyes within the very first applications. It works great on the entire face, too. It&#x27;s odorless and I&#x27;ve had no irritation. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Do not get fooled people. Non of the eye creams help.&lt;br /&gt;Read this two articles and you will see that you don&#x27;t need to spend money for eye creams that do not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(...)</li>
            <li> Makes my eyes feel great and less puffy.</li>
            <li> I usually ending tossing the eye creams I&#x27;ve bought over the years, but not this one.  This is actually the first one I found that really absorbs into the skin.  The other brands would often just sit there until I applied makeup and then would roll off in little crusts.  This stays put and underneath my eye is plumper and the fine lines are minimized.</li>
            <li> Helps get rid of the puffiness and circles. Love this stuff</li>
            <li> Bought this product and used the first one up in no time.  I really like and will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Works well so far. I&#x27;m excited to see if it works better and better over time</li>
            <li> Did not receive any results for the bags underneath my eyes. In fact, was experiencing sleepiness problems while using this product. Since I no longer use this product, hasn&#x27;t had anymore sleepiness problems.</li>
            <li> Organic and animal free testing is enough to make me use this product but the product will stand alone for it&#x27;s quality.  I have bought several items from this company and they are there to please the customer.  This is a can&#x27;t go wrong product and company.</li>
            <li> This product does reduce puffiness and seems to temporarily tighten the skin. However, I saw no results in reducing the dark circles under my eyes. I have been using this product for two weeks now.</li>
            <li> This eye cream has really helped with my under eye puffiness. I love the texture of it - it&#x27;s more of a gel than a cream but it blends into the skin very nicely. The best part is the SIZE - I received this for review, and now I won&#x27;t have to buy more for a while!</li>
            <li> For women who are on the go go. We never sit down to relax and rewind. This product is great for the under eye area. It is cooling and great smell. It is a nice thick gel that will stay place when you put it on. I am noticing firming up in the eye area in less than a week.  I could see a difference in my eye area. So I started using it all over the face. It was nice cooling effect on my face. I love that there is not parabens, sulfates or any alcohol in this product. I would suggest this for all skin types. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience!</li>
            <li> not impressed with this product. didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. will not purchase again</li>
            <li> The pro‍duct is good,I like it,and I will keep useing it.</li>
            <li> I can see a remarkable improvement in my skin. After 3 weeks of use (night time), my eyes are now brighter and the dark circles are fading gradually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to say that I will continue using this product as a treatment for my under-eyes skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, I used it on my entire face and I can notice a firmer skin which I am very delighted with ! I&#x27;m already receiving some positive comments !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the nice product, you&#x27;ve just won a loyal customer ^__^</li>
            <li> they asked me to wait 8 weeks after using it before posting a review....it&#x27;s been about 10 and have not noticed any difference after using it twice a day.</li>
            <li> cool! I feel like getiing younger.</li>
            <li> This procuct is pretty awesome as far as depuffing the bags under my eyes that I get from insomia. The only thing is I wish it was more moisturizing but it really isn&#x27;t a big deal to put a little lotion on top. Overall I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> This has worked great to take a way the puffiness and redness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am a mom of a 4 year old and a 4 months old - wich means I hardly sleep, I suffer from Dark circles, and puffiness.. it sucks&lt;br /&gt;I Have been using InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel Ultimate Eye &amp; Face Treatment for about a week now. I have seen a Dramatic change!!! My eyes are looking much better, my dark circles and puffiness are disappearing. I use this product twice a Day (I also use the Eye Serum and Retinol moisturizer) this products work great together&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this Youth Express Eye Gel 100%&lt;br /&gt;“Product provided for free for testing purposes”</li>
            <li> I should have known better.  Have yet to find a product that reduces the puffiness under my eyes.  Additionally, this bothers my eyes - can&#x27;t use it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now. It has made the lines around my eyes less noticeable. It also works wonders on my bags and dark circles. I have a young child,  so I can look pretty tired sometimes.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Have used for almost a month. I like the consistency - light and not too fragrant. Seems to be working, though I don&#x27;t see dramatic results yet. I&#x27;m happy with it and will continue use.</li>
            <li> Feels good when applied but see no difference</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin, light freckles, uneven skin tone, small wrinkles, dark circles and puffiness under my eyes. It usually takes about a month for any cream to start making a difference on my skin, except this one. I originally bought this to use just under my eyes, but by the second night I decided to wear it all over and WOW, I&#x27;m so glad I did. After three days of using this product my skin appeared brighter, more even in tone, and the puffiness under my eyes was drastically reduced. I have now used it for two weeks, day and night, and my skin has NEVER looked better. I look refreshed, my dark circles are just about gone, my skin tone is so even that by the end of the day my make up has worn off and I barely notice it. I am one of those people who has 6 different jars of face cream in her bathroom, each one just as disappointing as the next. I&#x27;ve used all the store brands and have found they work, about a 3 out of 10 for me. This gel is a 9 out of 10 b/c of how quickly it starts to work, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, has done everything it said it would do for my skin. I will most absolutely buy this product again. Tip: let it try completely before applying any face creams or makeup over it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this after all the great reviews, but I was very disappointed and felt like around my eyes looked way worse after using this product.</li>
            <li> I have not been getting much sleep due to taking care of my sick mom.  I needed something to help with dark circles under my eyes.  This product has made a big difference in the dark circles.  I did receive this product for free to try and even if I had paid for it my review would have been the same.</li>
            <li> It feels cool on your skin and leaves your skin dewy.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now.  There is no noticeable effect yet but the manufacturer said it takes right weeks to see excellent results,  so I will comment again at that time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to go the (mostly) all natural, healthy route for skin care. For my family and me, I feel like it&#x27;s important to know the ingredients that you&#x27;re subjecting your body to. I&#x27;ve been ordering lots of these creams from InstaNaturals and I haven&#x27;t found one that I&#x27;m not immediately impressed with. I did my research on Hyaluronic Acid before ordering Premium Hydration formula (another order) and was impressed to find that this ingredient is used in eye surgeries as well as to treat osteoarthritis and minor wounds. Further, it is described as &amp;#34;acting as a cushion and lubricant&amp;#34; (WebMD). If it works for all of these things, how can I go wrong trying it? It feels great on my face and my skin has never been so soft and smooth (though, like I mentioned, I&#x27;ve been using a lot of the InstaNaturals products daily, so it may be any one of them, or the combination). I am extremely impressed and will continue to use and recommend these products.</li>
            <li> Great for my under-eye area. Definitely keeps the area hydrated and my makeup goes on seamlessly over it!</li>
            <li> excellent  product&lt;br /&gt;did not irritate my sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;help to relieve some of my dry winter skin this winter</li>
            <li> I have tried so many bag reducers for my eyes  (I&#x27;m a dude) and most don&#x27;t work however,  this one does.  I really like it.  I can feel it firming my eyes up within just a few minutes. The tube is big too which is nice.  I will buy more of this when I run out which may not be for about 6 months!</li>
            <li> I can tell you this: I love how the skin around my eyes are way firmer than they used to be. I also adored how the puffiness under my eyes are now less reduced and less noticeable. The shipping was pretty fast too and the packaging quality was also 5 star! Defiantly repurchasing after I run out!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I&#x27;ve used it a few times and already in seeing great results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle, but you can see a little difference in a month.</li>
            <li> Really upset i  spent money on this it did nothing for me. It actually is making my skin around my eye dry &amp; some what irritated....My eyes looks worse. Really would like to get my money back....</li>
            <li> I am 29 years old and a mom to a 6 month old baby girl, which basically means that due to the lack of sleep and exhausting daily life I have been sporting dark circles and enormous puffy bags under my eyes ever since my baby was born. I have tried many different creams, gels, serums, etc - including high end brands - but nothing worked. Until I came across this product. This is the first thing that worked and I can&#x27;t tell you how pleased I am with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is quite a powerful, 75% organic product. I used it twice a day (morning &amp; evening) for about a month and I started noticing improvement after just one week. What you do is dab a little bit under your eyes and wait for it to absorb. It absorbs rather fast and you can feel the skin under your eyes tightening right away. I don&#x27;t have prominent wrinkles, but I imagine this would work great for anyone who does - I did try it on the crease between my eyebrows (the one you get from frowning a lot) and it is now completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin under my eyes is much firmer, the dark circles are almost not noticeable any more and I don&#x27;t have to worry about bags under my eyes even after a sleepless night. The yellow spots are gone too, which makes me beyond happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very faint and pleasant, the gel is on the thicker side, but it applies nicely and dries up quick. It&#x27;s not sticky or greasy, and as soon as you give it a couple minutes to absorb, you can apply makeup on top and it won&#x27;t get messy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to get a couple more for my mom and aunt to try, and will definitely be buying more for myself.</li>
            <li> Feels nice and it helps a little bit.  Not dramatic results.  Still, I like it.</li>
            <li> The product is as good a all the others are saying</li>
            <li> So far this product has made my skin just feel healthier. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the eyes with a wonderful consistency. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This product showed positive results in just over a week.  Both my wife and I continue to use it twice daily and are completely happy with our purchase.  Absolutely no skin or eye irritation, easy to dispense and use.  Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> This product is incredible! I&#x27;m a huge fan of the company- they make incredible products based on proven scientific research. Their ingredients are simple, natural, and incredibly effective. I generally have problems with eye creams- they often give me milli and pimples under the eyes, yuck! For that reason, I prefer to use eye gel. This gel is incredibly cooling, soothing, and has a very pleasant plant-like smell. I recently made a video review on the product, feel free to look it up on Youtube under the username itsbmax :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for dark circles, and after 3 days of use, I do see a difference - the darkness under my eyes has gotten lighter. Right after you apply it, there is a faint cucumber-ish scent which is not unpleasant. The gel feels cool and slightly tingly after application, sensations which go away after a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the star off is for the fact that the gel peels off like glue if you happen to rub it, however slightly, after it dries. I realized this the hard way the first time I applied this, and then tried to apply foundation cream on top of the gel. I was smoothing the foundation when I noticed something peeling off my face. It was the gel, clumping up with the foundation and peeling off like half-dried glue. After that I use it only when I don&#x27;t plan on putting makeup on for the day, or just for nights before I go to sleep. (Sometimes the gel is still peeling off by morning, lol.)</li>
            <li> this product is easy to absorb, and have effect on me, I  like it ,and  will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the best eye cream I&#x27;ve used but it&#x27;s decent. I notice discoloration under my eyes after using this product which leads me to think it is actually helping with my dark circles. My eyes also seem tighter and more awake but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s just me seeing what I want to see.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle worker but it&#x27;s a solid working eye gel.  Goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t cause issues with eye makeup, and seems to be helping in the overall appearance of the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Truly enhanced the area under my eyes. The gel acts as a lifter and stretcher! Preserving my skin&#x27;s elasticity from now :) great product!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. A very little goes a long way.  It leaves a slight tingle sensation around the eye area that is very pleasant and refreshing.  After washing my face and spraying on InstaNatural Rose Water I pat a small amount of the InstaNatural eye gel around each eye.  I let the serum set a couple of minutes before I apply my concealer and eye makeup.  Makeup goes on smooth and does not fall into the fine lines.  Along with this product and the eye serum I believe it has reduced my dark circles and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product free for an unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! Works just like it says</li>
            <li> Just got it and used for the first time today. I washed my face and applied the eye gel and I like the cooling sensation under the eye area. I hope it helps in reducing the puffiness. Will review in a week or so for a better review/opinion.</li>
            <li> nothing happened at all!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and overall I like it and think it&#x27;s a good product. I chose it mostly for the anti-aging and fine line reduction properties, I don&#x27;t have issues with bags under my eyes or dark circles. I do have one smallish fine line under my right eye I&#x27;ve been watching and it honestly doesn&#x27;t appear to be getting any different even after using twice a day, but I&#x27;ll wait til I have used the entire bottle to make a real decision. This comes with a really good amount and I like that it&#x27;s in a pump bottle, although it&#x27;s sometimes hard to control the amount that comes out and I&#x27;ve had way too much to spread out before. I use this on my lower and upper eyelids and I&#x27;ve also noticed that when I use it under makeup it almost acts as a primer which is neat, but it does make my upper eyelid stick to my face a little right after applying but doesn&#x27;t last long and doesn&#x27;t hurt or anything. I do have some issues with a slight burning around my eye if I get down almost to my cheek bone, but nothing horrible and it goes away quickly.  UPDATE: The fine line that I was talking about has very obviously gotten smaller and less less deep!! I am very excited!! I read that some customers say to give it at least 3 weeks to start really noticing a difference and I totally agree with that statement.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes have become so much smoother</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It took a whole bottle before I started getting compliments on my looks.  It works.  Stick with it.  You won&#x27;t be sorry</li>
            <li> i have tried just about every eye cream &amp; serum that promised to remove dark circles &amp; puffiness, some of which have been quite expensive, with no success..  I have been using this product for 5 weeks and the change is remarkable. I would highly recommend this product to every one who has these two problems, it truly works.  In addition the company is excellent.  I received an email when I first  purchased recommending guidelines for obtaining the best results &amp; last week, I received a follow up email enquiring about my impress thus far.  If I ever hear even a hint of this product being discontinued, I will stock pile it to make sure that I have enough to last for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> It says it&#x27;s moisturizing and I did not find that to be true. You cannot apply it under makeup...it just makes you look cakey. Not even under your eyes because it gives this weird outline.</li>
            <li> Noticeable improvement after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend this product. It&#x27;s a gel that leaves your eyes sticky. The stickiness creates a shine that actually accentuates any bags or dark circles you may have making them seem even more visible. I remained hopeful and tried it for a few weeks hoping that i would at least see improvement when i washed my face and the product wasn&#x27;t on. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t see improvement and a whole month was wasted trying out this product. My results actually make me question the overwhelmingly positive reviews on this site.</li>
            <li> This cream has done nothing but cause a burning sensation around my eyes. I discontinued as it was irritating my skin and making it turn red.&lt;br /&gt;Would NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought what I thought was this same product a couple of months ago and liked it very much. Bought it again, but the packaging has changed and the smell has changed a bit. I don&#x27;t like the new smell. Seems to feel the same on but I am not sure. The new scent puts me off a bit. The first bottle I loved. Didn&#x27;t work any miracles but it does make my skin feel nice and I think it does ease fine lines and some darkness I have undereye. Will update, if this version is equally good, better or worse after I have been using a while.</li>
            <li> I tried the product twice a day for a month .. and I did notice a marked change, but I will continue to use it</li>
            <li> Love this product&lt;br /&gt;Help my eyes with puff eyes</li>
            <li> This stuff is simply amazing. The number of positive reviews speak for themselves. It will reduced the puffiness under my eyes, and since then I&#x27;ve started using it as an all over face treatment for smooth and even skin.</li>
            <li> Very nice, cooling, non-irritating gel for both upper and lower eyelids. Not sure how well it works for dark circles, but I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This works really well, but you have to consistent! The bottle says it can be used on your face too, so I tried it and it was actually more effective than some of the other lotions I&#x27;ve used specifically for the face. It does leave residue so I use it overnight so it comes off when I shower in the morning.</li>
            <li> This worked almost immediately. There is a noticeable difference under my eyes. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I have to say that I&#x27;m very satisfied with your product this far and have noted very interesting improvements in the area around my eyes even when the main purpose of my purchase was to get an excellent moisturizer as I suffer from dry skin in the area that just got worst after two eye surgeries. My wife has noted the changes and now is about to start using this gel too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m considering to try one of your facial moisturizers given the excellent results of this gel and I will start with your Vitamin C Mosturizer. Thanks.</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference on the days I forget to put it on, Very good product</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. The skin underneath my eyes is thinning and the veins have been showing even through foundation and concealer. I started using the Youth Express Gel and within days I noticed a difference. The veins are not nearly as prominent as they were. Occasionally I have puffiness and after application of the product the puffiness goes away. I also use it between my eyebrows where I started having creases and the creases have subsided. I will definitely continue using this product.</li>
            <li> Nice product I got for free, leaves a slightly sticks residue and smells a little like glue but noticing everyone improvement</li>
            <li> 3 weeks using it and already i have wonderful visible results. i recommend it and for sure i&#x27;ll gonna buy again. You will be happy with the results.</li>
            <li> these product works really good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so happy with this eye gel so far. I&#x27;ve been using it every morning for about a month and I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in the puffiness under my eyes. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who suffers from under eye puffiness when they wake up. I&#x27;ve also been very pleased with the customer service.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about this product yet. I have used it for two weeks but I have not seen a significant difference. I will update if I end up loving it. I hope that is the case.</li>
            <li> Nice cooling feeling when applied.  Absorbed nicely,  not greasy at all.  My skin feels softer and looks smoother.  Circles under my eye&#x27;s are looking much better too!</li>
            <li> It feels nice and cool. I use it when I wake up tired.</li>
            <li> Excellent and as described</li>
            <li> The bottle I am using right now is the older look which I liked a lot.  I love the light weight of this eye gel, and sometimes I do apply the eye gel on my face too.  It provides enough moisturize for all over skin.</li>
            <li> I think i realized in dark circle clearing up , i&#x27;m still using it , but sometimes i skip days It feels like it works! it grabs and has this feeling sensation by my eyes so I think it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I have genetic dark blackish eye circles, and a dry under eye area. Regarding the dryness, this product is superior . In the 3 weeks I have been using it, my under eye texture has improved. I have zero sensitivity it despite my gentle skin. The scent is light cucumber like. It absorbs quickly, and if your under eye region is dry, you may need to apply eye cream atop this. Regarding its affect on the dark circles, I am not sure it has lessened yet,  though again this is genetics at play. The way it has vastly improved the softness, and texture is worth continued use .</li>
            <li> Good product will buy again</li>
            <li> Is not effective for large amount of puffiness under the eyes.  Did like ease of use and smell.</li>
            <li> It did not work well. I ordered this thinking that I would get a cheaper product that worked the same but the bottom line is if you want to remove dark circles and you have hyper-pigmentation, use hydroquinone.</li>
            <li> I have been using InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel every morning before I put on my makeup. It helps significantly with the puffiness under my eyes and in combination with InstaNatural Eye Serum, it has lessened my dark circles. It&#x27;s a great product. I recommend it if you have the same challenges with your eyes. I was provided a complimentary bottle of Eye Gel through my blog. I&#x27;ve expressed my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot. Doesn&#x27;t irritate or aggravate my sensitive skin. Great purchase!! I&#x27;d purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I am a 38 yr old black female and this product has done wonders to the bags under my eyes. I don&#x27;t wear tons of makeup, but the puffiness under my eyes was driving me crazy. I&#x27;ve been using this product night and day for the past 3 weeks and I can honestly see a big difference. I will definitely be purchasing more once I run out. Which probably won&#x27;t be for a while.</li>
            <li> Surprised. Have not been using this long but have already seen some benefit. Pleased, so far.</li>
            <li> I loved it, i tried it faithfully twice a day and my dark circles and puffy eyes were visibly reduced. It absorbs fast into skin, is light and moisturizes my under eyes. You have to put it on every day to get the best results. i started seeing results in 3 weeks. I am 23 years old and I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or fine lines so i don&#x27;t know what it does to wrinkles but it worked on my dark circles and i am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Little results if any after using this daily just as the directions say to for over 4 months. My dark circles are hereditary and weren&#x27;t going anywhere using this product. Maybe lightnend up a tiny bit. Did not affect wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream! It&#x27;s light and absorb fast. I use it both morning and night for 1 week, I can notice the difference and it reduces my dark circles. Love it. Will recommend to friend.</li>
            <li> looks good, but not effective</li>
            <li> it took only 2 weeks to see results on this, it did work well under my eyes but deeper wrinkles are going to need longer use, I was lucky enough to get a discount on this when i bought it.</li>
            <li> Very good, so I want to buy the product again</li>
            <li> I am surprised that the directions for this gel says to apply to the eye, four head, and cheek areas...  But other than that, The gel feels cool when applied. I have not had any adverse reactions after one month of using it. I haven&#x27;t seen any results either, but they did say most people see results at the two month mark...  So I guess only time will tell.</li>
            <li> Amazing, this stuff actually works thanks</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a week twice a day and I see no changes whatsoever.  I will give it a try till I finish the bottle to see if there is any difference.  I will continue to take a progressive picture weekly to compare the result and feedback later</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have dark circles under my eyes. I am a African American and I am impressed with this product. My dark circles are less noticeable. I use it on my forehead too. Gr</li>
            <li> Not a good product.  My eyes were swollen and itchy all night long. The next morning my eyes looked terrible. This is trash.</li>
            <li> This helped with that puffiness I get in my face after a night out drinking with friends. To be honest, that seems like the benefit of the product. It helps you look refreshed and youthful after a massive hangover. Honestly, I like it a lot.I used this on my eye area for a few weeks and I can definitely see an improvement on my skin and I believe I will continue to use it. It&#x27;s made of organic ingredients, which I also find to be a benefit as well. Check out my full review here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;LYDpRId5puw</li>
            <li> brightens up my face and definitely helps under my eyes</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much difference from the OTC products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me, not just that I actually developed more fine lines using this cream it didn&#x27;t feel good applying it under my eyes. My friend used it and she told me it increased the fine lines around her eye too.</li>
            <li> Not fast results but I&#x27;ll say it is working very well</li>
            <li> feels good on skin but can&#x27;t see much difference in appearance</li>
            <li> I like it. every day I put it on my eye twice, I can feel the different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a  few days but so far I think it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I like this product and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t done a thing for the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing gel.  I have used this for six months and have wonderful results. My skin under the eyes is smooth and hydrated.  I also use it on problem wrinkle areas on my face.  No dark circles or puffiness under my eyes. I am in my sixties and amazed at the results. My dermatologist states that my skin is amazing and looks &amp;#34;very good&amp;#34;.  Mari-Milwaukee</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got bags under my eyes from insomnia. I got this product today put it on as soon as I got it and 6 hrs later the bags are gone. Sounds impossible I know. This is the first application. I&#x27;m ready to see what it can do in a month or so for the dark spots under and around my eyes. I&#x27;ve used Avon Genics for 6 months or so and saw basically no change. This product is legit! It is very sticky, and has a smell of cucumber I believe,  but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> This product works great!</li>
            <li> I actually just received this and have tried it only one time. I will say that it feels very silky and very light on your skin. I have a problems with bags under my eyes and have tried so many different products I can&#x27;t even count them all. When I looked in the mirror this morning after applying last night I didn&#x27;t think &amp;#34;this might be working&amp;#34;. I thought &amp;#34;this is working&amp;#34;. And that&#x27;s after only one application. I did refrigerate this so I could have that extra cooling effect and it worked out very well. Really feels good when applied...not a heavy product at all, it feels very light on your skin. I now have very high hopes that after the recommended 8 weeks of applying this gel that my bags will really improve. Great product at such a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Got this on discount item with my Honest review opinion this is best awesome eye face treatment ,i just use this for days guess what works great ..try this and see you&#x27;re improvement fine lines Lessen and I can&#x27;t wait to see more improvement. .</li>
            <li> it gives cooling effect. i used it all over my face. not only for under eyes.</li>
            <li> Good item but if you use to much it gets sticky and stays sticky on your skin</li>
            <li> Makes the wrinkles around my eyes less noticable. I do wish there was more in the bottle that .5 but I guess that is the norm for eye cream.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of this eye gel. It has a wonderful cucumber scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming or underwhelming, it&#x27;s just the perfect lightness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I love that you use it on your eyes, cheeks and forehead (per the instructions), but you can also use it on your whole face if you choose. It makes the product more well rounded and more useful in my opinion. I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ve all had days where we were out of moisturizer or misplaced it and wished something else would work for the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed when I applied this gel is that it has a cooling feeling. It glides on really smoothly and easily like you would expect from a gel. I noticed firmer skin under my eyes and my eyes looked more refreshed overall. It helped with the dark circles and diminished the fine lines that I am beginning to notice as I get older. Where this eye gel really shines is reducing puffiness. You can see results rather quickly from this product compared to a lot of other products that are supposed to reduce puffiness. If you&#x27;re having a stressful week or not getting much sleep, this product works great for making you look more alert and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would really recommend this product. It reduces puffiness rather quickly (almost instantly for me) and has been a real life saver when I&#x27;ve had sleepless nights and needed to look my best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to believe this would be the product for me, but it wasn&#x27;t.  I used for product for about 2-3 weeks and noticed NO DIFFERENCE with my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for long, but I like it so far, it applies well and dries quickly without drying out my skin. I am sure it will take awhile to see if it makes a noticeable change. I will alter my review to reflect that in a few months.</li>
            <li> This gel is a great moisturizer for your whole face. I have very sensitive skin so most creams and lotions give me hives almost immediately. This gel absorbs quickly so your not feeling greasy and makes your skin feel fresh. The only downside I&#x27;ve noticed is that the circles under my eyes ( caused by terrible seasonal allergies) are still pretty apparent, but I&#x27;ve never been able to find anything that really helps with that.</li>
            <li> Feels AMAZING on! I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day now for two weeks and can already see a difference. Nothing has ever worked so well on my dark circles &amp; puffy bags under my eyes!</li>
            <li> In the past have not been big into eye gel&#x27;s or creams. I like that it&#x27;s also a natural product. InstaNatural products are mostly plant based or natural, but they are also highly effective. My upper eye lids have a dry or crepey look to them. Have noticed that my upper eye lid looks smoother &amp; hydrated. This product also helps with the puffiness. Just a few of the key ingredients are hyaluronic acid, plant stem cells &amp; matrixyl 3000. Take a small amount of the gel with your ring fingers, and lightly dab onto the eye area. It can be used twice a day. Only draw back is that often pump out to much of the gel, but Ill use that on sides my nose or some other area that could use moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product for free to review, and share my thoughts on it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product 2 times per day for 7 weeks. The dark circles under my eyes have diminished. Overall, my eyes do look brighter. The price is right and the portion size is generous.I am going to recommend it to a friend who complains about the dark circles under her eyes. I look forward to trying other products made by this company.</li>
            <li> not sticky, good for keeping skin wet. but it&#x27;s not helpful to my dark eye circles.</li>
            <li> This product has worked so well me. I have been using it for a few weeks and can see an amazing difference in the circles under my eyes. I am a mom of 6 children s you know i lose a lot of sleep. It doesn&#x27;t smell strong, but it does have a nice scent to it.  It&#x27;s a little on the thicker side, but it rubs in nicely. It&#x27;s not greasy, and you can apply makeup on top in a few short minutes. It never made my skin look oily or greasy. Definitely a god product, if you have dark circles.</li>
            <li> Good product, happy with results so far</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really work for me. After reading all the reviews, I wanted to like it but I saw no difference after a few weeks of use. I have better results with a Hyaluronic Acid eye cream than this gel.</li>
            <li> Love eye gels, and this one is a keeper. Feels cooling and refreshing and really minimizes the dark circles. Good moisturizer too, not too heavy for the eye area. A winner!</li>
            <li> As a first time user of this product, I am very pleased with my skin after one month.  I will continue with it and give an update after using it for two months.</li>
            <li> My mom uses this product. I received it and have it to her. She loves it. Her dark spots and wrinkles are disappearing. She had uses other products and none have worked like this one. She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very exited to see the ingredient of this eye gel and i bought it .I using this gel for almost 2 weeks and i do like it . Seems every morning my eyes looks less swolllen more youthful . I will buy it again .</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month.  I&#x27;m not sure what I expected, but every morning I think that I will go back to my other product, but then by the end of the day, it seems to be better, so I decide to use it again the next day.  The texture is great.  Odorless (unlike the facial moisturizer cousin).  Cooling.  Great value considering the volume you get in each bottle.</li>
            <li> I  have been using this product for about one month now and it is really working. My lines under my eyes are almost gone. Which is great! It has not worked as well on the dark circles but I have seen some improvement. I bought this for under $20 and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay $80 as the site indicated is the retail price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this eye gel; it is a fantastic product.  Not only has it done wonders for minimizing the puffiness/dark circles under my eyes, but it has also made my skin smoother and clearer.  Even though this is advertised as an &amp;#34;eye gel&amp;#34; you can actually use it all over your face.  I use it in the morning and at night, (just a small amount), and I am really pleased with the change in my appearance.</li>
            <li> Another cheap Chinese piece of crap that does not even clip onto the lens. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> Great company, but the product did not work for me.  However, I am 66 and maybe it needs a younger skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always nervous about using face creams under my eyes, the skin is so delicate, so I looked into products specifically for under the eyes.  Most of them don&#x27;t do much, so I didn&#x27;t expect too much from this.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It&#x27;s not a miracle cream, but the skin under my eyes was loose and sagging, and I definitely noticed a difference after using this a couple of weeks.  The skin is a firmer and not as puffy.  Not a huge difference in the dark circles, but I did notice a change, so that was good as well.  After trying this by itself and seeing nice results, I looked into other anti-aging products to improve the rest of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a great natural product that gave me even better results on my face.  [[ASIN:B00IIPI6CS Bel Essence Intensive Anti Aging Treatment - All-Natural Cream for Erasing Wrinkles. Lift, Firm, Tighten Facial Skin and Fade Fine Lines - 1.5oz]]  The rest of my face now matches under my eyes, smooth, and firm, and even better, the lines on my forehead and on my upper lip are almost gone.  I got a little daring and tried the bel essence (I figured it would be ok since it was all natural) with the eye gel and wow.  The results were even better.  The fine lines that were under my eyes are now gone, and the good results from the eye gel got even better - the skin is firmer and my dark circles are even less noticeable (I can tell because I&#x27;ve been using less and less concealer).  You have to give the products a little time to work, some people here saw results after a week, took me between 2-3 to start seeing results that made a difference.  This is a product I will buy again, with the Bel Essence.  Both gave me excellent improvement in the look of my skin, I&#x27;ve taken a few years off my face.</li>
            <li> A couple of months ago I noticed puffiness under my eyes and tried Insta Natural Eye Gel and noticed a difference in a few days.  I am so happy with it that I ordered another bottle.  Loved it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t given this product for free, I purchased it about 9 months ago and waited this long to post my review. I have been using it for 9 months and don&#x27;t notice a huge difference in the dark circles under my eyes, but I think that might have to do with my sleep and not the product. I will say that the product does give my under eyes and surrounding skin a tighter feel after I put in on in the morning and night. I also noticed that if I have it on, and then try to put liquid makeup (or a moisturizer) over it - I have to be very gentle where this product is. If not the product kind of peels off of my face like its not soaking into my skin but forming a layer on top.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dark circles but find this product also excellent for minimizing lines around my eyes. I also use it to minimize lines above my upper lip. I am very satisfied this gel and pleased that the price is not exorbitant, especially since I can use for more than an eye cream.</li>
            <li> I love this. I have a serious problem with dark circles and puffiness. I love the results I&#x27;m getting, especially with the puffiness.  It&#x27;s light weight and not sticky like some other gels. A little goes a long way too so I feel like it&#x27;s a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really work teak of my dark circles but you have to use it for mons or 2 you will see defrent in 2 week</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff it really works and it&#x27;s easy to use best stuff I&#x27;ve purchased for under the eye.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well as a moisturizer but I&#x27;m not sure if it is really doing anything for my dark circles, it defiantly overall is beneficial to my skin health so I will continue to use it, and the bottle is huge, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have used a whole bottle now and have noticed minimal results. Would like to have seen a little bit more of a change. However, it did reduce dark circles. Anyone looking to reduce their bags/circles should buy this.</li>
            <li> Because I have dark circles under my eyes, I am always excited when I get the opportunity to try out a new eye gel! This eye gel was easy to incorporate into my beauty routine and the consistency of the product makes it easy to apply.  I apply the eye cream at night right before bed. The scent of the product is faint and pleasant. The product&#x27;s primary purpose is to be used under and around your eyes to diminish dark circles, wrinkles, and improve the overall appearance of your eye area. However, this amazing product can also be used ALL OVER YOUR FACE as a moisturizer! I love products that serve more than one purpose! After continued use, I did see a decrease in the appearance of the dark circles under my eyes and my skin looked brighter and younger. I can&#x27;t wait to see how those results will improve with continued use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Used the whole bottle but nothing changed. It feels sticky as the other reviews have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference at all.  A waste of money.</li>
            <li> The best product that I have found so far.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! I love it; I read most of the reviews and it does what everyone says, which is more than I expected. Really, really good stuff. I say stuff because the consistency reminds me of hair gel lol; but it works! Aja</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying an eye gel because I am extremely sensitive around the eye area. Surprisingly the product did not cause any irritation and was very soothing. It did reduce the puffiness under my eye, I  needed to use a little eye cream afterwards because I have very dry skin and the gel was not quite enough moisture.</li>
            <li> Out of all the products available on amazon I love InstaNatural. This eye gel is one of my favorite products I have received for testing purposes from them. It feels great on my eyes and has definitely restored some youth to my eyes. I used to have the always tired look with bags and darkness. Since using this eye gel the darkness has faded drastically and I pretty much have no puffiness anymore despite the fact that my kids let me get little rest. I love that right after applying this gel I can feel the tightening. The bottle is also a very generous size with a nice pump that dispenses perfectly. I would highly suggest instanatural products.</li>
            <li> Feel nice. Isn&#x27;t heavy. My eyes get irritated easily and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this!</li>
            <li> This is a miraculous formula , will definitely keep buying more. I still have dark circles under my eyes but the texture is amazing , I can notice improvement .</li>
            <li> Love with two children already and pregnant with twins I am never able to sleep and it is very noticeable. After just one use of this product it has worked wonders!</li>
            <li> Bottle malfunctioned after 1 week and could not pump out gel.</li>
            <li> I  been used for almost 2  weeks ..I don&#x27;t see any different my skin at all...</li>
            <li> I was excited to offer this product to my mother for her review. She has terrible dark circles under her eyes and we always attributed it to her having an iron deficiency. She takes an iron supplement and contacted her doctor before trying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her words:&lt;br /&gt;This was very easy to use. I just put it in the bathroom so I would remember to use it and the other one every single day. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change the first few days. I started to feel disappointed until about day 10 when I noticed a significant difference in the color of the circles under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;It always looked as if I had a bruise under my eyes. But around Day 10 I noticed the color of the &amp;#34;bruise&amp;#34; had lightened up at least one shade. I was shocked because I&#x27;ve used everything under the sun to try to get rid of the dark circles since I was a teenager (I&#x27;m in my 60s now). You need to make sure to use this every day and use it with the other product  (the InstaNatural Eye SERUM!) every single day. Morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a miracle, not &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; but for the first time in my life I noticed a difference. Even if it doesn&#x27;t lighten up up the under eye circles anymore at least I see one shade lighter and that makes me very happy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep using this and I&#x27;ll have my daughter update this review as time goes by if there are anymore changes. By instant I don&#x27;t think it means the next day, but you wake up one morning and boom -- the circles all of a sudden are one shade lighter. That&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the serum a little more than the cream only because it glides on easier. I don&#x27;t think one actually works better than the other. I used the cream in the morning and the serum a night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller offered this product free or nearly free in order for my review. This is my 100% HONEST OPINION of the eye serum</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast  safety seal on first use it I see little improve but still on the first week! Can&#x27;t wait</li>
            <li> This is very nice for me. It&#x27;s cool feel &amp; sticky but effect my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is great on all wrinkles, but especially good around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Fantastic formulation.  Large size bottle considering it only is under her eyes.  I purchased this product at a reduced price.</li>
            <li> Okay as a moisturizer.  but I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference in fine lines or elasticity yet..  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month,. Use sparingly - i think I used too much a few times and it gave the skin under my eyes a weird crepe-like texture.  Made my eyes look worse - had to wash it off.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps with dark circles and tightens lines. I can feel it tightening right after putting it on. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Made my sensitive skin feel tight and dry. My eyes felt dry, too. Caused pimples to form under my eyes where I used it after a few days. Will not be using this product anymore!</li>
            <li> Wrinkles under my eyes got worse since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> I have the worst dark circles under my eyes, i never sleep well. I started using this, and it has been about 2 weeks. I have really noticed a difference, in the look and feel of my undereye skin. I use other products from the InstaNatural line, and I think all of them combined together have really helped my skin. I use less concealer when putting on my make up lately. That&#x27;s how I can tell this product is working.</li>
            <li> This is only the second day I&#x27;ve used it and I&#x27;ve had quite a bit of sleep over the last few days, but my eyes look much better.  I&#x27;m 47 and have always taken very good care of my skin.  People think I&#x27;m in my early to mid 30s, but lately I&#x27;ve noticed an area under my left eye near the top of my cheek that looks &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;.  The skin is definitely thinner and I don&#x27;t like how it crinkles when I smile - and I smile a LOT.  This stuff seems to plump it up and I don&#x27;t even notice it.  I&#x27;m not noticing any tackiness with it after I put it on and my eyes do look brighter.  It feels smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using an eye cream that costs twice as much and this works better already.  I&#x27;m glad I ordered this instead of reordering the other thing.</li>
            <li> So far I do like this gel.  I noticed my dark circles and fine lines improved almost immediately.  It&#x27;s been about 10 days now and I think the improvement continues, hopefully it will keep going so the dark circles disappear.  That&#x27;s my worst problem and my biggest hang up.  This is more than I&#x27;ve paid for an eye product, but so far it seems worth it.</li>
            <li> Try it. It really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the eye gel both day and night. I love the results! I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in the appearance of fine lines around my eyes and darkness. I love how cooling the gel is too, definitely helps to keep me awake in the morning. The formula is also rich and absorbs quickly, so I don’t have to wait for it to dry. I like that I don’t have to use an eye cream with it, so I can save time by skipping a step. It also doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance to it, if that is a concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own</li>
            <li> great product - I saw results after one use!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results. My under-eyes are still puffy and whatever wrinkles I have are still there. I will continue to try it for another month though. Since eye issues were years in the making, it might take more time than a month to reduce. Sigh....it&#x27;s really impossible to turn back the clock, but at least this product doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes or burn my skin the way other products have.</li>
            <li> IT HAD NO EFFECT ON ME. IT CAN NOT REDUCE DARK CIRCLES.</li>
            <li> will give review back later but now im taking daily photo for my eye. Will post photos after 1 month usage</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this every day or every other for 2 months and I have not seen any difference. Does nothing.</li>
            <li> If you need something to help with your dark circles, this product does not get rid of it, however it helps with the lines and wrinkles under your lids. Not sure I see any difference after using this, however it may work for you.</li>
            <li> This has not shown any favorable results versus the roll-on stick you can get at any drug store. I would know, I have purchased anything from $6.00-$80 eye syrums. Either pay a little more and go to Sephora or go to the drug store.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think this product helps my bags much at all.  I&#x27;ve noticed it must be doing something, because…if you let it sit wrongly…you can created a new line in your face that really shows when you put on make up.  So…its doing something…maybe it works on dark circle, but it does nothing for bags.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product after reading the great reviews. But I tried it for 5 days and ended up with a red swollen rash over the areas I had applied it. I admit, that when I used it alone, I only experienced mild burning and redness. But when I added it to my makeup and other skin products, my reaction was terrible. I have been on benadryl for several days to make the rash on my face subside. I haven&#x27;t been able to put much at all on my skin during this time. Luckily the hives are going down now, but this cream will be going in the trash. To be fair, I have very sensitive skin in general.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t see any immediate differences but I am going to continue use.  Like the texture of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping service was excellent</li>
            <li> good product and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and have trouble finding a good natural moisturizer. I&#x27;m also skeptical of claims to erase bags, lines or turn back the clock. This stuff is great! I don&#x27;t have wrinkles due to oily skin but purchased for the bags under my eyes. My skin feels tighter and the bags are less noticeable. I use it all over my face, as others have mentioned it takes a moment to absorb but once it does my skin feels great. My only negative comment is when I received my bottle it looked like a 3rd grader applied the label. You can&#x27;t escape your genes but this stuff definitely makes the best of what you got.</li>
            <li> So far I have found that this is a great product. Have only used for one week.</li>
            <li> This product works great! I&#x27;ve tried others, but this is the best one yet!</li>
            <li> Leading into the new year, I have made a conscious effort recently to pay more attention to my skin. Especially the thinner, more delicate skin around my eyes. I have bought and tried a number of products to help alleviate puffiness, and found that the youth express eye gel has made an incredible difference, even over the last week or so. A small amount applied gently around the eye in the morning and evenings is soothing and calming the bags that seem to appear in the mornings. I am very impressed so far, and feel like this product is a really good step in the right direction!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I saw any difference in the dark circles around my eyes, but those aren&#x27;t caused by stress or late hours, they&#x27;re hereditary, and may be immune to the effects of something like this.  I had some high hopes on that front, but alas, it wasn&#x27;t to be.  I will say that the tiny lines under my eyes have all but disappeared, which is nice.  And the cream -- more of a gel really -- does temporarily tighten the skin around my mouth where I&#x27;m getting some significant smile lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a while to dry, so you&#x27;ll need to be patient, but it does feel good on my skin, very cool and soothing.</li>
            <li> Hello, I&#x27;m  using the gel for 3 weeks twice a day without results. my skin feel sticky and tight. My wrinkles are noticeable. sorry this gel did not work for me.</li>
            <li> The reviews were right!!!  I see a difference and it&#x27;s only been one week.  This is worth every penny.  I also love the customer service, they respond individually and provide great tips.  I hope this company goes far because they can be a model for oh so many .  Thank you for being so personal with your replies and making me feel like I matter while making me look good !!</li>
            <li> Skin feels tighter after only a week.  I really like this!</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many eye creams. This one is the best. Works great not only on your eyes but the whole faces. Reduces wrinkles within one week. Don&#x27;t search too long for eye creams. Buy this one. And see immediate results.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product......it actually works!  I highly recommend it to any one with puffy, tired eyes (like me!).</li>
            <li> Working great for me! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a compact package of the best under eye ingredients for reducing puffiness and darkness. You can actually feel it tightening the puffy skin and I have already noticed a darkness reduction as well.  We have under eye problems for so many reasons, but I think this product would generally help anyone if used as directed!</li>
            <li> Love love love it!  This cooling silky eye gel goes on smooth, and absorbs quickly, leaving my eye area feeling supple and hydrated.  It has a refreshing cucumber scent.  I also like the fact that it&#x27;s non-irritating,  The ingredients in this eye gel are natural and one of the best combination I&#x27;ve seen.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for those who wake up with eye puffiness. I just dab a bit under and around my eye area, and I feel the effects immediately. My eyes look more awake, and I notice that by the time I am out the door, the puffiness is just about gone. I have been using this product for 2 months now, and only experience said effects during the day when I apply the product. Therefore, I cannot say that this product provides any permanent results, and you must continue use to continue seeing results. It is a nice product that feels nice and cool upon application, so I don&#x27;t mind having to have it as part of my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have a confession to make. Ok, maybe it&#x27;s not a confession because maybe it&#x27;s obvious. Anyways, the deal is, I struggle with bags under my eyes. But honestly, what mother doesn&#x27;t? I just think some women hide it better than others. But why hide them when you can get rid of them? Enter InstaNatural Eye Gel This gel has become a life saver in my world. Filled with natural ingredients like plant stem cells and cucumber it just another product from InstaNatural that I can feel good about! I&#x27;ve been using this product daily and it feels like a spa treatment every time.  I&#x27;ve personally only been using it under my eyes because that is my primary problem area but it is safe to be used on your entire face. The ingredients are safe and natural with no parabens, sulfates or alcohol. It is made with organic ingredients in the USA. Another great product from InstaNatural!</li>
            <li> really great, I feel the skin tightening up, in a good way, not dry, firm.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the eye cream.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.but I really have not really seen a difference under my eyes.</li>
            <li> The best eye product so far. Used many before and a lot more expensive. The area around my eyes stay very soft and moisturized for the longest time. I noticed that the small wrinkles are also getting smoother.</li>
            <li> The product size was a lot larger than I expected. The eye gel is nice and cool while applying and it has a fresh scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering. I have sensitive skin and had no reactions when I used it. It seems to have lightened my hereditary dark circles. I&#x27;ve notice that it has helped boost moisture and minimize wrinkles well. I would recommend this product because it has great ingredients for the delicate area around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month for undereye puffiness.  I believe that it has helped as the puffiness has dimished somewhat.  Will keep using it as I didn&#x27;t expect it to be an instantaneous thing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!!! It really does tighten and remove dark circles. I have very dark under eyes and this gel has made them very light. I don&#x27;t even have a need for concealer. You can feel this product tighten as it absorbs into your skin . I would definitely recommend this product and will be repurchasing</li>
            <li> I love this product, absolutely amazing....give it time, around six to eight weeks to start seeing wonderful results, don&#x27;t expect to see a dramatic change in a few days, that&#x27;s not realistic, but it DOES WORK!!!!!! PROMISE!!!  I tried it because a friend of mine gave up on trying it and passed it to me, so the bottle was not even full.....I have been applying the product twice a day, and definitely love it, my dark circles (always my big problem )are getting better and better, I just have enough gel for a few more days, so I have to get more :)</li>
            <li> not sure if I notice anything different but it does feel nice and cool on the eyes.  The texture is good too so I&#x27;ll continue to use it until I find something better.</li>
            <li> I have seen improvement in my skin around the eye area.  I have also used on my neck, and can see some improvement there as well.  Make sure to dry the product, before moving on to your next step.  Great value for your money.</li>
            <li> Seller very helpful when I had a minor issue , send replacement....now will update review later once I use product a little more</li>
            <li> This one needed time to grow on me but has won me over.  I was a little cranky at first because the bags and dark circles under my eyes did not magically vanish upon first application.  OK, so perhaps my expectations were a bit unrealistic...    I contacted AJ, who offered a refund but also counseled patience, as others had reported results over time.  Sure enough, after about six weeks I began to see an improvement in under-eye puffiness and the overall youthfulness of the skin around my eyes.  The darkness is immovable but hey, I&#x27;ve got concealer for that. The main thing is that this gel seems to be good for the health of the delicate skin around the eyes.  I also use it on my forehead and upper lip line in combination with the Hyaluronic Acid serum which is hands down my favorite of all the InstaNatural products.    InstaNatural seems to have done its research and turned out a great line of products that are also natural. I think it&#x27;s terrific that this little company can make it, thanks to Amazon, in the jungle of cosmetic giants and they will get my repeat business.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife who has dark circles under her eyes, partially do to heredity.  This product has lightened the dark circles and help smooth wrinkles around her eyes.  It also has been good for my daughters dry eye lids.  It has been the only product that seems to work for her in that department.  I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; under my eyes for my entire life. I remember my Mom pointing this out to me when I was 16 years old. What she thought I was going to do about this I don&#x27;t know but that was 47 years ago and the &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; are still there. I came across this product on amazon and thought I&#x27;d give it a try to see if there had been a solution all along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve rubbed a dab of this stuff under each eye twice a day for the past month or so. I even carried it to Spain with me so as to give the product the chance to work according to their instructions. NOTHING! ZERO! NADA! ZIPPO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHO is giving this stuff five star reviews? Dos the owner of the company have a huge family? The product did NOTHING for me. Did they say something about getting our money back? I have to check. I wish amazon offered negative star options.</li>
            <li> Miracle cure for dark circles and puffiness. WOW. During the day, use a little because it does come off as looking greasy on your face. At night use a nice amount before bed. You wake up looking amazing. Stellar product. Will be reordering once bottle is done.</li>
            <li> it smells fine and i like the texture but i don&#x27;t see the expiration date of it so i am a little bit concern about it</li>
            <li> It definitely seems to be&lt;br /&gt;decreasing the black circles under my eyes-so I&#x27;m delighted with it.</li>
            <li> This product helped to diminish the lines under my eyes, use it also on my entire face and I LOVE IT!!!  My dark circles are fading and I am very happy with product!</li>
            <li> Have been using this since I received the Eye Gel (end of Sept.) so far no sign of improved at all. Will continue to use and update later.</li>
            <li> seems to be working, it sure does feel good on</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel for about a month.  It goes on smooth and feels cool to the touch.  It does stay a little sticky, so I use it under my moisturizer during the day, but alone at night.  I use it on my whole face including under the eyes.  I have dark circles under my eyes, but haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in that yet.  However, my fine eye lines and jowel lines seem to be less noticeable.  I will continue to use it and report any updates.</li>
            <li> love it, it feels great on your skin, like you can just feel it working.  Have&#x27;nt had it long enough for results, but I think it will be the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love my new Eye Cream! I have purchased a number of things from InstaNatural and all the products are great and have a lovely natural scent to them. I am very sensitive to products with fragrance and this brand has nailed it.</li>
            <li> I have used it for 2 months. The gel is so gluey making my under eye bag stick together. I got more pronounce fine lines under my eyes T_T. You can just give it a try, it might suit you. The customer service is excellent tho.</li>
            <li> Love how it feels on the skin and how it lays under my makeup. Not sure if it&#x27;s really doing anything as far as skin care yet but that always takes time to see results. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I really like this so far. I only give it a four because I have only been using it a few weeks now and haven&#x27;t seen a big change yet. I like the way it feels and it does great under my makeup as well. So glad I found these products.</li>
            <li> I am far past skeptical about things like this, but.... Um.... I have to admit that after using this for less than 2 weeks, it&#x27;s actually doing something. The bags under my eyes had gotten out of hand and I was ready to try anything, and already they look better.  In my case, they are starting to smooth out from the inside by the nose and working its way out.  I&#x27;m actually pretty damn surprised.</li>
            <li> Love this gel, its texture is amazing and It softens and hydrates the eye so well. Will definitely re-purchase</li>
            <li> This is now my 2nd bottle and I love this stuff. It makes the dark circles fade away and tightens my skin up. Great product.</li>
            <li> Store this in the fridge for added cooking benefits. Works great!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Makes a difference immediately !!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful eye cream.  It has a cooling effect when applied and does help with puffiness and dark circles.  InstaNatural is a wonderful company making quality products at a very affordable price.  Delivery was fast and the item was well packaged.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product! Ordered because of a recommendation from a friend for the wifey. She loves it! Uses it every day and can even be applied under her regular makeup.&lt;br /&gt;The best customer service experience I&#x27;ve ever had when ordering anything from amazon! Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> if anything this is a great moisturizer for your eyes. I haven&#x27;t seen a significant difference in the dark circles but there is a slight difference. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> 2 weeks.. Idk if it&#x27;s working.. Nothing so far</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and it does minimize fine lines. Somehow, I think the gel plumps your skin to create a more smooth appearance. I use it on my crows feet and forehead. I am 45 yrs old and this product helps me keep youthful skin. Most ppl think I am in my 30s. :-). I will re buy this when I run out.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW: I was hoping to reduce under eye puffiness with this gel. No product I have tried in the past has helped much. This gel is cooling and pleasant smelling, and reminds me of cucumber-based gels I have tried. While the puffiness under my eyes seems about the same, the skin itself seems more moist and hydrated. I tend to rub any surplus onto my hands and I do notice my hands look softer and younger, much less dry. The price is reasonable, and I like that it is a natural product that strives for high standards. The customer service is great. The directions are specific and when followed properly (allow gel to dry before putting makeup on) users should have no problems with flaking, etc. I plan to purchase again when this free sample runs out. It&#x27;s a pleasant part of my morning ritual that I have come to enjoy.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I only use it at night as it tends to feel a bit dry around my eyes when I put it on and need to put night cream over top of it to help with that feel. The company is super supportive as they emailed me to give me tips, see how it was working out and to send me a complimentary bottle for free (same size and all).</li>
            <li> For me, this product is worth buying. It actually helped in reducing my dark circles. After using it for a month I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I really like that I can instantly feel the product working. I use it around my eyes. I do look more alert and not as tired.</li>
            <li> I finished this product in 3 weeks by using it every night. The first week I was convinced because I felt it working and I felt a coolness of the gel around my eye. As the second week came around I was seeing no results and I even got some burning by using it a little close to my nose but I kept with it because I understand products can take a while to work. Third week I ran out, and I was disappointed because I saw no results with this product. I excepted more from a product with high reviews and ratings.</li>
            <li> I like the texture and cooling sensation on my skin.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products and like this one the best.  I don&#x27;t think I have a visual effect yet but my skin feels good.</li>
            <li> Have been using this eye gel for about 2 months. It only takes one little dot of it to go around both eyes. I can really see a difference in the crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes and also the sagging upper lid. I will continue to use this product. I have a drawer full of retired eye cream and eye gel products that I need to just throw. This eye gel is a keeper. It is really working. I also bought vitamin C serum and put it around my eyes too. Together the products are working great. Before and after pics of me shows that my wrinkles are not as visible as they were. I am a 60 y.o. white woman with some damage to my skin from sun and I recommend this product to anyone who is starting to get wrinkles. I would have given this product a 5-star.....but, it has not done a thing to help dark circles under my eyes. I am very happy with the results of disappearing wrinkles though.This product will not be going into my beauty products that do not work graveyard(wasted money)......finally a product that really works.</li>
            <li> This works well and you get alot for your money</li>
            <li> Very effective product. I&#x27;ve been using this more than 2 months now and I can see my dark circles lightening. This eyegel is now a part of my daily beauty regime. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love it. After 3 days of use, the darkness around my eyes diminished so much that I forgot to apply my concealer! It&#x27;s been a few weeks now and I am noticing the puffiness is reduced as well. I like the price, too. (My usual eye cream is $95.)</li>
            <li> smells good !!!!!  and actually good!</li>
            <li> I noticed reduced puffiness almost immediately!</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT SAW A DIFFERENCE IN A WEEK IN MY PARTNER&#x27;S FACE</li>
            <li> Miracle!  I&#x27;m 33 and have been noticing dark circles starting for about a year and a half. I noticed a difference the first day I put this on and my skin is getting better everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many lotions and creams and none even come close to this! And the price is incredible!!!</li>
            <li> First I have to say this seller goes above and beyond to make sure you are satisfied.  I&#x27;m talking extra above and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;I like the product, I also have been using it on my smile lines.  It seems to help keep my eyes refreshed as far as bags and dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice the skin under my eyes seems a bit drier (showing fine lines that I don&#x27;t have when it&#x27;s not dry) this could, however be related to the weather suddenly getting colder and dry.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely give it a try. They will refund you if it&#x27;s not satisfying to you.&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I&#x27;m 39 and starting to notice the tired eyes showing up more often. Try this to see if your eyes look more refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be adding a littke extra moisturizer under my eyes for awhile to help seal in all of that goodness.</li>
            <li> Good some improvement</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for close to a month now and have not seen any improvements, I still have the dark circles under my eyes and the wrinkles and puffiness. I would not recommend this product to anyone else. I have read the reviews for people that say they&#x27;ve  seen improvenments in as little as 3 days that is why I purchased this product. I use as directed on bottle, before bed time and in morning, I am not happy with the results of this product and will not be purchasing anymore.</li>
            <li> I see a significant reduction in fine lines &amp; dark circles. I love the consistency of the product &amp; now it is one of my favs!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month, and I don&#x27;t see a change.  I have also developed a small dry scaley patch under 1 eye.</li>
            <li> As we enter our 30s, my husband and I thought it would be a good idea to begin using serums and eye gel/cream to take care of our skin. This eye gel is hydrating, nourishing, and gives a plumping feelings. We use this gel at night before using our vitamin C and hyaluronic acid serums. It&#x27;s easy to apply, quickly absorbs into skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it&#x27;s a little early to see any results, after about 1 week of use, the area around our eyes feels healthier and appears to have a better texture and pigment. We&#x27;ll see how it effects lines, bags and puffiness. So far my husband and are pleased with this eye gel.</li>
            <li> Reduced the dark circles under my eyes and I have been wanting to get rid of it for a long time now. My face looks a lot brighter now than ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to give such a low review but I have to for all those with sensitive skin. I bought this for my dark circles and bags under my eyes. I used it for two months straight and the bags got bigger and the circles were not improved. In fact, I came to realize that the worsening puffiness is from this product! I have sensitive skin and could not tolerate the product any more. After I switched to InstaNatural hyluronic acid serum I saw the improvement I wanted. I give the product 2 stars for its high quality ingredients, the pleasant smell, and the price. Unfortunately, I just couldn&#x27;t tolerate it.</li>
            <li> Not the best eye cream will not order again.</li>
            <li> Impressed! So much I purchased one for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day! Noticed big improvement in my dark circles.  My friends will be ordering too!</li>
            <li> Not impressed! No visible difference. Using all 3 products as instructed.</li>
            <li> Love it ... It works just like promised and like all your other products I have purchased!!!</li>
            <li> I really am impressed with this product.  It does what it says it does. My dark circles, and puffy eyes improved dramatically.  I did not look so tired after using this for a few weeks.  I thought more makeup would solve the problem, but more makeup made my eyes look worst.  I am definitely going to be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with dark circles all my life. I&#x27;ve tried different products and make-up. Nothing seemed to work until this. I&#x27;ve seen a brighter under eye area and the eye lid itself is lighter. It absorbs nicely my skin also feels smoother and softer under the eye. I think it&#x27;s a product you should try.</li>
            <li> Definitely see improvement. The description says most people see improvement after 8 weeks and I am 5 weeks into using it. I will repost in a few weeks but so far I am impressed with the product, the price and the results.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is so lightweight and wonderful. It absorbs so naturally and feels incredibly clean without a residue. It has a natural cucumber scent that is barely there and no chemical feel or smell at all. I am so glad I tried this product! Good riddance fine lines!  Just another great product from InstaNaturals.</li>
            <li> When I first tried the Insta Natural Eye Gel, I noticed that it had a thicker consistency, which is not a bad thing, since I would love some extra moisture around my eyes.  But what I noticed is that the thick gel formula felt cakey around my eyes.  When I went ahead and applied the concealer on top, I noticed that the concealer felt sticky, and I was not able to blend it under my eye as well as I usually do, and the concealer kept giving me a sticky feel.  If I continue using this product, I would only apply it at nighttime.&lt;br /&gt;Also, as far as results go, I did notice that the saggy part under my eye has faded a bit, which is why I&#x27;m giving this review a 3 star.</li>
            <li> This cream is great for the eyes and gives extra moisture in the eye area.  I use it with the other InstaNatural face products which are great, especially the Rose Hip Oil I can recommend.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this gel...I leave it in the fridge and it is just so cooling and soothing and more importantly it works...I also enjoy that it is made of natural ingredients. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a month now and I can&#x27;t really seem to notice much change in my skin. Perhaps I need to use it longer to see any difference.</li>
            <li> I cannot comment on how well this product works for me, as I have not yet used it for 60 days consecutively yet.  So far, about 30 days in, no real change observable.  I can say I am not a fan of the pump part of the bottle. I find it hard to get the amount I want.  The pump is very touchy and always dispenses more than I would like.  The under eye area is pretty small and I always get about twice as much product as I feel necessary. This is a little frustrating, as it means it is going to be used up faster than I would like.  I have tried several times to find a way to open the container to perhaps scrape the extra off my finger back into the bottle, but I haven&#x27;t been able to get it open.  It acts like it should pop apart, but no luck yet. I don&#x27;t want to force it too hard and risk breaking it.</li>
            <li> Did not see much difference</li>
            <li> Came quick but didn&#x27;t see much difference at all.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for this company in general, I am absolutely in love!&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is always super cute and they always keep things very sanitary by providing either droppers with their products or in this case, a pump. Speed of delivery was incredibly quick and may I just add - AJ from Instanatural is amazing at his job. He made sure to reach out to me since I was purchasing these products for the very first time and he wanted to make sure I knew how to use them and how to get the best results. Kudos to him! That really does create quite a great experience for someone who is just being introduced to a company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But back to the eye cream. I have been using this every single day for over two months, both morning and night. I&#x27;m 21 and unfortunately, wrinkles under my eyes are hereditary and something that I have always had to deal with, despite my young age. I also have incredibly dry skin which only makes my wrinkles look much worse! However, since I&#x27;ve been using this gel, I have noticed a huge difference in the hydration of my skin as well as a huge fix in my under-eye dark circles. This is a gel formula so it&#x27;s very cool and feels great under the eyes. I love to put this on at night and sit back and relax and literally feel a change in the hydration under my eyes. It can be slightly sticky if you put it on your eyelids, so if you are using it in the morning before applying makeup, I would recommend waiting for it to fully dry. My wrinkles are still there but I never imagined those would go away in just two months, even if I do believe in how amazing this product is, after all.. It&#x27;s a hereditary problem I&#x27;m working with here.. But I have noticed quite a difference and I will absolutely be repurchasing this product until I&#x27;m much, much older. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s working it&#x27;s magic to prevent more wrinkles as well -- Also, I do put this on the side of my nose and a bit on my forehead on extra dry days just for some added hydration and cooling feelings. I love thisproduct and I do recommend it!</li>
            <li> did not notice anything great as far as reducing puffy eyes</li>
            <li> only been 4 days and not really seeing a difference in eye bags. either I am not getting enough sleep or drinking enough water. thought this would help me. I&#x27;ll give it until the bottle is out two months or so. if no change I will find another product to try.</li>
            <li> Using it for about one month now. Feels great on my skin and already see an improvement. Less puffy under eyes and less dark circles. Very happy with this product and HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> On the eye gel for about a month, no real improvement. I will continue as advised for an addition month (month 2). Let&#x27;s see what happens. I have taken your tip and have refrigarated the product and putting it on cooled. Joe P</li>
            <li> Does not get rid of bags under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel. I feel confident that this particular product can help minimize my dark circles and wrinkles. Well, this product&#x27;s dispenser is a pump. So it&#x27;s easy to use and control how much I put on under my eyes. Also, the substance is cloudy-looking cream and it&#x27;s very creamy. It&#x27;s not really thick, but it does build up easily if you accidentally put too much amount on your under eyes and it tends to dry quickly, too. So be careful when you apply the gel as you go because once it starts to dry, it&#x27;ll keep it that way. My suggestion is to tug your skin on your under eyes to smooth out the lines and wrinkles. That way, it&#x27;ll gradually help you to have wrinkle-free eyes! With that being said, I can see my dark circles are getting less obvious and I wish I could show it to you but the SD card input is kaput. *sad face*</li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised. Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doing its job by keeping my bags down. I really like the product.</li>
            <li> Im surprised at how much I like it. seems to work really well and you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li> I only use the product once per day and must admit it has done wonders on my puffy eyelids, dark circles and crows feet.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. I can feel the difference already.</li>
            <li> Mediocre at best. Feels like glue.</li>
            <li> Feel good on the eyes, not sticky.</li>
            <li> This eye gel  is one of the best products that I have ever tried[  I have tried most of all the top product lines, from  Murad,  Cindy Crawfords, to Perricone, and this is one of the most effective for not only  under the eyes, but for wrinkles on the face and neck as well.{ and half the price] I will be ordering more very soon!</li>
            <li> got it first day and can feel it tightening the puffy areas around my eyes. think I am going to like it.</li>
            <li> Proved that it reduces my dark rings under my eyes!  Wahoo</li>
            <li> I used it around my eyes but mainly on those horrible vertical lines above my upper lip.  When I was religious in application and did not miss a day, it definitely helped!  I probably used it 3 X a day, however, which is more than recommended.  But I did see definite results at 3 weeks, which is remarkable.  Please note that you must apply thinly or it will flake a bit when dry.  I also used a very nice oil in between.  Then I got sick and did nothing for almost 2 weeks and...I&#x27;m almost back to square one.  So, yes, it works if you work at it a bit!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 60 and am religious about taking good care of my skin.  Most people don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m my age.  I started using Youth Express Eye Gel for morning puffiness under my eyes.  After a month&#x27;s use, I have noticed it to be significantly reduced and some mornings, not even there.  The gel is so gentle that I use it on my entire face and neck.  My normal routine is to wash my face/neck with my Clarisonic in the evenings, apply NuFountain&#x27;s C20+Lightening vitamin C serum, allow that to dry and then use this eye gel.  I allow each product to dry before applying the next.  I finish with a moisturizer.  Same routine in the morning but without the Clarisonic and adding sunscreen.  The consistency is nice, not sticky and the fragrance is really light and nice too. I use mineral makeup which goes on easily.  I&#x27;m curious to see what the final results will be after another month but I already know I love this product and will reorder it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month, mostly as an eye cream for fine lines.  I have tried other eye creams that worked great but had no lasting results or are no longer on the market.  I get good (not great) results. I would buy this product again</li>
            <li> doesnt work another con stay clear</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using it for one and half a week nothing changes but i hope it would i love the fresh smell</li>
            <li> I have seen incredible results with the Eye Gel in my eyes and complete face.  I am 50 years old and people have asked me what cream I am using.&lt;br /&gt;I truly recommend it. !!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now and I really like it! I have noticed a decrease in puffiness around the eyes. I like to use a little extra for the rest of my face and it kinda makes my face look fuller and more plump. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any defferance.</li>
            <li> So far I love this product. Great moisture and no irritation for my very sensitive skin. The aloe smells yummy!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if this was making a difference, but I believe it truly has. I plan on purchasing more! I don&#x27;t have dark circles. I purchased it for a good moisturizer for around my eyes. I had some dry skin that kept peeling off right at my eyelashes. This has taken care of it!</li>
            <li> This eye gel stings like hell but it does lighten around the eyes. The stinging is why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me at all</li>
            <li> Have only had it for 2 days, hard to rate it but so far I give it an okay</li>
            <li> been using for a month now don&#x27;t really see a difference</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think so it did anything for me. I start getting itchy eyes and felt more line under my eye. Good Luck if it works for anyone else.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible. Doesn&#x27;t work at all and actually makes eye bags and darkness more defined. Don&#x27;t purchase.</li>
            <li> This actually helps my eyes and the area around them appear fuller after just 5 days of using it.</li>
            <li> I started a week of experience and satisfied with it , i will write the final result in the future</li>
            <li> This product really does seem to work - my under eye area looks better - mostly have noticed a reduction in fine lines. My husband is even using it!!</li>
            <li> Girlfriend and I have loved the eye cream thus far.  This has been my favorite out of a few brands.</li>
            <li> My job requires me to work all kinds of hours and staring at a computer screen for the whole shift. So, needless to say some days/nights, my eyes can be so exhausted and puffy. Before I started using this product, I didn&#x27;t even want to look at my face in the mirror when I wake up. I also have a birthmark under my right eye which makes my eye bags look even more terrible than they already do.This product helps diminish the eye bags and the puffiness that comes with it. Although I still have to use concealer to hide my birthmark, the fact that the eye bags are no longer my problem makes it the best deal ever.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help with my dark under eye circle which is what I bought it for. Did see some difference in lines on forehead. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Did not care for the product, had to return.</li>
            <li> The product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference and I used the whole bottle. I applied it morning and night.</li>
            <li> Very good gel for a good price. Helps my eyes for feel good.</li>
            <li> This simply moisture, that&#x27;s it! Not for dark circle! Useless,</li>
            <li> love it! Will order again</li>
            <li> I was incredibly skeptical of this product, and was about to order a different more expensive product, but this did the job. I had an extremely stressful December,  and I developed harsh bags and circles under my eyes. I also have fine wrinkles. I literally looked like I had aged ten years and nothing from the drugstore or at home remedies seemed to work. I tried this, morning and night and after three days the bags were diminished and the circles gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using morning &amp; night for a month. I love this product.  My under eye dark circles have definitely improved.  It doesn&#x27;t happen overnight.  The process is gradual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because of packaging. I do like the pump. A little goes a long way. However,  It only comes in one size and it&#x27;s hard to see how much is left in the bottle.  I don&#x27;t want to run out before i reorder.</li>
            <li> I have notice a difference but my dark circles wasn&#x27;t that bad  i also use it all over my face and neck and have notice a big dIfference in my skin  will continue to use it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any improvements in my dark circles. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about a month now and it hasn&#x27;t reduced my puffiness but I am feeling it tightening my skin. I will let everyone know the results after the 2nd month. Also, unlike many other companies, this company is very responsive and has reached out to me a couple of times to see how I like their product. So far, so good! :)</li>
            <li> same as the cheap stuff at walmart. No difference</li>
            <li> I been using coffee bean caffeine eye cream and it work good but after using this I kind believe it work better cus it do tighten under UR eyes.  Not only thAt it not sticky.  But i use Vaseline coco butter after to massage under my eyes and that helps big time to cus it like exercise that helps with the blood circulation and reduce fluid. And drinking a lot water and puting Vaseline coco butter on night before I go bed to keep my eyes moisture.  And most important drink lots water.  Grantnee if u do this U will see fast result.  And this is my first time leaving comment but i want to pass on cus it help unbelievable.  But massage 3 4 times with Vaseline coco butter to push the fluid and bring ciculAtion and blood flow under UR eyes.</li>
            <li> Light, odorless gel that not greasy. I almost overnight results.  I can put all over my face and eyes without any stinging or discomfort. Im  57 and pleased with the results esp. eye area. I will be reordering. Great product without the high $.</li>
            <li> This is very good and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Good&lt;br /&gt;Ship is very quick&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy&lt;br /&gt;Because I get good itemed</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing! !!! It cools my eyes within seconds. Also with a little massage your bags will diminish. I love it so much. Dries very quickly.  Non greasy.</li>
            <li> very nice feel, absorbs quickly and has made a noticeable difference in my fine lines and dark circles.</li>
            <li> This product goes on clear and you really don&#x27;t even feel like you have something on your face. They eye area is especially important and every little bit helps. I don&#x27;t really have a problem with dark circles so I can&#x27;t comment on that claim.</li>
            <li> Tingles a little once you put it on. My eyes feel refreshed. I&#x27;ll let you know about the circles in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> My eyes seems brighter and much less puffiness in the morning. My dark circles are still there thanks to having three babies, but this makes it seems more bright and less dull.</li>
            <li> I use the eye gel day and night,  it is smooth and easy to apply, my feel my eye skin is well hydrated and protected.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was cheap, the reviews were good, and I really hate going to the mall. I purchased it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 27 years old with reasonably nice skin. Fortunately, dark circles are not something that I generally have to deal with. Then why did I buy eye cream? Because I never have dark circles and bags and I like wine. You get weird looks when you are 27 and  have reasonably nice skin and show up with bags under your eyes on a Tuesday. I have used a few different eye creams in the past- cliniqe all about eyes and more recently origins ginzing.&lt;br /&gt;This product comes in pump style container....that works. The consistency is comparable to aloe vera. There is a slight cool feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I do not notice immediate improvement in &amp;#34;questionable decision&amp;#34; eyes as compared with other products I have used. So if that is what you are looking for, I would not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it every day for about 2 weeks. Although I don&#x27;t see any noticeable improvement, I don&#x27;t know if i had anything to improve upon. I will keep using it as a part of my normal skin routine until it is out, but will probably go back to my old faithfuls.</li>
            <li> While they say it takes about a month to see results...a week is more than enough.  The label says you can treat your whole face to it.  WOW  I especially like to tap &amp;#34;excess&amp;#34; from my eyes to my mouth area.  You younger ladies, I&#x27;m 68, don&#x27;t understand the wrinkles around your mouth as you age.  My face seemed in dire need of some serious exfoliating or some thing as there seemed a dry wrinkly layer over my face.  The eye gel seemed to moisturize my whole face so everything seemed to exfoliate all the stiff wrinkly layer leaving a healthy smooth and soft skin.  I am so delighted especially since this is the 50th class reunion of my HS class.  I don&#x27;t need to cover my face with make-up.  Oh yes, my eyes don&#x27;t seem to be old and the eye cream/gel does not irritate even when I need to put in eye drops.</li>
            <li> the wrinkles around my eyes are gone! The dark circles are still there though,  On the instructions it says you can place it on any part of you face, so I placed it on my pimples...well, it took my pimples off in one night!!! so happy</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye gel for three weeks now and I like it. I was using the Clinique roller ball for years and thought I should give this a try. It really does pull in the puffiness and so far I am very happy with this product. I am told it can take several weeks to work but I can already see the difference. Yes, I am a guy but I don&#x27;t want my eyes looking dark.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  I think that the peptides have also helped my eyelashes grow!</li>
            <li> This product is all that it says it is! Very light, easy to use and I see a difference in fine lines and puffiness already. I have only been using it for two weeks! The best thing, is that I didn&#x27;t have to pay an arm and a leg for it. I have done that with other eye creams for years. Buy this! You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Bought 3 InstaNatural products, used for 3 days (eye cream, moisturizer, and another serum) and made my perfect skin break out with very painful pimples all over my chin and neck. I&#x27;ll stick to buying $100+ Lancome or Clinique products. I never break out and this stuff jacked my face up. Refund couldn&#x27;t come quicker. Thank you InstaNatural for naturally making my face breakout! Late night online shopping gone bad. So many great reviews I have no idea why. But hey everyone&#x27;s face is different but come on I&#x27;ve used about everything from cheap drugstore crap to very expensive and this stuff really messed me up. Messed me up enough to write reviews when I normally don&#x27;t write reviews at all. First time writing actually on Amazon! Haha!</li>
            <li> Used for 2 weeks, haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in color or puffiness but it is very moisturizing. I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I have bought so many eye creams to try and decrease eye puffiness and an overall tired look. This by far makes the most difference. I&#x27;m 37 and a mom of three under 8.  I&#x27;ve spent hundreds trying to fix eye troubles and now aging eyes. Within a week I saw a difference. I just happened to try this because I am a frequent Amazon customer and searched eye creams and the eye gel came up. Really worth the money. I&#x27;ve spent hundreds on creams that don&#x27;t make a difference like this one. I also have sensitive skin and rosacea and after three weeks have no irritation!  So worth the money. I&#x27;m now going to order more products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so very pleased I ordered this InstaNatural eye gel.  Being an older lady with very sensitive and dry skin, especially around my eyes, I found this eye gel very soothing and moisturizing.  I&#x27;ve also been using it on two small horizontal lines above my eyes and they seem to already be less noticeable.  This eye gel contains excellent ingredients like hyaluronic acid, plant stem cells, peptide complex, matrixyl 3000 and amino acid complex.  It comes in an easy-to-use 1.7 oz. container, so that I can put what&#x27;s left on my finger lightly all over my face and I notice I now have less redness on my cheeks, too.  I&#x27;m definitely going to continue using this great gel and am very glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Nice cool gel for the eyes. I have noticed since using InstaNatural products my crows feet are almost gone.</li>
            <li> I like this product,  but you need to be real careful to not rib or it will burn.  My eyes look nice and healthy</li>
            <li> It is what I was hoping for - a topical answer to the bags under my eyes.  Right away I saw improvement, but after a couple of weeks the result is even better.  Wish I&#x27;d taken before photo because it really is a noticeable improvement.  Very happy with this product and have already purchased extras to have on reserve.</li>
            <li> I think this did decrease some puffiness, but it was so drying that it didn&#x27;t matter.  This dried out the skin around my eyes so much that it actually accentuated my fine lines. I ended up giving it to my mom.</li>
            <li> Starting to see results</li>
            <li> Really does reduce under eye bags consistently. This product is not a staple in my skin care regime. Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this eye gel! It is effective, lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. I wear it everyday under my makeup! I will forever buy this eye product!</li>
            <li> The product came quickly, but did not work for me. Cool, thick cream, unfortunately I didn&#x27;t see results, which I would expect for the price.</li>
            <li> For 8 weeks I used this Eye Gel hoping to reduce the bags under my eyes. I used it exactly as directed, twice daily for the 8 weeks they told me to use it, and I had zero results. (There is a transitory tightening that lasts until you wash it off). I wrote to Customer Service and they couldn&#x27;t have been nicer...they told me it didn&#x27;t work for everyone and refunded my money and sent me another product called Eye Serum for free. For 3 more months I used the Eye Serum. Results were still zero, in fact the bags have gradually worsened. So that&#x27;s 5 months I used the products according to instructions and there was absolutely no improvement. Why do so many people give it good reviews? I have no idea. Maybe it works to reduce dark circles but it sure doesn&#x27;t reduce puffiness and bags.  I really wanted this to work and I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Didnt notice any change</li>
            <li> i really like this product it does really works. thanks</li>
            <li> Did not get rid of my dark circles.</li>
            <li> Reduces puffiness and dark under eye circles. Feels cool and goes on smooth. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 42 year old female and have been using this product for a week now. So far I am LOVING this Eye Gel!!! Tiny drop goes a long way, which will make this bottle last a VERY, VERY long time!!!! Instant smoothness, blends into skin completely and very fast, brightens my tired eyes, and smoothed out my fine lines within seconds. Kind of gave my sleep-deprived under eyes a plumped up look. Very, very pleased so far! Looking forward to seeing what the long-term results will bring. Also loving the Age-Defying Skin Clearing Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> The company is wonderful.  They email me and make suggestions.  They said to look for an improvement in the eight weeks.  This is the end of my fourth week using it in the morning and evening.  I don&#x27;t see any difference at all but I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed.  I thought maybe a little improvement would start before that.  At this point I feel discouraged.  I am hoping it&#x27;s not just a pipe dream.  The consistency of the gel is very nice and you don&#x27;t need a lot so push the pump very gently to dispense the product.  If I see the improvement at the eight week, I will fill in the stars and give a glowing conclusion to my review.  Unfortunately I did not have any results using the product.  My dark circles are still the same.  Maybe it works for other but it didn&#x27;t for me.  I have to say I was disappointed because the company is very communicative and helpful.   Maybe I need fillers.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I wouldn&#x27;t have thought I would use eye cream until I was middle-aged at least. Now that I&#x27;ve seen the difference it can make I can&#x27;t imagine waiting for the signs to get worse before using this.&lt;br /&gt;It honestly does make a difference to the amount of puffiness and helps to lighten the dark circles. I&#x27;m so thankful that I tried this now while the problems are mostly perceptible to me, and hopefully with continued use they will not become a bigger issue as I age. Though I try to drink enough water, get enough rest &amp; eat right it&#x27;s just not entirely possible all the time; but I can tap on this eye gel and it helps to combat the damage I&#x27;ve done.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about a week and can already tell the difference. It&#x27;s very refreshing e</li>
            <li> It works!!! I always have puffy eyes when I wake up (since I was a kid) if I drink any water before bed. So I gave it a try day and night... after 2 days I have no more puffy eyes even I drank 4 cups of water last night before bed! I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this eye gel! Ive used other gels and while they may have helped with dark circles they werent hydrating. This does both. And a little goes a long way. Will be repurchasing for sure!</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying that I am 28 years old and have had some fairly noticeable under eye circles for the past few years. I used to work third shift for about a year and a half and I really struggled with taking care of my skin the way I was supposed to. I was pretty much a zombie during the day and I was lucky if I got six hours of sleep each night! I have become more concerned with my skincare routine over the last couple of years, especially since 30 is right around the corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Product: The way this product is dispensed is really nice. It&#x27;s a nice pump that distributes a rather hefty amount in just one go. I&#x27;ve come to only use about half a pump for my entire face and it seems to be plenty for my skin. I think this bottle will last me at least a couple of months, so the price is very reasonable. As far as the consistency goes, it&#x27;s similar to a gel shaving cream, but maybe a little more lightweight. It did not weigh my skin down at all, but it was a little shiny immediately after the application. After it&#x27;s soaked in, I only had a little sheen to my face, which actually just made my skin look more dewy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results: My skin LOVES this stuff. I do let it soak in for a few minutes before applying an oil free lotion moisturizer on top and it&#x27;s applied both morning and night, which is the recommendation on the back of the bottle. I noticed a difference in my under eye area immediately after applying this. Now, I research a product thoroughly and read numerous reviews before actually making a purchase, so I had absolutely no expectations going into this. I like to be realistic, no matter what the other reviews said. Did I expect to see results right away? Absolutely not. But I noticed that my under eye area immediately seemed brighter and that area of skin literally drank this stuff up. I don&#x27;t have to use hardly any under eye concealer now, which saves me time and money. I have also started to notice a nice vertical wrinkle line down the center of my forehead that meets right in between my eyebrows (I&#x27;m near sighted, so I&#x27;ve squinted pretty much my entire life), as well as the very beginnings of crow&#x27;s feet on the outer parts of my eyes, so I apply this pretty much all over the face, including the eyelids themselves. My eyelids have become brighter and more even toned as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: I don&#x27;t think is a miracle product, because I don&#x27;t believe such a thing exists, but I am absolutely impressed with this product so far and cannot wait to see how my skin looks with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy. This. NOW.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed intense differences in the few months I&#x27;ve used this. It helps a little for tired under-eye circles but I was hoping for better results.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a week now and i can already see the difference. I only use it on my eyes, though it says to also put on forhead and cheeks, my eyes don&#x27;t have that tired look anymore, the dc are getting lighter and it&#x27;s much firmer around my eyes, love it, hope it&#x27;s not just a temporary fix.</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel!  You don&#x27;t have to use much so this container lasts a really long time!</li>
            <li> I like this product.  A gel that is not sticky and can be used on other parts of your face as well as eyes. Lines and wrinkles seem to be softened.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet but its just been a week. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, so that&#x27;s a big plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months and it does nothing for bags.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and decided to order an Eye Gel.  I like it so far.  It helps to reduce my eye bags.  It took 2 weeks to see the result (I apply a thin layer, twice/day)</li>
            <li> I like it because of the smell because it smells like plants and organic. It also dries nicely. I just wish i noticed a difference. Maybe its just genetics for me to have dark circles. Wah.</li>
            <li> I did not see improvements on my eyes. Maybe because I don&#x27;t use it often enough. Will try it more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the cool and smooth feeling of the gel though. Haha</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t the experience I had expected but it&#x27;s still early and I&#x27;m going to give it more time.</li>
            <li> Great eye gel.  Very soothing.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this product. I started getting very small blisters in my eyes after 3 days of use. No changes in my eyes or forehead in those 3 days using twice a day as recommended.</li>
            <li> This cream is very refreshing and quickly absorbed into my skin. I have noticed less puffiness and I have even gotten my boyfriend to start using it.</li>
            <li> Youth Express Eye Gel has lots of ingredients that are on the skin care &amp;#34;hit-list&amp;#34; right now. I don&#x27;t know what works and what doesn&#x27;t. Hyaluronic Acid, Peptide Complex, Plant Stem Cells, Matrixyl 3000, Amino Acid Complex are listed on the front of the package. Organic ingredients! And the &amp;#34;not-in-our-eye-gel&amp;#34; list is great - NO parabens, sulfates or alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The folks at InstaNatural say this is good for the entire face and the package size will allow for that without breaking the bank. Most eye creams or gels have .5 to 1 oz. This has 1.7 fl oz which is comparable to most face care products. So one product might just do the job for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now what do I think of the gel? It has a nice cooling feel after application but there is no stinging. It glides on very easy. I&#x27;ve used it day and night. It helps; but then I don&#x27;t expect miracles. I just hope to at least maintain the status quo and Youth Express goes a bit beyond that. I expect any eye product I use to help me wake to eyes not so old and weathered looking. Not hooded and puffy. This does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!  My husband bought this for his dark circles, but I thought I would try it for myself.  In just a few days my eyes looked brighter and not so tired.  Then I read that you could use it on your face.  I have extremely sensitive skin so I was hesitant to use it anywhere else, but the ingredient list looked pretty safe so I went for it.  I am SO glad I did.  My skin has never looked better!!  I have some worry lines on my forehead that won&#x27;t go away, even with prescription creams.  After a couple of weeks of using this gel they are almost gone.  I am completely amazed.  For the past year I have been using creams prescribe by my dermatologist to help with my adult acne.  While the creams help, they have left my skin dry and dull.  I&#x27;m only 36 and I was starting to look old.  This gel has hydrated my skin and made it look a lot brighter.  I am so happy with this product!  If you have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t be afraid to try it.  Almost everything irritates my skin or breaks me out, but I haven&#x27;t had a single problem with this gel.  I&#x27;ve read that some people had trouble with it under their makeup.  I did too the first time I used it, but I have since learned that if I let it dry for a few minutes and then apply my moisturizer I won&#x27;t have any issues.  It has looked great under my makeup!</li>
            <li> did absolutely nothing for my skin. I have been an esthetician for years and this is complete crap do not waste your time or money it feels very sticky like glue on your face and you cannot put makeup over it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. Don&#x27;t waste your money and invest in something that actually works, even if more pricey.</li>
            <li> excellent product. Will not sting eyes if you accidently rub your eyes. Feels cool and soothing.</li>
            <li> As soon as I used this product for the first time I noticed an improved difference in how my eyes looked. The skin around my eyes continues to improve each day. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this gel and will continue using it in the future.</li>
            <li> A little background. I am a part-time stay-at-home mom of twins and work part-time. I am 30 and have fine lines and wrinkles as well as pretty significant dark circles under my eyes. I&#x27;ve always had them and I&#x27;ve always had to use some type of concealer to help lighten under my eyes up so I don&#x27;t look like an insomniac! My face is extremely sensitive to products. I buy all-natural make-up because I&#x27;ve had such a hard time with extreme reactions. I&#x27;ve had no reaction to this gel whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this gel in the end of December and noticed results within a week or two. I use this 2X daily. I apply this gel in the morning after I&#x27;ve applied face lotion and before I use my liquid foundation (if I work that day) as well as at night before I go to bed. I wait about five minutes for the gel to completely dry before applying anything over it. I can honestly say I didn&#x27;t really notice the results until I got ready for work a week after using it (no need to wear makeup when the only people seeing you are two and could give really give a you-know-what). I didn&#x27;t have to apply as much concealer under my eyes! I was PUMPED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about four weeks now and have noticed fine lines disappearing as well as a tightening underneath and around my eyes. I absolutely love the way this product feels and looks! I&#x27;ve started using it in between my eyebrows and on my forehead to try to diminish my &amp;#34;frown&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;contemplation&amp;#34; wrinkles.  I&#x27;m extremely happy with this purchase and will continue to use it! It&#x27;s definitely worth it for the results you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone! It&#x27;s worth a shot. What have you got to lose?! Wrinkles and dark circles. That&#x27;s what :)</li>
            <li> Uh, my eyes felt drier than the Mojave after using. You&#x27;re better off using Vaseline or coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I think this gave me more crows feet.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I have not used everyday yet. I will complete a review when I see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does moisturizes well, though, considering it is a gel - not cream. It does not make my eyes burn (I have sensitive eyes.) It does feel a bit sticky if you use on the upper lid, too close to your eyes. Would not recommend that.</li>
            <li> Works great!! Less puffiness after just a couple of weeks! Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Good result. Smoothed the fine line. Love it!</li>
            <li> Works well, noticed a difference right away. I have been using this product about 3 weeks now &amp; my eyes do not have the dark circles underneath them.</li>
            <li> As usual, InstaNatural nailed it. I gave this to my mom to try out as she has trouble sleeping and often experiences under eye circles. However, the skin around her eyes is very sensitive and many products cause them to water and sting. This eye gel worked wonders for her, all without irritation!</li>
            <li> This is one of the newer things I&#x27;ve purchased and I can tell it&#x27;s working already! My under eyes get puffy in the morning from sleep and my dark circles are intense. This gel has brightened my under eye area and reduces puffiness within minutes after applying! Not to mention a little goes a long long way!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! I also have a problem with unwanted facial hair, this product has actually slowed down the regrowth so I don&#x27;t have to shave everyday! I love it</li>
            <li> Feels very natural! My eyes look brighter. I now use it all over my face. Perfect under makeup as well!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fresh smell and wonderful creamy sensation to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent price as well.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Absorbs nicely, doesn&#x27;t sting and the best of all - it works. My colleagues noticed the results on week 3, I was told that I look more rested and youthful. I also purchased Retinol Serum from InstaNatural and I love it too. Great combination. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Had higher hopes for this gel but am still extremely pleased! I wish it had worked on my dark circles a little better but it has faded them somewhat and my under eye area is much smoother and feels better when I use this! I didn&#x27;t use it for a week and noticed a big difference from using it and not using it. Best undereye gel I have tried so far!</li>
            <li> My mom loves this product, she wants more!</li>
            <li> It has helped with the puffiness under my eyes and I&#x27;ve noticed my dark circles are getting better.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet...</li>
            <li> Just look the size of yhe bottle it is great! A lot if product for a razonable price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a week so not sure of the long-term benefits, but eye area feels cool, toned and hydrated.  You get a generous amount of product in the large pump and it&#x27;s more sanitary than a mini-pot.  The product even came with a 50% off coupon for my next purchase and I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does for me in a month!  Will re-post then.</li>
            <li> After a month of usage, I can say this product works better than other eye creams I have tried. I have hated the way my under eyes have begun puffing and sagging with age. (I am 48.) I tried many things (even Preparation-H!). Nothing has worked as well as this. I don&#x27;t know how moisturizing it is since it&#x27;s a drier gel, not a goopy cream, but it sure does the job on my puffiness.</li>
            <li> RESULTS!! I have struggled with dark circles my entire life so it was wonderful to find something that actually works! Within a few weeks of using the difference was noticeable and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Excellent eye gel, I apply a slight amount of it at night to my eyelids and massage them for one minute or so, and the results are amazing. Now I&#x27;m 42, and I&#x27;m getting compliments about how my face looks all the time. People, mostly men, say that I look like 30, and that is a mood booster for any woman.</li>
            <li> Best face cream ever, I used this cream for the face and is making my skin look AMAZING. I&#x27;m about to buy my second one today. I love it</li>
            <li> I tried it but within 4 days of using the product I started getting small pimples below the eye. It wasn&#x27;t for me. InstaNatural Customer Service is absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> Never thought a cream can do this. Within seconds after applying it, I can see the difference around my eyes. It definitely firms and plumps the skin. Love this!</li>
            <li> I wanted to write a rave review saying it performed a miracle on my puffy, tired eyes but I can&#x27;t.  I will say this product has improved my appearance and reduced the puffiness.  I think realistically that is the best I can hope from any product.  I was provided this product at a reduced rate for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Using daily on under eyes showed some improvement.</li>
            <li> My eyes look great.  Feels great going on and my under eye area does not dry out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product but doesn&#x27;t really do anything for my eyes. Eyes just got more puffy....</li>
            <li> I bought this for the dark circles under my eyes &amp; it didn&#x27;t work at all &amp; actually made them all puffy!&lt;br /&gt;But I liked the way it felt under my eyes so I put it on my face &amp; neck loved it! I now use it every morning on my face &amp; neck &amp; my face feels younger &amp; tighter! A friend commented on my skin &amp; said it looks like I get a facial once a week!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled dark under eye circles and puffy eyes for a long time. I’ve spent much of my adult like working shift work, plus I’m a busy mother and freelancer. I struggled through many days without having gotten much sleep. My eyes certainly show it with dark circles and puffiness, which I’ve sought a solution for years. I’ve tried many eye products that promise to reduce puffy eyes and have tried several home remedies. I’ve been using InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel for about four weeks and am pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve seen visible results with decreased puffiness and bags. I&#x27;ve also had some lightening of the darkness under my eyes. It didn&#x27;t completely make the darkness disappear, but it did help lighten and brighten my eye area. The eye gel feels cool and refreshing, as it goes on. It makes my skin feel tighter, not uncomfortably tight but just enough that I can feel it’s working. It absorbs quickly, plus it has a fresh cucumber scent. I do look refreshed and less tired. I don’t only use it around my eyes, but also on my forehead and my jowls, where a little sag is starting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allow it to absorb and dry several minutes, then you can put makeup on over it. Makeup goes easily on top of the gel, as long as you give it sufficient time to absorb. If I don’t wait long enough, I have noticed makeup around my eyes turns out blotchy and I have a hard time blending it in.</li>
            <li> No value. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I have used this eye cream for two weeks, and I have not seen any change.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised. The product was here before it was due and that was amazing. I was so surprised!! Great product, Easy to use, Thanks to the seller who deserves more than five stars in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Did not complete my review due to a lazy computer touch tone screen. In summary, I think that, with a few more weeks, the puffiness will continue to diminish.</li>
            <li> After using this for about 3 weeks now, the skin around my eyes just feels a bit tighter.&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it feels immediately after I&#x27;ve applied it for several hours afterward, it&#x27;s a cool and tighter feeling that has a gentle smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other night creams that claim to do this, but those seem to leave a burning sensation, this is simply cool and tight.&lt;br /&gt;Slight improvement in darkness, but that was never a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Absolutely sold on this product!  Sold on this company - great communication!!!!  I use the C serum - let it dry - then use the eye cream.  Great for puffiness which was my concern.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this cream because it&#x27;s gentle on my eyes and doesn&#x27;t hurt my overly sensitive skin like other eye creams. I have used so many eye creams before that made the skin under my eyes feel like it was on fire! This one has never bothered my skin and has significantly reduced the puffiness under my eyes. I am loving it so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free - for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.

            <li> Absolutely great for my over medicated body, my skin is rejuvenated and not dull anymore, my face is radiant and the company selling this product really cares about you and your experience with the product, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ll stick with what works for my delicate skin and great customer service. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect immediate results.&lt;br /&gt;But as I use, for me after one week, I could see reasonable improvement under my eyes.Now I don&#x27;t look much tired!</li>
            <li> This eye cream does a great job of moisturizing and firming the eye area. It&#x27;s a great value as well.</li>
            <li> Have re-ordered based on noticeable improvements. This product matches well versus many other well known, highly advertised and candidly, pricy alternatives. As a male, I like the daily result. I’d recommend at minimum, a 60 day cycle.</li>
            <li> I am a male using this product to reduce the dark circles and puffiness above my cheeks. It seems to be working, I put it on at night before bed and I appear to have reduced the darkness under my eyes but the puffiness is still there. It smells like cucumbers which is a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have put this product really close to my eyes since I was trying to cover the entire bottom dark circle under my eye and sometimes it gets in my eyes but does not burn which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of this eye cream since it is very light. I have been using it almost every morning and night for the past month and the area around my eyes seem moisturized.</li>
            <li> I loved the light cucumber scent, it made it feel spa like! I also love the light cooling feeling it had when applied. It was nice to apply at night and let it set in to do its magic. I have noticed a difference in the puffiness of the under eye area. Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles and fine lines under my eyes. I was almost out of the eye cream I had been using, and it wasn&#x27;t helping much, so I went searching for something new to try. After seeing all of the great reviews for this, I decided to give it a try. I did not like it at all. It made my under eye area look crepey and awful with makeup on. It made my skin feel sticky and tight. I would not recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on other reviews on Amazon, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I&#x27;ve been using the Eye Gel for about a week and have seen improvement already!  I have bought many, many, MANY eye creams in the past with zero results.  I am 46 years old and battle daily with under eye bags.  I don&#x27;t feel tired, I just constantly look tired.  This eye gel has already helped this dramatically!  I&#x27;m a believer and will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about two weeks and I love it.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with dark circles but I do with puffiness and tired eyes.  The eye gel gives instant refreshing; it just feels good!  I store it in the refrigerator; the added coolness enhances the refreshing effect.  The list of ingredients is impressive, and I like that it doesn&#x27;t have added color or fragrance.  I like this product better than higher priced products I&#x27;ve used with similar ingredients.  The customer service I&#x27;ve experienced with Insta-natural has been very enjoyable and exemplary....they should give lessons to other companies :)</li>
            <li> it works! after a week I saw the result!</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on reviews and it being much more affordable than other products. I think it definitely diminishes wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I am truly blown away. I am not kidding. I have searched and searched... I HAVE FOUND. Very upset that I did not take pictures. I am only on day 6 and cannot believe how quickly the skin around eyes tightens. And my dark circles... I came to work today with no makeup on except for mascara. I NEVER do that. I highly recommend this product. SENSATIONAL.</li>
            <li> Mmm I love the smell of this product. When applying it to your face you need to be careful and use minimal force to push it out. I off tan get to much liquid for my face, which still isn&#x27;t that much more then I need. Also, it doesn&#x27;t burn if it gets in your eyes!</li>
            <li> Moderate success with my dark circles so far, I can tell after I have applied as it makes my skin tighter.</li>
            <li> I have not had time enough to write about this product.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected from it. As soon as it touches my skin I feel instant coolness under my eyes espically. It feel like your putting two cucumbers on your eyes, but better! It really helps perk me up as soon as I wake up, it feels really nice and that&#x27;s the best part. As far as under eye wrinkles go, i have actually noticed a small difference, but more than anything I feel like i&#x27;m prventing wrinkles by using this product. Would like to purchase again after I run out, good price.</li>
            <li> has not made a difference after one month of using.</li>
            <li> This really works great.  The dark circles and the bags under my eyes have diminished a lot  I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> it has only been 5 weeks since I have been using this product and I have already noticed a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks along with the Eye Serum and it truly is amazing the quick results. Morning and evening I dab the Eye Serum all around my eyes including the lids and let it dry completely. Then I layer with the Eye Gel. You don&#x27;t have to do this, but I feel more is better, though I realize this is not always the case. I am new at trying the Insta-Natural product line, but so far I&#x27;m very impressed by the natural ingredients and that they are chemical free. That is the first thing I look for in all products that I put on my skin. What goes on the skin, goes into the skin and into the body. I appreciate that the ingredients are specific to what the skin requires to be healthy, plumped, and naturally glowing. They use a high percentage of these important ingredients which is good. I see the fine lines around my eyes smoothing out, and the puffy upper eyelids literally shrinking. I&#x27;m truly pleased with the product and would recommend it. I&#x27;ve tried them all, and this one works!</li>
            <li> I am not the type of person to be rating products BUT I have to give it to InstaNatural Youth Express.  It is simply fantastic!  I am 48 years old and have noticed that my skin is lacking elasticity and radiance.  I have been looking for that elixir that would bring back some elasticity from inside my skin not just superficially as most creams do.  I&#x27;m happy to inform that this product has made me look more radiant and has made my skin plumper as I use it in my whole face.  If you don&#x27;t see results right away use it for at least 2 months.  You will see the difference!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of months now.  It doesn&#x27;t provide adequate moisture for me (I&#x27;m 40), so I add a little aquaphor and that seems to help a lot!</li>
            <li> I really love the cooling and firming properties of this eye gel! Once applied, it dries quickly so that I can apply make-up or head out the door and start my day. On the weekends when I usually do not wear make-up, I will apply once in the morning and once in the afternoon, for hydration! Great Product, simple, nice calming smell and a  great value for my beauty dollars! I am on my second bottle, first one lasted about three months because I choose to apply the gel generously and now my boyfriend is also using it! I am 100% satisfied</li>
            <li> Puffy eyes run in my family I am 24 and scared I&#x27;ll look 50 in just a few years. I&#x27;m a little less scared after using this eye product. I will continue to buy it because I see a dramatic change already and it feels amazing after I put it on.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see a difference. I think i&#x27;m better off drinking tons of water and flushing out the toxins in my body.</li>
            <li> Gel goes a long way. Don&#x27;t need much to cover under the eye area. I found it to burn for the few minutes that it was drying. Texture is light and can definitely be worn under concealer. I did not notice any difference in the appearance of dark circles, puffiness, or fine lines around my eyes after 5 weeks of use 1x a day however.</li>
            <li> I bought this to remove my dark circle under eye. It did not help me at all  to remove anything neither my face got any chances at all. I don&#x27;t recommend at all . It&#x27;s not worth it buying this one. If the company gives me my money back $ 19 plus the shipping I would love to do it ASAP. It is expensive and useless to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was recommended by one of my friend but he bought it reading the reviews , so this is not for me and any men. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNTIL IT GURANTEE YOU !!!!!!</li>
            <li> InstaNatural eye cream tightens and smooths under your eyes. Easy to use pump lets you control how much you need.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in dark circles. It makes the skin under my eyes feel very dry.</li>
            <li> can tell a difference. good product</li>
            <li> This one really works! Great product, and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me.</li>
            <li> love it! it is the perfect consistency for eye gel..not greasy or heavy</li>
            <li> Works fair if you apply multiple times daily</li>
            <li> A little goes a looong way. I wish it wasn&#x27;t so runny in terms of consistency but other than that it is pretty decent and my skin seems to like it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Within a week the skin around my eyes looked less wrinkled, firmer.  I even applied the product to the smile wrinkles by my mouth and saw a difference (wrinkles beginning to diminish).  I&#x27;ll be purchasing more of this product.</li>
            <li> Sorry but my wife had a severe allergic reaction to this - red and swollen eyes - threw it away immediately. Of course your mileage may vary, she must have been allergic to one of the ingredients, and of course the word natural in the name means nothing</li>
            <li> It felt tacky on my skin and it&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve used that broke me out around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This has similar effect than the other eye cream I reviewed, which similar price and I find it hard to say which is better than the other. But both are great product</li>
            <li> already seeing great results</li>
            <li> Very effective! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for approximately one month and have found it to be just as good as the more expensive eye creams.  It does not burn or sting and goes on quite easily.  A little goes a long way so one bottle will last quite a long time as you only need to pump a little at a time.  It has helped somewhat with the dark circles and puffiness, but if you are looking for a miracle worker, this is not it, its effects are gradual but visible so I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this to review and love it! I have puffy eyes with dark circles a lot because I have problems sleeping and this took care of both of those problems! And it smells so fresh!</li>
            <li> eh this product is okay I have SEVERE eye bags at the ripe age of 19 (genetic bags) this literally does nothing for me. I was excited to order this because of all the positive reviews and the affordable price too bad it didn&#x27;t work out. Not too sure if all those reviews are fake or not, but I defiantly wouldn&#x27;t buy this if you have severe genetic eye bags like myself</li>
            <li> ok, so I was a little doubtful at first since I did not see any difference using it the first week, then low and behold by end of week two, amazing....it looks like I am well rested and under eye makeup goes on really well. There is quite a bit in that bottle which should last awhile. I will definitely purchase again:)</li>
            <li> I purchased this eye gel when I didn&#x27;t feel I was getting good results from another product.  I love this product and have noticed a difference in the area around my eyes.  The skin is firmer, lines less noticeable.  I don&#x27;t use the product over my entire face as suggested but I do use it round my lips and on the lines from my nose down (commonly called marionette lines)  I&#x27;ve noticed changes there, too.  I&#x27;m perhaps a fourth of the way through my first container. Another great plus is the price point for the size of the product and the ease in dispensing the gel.  I&#x27;m hooked and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Quite simply - it does exactly what it says it does.  Now imagine that!!!</li>
            <li> Although I have not found this to be amazingly effective on my dark circles after a month, I do find that I love using this as a light facial cream. I pay attention to areas that I could become problematic in the future and am happy that this does not make me greasy. It does firm well, I still use it under my eyes for puffiness but I just have not seen a huge improvement in my dark circles. Since it is a bigger bottle and it is recommend on the bottle for the entire face as well I think I will use it on my lazy days when I just want to use one product for my entire face. Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for the bags under my eyes sadly.</li>
            <li> Great product! Been using it now for about a month and noticeable improvement around eyes (reduces puffiness and softens laugh lines). I have sensitive skin and no sensitivity at all to the gel. A little goes a long way when applying and gives a soothing cooling sensation. Very pleased with this purchase and plan to buy more once my supply runs out.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have been applied this eye cream for almost a month now. It works on my puffed eyes and eases my dried fine wrinkles. Use it daily to get the best result! Love it!</li>
            <li> Another claim that falls short.</li>
            <li> Works Immediately, very impressive results</li>
            <li> I use this gel on my crow&#x27;s feet,frownlines and laugh lines.,really helps smooth out lines...Love the texture and silky feel.I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been using it long enough to help with dark circles.</li>
            <li> Apparently the word is out across the entire www that it was me. I was the kid who tied the pork chop around his neck to get his dog to play with him.....because I am just..plain....ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So those beautiful, youthful folks at InstaNatural sent me some of their products to try out, assuming I&#x27;m sure, I&#x27;d be needing a lifetime supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it interesting that this uses hyaluronic acid, because I&#x27;ve had this substance injected into my knees for joint lubrication. Apparently it&#x27;s made from rooster combs, what will Tyson be selling next, chicken tongues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a scientific approach to this and used photos to analyze the results it provided. I used it for 18 days and finished 3 days later with my last photo and this is what I found out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly instant results after applying, this does what it claims to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These results fade somewhat and for a night out, clean up and re-application is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some overall improvement after about a week, but not so much after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Improvement fades after about 3 days of not using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This being a gel and used around the eyes it&#x27;s hard to get a small enough amount to apply, so I believe this will last many months, possibly a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container, contents and sellers are all top notch and professional, this is not a dollar store product, but somewhere in between a prescription and high end salon items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My testimonial, after just one weeks use, I spoke with a woman and didn&#x27;t even get my face slapped. I now call it anti slapping gel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended and with the money back guarantee, you can analyze your own photos. Although my therapist told me to never do it again, there have been nightmares.</li>
            <li> I have used this for almost 6 weeks. No improvements in puffy eyes and dark circles. It doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype. I had high hopes because of positive reviews but I don&#x27;t see any change in my situation. I was truly disappointed of the poor results.</li>
            <li> So far, I am very satisfied with this product. I know it is too soon to see results, as I just started using it a week ago, but I do notice a slight glow to my skin and the bags under my eyes are not as noticeable. I made it through my work day yesterday not looking as tired as I normally do. I will continue using this product!</li>
            <li> Does not do what it supposed to do</li>
            <li> Second bottle for me and really like this product. Came on time.</li>
            <li> I have been using  Eye Cream For Dark Circle  for about four weeks now. I had medium dark circles, mostly under my eyes, and moderate puffiness. Using it once or twice a day, the darkness went from medium (which most folks see on themselves as hideous and disfiguring. . .) to mild rather quickly. The puffiness is a bit better, but just a bit. I am hopeful that with continued use that both issues will be reduced. However, this product has definitely improved the appearance of the skin around my eyes. It is an effective moisturizer, and seems to decrease the puffiness of the old eye bags. Importantly, it does not irritate the eyes, and has no obnoxious scent.i received a sample of this product in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I like this product. Seems to help with eye puffs. Will probably order again.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural&#x27;s Youth Express Eye Gel does not irritate my eyelids and I have VERY sensitive skin.  (Most eye gels burn and cause a rash.)  It does smooth fine lines and is refreshing.  For 1.7 oz. it is a better buy than other eye products I&#x27;ve tried, too.  I have also recently used two other InstaNatural  products that cause NO irritation:  Youth Express Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer Cream, which is non-greasy, very hydrating and does smooth wrinkles, and their Vit. C serum which has faded sun spots over the one month period I&#x27;ve used it.  I&#x27;m quite impressed by the effectiveness of these products.  InstaNatural&#x27;s customer service is also one of the best I&#x27;ve encountered:  They respond quickly to questions and appear truly interested in what their customers think.  I appreciate their money back guarantee, too.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!!! I have serious dark circle and after two weeks I can see that is better than before. I believe that my panda&#x27;s face will desapear. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I Love InstaNatural for continuing to let me test their products for them!  This is another great quality product that really works!  The gel feels really refreshing, especially in the a.m. and it absorbs quickly into your skin.  I have even been using in on my neck as well.  They say you can use it on your entire face but I am already using other products right now so I have just been using it on my neck.  It leaves my skin well moisturized and has really helped with puffiness too, works great!!</li>
            <li> I believe this product along with the toner, and serum have given my skin a youthful glow. I really enjoyed using all three products together and that they are fusing nature with science to give our skin all it deserves! I did get my items for free for a review but have no issue saying when I do not care for a product! I have done so in the past and would do so again if I feel an item does not meet standards but this product and its accompanying products do that and more. I really have enjoyed the process of getting to know about InstaNatural and I will use them again in the future once these run out.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the first time I used it, can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results</li>
            <li> I have only used about 1/2 of the first container and so far I see no difference. I don&#x27;t feel I can make an honest opinion at this point. So far I see no difference.</li>
            <li> At first I was impressed with this eye gel!! It did seem to be diminishing the puffiness over and under my eyes, but them I realized, no matter how long I waited for it to dry, that after I put my moisturizer and foundation on, the gel started caking up and I could peal it off like a facial mask!!! So now I only use it when I am nit going to be applying my makeup!!!!!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT SERVICE.</li>
            <li> Makes under eye area feel tight and dry.  Made concealer show every line and wrinkle.  Don&#x27;t like at all.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long, long way.  After the first application I realized this.  If you use too much it&#x27;s tacky.  Start with very little and add more if needed.  Love the results, I don&#x27;t look like a walking zombie anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received the below products for free for review on \\&quot;Pickles and Peppers\\&quot;.

            <li> Good prod, works as described.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as I am a 42 yr old woman with small crow&#x27;s feet starting to form around my eyes...Nothing I have purchased seems to have done the job..After I read the ingredients, I was amazed at how many incredible and powerful natural items included in this gel...But, I was still hesitant..It has been over a week now..I use it in the morning and evening, after my cleanser, and serum. I let it dry, then follow with my moisturizer..All I can say is WOW!!!!  My under eye wrinkles are almost completely gone...And a tiny bit goes a long, long way...I massage it under my eye, and with the remainder, I use it in my cheeks, and on my forehead...(Hey, I&#x27;m sure not going to waste all these amazing plant stem cells, and peptides, why not get an entire facial treatment?)  My face, and especially under my eyes, are so firm and plump, this is well worth your money...But, I also use Watts Hyaluronic Retinol Serums regularly, so I&#x27;m sure that boosts it...But, if I had to pick just one, I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;d pick this.....Good luck ladies...!</li>
            <li> do not waste your money on this item. it does NOT help at all.  i was sorry to have purchased it.  cannot return because i moved overseas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, and am happy with the product and results I&#x27;m getting.  I can see a reduction in my undereye puffiness after I apply this in the morning.  It only takes a very small amount, which makes this very cost effective!</li>
            <li> OK product - a little sticky to use under makeup so using it at night only</li>
            <li> I have used this gel mainly at night, and I have seen some  results, I do not get much sleep therefore, I also have the undereye puffies....I decided to start using during the day also, this might erase all signs of puffy eyes and the dark circles sooner.  I had to contact the seller about something and let me tell you, these people were GREAT!!!!!! easy to work with very plesant.  Delivery was swift as well....overall this was a great experience with the product and with the seller.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the plesant odor the eye gel has, now this is just me, but, it smells like cucumbers.  Happy eye geling....</li>
            <li> I find this product very good. I see it is helping me a lot. Even though I have very big under eyes bags, I can see how this eye gel is helping my eyes look better. I use it everyday before using make up. You have to let it dry for a couple of minutes, and it stays perfectly under your make up. ;)</li>
            <li> Great to use as a moisturizer at night</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had great results using this product. The fines lines (crows feet) have been noticeably reduced as well as dark circles under my eyes. I like that its not oily either.</li>
            <li> Just received product yesterday so I can not attest to any long term affects. HOWEVER- as a new mom with horrible bags and dullness not to mention a lifetime of sensitive skin and periodically stress-induced adult acne, it is a HUGE achievement for a product to not irritate my skin while simultaneously making it feel amazing. I previously was using the more expensive Lucene eye day creams which was delightfully rich and alleviated dryness but almost made my eyes look visibly more tired. It also would cause little red bumps if it was absorbed anywhere near my cheeks. I took a chance and put this eye gel all over my face before bed last night (and after applying another miracle product, Lancome&#x27;s Vissionnaire) and woke up to visibly improved skin despite being up through the night with an infant. I will def recommend this to anyone in need of a quality moisturizer and eye cream.</li>
            <li> Has to be the best eye gel I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Works really well!</li>
            <li> Not too impressed with this eye cream, have had better..</li>
            <li> Love it. I love every product I have tried from Instanatural. I will never go back to the overly advertised aging products. These are 100% better.</li>
            <li> I received the Youth Express Eye Gel from Amazon for evaluation of the&lt;br /&gt; product and to share my honest and unbiased opinion of the results as stated.&lt;br /&gt; I have used Youth Express Eye Gel each day and continue to see positive&lt;br /&gt; results not only in the appearance of my eyes but also the texture of skin&lt;br /&gt; around my eyes.  The product is by far the best that I have used to&lt;br /&gt; eliminate dark circles and give my eyes a more youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt; I am well pleased and will recommend Youth Express Eye Gel to my friends&lt;br /&gt; and family.&lt;br /&gt; Thank you for allowing me to sample and evaluate this great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; L Ayers</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work been using this for 4 months it doesn&#x27;t work!!</li>
            <li> This product is nice. I have been using it for about 5 weeks and have started to see some results. I use it around my eyes, on my forehead and smile lines.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it! This product really does help improve the looks of dark circles and I&#x27;ve even seen improvements in the bags under my eyes. Has helped me look less tired and less like the crypt keeper.</li>
            <li> Yes I recommend this product. You won&#x27;t get a quick fix. I do see some progress. I been using it for over a month now.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT! THIS INSTANATURAL EYE CREAM FOR DARK CIRCLES HELP MY EYE SO SOFT.  EVERY MORNING AFTER I WAKE UP MY EYE ALWAYS PUFF AND BIG WRINKLE COME OUT.  BUT I USE THIS EYE CREAM. FEEL REDUCE THE WRINKLE.  THANKS I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT DISCOUNT PRICE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I started using this product because I was so happy  with the  Argan oil hair treatment  by  InstaNaturaI  I decided to try their eye serum. Unfortunately I inherited puffy eyes that gets worse when I am  tired or with  allergies and now at  forty two (42) years old I needed something that would really work. I must say that I  am pleased with the results so far I am not as swollen and puffy around the eyes as much and the results have been gradual. I am happy and  will continue to use the product. It is just refreshing to find something that really does what it says it can do.  I am even more impressed with the care and concern I personally get from this Company, they actually send personal emails with instructions on how to get the best results from their products and follow up with your progress.  This only validates the care they invest  into making this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I have this product as a gift. It feels really good on my face I enjoy this project.I have an discounted price for this product in exchange an honor review.</li>
            <li> I like the cooling  effect but it doesn&#x27;t help me with dark circles I have to mix it with a cover up eye cream other wise I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this eye gel.  Most eye products I have tried irritated my eyes and made them water.  This one works great with out the irritation. I have really seen a difference. I do recommend this gel, and the price is almost too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Been using a few weeks now, twice a day. I have puffiness under my eyes. It seems to be helping a little?? But no real noticeable changes yet.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using till it&#x27;s gone. Hoping it will help some.</li>
            <li> Great for my sensitive eyes, and does the job of reducing under eye puffiness Honestly need more time to continue use of product..</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received this eye gel free for review purposes.  It does come out of the pump as a gel, it doesn&#x27;t take very much at all to cover the eye, cheek and forehead area.  I absolutely LOVED how my skin felt after putting this on, it was so smooth and soft!  It didn&#x27;t affect my makeup foundation at all, in fact I feel like my foundation went on smoother and more evenly after having put this on first.  I have very sensitive skin and this gave me no problems at all, no redness or itchiness, it even felt cool when I put it on.  I will update this review in about a month after I have been using it longer and let you know about how it does as far as my wrinkles are concerned.  I will say though that on my eyelids after putting this on it did seem to make it appear to be smoother and not as wrinkly.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. I honestly have no idea if it actually did anything for my skin, but it felt so refreshing on my eyes in the morning. I would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this for free to test out, but this review is honest and 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Never received Eye gel. I received Vitamin C gel and Vitamin C cream.</li>
            <li> It meant for Eye but it&#x27;s too dry for me. Maybe good for people in tropical area?</li>
            <li> by S. J.: The directions say for best results use for 90 days. I was committed to doing that even though after a month I was seeing absolutely no positive changes for dark circles and puffiness. HOWEVER, the worst part was the RED EYES. Even though I did NOT place it directly below the lower eye and certainly not in the eye, after a month the inner corners of my eyes became tomato red. Thinking the reason was something else-a cold or fatigue, I did not initially think it was the product. After all, I had been using it for over a month, but when I decided to test by not using it for a couple days, by the second day my eyes were clear. The product doesn&#x27;t live up to its promise, just like every dark circle/puffiness product I have tried.</li>
            <li> Use this hydrating eye gel to give thirsty eyes a cool, refreshing drink. This product leans more on the natural side. The formula is oil-free and light-weight; ideal for any skin type as well. It works to refresh, tighten, and cool puffy eyes. This product does exactly as it&#x27;s described. Lifts and cools eye lid. It&#x27;s a bit sticky but nothing that I notice once applied. It really lifts my upper eye area.  The cooling sensation feels similar to using cucumber slices on the eye lid. I&#x27;m using this product during the day as well as night.</li>
            <li> Do you know how I can tell if I look tired to other people? I can tell by looking at the bags under my eyes in the mirror. I may not actually be tired, but if I have dark circles under my eyes, it just makes me appear that way. Now that Iâ€™m trying the Youth Express Eye Gel by InstaNatural, Iâ€™m hoping thatâ€™s about to change!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, itâ€™s a snap to apply this around your eyes. You dab into place, whether you are just concentrating on the skin around your eyes, or even use it on the rest of your face! It has hyaluronic acid which is a great moisturizer (that Iâ€™m already using) and it uses all natural and organic ingredients to protect your skin from sun damage, dark circles, puffiness and more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the dark circles or bags under you eyes start to fade, you wonâ€™t believe the difference you will see. Plus, folks around you will notice and probably ask what youâ€™re doing different; what you tell them is up to you, of course!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use this around my eyes and let it soak in (just a minute or two). Then I use a similar product with the hyaluronic acid and vitamin C on the rest of my face, then my favorite moisturizer over the top before I apply my makeup. It sounds like a lot but it only is a few extra steps, and I really notice the difference the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li> This eye gel did nothing for the puffy eyes nor did it help with my dark circles.  Just another product that promises but does not work.</li>
            <li> GREAT EYE GEL. MOISTURIZES AND BRIGHTENS. SMELL LIKE FRESH CUCUMBER.I USE IT ON MY SMILE LINES TOO. HUGE CONTAINER FOR THE PRICE. DID&#x27;NT HELP MY HEREDITARY DARK CIRCLES.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this cream</li>
            <li> Definitely helps my dark circles from being so noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye gel for about a month and a half or so, and I have to say it works for me! I am a semi insomniac, I have to take something for sleep almost every single night. But anyway I got really bad bags from not getting enough sleep, so I went to check out amazon to see what I could find. There were a lot of options but I&#x27;m glad I got this one.</li>
            <li> I have tested quite a few products when it comes to skin care and while I don&#x27;t have too many issues with puffy eyes or dark circles, I do get them from time to time.  Honestly, I was amazed at how immediately this product worked.  Since I don&#x27;t have many issues with regard to puffiness or dark circles, I didn&#x27;t expect to see the results that I did.  This product is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light cucumber scent, thick product but definitely worth the cost.  A little of the product goes a long way and it feels really nice on the skin.  I didn&#x27;t really experience it to be sticky which I like.  It worked well with my other skincare products and I like that it didn&#x27;t burn the eyes or cause me any skin irritations which many products can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great eye gel and I recommend it completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product from Insta Natural however all reviews and recommendations are my own and 100% unbiased.</li>
            <li> Lately my husband has been fussing about the puffiness under his eyes.  He wanted to find something that would work to make his eyes look a little better.  When the InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel arrived he couldn&#x27;t wait to see how it would work.  The product is very easy to use and according to my husband it does help with tired eyes.  We mainly used this product with my husband because he complained about his eyes being puffy and looking like he had bags under his eyes.  He wanted to use something that was safe for around his eyes and would help his eyes look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the product arrived he read the directions and decided to start using it in the mornings.  He would get up wash his face and then apply the gel under his eyes, on his forehead and on the base of his cheeks.  He then left it like that.  I would recommend using a moisturizer on your skin after the gel has dried as well.  He repeated the steps each day and within a few days his eyes seems less puffy in the mornings and through out the day.  The dark circle that started to show up started to improve and he didn&#x27;t look tired all the time.  The gel helped his eyes look more radiant and ready for the day.  He has also recommended the product to a few co-workers and family members.  He likes that it&#x27;s made from natural products and it didn&#x27;t cause his skin or eyes irritation.  The bottle is very travel friendly so you can take it with you when you are traveling.  You only require a small drop of gel twice a day for best results.  If you&#x27;re looking for something for your eyes then give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this product for review purposes.  Any opinions expressed are my own</li>
            <li> For most of my life I&#x27;ve noticed that I have puffiness and dark circles under my eyes.  I&#x27;ve tried using a wet washcloth with hot water but that only does so much.  There have been few products that can reduce my problems, but none have been able to make such a difference that I find them to be worth it.  What I like about this product is, for me, after using the [[ASIN:B00KCFAZTE Eye Cream For Dark Circles, Puffiness, Wrinkles &amp; Bags by InstaNatural]] for the last two weeks I have noticed an impressive reduction in puffiness and darkness under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reduction actually started within the first use, however now it&#x27;s much much better than I could have ever hoped.  I fit this product into my routine after I take a shower.  Just a small press and I split the amount between my two under eyes.  Overall, I&#x27;m really pleased and couldn&#x27;t ask for better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> I loved the product. Really worked well for me. Though my dark circles have not completely gone, they have reduced. Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> This really works. Lines smoothed and dark circles gone!!!</li>
            <li> I found this product when I surfed &amp;#34;the best beauty products of 2014&amp;#34;.  I hoped it would be a good way to cut costs - I was spending $$$&#x27;s, ok $$$$&#x27;s on products  annually and I just felt like there had to be less expensive way to good skincare. I was buying Clarins serum super lift advanced extra firming eye countour serum for twice the price for 1/3 the product. I just didn&#x27;t know. OMG - I LOVE INSTA- NATURAL!!  It makes me HAPPY as the skin around my eyes is brighter and tighter! (I&#x27;ve been using a little extra for between my eyes and in my smile lines.) It&#x27;s the BOMB! I wish I could bathe in it.</li>
            <li> It dries up very quickly and it&#x27;s not sticky nor greasy. It&#x27;s the perfect eye gel for summer time.</li>
            <li> The best! I could not believe how great it feels and last along time</li>
            <li> Did not work as I had hoped for dark circles.</li>
            <li> This Eye Gel has a nice light texture and goes on very smooth.  It  keeps the eye area hydrated throughout your day, plus it does not interfere with eye makeup.  It also softens and hydrates the eye area, making those fine lines much less apparent.  This product has been supplied to me free of charge for review.</li>
            <li> Good eye cream.  I noticed a decrease in my under eye circles and puffiness, also in some of my fine lines after using for a month.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product and it does not blend well with moisturizer and makeup. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Definitely works for dark circles and fine lines. I actually use it over my whole face under my moisturinzer (also from InstaNatural) and I&#x27;m quite pleased. In 2 weeks I totally noticed a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and mouth. Even decreased the puffiness and slight bags I was developing. A bit sticky, but not intolerable at all.I HIGHLY recommend InstaNatural products!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife. Here&#x27;s here review: I have 2 small children that like to wake up way too early in the morning and through out the night. I noticed that I was starting to get puffy eyes and dark circles along with the first signs of wrinkles. I don’t have time or the desire to go to the beauty store with 2 littles to look for eye cream. I’ve used several other InstaNatural products and have been pleased with them so I went to them for this need. After a week of using it every night before bed I’m noticing that my eyes aren’t as puffy, the dark circles are getting lighter and I can’t tell how it’s working on the wrinkles yet. It’s very thick gel so a little goes a long way. A pea sized amount covers eyes, forehead and cheek. It doesn’t have a smell and is clear. I haven’t used it under makeup during the day because it’s too thick. I think honestly the makeup would just cake around it. Overall I would recommend it and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mom of a very active one-year-old and my job requires very long days which leaves me looking very tired.  I&#x27;ve been using different eye creams for almost 15 years, but I still looked exhausted.  Since using this product, the circles and rings under my eyes have diminished considerably and I&#x27;ve only been using it for one month.  Additionally, their customer service is outstanding.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t really helped my specific eye problems, sometimes it stings the skin. Wish I had better things to say about it.</li>
            <li> This is helping already after about a week or so, I have really bad allergies and asthma from when I was a kid and now I am 50 so I have puffiness and moderate darkness under the eyes so I bought this hoping for just a little improvement well so far I do notice some change in a short time,InstaNatural make very good products I am definitely pleased with this one</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I see a difference. I bought cause the rating were good.  But it didn&#x27;t really work for me. I&#x27;ll continue to use it until it&#x27;s finished since i already spent my money on it.</li>
            <li> Love this not oily eye gel. works great!</li>
            <li> I just finished the whole bottle before I give my review about this product. Honestly, It did not do anything for me. I used it as a serum for all my face, and my eyes. No,no change at all. I&#x27;m not gonna buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> Hey this is Ashley from It&#x27;s a PAshion (www.itsapashion.com) &amp; I am writing from an account I share with my mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a blogger, I get sent tons of products, but Insta Natural actually works! With all the stress in my life, I get huge bags under my eyes and this removes the bags and makes me skin look refreshed. I 100% recommend this product for you. I feel so much more confident and beautiful using this product. Also, I have very, very sensitive skin and this product has been gentle, yet effective for my skin. Try the product today. (-:</li>
            <li> I have been using the Instanatural Eye Cream for Dark Circles in conjunction with The Instnatural Eye Serum. The combination of these two products has been working for me. I find the skin under my eyes to be tighter and firmer. I cannot attest to this product as a dark circle remedy, because I do not have this issue.&lt;br /&gt;I have creases in my forehead and between my eyes. I have been using this cream nightly and I have  see an improvement in my wrinkles. I am not claiming this to be a miracle cream, but some reduction in the size and severity of my wrinkles is always welcome. I am hopeful that with continued use of this product I will see an even larger improvement.I was given this product during a promotional period to test and try.It has been working for me, therefore I am recommending it based on quality and performance.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with results.</li>
            <li> Nice gel!  Helped the darkness under my eyes, but still a little puffy.  I probably just need more sleep to help with the puffyness!  Feels great on tired eyes!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I use this everyday under makeup. I do notice a tightness of skin around my eyes, reduced lines and puffiness. A little goes a very long ways.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I thought with all the great reviews, there had to be something beneficial in this product.  Guess again.  Not only did this do absolutely nothing for my eyes, but it also stung and irritated the delicate skin I was trying to repair.  I would highly discourage purchasing this product unless you have very tough skin, or don&#x27;t mind wasting money.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps to diminish lines around the eyes.  I use it around my eyes and on my forehead.  As the gel dries you can feel a tightening of the skin.  As a lifetime allergy sufferer, I have had dark circles under my eyes for as long as I can remember.  I have seen a huge improvement from using this eye gel.  I use less and less under eye concealer every day!</li>
            <li> dont see any difference in my under eye darkness, but it gives a nice moisture . i have benn using every night and morning for 1 month.</li>
            <li> This product is a great moisturizer for my puffy eyes. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday, and I can see the difference. I&#x27;m looking forward to see the final results. I would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work! I used this 2-3 times a day for the past 6 months, and no results. My dark circles almost exactly the same as it was from the beginning. But the up side to this product is it smells decent.</li>
            <li> This stuff works.  I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in dark circles, bags, after using for 3 weeks.  Great  customer service, too!</li>
            <li> Nothing dramatic. It stings a little when applied to dry skin at times. Could be do to sensitive skin.. or reaction to ingredients.</li>
            <li> Great product. Nice smell. Nice texture. Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. I originally got it for my boyfriend (who likes it very much), but I may end up buying myself a bottle so I won&#x27;t keep stealing his!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product faithfully for 3 months and absolutely no improvement</li>
            <li> Not only is the package HUGE for an eye gel - a teeny tiny bit can go a long way.  The easy to use pump is great, but I only need to depress it about 1/4 the way down to get the amount I need for my undereyes AND I still have enough product left to dab on other trouble spots on my face and neck.  This is a non-irritating, cooling, refreshing clear/cloudy gel that smells faintly of cucumbers which only adds to the spa-like feeling of using it.  The product literally glides on and absorbs quickly into the delicate undereye skin.  It feels succulent, water-based, definitely not oily or greasy at all.  I would use this all over my face if I had really thin, sensitive skin - or if I had really oily skin and didn&#x27;t want an oil-based serum sitting on top of an oil slick.  This reminds me of the oil-free product lines that carry gel moisturizers to help balance and soothe your skin.  The bottle is big enough that you wouldn&#x27;t be running out quickly if you used it on more than your undereyes.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that this is by far the BEST eye cream that I have ever purchased and applied with visible results in terms of puffiness and dark circles as I always go to bed after 1am and get up at 7am. It smells as if it has a bit of cucumber in it and very cooling even though I do not keep it in the refrigerator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should definitely give it a try and you will be amazed. We still got to be practical in the sense that less or no cigarettes, limit your exposure to sunlight, no constant winking or rubbing your under eye.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is really helping my dark circles go away. The smell is pleasant and I enjoy the fact that I&#x27;m looking younger. I use it twice a day and am seeing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Use it every day!</li>
            <li> I got this product free for a review. Its Insta Natural Eye Gel. I have been using it for about a month and I like it. The skin around my eyes is sensitive and this product has no burn at all, not even a tingle. It also has no smell. I liked that. It comes out of the bottle in a pump, its a clear gel that goes on very light. It soaks into the skin in minutes. I have noticed the skin around my eyes is softer, and my crows feet a little less noticeable. I am pleased with the results so far. If you are looking for an eye gel then give this one a try. If your skin is sensitive then this is the eye gel for you.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered it,I don&#x27;y know the effect of it. Sorry.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing my mother and I both have seen results immediately!  I will purchase this when first bottle when I&#x27;m finished.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few months, haven&#x27;t seen any significant results.</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to use. I use in the morning and before I go to bed. I can visibly see a with the bags under my eyes. The puffiness goes away and the skin appears brighter. I am extremely happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I have been using this product along with the eye serum. This one I use in the morning. I noticed that there was a immediate tightness to my skin. It is clear so it didn&#x27;t matter if I used makeup over it. It dries quicky, not sticky at all. I have to say it seemed like my makeup went on nicer. It worked.. I&#x27;m happy. The best part was my mom noticed, she commented told me I looked good and well rested. She asked me what I was doing and I told her about these products. Happy to say she is ordering them too!</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT. I USE IT ON MY HUSBAND JUST ABOUT EVERY NIGHT AND I CAN SAY  SEE A BIG DIFFERANCE. HE REALLY DONT LIKE FOR ME TO BE PUTTING STUFF ON HIS FACE BUT THIS STUFF IS AWESOME!!!!</li>
            <li> (First of all I&#x27;ve been using  this product almost 5 days now)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Most of the under eye treatments that I’ve used in the past have been in the form of a serum or moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;The Insta Natural Under Eye Treatment on the other hand is more like a gel or ointment because it’s thick. (No roll or brush)&lt;br /&gt;but honestly thickness isn&#x27;t big deal with me if it works as well but unfortunately strongly I&#x27;m thinking about to return it because;&lt;br /&gt;1. White flakes on my under eye bag ---&amp;#62;yes it&#x27;s really not necessary&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;m male so that meant can&#x27;t hide white flakes on my under eye bag as much as like female (can&#x27;t make up as like female)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Little bit of irritating ---&amp;#62;oh well maybe my skin is too sensitive? so can&#x27;t blame to production&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should I use it few days more? or should I return it? OK let&#x27;s give it to more chance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks and have noticed a brightening of my under eye area. I don&#x27;t typically have an issue with dark circles, but when I don&#x27;t sleep well and have slight darkness, this helps lighten it up a bit.</li>
            <li> I love lovr love this product. I got 6 of the instaNaturals. Skincare products &amp; since I&#x27;ve been using u can see a visible change in my skin. I an so happy with this product. I highly recommend..</li>
            <li> I am so smitted by this InstaNatural brand! Every product I&#x27;ve gotten from them has been so amazing! This Youth Express Eye Gel is no exception!&lt;br /&gt;They pull out all of the stops when it comes to their quality ingredients: hyaluronic acid, plant stem cells, amino acid complex, peptide complex, and matrixyl 3000, vitamin e, and jojoba oil to name a handful.&lt;br /&gt;My husband suffers from dark undereye circles, crows feet, and puffy/saggy skin. Since I&#x27;ve been making sure he is using this morning &amp; night, you can tell that he looks so much more refreshed and younger even! This stuff is a little miracle! It&#x27;s potency isn&#x27;t just limited to your eye area though! You can firm, plump, improve the tone and elasticity of your entire face with this little treatment!</li>
            <li> Good, will continue to use</li>
            <li> I really like InstaNatural products, and this eye gel is super effective.  I received a sample for testing purposes and had a great experience with the products and the company, they have great customer service.  I&#x27;ve tried so many products for my dark circles and this has made the most impact.  It&#x27;s good for my sensitive skin and it feels good because it&#x27;s cooling.  And at $20 it&#x27;s way cheaper than the $40 I&#x27;ve spent on other eye creams!</li>
            <li> My skin around eyes absorbs it instantly, and feel moisturized. It is not too expensive and makes me feel good.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is gentle.  I have been using it for over a month with no effect.  I have used the &amp;#34;OZ&amp;#34; brand and it was a fairly good product.  I was expecting this one to be more effective but did not meet my expectations.  I have stopped using it and will go back to &amp;#34;OZ) brand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 2 weeks &amp; I, as well as others definitely notice the difference! Seems to take years off the skin, highly recommended !</li>
            <li> I have been using this since I received it and it does nothing for dark circles or bags.  It is kind of an instant tightening cream but when you let it dry and put concealer on, it goes back to normal.</li>
            <li> I can say I see a difference in about 30min&#x27;s or so .The puffiness is not all gone but it is better and I am real grateful for that . I will be buying it again.Thank You</li>
            <li> Works reasonably well for just the 2 weeks I have been using it.  It is a bit stiff under my lower eye lids after it dries so that make-up does not go on quite as well.  We&#x27;ll see what happens in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the puffiness reduction for me.  Also, as a gel, it is shiny on the skin</li>
            <li> I expected more after reading all the reviews.  No noticeable difference after using this product for 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really take the wrinkles away but makes your under-eye area feel ALIVE.  I use it everyday just for THAT ;o)!!</li>
            <li> I loved the eye  gel and I would recommend it to anybody who wants to try it .</li>
            <li> Within a week, i saw a noticeable difference.  I have been using it consistently, and i am very impressed!  This has drastically reduced the puffiness and darkness around my eyes.  Often times, i struggle with a good nights rest, so this is where this product comes in, to hide that puffiness and sign of getting older.  Works great!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This eye gel has really helped with the fine lines around the crows feet area - but what I really have noticed is a big improvement on the eyelid under the brow area where I have started having some crepe-ness.  It looks smoother and my eye-shadow goes on much better.  I like this product  very much - been using for almost 2 months now.</li>
            <li> Because of high ratings, I bought this product.Used it for 2 months. Unfortunately, it doesnt work for me at all. It just dries the skin around eyes and doesnt hydrate it. It got to the point that the skin is so dried out now that it hurts. Do not expect a lot from this product.</li>
            <li> While this product really helped diminish the dark circles and fine lines around my eyes, it has really helped reduced the &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; under my eyes after 5 weeks of use.  I believe with continue use my &amp;#34;baggie&amp;#34; eyes will not be an issue or at least not a serious issue.  I think price is fair and it helps me.</li>
            <li> FINALLY found something that helps bags under eyes.  I tried 3 other &#x27;quality&#x27; products but never saw results.  With this, I saw less bagginess in 2 weeks!!!</li>
            <li> Works well, goes on smooth. results are pretty quick. Did not irritate my skin which is typical sensitive. I love all of the InstaNatural products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so tired all of the time and have dark circles under my eyes from not sleeping well.  I chose to buy this when I seen a promotional price and glad I did my dark circles are now gone.  I did follow the instructions on the package.  I love this and it did not bother my sensitive skin.  Great product.  Goes on nice not oily or greasy.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this cream as well as a similar product, both of which claim to do the same things. I used both products, one on my left eye, one on my right, and the other product I used worked much better than this cream. Its cooling, and it feels nice when applied, but I didn&#x27;t notice any changes to dark circles or fine lines. I probably won&#x27;t buy this product again, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it for an all over face gel.</li>
            <li> Works great as an eye cream. The directions state to use wherever it is needed, but I found that if I used this product anywhere besides under the eyes it would cause a breakout. I contacted the seller regarding this issue and was refunded, no questions asked. I have purchased multiple different products from InstaNatural and have experienced nothing but quality service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are worried that the product will not work, then at least you know if it does not work for you they will immediately refund you your money since you were not completely satisfied. Will continue to buy their products.</li>
            <li> I like it. My eyes look better now. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is awesome for one&#x27;s eyes.  I have no dark circles or puffiness.  My eyes look naturally nice in the morning when I get up, and throughout the day.  I&#x27;m so pleased with is eye gel!  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I put some of the gel around my eyes and I felt a firming action with this. This is a clear gel and I don&#x27;t think it has any scent really. I think this could really help with any under eye issues you may have. I don&#x27;t think I have dark circles or puffiness really. Maybe a little crows feet. I will be interested in seeing how much more this will help over time. Only been using a short time so hard to tell, but think this could work.&lt;br /&gt;I received free for review only.</li>
            <li> This makes me have dry skin. Not cute. Disappointed!</li>
            <li> i read the reviews before buying this product, when i bought it it worked well i though however over time im still in the same boat with the dark cycles and crows feet...im a 26yr old african american and im still looking for something to help me with this.I think this will work better with concealer on top of it.</li>
            <li> Did not see improvement at all.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Awesome customer service!</li>
            <li> I think this is a very good product. I have not seen my dark circles go away but I haven&#x27;t been using it for that long so I can&#x27;t say that the product won&#x27;t over time take away some of the darkness. However I do have to say that this is very hydrating. As soon as you put it on you can feel it sinking into your skin. One of the first ingredients in it is aloe which is very good for the skin so I was happy to see that. And honestly the best part of all is the packaging. I hate having to put my fingers into a jar of eye cream. So I love that this has a pump (which even is flexible) and there is a large amount of product. All in all for the price I am very impressed!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work on my eyes even I have been using 5 months already. Now i have to look for the other brand.</li>
            <li> No joke, and quite possibly psychosomatic, but I felt and saw an immediate difference around my eyes. I was blessed with horrible, deep under eye circles and this helped those seem not as deep and crows feet seemed less noticable as well. I also have very sensitive skin which wasn&#x27;t bothered at all.</li>
            <li> doesnt really do anything, used as directed.</li>
            <li> this is a great product</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye gel, night and day, for a few weeks now...It&#x27;s really cooling on the eye, and plumps up the skin under your eye. You can use this all over your face, I myself, concentrated it on my under eye.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 3 months and do not see any improvement for my dark circles. It doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried other creams for years but this one is the best I have found, beating Avon eye cream for sure</li>
            <li> I love having this eye gel in my beauty cupboard, and adding it to beauty routine. I haven&#x27;t used an eye gel before, but this one has me hooked! It&#x27;s goes on great, feels really soothing, and makes the skin under my eyes look better - more even toned, less wrinkled, and more moisturized. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love make-up , electronics , toys for the kids just about really anything I am willing to try, incase a family member wants to know if its worth the price and does it work. Well, Insta Natural emailed me asking if I would be interested in trying out 2 of their products. One is called Youth Express Eye Gel and the other is called Youth express Eye serum. Well lets get started on these facial products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to start out with the Youth Express Eye Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there are so many things I like about this product, I am 30 years old a mother of 3 girls and a wife. My 2 older girls are sorta a hassle when its bed time , but mostly my 8 month old she used to sleep through the night and now she is on a schedule waking up at least 2 times a night and wanting a bottle, and then after that she wants to watch cartoons so I am barley getting sleep. Since I have to get up at 6 am get the 2 older girls ready for school, I always look tired and have really bad dark circles around my eyes. Which is a reason I wear make-up so you really can’t tell but some of the time you can see the circles through the make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you are probably wondering what are the steps to take to help reduce the circles. The directions say put a small amount around the eyes, forehead and cheeks. Allow to air dry for the product to absorb into the skin. For best results I use the product as directed 2 times a day. If you are wanting to , to help the aging process you can use this all over the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen a small difference since using the product. Products like these take time to have a affect to the process, it just don’t happen over night. I apply this all over the face and when I apply my make-up my dark circles under the eyes are barely noticeable. Which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There really is a small scent to me its more of a flowery scent which does not bother me, I apply the gel on first then my make-up. Since using it I have seen a difference and can not really tell my dark circles are there unless your really up close. I actually am going to get a bottle for my mother in law, this should be in every young women and older women’s beauty cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what contains to make the dark circles go away and your skin feel healthier and younger? Well i’ll tell you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.Hyalurobic Acid –&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Plant Stem Cell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Peptide complex&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.Matrixyl 3000&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Amino Acid Complex.ur really up close. I actually am going to get a bottle for my mother in law, this should be in every young women and older women’s beauty cabinet.  So what contains to make the dark circles go away and your skin feel healthier and younger? Well i’ll tell you  The ingredients:  1.Hyalurobic Acid –  2. Plant Stem Cell  3. Peptide complex  4.Matrixyl 3000  5. Amino Acid Complex.</li>
            <li> Works to hydrate, but does not help with dark circles after two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Followed instructions and see absolutely no difference. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> It does not do much for me. I think it&#x27;s my age. Probably nothing will help when you are over 60.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing eye cream for dark circles and puffiness! My wife has dark circles and asked my to buy her this gel.&lt;br /&gt;She is very happy with this eye cream and I can see how her eye area doesn’t seem to be as dark anymore.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a mediocre product. All it seems to do it cool the skin for few mins but then it actually sets a film around the eyes which makes you think it is firming the skin but it makes it worse in the morning. The better products are more expensive but they get absorbed in skin well. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for the eye area....soothes, and smooths out the under eye area....also plumps up the skin</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Have noticed with every application the fine lines and wrinkles softening.  I have used may face products in my day and this is tops hands down. I use it all over my face and to my surprise have noticed my age spots disappearing.  I am on my second bottle and will keep ordering .  Can&#x27;t get to much of a good thing! Quick shipping too!</li>
            <li> A very nice product.  Gentle around the eye area, and its made from natural ingredients.  I noticed a reduction in puffiness after using it for several days.  I got this product for free to try and give my honest opinion on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month and it seems to be too drying for under my eyes. I think I&#x27;ll have to finish it off on other parts of my face or chest. I have shown no irritation but it just does not plump up my under eye skin.</li>
            <li> I only buy eye gel a few times a year as the stuff lasts forever, so i usually forget who/where I bought from in the past. I will be remembering this stuff though for my next purchase. Price is good, and feels good when applying and seems to last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After using for over two months. I have not seen any results. Save your money!</li>
            <li> Ok...my family has hereditary under eye puffiness. I am 40 and over the past 5 years my  puffiness has increasingly gotten worse. It&#x27;s one of those issues that really bothers me. I have tried many, many different products and didn&#x27;t see any great results. I decided to purchase instanaturals eye cream based on its great reviews. I noticed a difference within minutes of applying this product!!! I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night for about 3 weeks. It really, truly works!! My eyes look much less puffy, skin is soft and smooth. No irritation and works perfect under make-up. I will continue to use this and purchase more before I run out! I may even be able to bypass that under eye lift! ;)</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting something different from this cream, but I used it for several weeks and did not notice any results.</li>
            <li> The product does not absorb at all and leaves a film on the skin.  Does not reduce puffiness under the eye.</li>
            <li> Well I have given this product 2 months to work and am disappointed with it. It has done nothing for my dark circles,nothing. As for wrinkles it really has not helped with that either. I see no difference in them. The only thing that it has done is firmed up around the eye but that lasts for maybe an hour. It just did not deliver for me what they said. A refund would be nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great just not working as fast as I would like there is  difference in the swelling due to my allergies.  I wll purchase again!</li>
            <li> So far I really like it I&#x27;m going to make another order hoping it will continue to work as well as it has already</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it enough to give a helpful answer.</li>
            <li> Before bed  I apply this to my face it drys fast and my face seems a little tight but then feels fine, and when I apply this in the morning and want to apply makeup I have to use another lotion so I can get the make to blend better. Not sure if I will buy this again. Now I only use at night.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really notice a difference with the dark circles or puffiness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from puffy eyes and bags for years. I&#x27;ve tried everything...spent so much on expensive products. I gave this eye gel a chance. The improvement was visible after a week. Be sure to allow product to set for a while prior to applying shadow.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve finished the entire bottle, taking it apart to get every last drop. I used it 2 times a day, morning and before bed. I have to be honest I did not see much if any of a difference between the before and after pictures I took. I know a lot of people are saying great things about the eye cream but unfortunately I&#x27;m not one of them, maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m a 51 year old guy is the reason I didn&#x27;t see any change. I will not be purchasing or can honestly recommend anyone to purchase this eye cream.</li>
            <li> Very good product, haven&#x27;t seen any result for puffiness yet. I&#x27;ve used it about a month.</li>
            <li> I have not idea, but I am so sick of these cremes getting 3000 plus reviews on here. Come on....this is staged junk. A high end product will maybe reach 1000 on occasion, but not this or any other items like this. Not sure what they offer reviewers but let it go.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is very soothing!  I have been looking for an eye cream that helps with under eye puffiness and this seems to do the trick!</li>
            <li> Great product. My lines under neath my eyes are smoothing out and disappearing.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Only needed a small dab and it covers very well - a little bit goes a long way!  I used morning and night to help reduce dark under eye circles - I could also feel my skin tighten a bit right after application!  Highly recommend this product - it won&#x27;t give you back the sleep you missed, but it can help you look refreshed anyway!</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great!</li>
            <li> I tried Eye Gel as suggested for dark circles under the eyes, but saw no improvement.  I have requested a refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for exactly one month now and sadly, I&#x27;ve seen no difference or change in my under eye dark circles or wrinkles. It&#x27;s a shame because I really thought this product was going to work considering all of the positive feedback it recieved.</li>
            <li> Noticed no difference.</li>
            <li> I can see slight improvement near my eyes, however, I have not been using it every morning and night so I&#x27;m sure that is the reason why I have not seen a drastic change. I haven&#x27;t allowed it to work to its full potential. Will continue using it for sure though! :)</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this cream very much (cucumber) and it goes on easily and is well absorbed. I have not seen and dramatic improvements since I have started (about two weeks), but I am optimistic that longer usage may yield positive results.</li>
            <li> Ok I never write reviews and I thought well just like other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products was skeptical about the results with this product but thought I&#x27;d give it a try....worked like a charm in days!!. I am 51 years old, male,  work too much etc. and get really tired, dark circled eyes. Thought nothing would help but maybe this would just lighten it up a little. By the end of second week dark circles were almost completely gone. I actually saw results in 2 days but wasn&#x27;t quite sure...thought I was seeing things but by end of first week the darkness was almost gone and it was completely gone by second week. It was truly weird. This product really works. Goes on easy and really small amount goes a long way. Great product.</li>
            <li> Another great product, helps if I get rested and then use it, but would buy it again!</li>
            <li> This stuff works.  It has relieved me of my dark circles and there is no pealing or burning of my skin.</li>
            <li> wonderful product can see results right away lighten up my dark circles, will order again :)</li>
            <li> See no difference.  Called the company, they said you have to use it for several months before you see results. :(</li>
            <li> It does seem to reduce the appearance of dark circles and puffiness, but it is not my favorite eye cream. The smell is not great and i&#x27;m just prefer the gels and serums to a cream but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many products from InstaNatural.&lt;br /&gt;This eye gel is again another star product for me.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients don&#x27;t irritate my eyes and the gel is quickly absorbed without the feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other eye cream products from other brands, many of them actually make the skin around my eyes feel dry after couple hours, but instanatural eye gel actually keep the skin moisturized for a long time, which is a plus besides diminishing puffiness!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have been using it for a month and my skin feels smoother and translucent. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Feels great put on face .&lt;br /&gt; Goes a lomg ways with 1 pump on your face, don&#x27;t feel anything, can&#x27;t real tell much. Have used for over a month now .The price is right.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a week but I do like how it makes my skin feel tighter.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and so far this gel hasnt caused any irritations and seems to be getting rid of my dark circles. Its too early to see any improvements with wrinkles. I think it might be a keeper!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I noticed much of a difference from using this product. I used it consistently for a little over two months before giving up on it. I really wanted to believe that it would improve my fine lines, especially after reading such great reviews but I&#x27;ll have to keep looking.</li>
            <li> I like this product I just started using it and it feels great. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Sticky, bad and makes you look older if you stop using it.👎&lt;br /&gt;Go for Botox 👌</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a change.</li>
            <li> My wife loves how easy this product is to use. It goes on her skin great and doesn&#x27;t drip off like some similar products. This moisturizes her skin and makes it feels soft. She also has some scars from living in the Philippines. Some fire ants got her leg and she wanted to get rid of the scar. This stuff works great on that too. The scar is beginning to fade. I have a scar from surgery, that I may try this on to see what happens. This product does wonders for the skin and my wife is telling all her friends about it. Was happily provided a review product to try out. We can&#x27;t wait to try out more of their products.</li>
            <li> I received this from InstaNatural to try for free.  It was ordered through Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this Eye Gel comes in a pump because that lets me control how much I use.  The gel is clear and a little bit goes a long way.  I can’t see how much I have used, but I feel this bottle will last me a very long time because of how little I need to cover my eye area. The gel doesn’t seem to really have a smell to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this 2x a day.  I put it on after cleansing &amp; applying serum, but before my moisturizer.  I was always taught to apply face products thinnest to thickest so that is why I apply it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed my eyes are more hydrated.  Sometimes I get dry patches on my eyelids and I haven’t had that problem since starting this gel.  I use this with the InstaNatural Night Cream and the InstaNatural Vitamin C serum.  I really like this system!  It works well together and everything is easily absorbed by my skin.  You can read other reviews on my blog at: surveysbystephanie.tumblr.com!</li>
            <li> I definitely see a difference since using this cream. It reduces the puffiness that I usually get when I am overtired! A little goes a long way so this bottle will likely last me another few weeks. Once it runs out, I plan to order more.</li>
            <li> I think this was a very good purchase</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have not  seen any notable difference in the puffiness or dark circles.</li>
            <li> Terrible no result just a  shiny spot that&#x27;s left after you apply it.</li>
            <li> Dark circles more like the worst saddle bags ever. I couldn&#x27;t believer they weren&#x27;t even that bad before now gravity has lowered them to a new low. Luckily for this. Keeps them moving on</li>
            <li> I love this.  Been using for  3 days, can tell the different already.&lt;br /&gt;For puffiness, This is definitely a  winner , no doubts. GREAT result. I am going to put this in the fridge, which  i think it will be an eye opener in morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For dark circle, I see a slight  improvement  , but it only  been 3 days, i believe it will be better in time/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For wrinkle,  I have dry skin , so  I will top it with another  oil  free eye cream at night in the winter only.&lt;br /&gt;Overall 5 stars , BIG bottle for only $20.00 , a happy customer !!!</li>
            <li> This gel is non-scented, smooth, cooling and works well under make-up. I saw a difference in my dark circles and wrinkles within 3 weeks, and my skin has continued to improve with the consistent use. As a swimmer I wear tight goggles that have started to create more wrinkles (being 49 adds to this!) and this gel has softened these lines!</li>
            <li> After trying many other creams to reduce dark circles around my eyes, I am happy to have found the one! This worked great! I am happy to have received this item for review! I will definitely continue using this and would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> not sure what all the rave reviews are about.  Been using for approximately 2 weeks with no difference.  In fact, my eyes feel puffier than ever before.  Sending back and starting the search again for an undereye product</li>
            <li> Saw absolutely zero improvement after two weeks of routine use. I experimented and applied only around my right eye and observed zero difference with my left. What a huge disappointment and waste of money.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working well.  I&#x27;m please with your product.</li>
            <li> I have used product for a few weeks. I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for 4 weeks. I have severe eye puffiness, partially due to an underactive thyroid condition.  So far I have not seen any reduction in puffiness, however, my eyes do look brighter &amp; they don&#x27;t appear to look tired. I will continue to use this product because they say you should see results in 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t done anything for me.  I must not be using it right????  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Seems to have limited effect</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t expect miracles when it comes to eye cream, and this product proves it.</li>
            <li> Wow!! Nevwr thought the bags under my eyes will evwr go away. Im in complete shocked that im on my 4th using it and i see a major differences. They are gone. Ill pay an extra 20 . Thats how good the product is. 5 stars</li>
            <li> This eye gel is so refreshing and actually reduced my puffiness. The best part is that it didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and eyes!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Feels good, works great!</li>
            <li> I received this as part of an advertorial. This gel had no scent thankfully. It did go on smooth though, but as with the Serum I previously reviewed, it also took too long to dry, and left the unwanted stickiness and weight down my face after application. I think this needs to go back for a revamp, and be released at a later date.</li>
            <li> This has had absolutely no effect on the under eye puffiness, or the darkness.  I will use it up, but not buy it again.</li>
            <li> This goes on smoothly, without much of a scent, and is not sticky in the slightest. I loved that this was so moisturizing, and it made my eyes feel so refreshed. It had no harsh smell that hurt when I put it by my eyes. This promises to help with dark circles, wrinkles, puffiness and sagging skin. Though i don’t deal with the majority of those problems yet, I can say I think it has helped my dark circles some for the short time I have been using it.</li>
            <li> I WAS DISAPOINTED - I DID NOT SEE ANY RESULTS - I HAVE BEEN USING THE PRODUCT FOR OVER A WEEK AND STILL DON&#x27;T NOTICE ANY CHANGE ;-{ . I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT B/C OF ALL THE &#x27;&amp;#34;GREAT &amp;#34; REVIEWS - I SHOULD HAVE SPENT THE EXTRA MONEY AND GOT THE PRODUCT I&#x27;V EBEEN USING</li>
            <li> it makes my skin feel soft, refreshed, and taught. It reduces my baggy grey puffy eyes a lot too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really see any difference. For weeks I tried coconut oil under one eye, and the eye cream on the other.  There&#x27;s no apparent difference, no change to bags, dark circles, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is also very sticky. I found that when I yawned, the skin under my eye would sort of &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to another part of my skin with some of the cream that had dried, which felt REALLY weird. I had to &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; my skin to get the two pieces to separate from each other!  Do you really want that in a skin cream?  I don&#x27;t.. So I will use it up, but it&#x27;s not likely I&#x27;ll buy this again since coconut oil works just as well, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love it. It really helps with puffiness.</li>
            <li> Putting this on wakes me up in the morning and makes me feel refreshed. There is a slight scent of cucumber, which I like, and I am happy that it doubles as a moisturizer. I have only been using it for a few weeks so I can&#x27;t really comment on how well it&#x27;s working, but I will update this review after a few months.</li>
            <li> Great product! I will be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The owner of the company emailed me and asked about his product, that&#x27;s a first for me on Amazon... Nice touch.</li>
            <li> Meh, it&#x27;s been about a month. No difference, and my dark circles and puffiness aren&#x27;t that bad.Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;My eyes have never looked younger!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Been using it a few weeks I see a small difference as in bags are hardly there</li>
            <li> Very effective and a great price for such a high quality product! I love that you can use it all over your&lt;br /&gt;facial and neck area with firming results.  Feels good going on, which is always nice.  I keep mine in the&lt;br /&gt;frig to preserve it longer and give a cooling effect that really brightens your skin tone.</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel. I use it actually all over my face after I cleanse and tone and then after I put on my moisturizer. I only actually use this product in the evenings before I go to bed, I don&#x27;t feel like I need to use it during the day although I have before and had no problem putting my makeup on over top of it I know some people had mentioned they had trouble with that. I love the cucumber smell it makes me feel calm and relaxed before bed. I feel like this product has brightened up my eye area although I have to say I don&#x27;t have bags at all, and the darkness under my eyes was probably normal or better than normal. Now I have no darkness whatsoever under my eyes, my eyes look even younger and this product just makes me feel like I&#x27;m really nourishing my skin and preventing any of those issues from developing in the future.</li>
            <li> Feels nice. It&#x27;s gel, not cream. Didn&#x27;t get into my eyes when I exercised. Hopefully, it&#x27;s doing its job! I&#x27;ll let you know in thirty years.</li>
            <li> Usually around my eyes is very dry and puffy. I am big on sleeping.. I go to bed early and get up early. I am going to be 48 and no one can tell me age. This procudt deflate puffy eyes and the skin around your eyes is soft  and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old and was constantly fighting pudginess and dark circles under my eyes.  I saw this product on Amazon and gave it a try.  It is the only product I have used that actually made a visible difference in my appearance.  The puffiness is down and the dark circles are diminished--and I have only been using it for about 2 weeks or so.  I liked it so much that I ordered two other products from them and plan to get more.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. I have been using this eye gel for over a month. I no longer have the dark circles and that tired ragged look. I have been getting compliments that I glow with youth.</li>
            <li> When I first applied the gel, I did notice immediately that it was working in the lines. I started to see the lines fill in and smooth out within the first 15 minutes. This of course didn’t last as I noticed the lines start to return 8 to 10 hours later, and then filled in again when I reapplied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyes were certainly hydrated, as well as a reduction in my dark circles, but a small amount was left on the side of my nose and right under my tear duct. I also didn’t see much of a difference in the amount of redness on my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received free for review purposes</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old and an avid eye gel/cream user.  I have bought many, many brands to try and reduce the fine lines and crows feet around my eyes.  I am very realistic when it comes to skin care products - I&#x27;m 50, I have wrinkles.  They are not going away - ever.  I am looking for products that help slow down the wrinkles progression by adding hydration and elasticity.  Oh, and about a year ago, the dark circles came on the scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on product reviews and price, I gave InstaNatural Youth Express Eye Gel a try.  And, boy, did I find a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product about 6 weeks ago.  I apply a small amount around my eyes twice daily.  It absorbs into the skin quickly. A little goes a long way - about the size of a small pea covers both under eye areas.  The eye gel is not sticky or leaves any feeling of a coating on my skin. This eye gel does not allow my eye makeup (mascara or eye liner) to smear - a real problem with most brands.  But most important, the fines lines and wrinkles around my eyes are less noticeable.  It has begun to address the dark circles too.  They are not completely gone, but I no longer have the need to wear concealer under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have paired the eye cream with the night cream and started using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  I am amazed at how fresh and plump my face feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have paid three to four times for products with similar claims that have done nothing.  This is a great product - that WORKS!</li>
            <li> This Serum is wonderful. I have used it for a couple of weeks in conjunction with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum, and I definitely see a reduction in the puffiness of my eyes. The bags are shrinking, they are actually getting smaller, and are less puffy.&lt;br /&gt;The serum is thick and creamy. It does not irritate my eyes and it is non greasy, dries quickly, and leaves no residue. I really appreciate the size of the container, this is truly a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;You only need a little,  I also use it for my jowl lines in my face, I see an improvement there also.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks AJ for products that actually work, feels luxurious, and are really affordable.</li>
            <li> No visual improvement during  3 weeks use. Do not remove puffiness in my eyes as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Lucy Press</li>
            <li> Fabulous Product&lt;br /&gt;Works great for puffiness under eyes.  Will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  I had pretty baggy eyes that were always puffy and dark.  I hated it, they are much better than they were a month ago.  Still some darkness but the puffiness is gone and the bags are starting to fade.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. I am the mother of two preschoolers and have terrible allergies. My eyes always look puffy, tired, etc. I was considering going to a dermatologist to try to do something for the puffiness and fine lines when I came across this product. It goes on really smoothly and definitely brightens my overall complexion. I started with just using it on my eyes but now also use it on my forehead and cheeks. I have noticed my skin does not seem to break out as much either. I will definitely be buying this product again and think I may try the InstaNatural eye cream.</li>
            <li> this did nothing for me. Some days I think it made my eyes looks worse. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> this is perfect help to make you look younger</li>
            <li> I received a coupon to try this product at a deeply discounted price and I was so glad that I took advantage of the offer . I love the convenience of the pump to be able to dispense the product and the products feels really good and cool eyes and puffiness I even put it in the refrigerator to make it cooler, it has a very pleasant smell and a very l great texture and I can see definite changes ..Denise F</li>
            <li> I have had the product only a few days and even going on less sleep than average, I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference.  My eyes aren&#x27;t as baggy, the skin tighter.  There are less lines than usual,  and no dark circles.  Love it so far!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this eye cream and thought it was a bit of a gimmick. I have been very impressed with how much it tightens the skin! I have a very deep wrinkle on the side of my mouth and it went away with just one application. I would definitely recommend this product for wrinkles and puffiness around the eye. I was really hoping to alleviate the dark circles under my eyes, which I don&#x27;t feel like have been all that improved. But it does make the skin under the eyes much smoother and nicer, so I plan to keep using. I&#x27;ve only been using for a week, so maybe the dark circles still will lighten up a bit.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t done much for my dark circles but I have noticed a reduction in the puffiness of my eyes. It absorbs really well and doesn&#x27;t ruin my makeup application. Plus I got it in my eye and I wasn&#x27;t blinded for hours!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. I use it every day, some days twice a day. I feel it removes the puffiness and bags and gives me a more &#x27;alert and awake&#x27; look every day. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> This product has worked great for me.  It did actually reduce fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and I also used it above my top lip.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye wrinkle creams, but this is the first one that has actually worked for me.  It is also not sticky, which I like.  It does take about 3 weeks to a month to see best results.</li>
            <li> Product works great, the bags under my eyes have gone away as well as the circles.</li>
            <li> No discernible reduction in puffiness or lines or circles. And I don&#x27;t have much of these to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the product caused my eyes to burn and to become inflamed and even more puffy. I tested to make sure it was this product by taking a couple days off then re-using. I did this 3x, each time suffering from puffy, burning eyelids and eyes a few hours after application. I&#x27;m not an allergic type, so I think this reaction was good ol&#x27; chemical irritation. This got returned.&lt;br /&gt;Back to my go-to, which is Origins No Puffery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6 weeks and I&#x27;m still undecided as to whether it actually works... two detriments are (a) it stings a little; I have pretty sensitive skin and that part of your face is very fragile, so if you have sensitive skin you may feel a bit of a sting. More annoyingly, (b), it makes under your eyes really shiny. There&#x27;s no way to really rub it in, as it&#x27;s not lotion, so it looks a little wet underneath your eyes even when it dries. I&#x27;m going to use the entire bottle before I decide to say either way but after 6 weeks I don&#x27;t see much of a difference, and I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day, in the morning and evening. I think people tend to see &amp;#34;#1 Bestseller&amp;#34; and assuming it will work for everyone, and it may work for lots of people but thus far it hasn&#x27;t worked particularly well for me. My circles aren&#x27;t enormously bad but they are more intense than I&#x27;d like them to be; after a lot of research most websites indicate that many of these things don&#x27;t really work well, so I may try an ice mask next.</li>
            <li> My other half and I have been using this product everyday since I purchased it. Unfortunately, we both haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in using it.</li>
            <li> This seems to really work! I am pleasantly surprised. Tightens skin around eye area. You just need a little. Helps with puffiness, dark circles. I can hardly wait to use it for 8 weeks like it suggests for best results.</li>
            <li> I have waited to see if this works as it says. The results: IT WORKS! I am bery happy with this product and would buy it again</li>
            <li> This did not work for me. However, seller honored return policy and like that it has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> My whole family has dark circles under our eyes, from my mother to my kids. I noticed a difference after a couple months. It was strange seeing myself like this at first, because I was so use to seeing dark circles. I am very happy with the results. Thank you.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Eye Cream is a clear gel that is to be used to fight the signs of aging.  On the directions it says it can be used on the forehead and cheek areas as well as the eye area.  I purchased mine and received it this morning.  After opening and testing out, I can say that the light cucumber smell is so refreshing, I want to slather it all over my face!  A little bit goes a long way, this bottle will last a long time.  My skin instantly felt smoother and refreshed.  The gel dries fairly quickly and it very light on the skin.  NOT heavy or sticky.  I will continue to use this morning and night as directed and look forward to seeing results!</li>
            <li> I like this product, only been using it for about 2 weeks or so, the texture is good, smell is nice, I also use it under and with the other products from InstaNatural, facial moisturizer, I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference yet, but in due time it will tell.  I will update my review in about another 2 weeks.  I would recommend this to others.  No greasy feeling after applying  it to your face and eye area, it does absorb quickly.</li>
            <li> I just got this it only my second day using it so I need more time to review the product.</li>
            <li> I do notice a slight change in the appearance. I did not give rate this a full 5 star because of time frame. I will update in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> Have only been using this cream for a few days but so far it is great! Any type of cheap cream or lotion makes me break out and so far I&#x27;ve had no problems. No burning or watery eyes!</li>
            <li> It did not work at all even though my dark circles are pretty bad, it still did nothing, no improvement</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li> Great product. Recommeneded. Really works.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work - plain and simple. Item stung a bit when first put on and as other describe the does &amp;#34;pile&amp;#34; and leave a sticky residue. Tried this 2x a day for a month and saw no difference. Tried putting in the fridge as well - no impact.</li>
            <li> I Love this product! I apply it every morning before my other facial products and I see a big difference. Eyes are looking better.</li>
            <li> I have nothing but praises for this product. I usually apply it daily after my evening bath and it feels sooo good on my skin. I&#x27;ve also been getting complements that I&#x27;ve been glowing, so maybe it does work! But I really haven&#x27;t had a skin care routine before this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product and would repurchase in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and I can see a difference. Wish it was a little more effective but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an african American female with dark circles around my eye and this cream was a miracle. It lighten the circles drastically and I didn&#x27;t even notice until 2/3 months later. A little goes long way. I&#x27;m finally finished with this bottle after 3 months of use.</li>
            <li> This seems to be really helping. I have noticed that when I do not use I can tell a difference in just a matter of a few days. Also seems to pair well with most of my facial moisturizers.</li>
            <li> In the month that I&#x27;ve been using this, I notice my contacts get dry close to the end of my work day PLUS it seems like my dark circles have gotten progressively worse when they really weren&#x27;t that bad before using the product.  If it wasn&#x27;t for it irritating and burning my eyes I would stick with it.  I think I&#x27;ll go back to using my Yes! to Grapefruit Dark Circle corrector eye cream that was more moisturizing and cost less. :(</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Great on the eyes as well as the skin. I mix it with the vit c moisturizer cause it&#x27;s a bit thick. Great product</li>
            <li> I love the gel just for its moisturizing quality since the areas around my eyes need intense  hydration as they age faster. I didn&#x27;t notice how they work for my dark circles since mine are not so visible. I even used this gel for my whole face once. This is a good eye gel in a big bottle. Compared to other eye products I have, this is just humongous for an eye product. It is going to last forever.</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream! I&#x27;ve tried creams from my doctor that were so expensive. This one leaves my under eye smooth and clear, works just as well as prescription. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Did not see a difference.</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING for under eye puffiness. I swear by it. I do not look tired anymore.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed in the eye gel not even a little change in the puffiness, still look tired......</li>
            <li> No change at all, nothing for fine lines, dark circles, puffiness. These must be fake. I started a different product and it started working in 1 week!  (I&#x27;m 28 with pretty good skin to begin with)  Update: company contacted me, and offered refund. So it maybe worth it to try the product, they stand by it.</li>
            <li> THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN AND IT DOESNT BOTHER ME! I SEE MY PORES AND WRINKLES DISAPPEARING THANK YOU FOR THIS GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t  been using it very long, but my eyes don&#x27;t look any less puffy since I started using it.</li>
            <li> ive been using it for a few weeks and it does reduce morning  eye puffiness.  i am also using it again in the evening.</li>
