            <li>This one is outstanding.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s arrived on time and it satisfied my expectation .I will recommend it to anybody .</li>

            <li>I GET MANY COMPLIMENTS WITH IT.</li>

            <li>Not the original from Yardley.</li>
            <li>but the smell is very dated, very 1980&#x27;s and not in a good way.  </li>
            <li>for those who wrote positive reviews, I respect your reviews but this is not for me and many others who I asked for their opinion.</li>
            <li>I have been buying this particular cologne over the past 20 years and I&#x27;m happy to see that it still retains all those qualities that you would expect in a good man&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>I am open to woodsy colognes but this cologne I have heard was good but a \\&quot;old\\&quot; smell.</li>
            <li>Bottle about the size of your palm full to the brim.</li>
            <li>This cologne has a very strong masculine scent.</li>
            <li>When my boyfriend and i very first sprayed the cologne, we found it to be a bit....strong.</li>
            <li>Very masculine and sexy.</li>
            <li>I think its totally worth for the value</li>
            <li>men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received authentic product by ordering directly from amazon.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend last Christmas kind of as a joke because he owns a Jag</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has an over the top sent of old man an camping.</li>

            <li>YOU USE TOO MUCH.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about that</li>
            <li>as described fast shipping</li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;m not quite sure why such a small item in its own box needed such a large box to be shipped in.</li>
            <li>Its a very woodsy scent, and enjoyable in small doses.</li>
            <li>Last long and got many compliments</li>
            <li>I got it to go with his new car</li>

            <li>This particular order I have written to the seller that I am particular about getting the bottle with brow cap (wooden texture) not a silver cap.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting much considering the low price</li>
            <li>Feels very sturdy and bottle seems to be made of glass or something related to glass (not plastic)</li>
            <li>Smells like a old mans coulonge</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it as long as you don&#x27;t live around my area!</li>
            <li>Jaguar for Men has a very harsh and synthetic smell; It&#x27;s pretty much alcohol and pine mashed up together.  </li>

            <li> Great old school scent. Projection and longevity. Will garner many compliment!!!</li>
            <li> good quality and service</li>
            <li> Years ago my husband wore this cologne and then it kind of disappeared, I was happy to find it for him at Amazon</li>
            <li> ALTHOUGH I LOVE THE PRODUCT, I RECEIVED MY ORDER WITH A HALF FULL BOTTLE DUE TO THE TOP NOT BEING SECURE AND IT LEAKED OUT.  I DIDN&#x27;T OPEN THE BOX UNTIL A WEEK LATER, SO IT WAS NOT WORTH MY TIME OR EFFORT TO RETURN IT. I HAVE ORDERED MANY ITEMS FROM AMAZON, AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE HAD A PROBLEM WITH AN ORDER.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;n disappointed with this purchase. I don&#x27;t like the smell. I don&#x27;t recommend this to anybody</li>
            <li> Great fragrance for dirt-cheap value! I think its totally worth for the value you pay!&lt;br /&gt;the delivery was on-time too!&lt;br /&gt;good packaging..</li>
            <li> one problem, the cap on bottle did not fit properly.  very poorly made.&lt;br /&gt;jaguar it self is great</li>
            <li> Great deal, looking to purchase more cologne.</li>
            <li> All Jaguar fragrances are superb! This one is outstanding. Like nothing else. It will go on strong but taper off within 30 minutes to a more manageable scent</li>
            <li> thanks. I like this eau de toilette spray very cool&lt;br /&gt; thanks again</li>
            <li> The scent were so amazing, I just loved it, I wear it everyday, and people on the street just stops me,  and tell me how wonderful I smell...</li>
            <li> This is my husband favorite new cologne spray and this was his valentine present and he was very happy to receive it on two days after that day due to the delay of snow.</li>

            <li> Good price&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell</li>
            <li> I am open to woodsy colognes but this cologne I have heard was good but a \\&quot;old\\&quot; smell. I didn&#x27;t let it deter me to try it out. When I got it, I was told I tried one spray, I didn&#x27;t like it at all. Then I was told it smells like a mix of a hamster cage and kitty litter. I still didn&#x27;t like the smell even after it wore off, to woodsy with some bite of something I didn&#x27;t like.. I asked a female in her sixties to smell it.... The look of disgust of what is that smell on her face, sealed the deal for me. Everyone including myself didn&#x27;t think this was very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well for those who wrote positive reviews, I respect your reviews but this is not for me and many others who I asked for their opinion.</li>
            <li> I used to use it for a long time, like it, its great I will order it again, you have to try it,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s arrived on time and it satisfied my expectation .I will recommend it to anybody .</li>
            <li> When my boyfriend and i very first sprayed the cologne, we found it to be a bit....strong. But luckly, it mellows out, and becomes quite nice after it gets some air. Its a very woodsy scent, and enjoyable in small doses. It is also a very mature smell, just sayin.</li>
            <li> It is nice but it is a bit too strong for me.</li>
            <li> Jaguar for Men has a very harsh and synthetic smell; It&#x27;s pretty much alcohol and pine mashed up together.  I was not expecting much considering the low price but the smell is very dated, very 1980&#x27;s and not in a good way.  I&#x27;m planning on using it as an air freshner.</li>
            <li> This particular order I have written to the seller that I am particular about getting the bottle with brow cap (wooden texture) not a silver cap. And the quality of both differ. The picture shows in all their promotions a bottle with a brown cap. This seller irrespective of my chosing sent the one with a silver cap which is either a duplicate or lesser quality. I have written to them again and expressed my concern and they have not bothered to send me a reply either. I hope and pray that these sellers change their mentality of just make money and enforce anything they have upon us aganist our will, I have kept it and not othered to asked for a refund because this is only one time deal. Never again.</li>
            <li> Awesome men&#x27;s cologne</li>
            <li> Definitely a sweet smell, but its also a mature smell. Probably not the best scent for a young man. Better for a gray haired golfer, doctor, lawyer or business executive. The bottle itself is top notch. The spray spout is strong and sprays well and you don&#x27;t feel like its going to break. Feels very sturdy and bottle seems to be made of glass or something related to glass (not plastic)</li>
            <li> Have been waiting for this , Thanks</li>
            <li> I do not get the smell that was in the photo and the drafting of amazon ad says it&#x27;s the same really mortified</li>
            <li> Excellent store. Everything was as expected with product and product deliver on time. Everything perfect buying from them and I would buy with them again.</li>
            <li> Smell Good. Perfect to gift, excelent service</li>
            <li> This is awesome buy...I liked the fragrance...</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this $9 perfume. Last long and got many compliments</li>
            <li> THIS IS GREAT FOO FOO JUICE AND I DO LIKE IT.  JUST A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY, IT WILL GET OVER POWERING IT YOU USE TOO MUCH.  I GET MANY COMPLIMENTS WITH IT.</li>
            <li> I love this smell. This is a very good cologne. I highly recommend it as long as you don&#x27;t live around my area!</li>
            <li> We purchased this first back in 1990 and we are still buying it today. We love it ND hope everyone tries this.</li>
            <li> It was not the one you see in the picture. It was all black! Besides, the lid is not fully sealed and have some leak all around it when I want to use it.</li>
            <li> I love woody masculine fragrances and this is exactly what I wanted. I love this cologne</li>
            <li> After buying one for myself, I ordered a second one for my dad. He loves it and so do I. This cologne has a very strong masculine scent. It &amp;#34;settles&amp;#34; on your body after awhile. Perfect scent for older men,but also great choice for mature young men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received authentic product by ordering directly from amazon.</li>
            <li> Smells like a old mans coulonge</li>
            <li> I did not like the fragrance at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend last Christmas kind of as a joke because he owns a Jag and we both fell in love with the smell. Very masculine and sexy. Great for date nights!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves it! I got it to go with his new car and he&#x27;s happy. It will look great on his shelf and smells great on him! He says it smells like another brand he used to use called Chrome. I don&#x27;t know much about that but I love it :) a lot of spray for the money. Bottle about the size of your palm full to the brim.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with both the Jaguar that I purchased and the service from the seller.</li>
            <li> Jaguar is one of my favorite colognes ever! I&#x27;m sure lots of men think they can have all the fun, but so can us ladies. Originally, one of my guy friends came over wearing this and I HAD to get it -this cologne just smells that good! Nice and spicy, not overly strong, lasts a good amount of time. Great for mischievous encounters (not all being a certain kind of mischief). Other than that, prompt arrival, bottle was as advertised and it smells awesome. Though I&#x27;m not quite sure why such a small item in its own box needed such a large box to be shipped in. But who cares? I got my awesome Jaguar cologne.</li>
            <li> This product smells terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an over the top sent of old man an camping. Don&#x27;t waste you money on this it is a terrible sent.</li>
            <li> as described fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have been buying this particular cologne over the past 20 years and I&#x27;m happy to see that it still retains all those qualities that you would expect in a good man&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> I have been using Jaguar aftershave for many years and it still is refreshing and has a smell that both myself and my wife like.</li>
            <li> This is at best an after-shave.  Scent is gone literally within minutes.  In case you are looking for a long-lasting scent, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> Soft pleasant smell. Not too over powering. Not the original from Yardley. Wish they would bring back theirs. But this one is good.</li>
            <li> Though I have ordered through Amazon prime, it took a week to reach me, though iam not in hurry to receive it, it smells like after shave lotion.&lt;br /&gt;not at all kind of regular cologne.</li>
            <li> Scent of this cologne is good and not to overwhelming . I love it.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance...not overpowering but long lasting.</li>
            <li> I tried this brand for the first time and I would say it did not impress me. I will try something else next time.</li>
