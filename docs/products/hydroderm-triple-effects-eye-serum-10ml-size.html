    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I just wasn&#x27;t impressed with the product or results.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s priceless!</li>
            <li>i love all the hydroderm products!!!</li>
            <li>But you will be happy.</li>
            <li>I just ordered four more bottles at an excellent price through Amazon and have not yet received them....?</li>
            <li>However, I will continue to use the serum from Clarins and the eye serum and face cream for awhile, as they have good results as well.</li>
            <li>It is good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Good product... works well</li>
            <li>Feel like I&#x27;m going to be very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I very glad with wath I buy</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel this is as effective as the Wrinkle Serum</li>
            <li>I have tried all kinds of eye products and this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>but I will get one more order to see</li>
            <li>You can call the health advisors at Life Extension which is not the sales department and they can give you much more information and answer your questions.</li>
            <li>The result is a reduction in the appearance and depth of creases and the restoration of a more youthful appearance to skin in most people over age 40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The longer you use Hydroderm®, the better the results.</li>
            <li>Not what I thought, but OK</li>
            <li>Lovely texture and glides on like a dream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product for about three months now and have noticed I look much more rested.  </li>
            <li>STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I still love this and use it, soothing and does seem to help with some wrinkles but not as effective as it used to be on my skin, must be because I have older</li>
            <li>No improvement , did not notice any difference, no prove meant in fine lines or around eyes.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are gone.</li>
            <li>but it does seem to somewhat smooth out my skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Doctors are also available.</li>
            <li>You will begin to see results within a few days, but for best results, we recommend use of product for 30-60 days or longer.</li>
            <li>there was some difference if I didn&#x27;t smile!  </li>
            <li>I did not notice any significant reduction in wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>texture easy to apply and quickly absorbed, my skin seems tauter and wrinkles diminish</li>
            <li>Life Extension has many skin products that really deliver and surpass the results from Clarins.</li>
            <li>No doubt I will reorder more of this cosmetic very soon.</li>
            <li>I have been using Clairns from Macy&#x27;s and this product seems to be better particularly on the eye lids.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maturity has many advantages, but there&#x27;s no reason for your skin to look older than it has to.</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth the price.</li>
            <li>But my smile lines are stronger then</li>
            <li>Cleanse face and neck with warm water to help open pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can say I am pretty much wrinkle free</li>
            <li>In no time, the tiny lines and sagging top lid tightened.</li>
            <li>Waste of money, but it does feel good for a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>However, the better quality bottles of serum seem to improve the look of the eyes - less darkness - more natural looking.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>Works very well, takes time to notice a difference.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing that it claimed it would.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well, doesn&#x27;t seem to have much effect on the bags under eyes</li>
            <li>Below are the ingredients and wht they do as that is very informative as to what you can</li>
            <li>I read so much about this product, so I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I was very disatisfied</li>
            <li>Now, I use other products that seem to do a better job.  </li>
            <li>The results are quickly visible, but remember you need to use such a product two to three months to really see drastic results.</li>
            <li>This product is not going to make you look 20 years old, but it certainly helps with bags and puffiness.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t see results much different than other eye serums that are available at lower price and readily available locally.</li>
            <li>Shipping was extra fast too!</li>
            <li>and Hydroderm is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that actually works!  </li>
            <li>The first bottle I received from Amazon was less than half full, and the liquid separated into two distinct layers, something that was not the case with the bottle I bought directly from Hydroderm.</li>
            <li>My old eyes needed some help.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen a marked improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Life Extension offers the Hydroderm® formula to members based on clinical studies and the improvements in skin appearance that have been shown.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 82 year old mom and she loves hydroderm too.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve got to say this has been my least favorite eye serum I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I am 44 years old and a sun worshiper.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product directly from Hydroderm and paid a small fortune for it, so I was delighted when I saw it offered by Amazon for less than half the price.</li>
            <li>Some bottles of serum seem to be of higher quality than other bottles.</li>
            <li>The dark circles have faded and the wrinkles around my eyes are becoming less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>but I think the wrinkles are becoming a little less noticeable.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> As I stated above, I have been a long term user of the eye serum.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not only does it firm up the skin on your eyelids to reduce the \\&quot;crepiness\\&quot;, but it is not the least bit greasy and you can apply makeup right away.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use this product every single day.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough positive things about this product - I&#x27;m addicted to using it!</li>
            <li> I have had this product about a week already seeing a little different underneath the eye.</li>
            <li> The vial did not last long, small portion.</li>
            <li> not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting to plunk down $45 for the usual bunch of nothing, but was pleasantly surprised with the results.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel dry and tight and not anything like promised or in the description.</li>
            <li> but it will take longer before I have an opinion one way or the other.</li>
            <li> I did not take a before and after shots other than photos of me.</li>
            <li> Due to that it lasted about 3 days so couldn&#x27;t tell if it works or not</li>
            <li> I use this system along with two other systems</li>
            <li> The bottle came half empty and the dropper never did work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the results but using it along with my other products I am hoping long term to keep the wrinkles at bay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to get rid of my dark circles (creams, concealers, illuminators etc.)</li>
            <li> I will decide that in a few months.</li>
            <li> waste of money and would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> It was  a waste of my $$😟</li>
            <li> The bent tip prohibits empty in the bottle which is very small and hard to handle.</li>
            <li> Received this product, have used quite a bit in the past and swore by it.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Been using it for at least a year.</li>
            <li> Not surprisingly, Amazon replaced the defective product.</li>
            <li> The Hydroderm applicator is difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Fake item and nothing done about it.</li>
            <li> I am 100 percent disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Cleared up bags under my eyes in 3 days..use it constantly now..</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product directly from Hydroderm and paid a small fortune for it, so I was delighted when I saw it offered by Amazon for less than half the price. The first bottle I received from Amazon was less than half full, and the liquid separated into two distinct layers, something that was not the case with the bottle I bought directly from Hydroderm. Not surprisingly, Amazon replaced the defective product. I am 64 y.o., and I do feel this product makes a difference: the puffiness under my eyes has tightened, and my eyelids seem firmer as well. On that note: I read several Q &amp;A&#x27;s that said not to use Triple Effects on the eyelids. However, I believe the directions state the opposite.</li>
            <li> My old eyes needed some help.  This product is not going to make you look 20 years old, but it certainly helps with bags and puffiness.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Received this product, have used quite a bit in the past and swore by it. Now, I use other products that seem to do a better job.  I still love this and use it, soothing and does seem to help with some wrinkles but not as effective as it used to be on my skin, must be because I have older not so &amp;#34;bounce back&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of eye products and this one is my favorite.  Not only does it firm up the skin on your eyelids to reduce the \\&quot;crepiness\\&quot;, but it is not the least bit greasy and you can apply makeup right away.  This stuff is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> Works very well, takes time to notice a difference. But you will be happy.</li>
            <li> texture easy to apply and quickly absorbed, my skin seems tauter and wrinkles diminish</li>
            <li> Some bottles of serum seem to be of higher quality than other bottles. However, the better quality bottles of serum seem to improve the look of the eyes - less darkness - more natural looking.</li>
            <li> I have used this for over a month.  I haven&#x27;t seen a marked improvement in my skin.  However, I haven&#x27;t seen a decline either.  I wont buy it again.  I just wasn&#x27;t impressed with the product or results.</li>
            <li> I am 100 percent disappointed with this product. It did absolutely nothing that it claimed it would. Waste of money! I feel like I got scammed. Don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel this is as effective as the Wrinkle Serum but it does seem to somewhat smooth out my skin around my eyes. This is not made to remove bags under you eyes though, so don&#x27;t use it for that.</li>
            <li> there was some difference if I didn&#x27;t smile!  But my smile lines are stronger then the product  but I will get one more order to see</li>
            <li> Although I used this in conjunction with the Hydroderm Anti-Wrinkle Serum I did not notice any significant reduction in wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;It was a lot to pay for, virtually, no results.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this product. Over priced. Made my skin feel dry and tight and not anything like promised or in the description.</li>
            <li> No improvement , did not notice any difference, no prove meant in fine lines or around eyes. Not sure it is the real stuff since I didn&#x27;t buy it from manufacturer website .</li>
            <li> The dark circles have faded and the wrinkles around my eyes are becoming less noticeable.  I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> As I stated above, I have been a long term user of the eye serum.&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily regularly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to form a solid opinion. I think it is doing something but it will take longer before I have an opinion one way or the other. It absorbs well, doesn&#x27;t seem to have much effect on the bags under eyes but I think the wrinkles are becoming a little less noticeable. I plan to stay with it until and unless I decided it is ineffective! The price seems a little high for the size but if it ends up making me look ten years younger....that&#x27;s priceless!</li>
            <li> This stuff combined with Hyaluronic Acid beauty cream may be the answer. I&#x27;ve read up on this combination. It&#x27;s being touted the fountain of youth. Out of ALL the products I&#x27;ve tried these two together make a visible difference. I did not take a before and after shots other than photos of me. The Hydroderm applicator is difficult to use. The bent tip prohibits empty in the bottle which is very small and hard to handle. I just ordered four more bottles at an excellent price through Amazon and have not yet received them....? Where is my order?</li>
            <li> The results are quickly visible, but remember you need to use such a product two to three months to really see drastic results. I have been using Clairns from Macy&#x27;s and this product seems to be better particularly on the eye lids. Life Extension has many skin products that really deliver and surpass the results from Clarins. However, I will continue to use the serum from Clarins and the eye serum and face cream for awhile, as they have good results as well. I may eventually just use the Life Extension skin products. I will decide that in a few months. You can call the health advisors at Life Extension which is not the sales department and they can give you much more information and answer your questions. Doctors are also available. That number is 1-800-226-2370 Below are the ingredients and wht they do as that is very informative as to what you can expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingriendients speak for themselves. I have provided the following from the Life Extension website. I have a membership there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collagen is the chief constituent of connective tissue that supports the structure of the skin. As collagen is depleted, visible signs of skin aging appear and then accelerate. The skin requires constant synthesis of new collagen to remain firm and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydroderm® liquid drops have been shown to deliver nourishing collagen through the upper layer of the skin deep into the lower layers of the epidermis. The result is a reduction in the appearance and depth of creases and the restoration of a more youthful appearance to skin in most people over age 40.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maturity has many advantages, but there&#x27;s no reason for your skin to look older than it has to. Life Extension offers the Hydroderm® formula to members based on clinical studies and the improvements in skin appearance that have been shown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Collagen (marine), water, alcohol, sodium methylparaben, phenoxyethanol, ethylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, isobutylparaben, methylparaben, serum protein, amniotic fluid, placental protein, calfskin extract, hydrolyzed collagen, imidazolidinyl urea, PEG-16, trisodium EDTA, potassium sorbate, citric acid, ascorbic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dosage and Use&lt;br /&gt; Shake well. Cleanse face and neck with warm water to help open pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Apply drops onto palms of hands and/or fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Apply generously over face and neck avoiding the eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Use in the morning and evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You will begin to see results within a few days, but for best results, we recommend use of product for 30-60 days or longer. The longer you use Hydroderm®, the better the results. Hydroderm® actually rejuvenates the collagen in the skin, so results last for months and will continue to work as long as you use the product.</li>
            <li> not what I expected.  don&#x27;t see that it does what it is advertised to do.  waste of money and would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I started to use the eye serum, after years of using the hydroderm face serum. In no time, the tiny lines and sagging top lid tightened. I bought it for my 82 year old mom and she loves hydroderm too.</li>
            <li> Awful! That&#x27;s all I can say. Will never buy again!</li>
            <li> I have had this product about a week already seeing a little different underneath the eye.Feel like I&#x27;m going to be very satisfied with this product. Shipping was extra fast too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the eye serum for several months and I can see a difference. Fine lines are gone. I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, but it does feel good for a couple of minutes. I see zero difference after using it for a month along with the face product.</li>
            <li> i love all the hydroderm products!!!</li>
            <li> Not what I thought, but OK</li>
            <li> The bottle came half empty and the dropper never did work.  Due to that it lasted about 3 days so couldn&#x27;t tell if it works or not</li>
            <li> Been using it for at least a year.</li>
            <li> I read so much about this product, so I decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks  &amp; I&#x27;ve got to say this has been my least favorite eye serum I have ever tried.  It was  a waste of my $$😟</li>
            <li> Works like it says it does.  Lovely texture and glides on like a dream.  People don&#x27;t believe me when I tell them my age!</li>
            <li> I bought this about a year ago along with the age defying wrinkle reducer. I use this system along with two other systems so I don&#x27;t use this product every single day. I&#x27;m not sure about the results but using it along with my other products I am hoping long term to keep the wrinkles at bay. I am 44 years old and a sun worshiper. I can say I am pretty much wrinkle free so what I&#x27;m doing seems to be working.</li>
            <li> must have eye product, the only product that I can use that I&#x27;m not allergic to.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with this product and the service Amazon provided.  I&#x27;ve tried everything to get rid of my dark circles (creams, concealers, illuminators etc.) and Hydroderm is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that actually works!  I was expecting to plunk down $45 for the usual bunch of nothing, but was pleasantly surprised with the results. I&#x27;ve been using the product for about three months now and have noticed I look much more rested.  My friends and co-workers have also noticed a change in the appearance of my eyes and asked if I had been on vacation or changed my makeup. The product seems to reduce wrinkles as well. I cannot say enough positive things about this product - I&#x27;m addicted to using it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d purchase this again.  Product arrived on time.  Couldn&#x27;t see results much different than other eye serums that are available at lower price and readily available locally.</li>
            <li> Fake item and nothing done about it. Company should back their products but this one did no.t. I was very disatisfied</li>
            <li> Still trying this product. Have no idea what it will do. I faithfully apply it every days, two times. I will let you know....</li>
            <li> Hydroderm triple met my expectations.  It is good stuff.  No doubt I will reorder more of this cosmetic very soon.</li>
            <li> DID NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> The vial did not last long, small portion.</li>
            <li> STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I very glad with wath I buy</li>
            <li> Good product... works well</li>
