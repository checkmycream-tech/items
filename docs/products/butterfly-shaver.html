    <ol>
            <li>One of the best electric shavers I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I think the best thing about it is that it is cordless</li>
            <li>Best shaver I ever had;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, their foil body shaver attachment was perfect for underarms and there was not itching after it.</li>
            <li>Best shaver I have ever had -- even acts as an exfoliator.</li>
            <li>The shaver is awesome!</li>
            <li>Brilliant design and incredible shave.  </li>
            <li>Incredible shaver.</li>
            <li>This is a great ladies&#x27; razor.  </li>
            <li>Am happy to have found an alternative to blade razors.  </li>
            <li>SkullShaver, you have a really GREAT product in the Butterfly shaver – every woman should have one.</li>
            <li>That’s the easy part – it does a wonderful job on my legs and under my arms.  </li>
            <li>I had used my husband&#x27;s skull shaver and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I Love it for legs!</li>
            <li>I got this as a gift from my mom on my birthday, and I love it!</li>
            <li>and I am certainly glad I did!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>My husband has heard so many plus comments from me that he is threatening to shave his head!  </li>
            <li>but the real important thing is how it shaves.  </li>
            <li>I will be honest</li>
            <li>I love that it is ergonomically easy to hold, and I get a great shave.  </li>
            <li>At first, she wasn&#x27;t impressed but after her first use, she was very impressed with how clean it cuts.</li>
            <li>I love love love this shaver!  </li>
            <li>Great for a quick shave, easy to use and fits all the curves.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I took the risk and bought it.</li>
            <li>That risks damage to the product, your knuckles, and innocent bystanders.</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s okay, because they want you to replace them every 6 months, anyway.</li>
            <li>For a premium price, I expect much better.</li>
            <li>For a premium price, I expect much better.</li>
            <li>I received this as a gift and just love it.  </li>
            <li>have had many electric shavers over the years.</li>
            <li>Buy it - you will love it, too.</li>
            <li>She told me she did not get any more cuts</li>
            <li>Its price was $100 more than the Skull Shaver Butterfly razor.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Great product, highly  recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a great many electric razors and this far surpasses any of them.  </li>
            <li>Love this product really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable fit in my hand.</li>
            <li>The shaver is easy to hold and maneuver and does an excellent job dry, without any shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>One of the best features is the quick 5-10 second cleaning process.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use on the backs of my legs.  </li>
            <li>I have strong reservations about quality, however.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It itched a immediately afterward but some aloe vera gel took care of that, and it feels fine today.</li>
            <li>but it will not be silky smooth to the touch at all</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with my cheap plastic disposable razers.</li>
            <li>Plus, from trying out my husband&#x27;s electric razor I was intrigued by this kind of razor rather than the straight one like all of the others.  </li>
            <li>It is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The light that tells you when to recharge it is helpful.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth</li>
            <li>A nice assortment of shaver and trimmer attachments is available, making it a very flexible product.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I am personally so excited for how close I can get with it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it has not caused me any kind of rash or cuts and seems to get all the hairs.  </li>
            <li>This one is great for girls, though really the same razor.  </li>
            <li>and it was so fast and easy that anyone could do it.</li>
            <li>The shave is smooth and very close with no need of any shaving cream, and the five floating heads assure that you’ll never miss a spot.  </li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Its also easy to clean, but does take longer than a regular shaver because you have to clean all four heads.</li>
            <li>It’s light weight, easy to hold, very maneuverable, simple to clean</li>
            <li>Nice and gentle to use and very ergonomic,however you do have to use it quite frequently</li>
            <li>Easy to hold and leaves the skin really soft.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable in my hand, entire chest took it from 100% to 60% charge.</li>
            <li>lives up to its promise -- does a better than average job quickly, easily, and with no problems -- makes daily life better and easier</li>
            <li>Its my first electric shaver</li>
            <li>Though more expensive than most women&#x27;s razors, it does a much better job.</li>
            <li>Recently, my wife purchased the famous brand name (the name starts with N) 3</li>
            <li>– I can’t say it enough I just love it.</li>
            <li>It is better than my other shaver and gives a nice close shave that is similar to a razor.</li>
            <li>Without her knowing, I purchased the Skull Shaver Butterfly Smart razor as a gift for her.</li>
            <li>that is, until I got the Skull Shaver Butterfly Smart razor that my husband bought for me.  </li>
            <li>I still think its costly for what it is but highly recommend buying it as it makes the task of shaving so much easier!</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re fit to go out in public</li>
            <li>As you&#x27;re pulling it apart you don&#x27;t know how much force to use or when it will let go.</li>
            <li>That wouldn&#x27;t bother me so much if they didn&#x27;t try to fool you into thinking it&#x27;s stainless</li>
            <li>For those that don&#x27;t have much time in our hands.this is a must have</li>
            <li>It is so simple and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Butterfly/Skull shaver.</li>
            <li>It’s absolutely everything I’ve ever wanted all in one razor.  </li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and for some reason have sensitive skin which seemed to cause pain from open pores from traditional shaving.</li>
            <li>okay if you&#x27;re in a hurry and want to shave visible stubble, it will knock it down</li>
            <li>The attachments, including the main blades are &amp;#34;friction fit&amp;#34; onto the motor housing.</li>
            <li>The main shaver head is a shiny, silvery, *plastic</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; does NOT mean you can use it in the shower -- it just means you can use shaving gel with it.  </li>
            <li>and so far it has worked really well.  </li>
            <li>So far it has worked well and has not bothered my legs at all!</li>
            <li>Most electric shavers leave small stubbles.</li>
            <li>It took a few passes but easily did the job.</li>
            <li>Overall I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this product for the price point.</li>
            <li>for the product itself, I review this from the perspective of a professional mechanical engineer.</li>
            <li>This thing is so much easier than the traditional way of using a razor and shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 43 yrs old.</li>
            <li>The extra head for underarms worked very well also.</li>
            <li>, you can keep it in your nightstand and, if as you&#x27;re getting dressed, you think you need a quick shave, just whip it out, go up and down your legs,</li>
            <li>If you go over the area a couple times OR push a little harder you will have a very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>This is a fun shaver to use because it  cuts my shaving time in half.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking at electric shavers for a long time and finally decided to get this one</li>
            <li> Will use this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have not used it wet and have only used it dry</li>
            <li> It is maybe a tiny bit less close than a razor</li>
            <li> Once a week maintenance should only take a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about spending so much on a razor but have to say I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> In other words, they just press in and friction is supposed to keep them in place.</li>
            <li> It may get so loose the attachment falls out, or so tight attachments won&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> The photos in the instructions were small and low-contrast, and therefore not much help.</li>
            <li> The shave is as close as a razor without the mess, or cuts.</li>
            <li> The clear plastic cover is difficult to put on, and falls off immediately.</li>
            <li> I was never satisfied with any of them,</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife since she has always complained of getting cuts whenever she shaves her leg.</li>
            <li> She tried the expensive men’s razor several times and she was so unhappy with it that she returned it under Amazon’s 45 day return policy.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help that the instructions for the wrong model were included in addition to the correct instructions.</li>
            <li> So, not impressed with the quality of the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> Just received this, and the base product appears to work as advertised.</li>
            <li> I hate blades.</li>

            <li> One of the best electric shavers I have ever used. A bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I think this is the final body hair answer I&#x27;ve needed. I did chest last night, had about 1/2 inch growth. It took a few passes but easily did the job. Very comfortable in my hand, entire chest took it from 100% to 60% charge. Once a week maintenance should only take a few minutes. It itched a immediately afterward but some aloe vera gel took care of that, and it feels fine today. I&#x27;m glad I took the risk and bought it.</li>
            <li> This thing works okay if you&#x27;re in a hurry and want to shave visible stubble, it will knock it down so you&#x27;re fit to go out in public but it will not be silky smooth to the touch at all and you&#x27;ll still need to go over it with a razor later. Overall I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this product for the price point.</li>
            <li> Just received this, and the base product appears to work as advertised. Frustration-free packaging. A nice assortment of shaver and trimmer attachments is available, making it a very flexible product. Easy to use. I have strong reservations about quality, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions were poorly translated into English and full of spelling errors. It didn&#x27;t help that the instructions for the wrong model were included in addition to the correct instructions. The photos in the instructions were small and low-contrast, and therefore not much help. It look a lot of searching to see how to remove the attachments. So, not impressed with the quality of the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, I review this from the perspective of a professional mechanical engineer. The clear plastic cover is difficult to put on, and falls off immediately. You can&#x27;t just rest the product on the cover, either, because the cover&#x27;s clips get in the way. It&#x27;s useless. The attachments, including the main blades are &amp;#34;friction fit&amp;#34; onto the motor housing. In other words, they just press in and friction is supposed to keep them in place. This is an inherently unreliable design, as the friction tends to change over time. It may get so loose the attachment falls out, or so tight attachments won&#x27;t come out. Removing an attachment is going to be a gamble every time. As you&#x27;re pulling it apart you don&#x27;t know how much force to use or when it will let go. That risks damage to the product, your knuckles, and innocent bystanders. The main shaver head is a shiny, silvery, *plastic*. That wouldn&#x27;t bother me so much if they didn&#x27;t try to fool you into thinking it&#x27;s stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clips that hold the blades in are molded into that same head, and you remove the blades by pulling on them until the clips give way. The instructions say to remove the blades for cleaning after each use. I give it maybe 50 removals before a clip breaks. Maybe that&#x27;s okay, because they want you to replace them every 6 months, anyway. (Yes, that was sarcasm.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a knock-off shaver, I would expect this quality. For a premium price, I expect much better. (Wait did I get hood-winked with a knock-off? How would I know?)nt you to replace them every 6 months, anyway. (Yes, that was sarcasm.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a knock-off shaver, I would expect this quality. For a premium price, I expect much better. (Wait did I get hood-winked with a knock-off? How would I know?)</li>
            <li> I will be honest I was very skeptical about spending so much on a razor but have to say I was very pleasantly surprised. This thing is so much easier than the traditional way of using a razor and shaving cream.  I have not used it wet and have only used it dry so I can&#x27;t comment on using it that way.  I have sensitive skin and it has not caused me any kind of rash or cuts and seems to get all the hairs.  I still think its costly for what it is but highly recommend buying it as it makes the task of shaving so much easier!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as advertised. The shave isn&#x27;t as close as I&#x27;d like it like a regular blade shaver. Its my first electric shaver so I cannot compare it to those...perhaps this is a close a shave as any electric shaver. I&#x27;ll stick with my cheap plastic disposable razers. Not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> Great product, highly  recommend. I been shaven my head for 15 years. It&#x27;s a quik shave. For those that don&#x27;t have much time in our hands.this is a must have</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this about 3 weeks and so far it has worked really well.  I was a Remington user for years but they are just not working as well and I keep having to replace them.  Plus, from trying out my husband&#x27;s electric razor I was intrigued by this kind of razor rather than the straight one like all of the others.  So far it has worked well and has not bothered my legs at all!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift and just love it.  It is so simple and comfortable to use.  The shaver is easy to hold and maneuver and does an excellent job dry, without any shaving cream.  Note:  It is referred to as a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; shaver.  &amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; does NOT mean you can use it in the shower -- it just means you can use shaving gel with it.  Also, it is meant for the legs, not for under the arms.  Stick to doing armpits in the shower.  I think the best thing about it is that it is cordless, you can keep it in your nightstand and, if as you&#x27;re getting dressed, you think you need a quick shave, just whip it out, go up and down your legs, and you are done!!  A big time-saver.</li>
            <li> Just got my shaver.  Charged it and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out.  It is fantastic.  Never been a fan of electric shavers but that has changed.  I would definately recommend it.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I ever had;&lt;br /&gt;I have had many electric shavers over the years. I&#x27;m 43 yrs old. And this is the closest shave you will ever get with an electric shaver. Most electric shavers leave small stubbles. If you go over the area a couple times OR push a little harder you will have a very smooth shave. I hate blades. I am always knicking myself and bleeding. I can shave my legs with this and watch TV. Do not use it under arms, it will leave you itching. However, their foil body shaver attachment was perfect for underarms and there was not itching after it. I Love it for legs! It may turn out to be the only shaver I will EVER buy! Worth the money. Buy it - you will love it, too.</li>
            <li> This is a great ladies&#x27; razor.  I love that it is ergonomically easy to hold, and I get a great shave.  Easy to use on the backs of my legs.  I&#x27;ve owned a great many electric razors and this far surpasses any of them.  I had used my husband&#x27;s skull shaver and loved it.  This one is great for girls, though really the same razor.  One of the best features is the quick 5-10 second cleaning process.  Brilliant design and incredible shave.  Thanks, Butterfly/Skull shaver.</li>
            <li> lives up to its promise -- does a better than average job quickly, easily, and with no problems -- makes daily life better and easier</li>
            <li> This is the quickest and easiest shave I have ever gotten from an electric razor. Very comfortable fit in my hand. The extra head for underarms worked very well also.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife since she has always complained of getting cuts whenever she shaves her leg. At first, she wasn&#x27;t impressed but after her first use, she was very impressed with how clean it cuts. She told me she did not get any more cuts and it was so fast and easy that anyone could do it.</li>
            <li> Nice and gentle to use and very ergonomic,however you do have to use it quite frequently</li>
            <li> Great for a quick shave, easy to use and fits all the curves.  Am happy to have found an alternative to blade razors.  Will use this for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a fun shaver to use because it  cuts my shaving time in half. Its also easy to clean, but does take longer than a regular shaver because you have to clean all four heads. The light that tells you when to recharge it is helpful.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift from my mom on my birthday, and I love it! It is better than my other shaver and gives a nice close shave that is similar to a razor.</li>
            <li> Love this product really easy to use.  Easy to hold and leaves the skin really soft.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I works well for a person with a disability.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I have ever had -- even acts as an exfoliator. Though more expensive than most women&#x27;s razors, it does a much better job.</li>
            <li> Incredible shaver. I am personally so excited for how close I can get with it. It is maybe a tiny bit less close than a razor but now I have no bumps, no extra cost for creams, no extra 10 minutes in the shower, and noticeable improvement in my ingrown hairs. I am fair skinned and for some reason have sensitive skin which seemed to cause pain from open pores from traditional shaving. This razor will be all I use now. I bought the attachment for under arms also.</li>
            <li> I love love love this shaver!  I&#x27;ve been looking at electric shavers for a long time and finally decided to get this one and I am certainly glad I did! The shave is as close as a razor without the mess, or cuts.</li>
            <li> The shaver is awesome! My skin feels so smooth and I love it!😊</li>
            <li> Recently, my wife purchased the famous brand name (the name starts with N) 3 floating heads men’s razor.  Its price was $100 more than the Skull Shaver Butterfly razor.  She tried the expensive men’s razor several times and she was so unhappy with it that she returned it under Amazon’s 45 day return policy.  Without her knowing, I purchased the Skull Shaver Butterfly Smart razor as a gift for her. What follows is her review:&lt;br /&gt;Over my life I have purchased several manual and electric razors including the one mentioned above. I was never satisfied with any of them, that is, until I got the Skull Shaver Butterfly Smart razor that my husband bought for me.  I love it – I can’t say it enough I just love it. It’s absolutely everything I’ve ever wanted all in one razor.  It’s light weight, easy to hold, very maneuverable, simple to clean and it seems to run forever on a charge; but the real important thing is how it shaves.  That’s the easy part – it does a wonderful job on my legs and under my arms.  The shave is smooth and very close with no need of any shaving cream, and the five floating heads assure that you’ll never miss a spot.  My husband has heard so many plus comments from me that he is threatening to shave his head!  SkullShaver, you have a really GREAT product in the Butterfly shaver – every woman should have one.</li>
