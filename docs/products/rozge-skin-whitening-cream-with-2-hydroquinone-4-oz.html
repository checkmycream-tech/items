            <li>Very very good product!!!</li>
            <li>ONE OF THE BEST WHITENERS I HAVE USED</li>
            <li>best cream ive ever used.</li>
            <li>this is perfect for lightening scars and skin imperfections on knees, legs, and arms.</li>
            <li>However company is wonderful  and accepted return and refunded.</li>
            <li>Good luck in your search  for a whitening product!</li>
            <li>sensational!.</li>
            <li>It even smells great.</li>
            <li>It is good for scars but not for a clearer skin tone.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with the results of Rozge&#x27;s product!</li>
            <li>Good product and price appropriate</li>
            <li>The cream has a very strong smell that I did not like, so I stopped using this cream.</li>
            <li>I used one that was more effective at removing scars.</li>
            <li>I have extra oily skin, and this is a great moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t break out my face; not to mention its great for evening out the complexion as well.  </li>
            <li>Again, I cannot be sure</li>
            <li>bought two more.</li>
            <li>Unlike most people on here, I have a realist view of these types of creams.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>cream was ok.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I use it as a spot treatment and it works fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>I love it ...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will continue using it for better results</li>
            <li>I find this product is working better than others i have tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this product 2 stars because I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good product, but definitively not for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>leaves face so smooth and moisturizing.  not oily.  </li>
            <li>well worth it!</li>
            <li>I love it&#x27;s consistency, light scent, and it&#x27;s fast absorbency on the skin.</li>
            <li>just used it every night right before bed,</li>
            <li>I had forgotten the name of it when it was time to reorder, but thanks to Amazon all I had to do was look in my order history and Bam...reorder!</li>
            <li>I gave this product three stars because it didn&#x27;t get rid of all the spots, but it did take away the clusters of darkened areas that were pretty noticable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought similar effective creams from many local Beauty Supply shops for less than $8 (I&#x27;m sure you can too.)    </li>
            <li>but i am seeing some positive change</li>
            <li>So I took a chance because the price was super reasonable and it had most of the ingredients that more expensive products contain.  </li>
            <li>cream filled me me this clarifying expectations acne blemishes and hopefully completely eliminate me leave me slick and smooth skin and helps to expression</li>
            <li>I experienced a little bit of skin irritation on my face &amp; neck, so I used it on less sensitive skin body parts.  </li>
            <li>Well this stuff eliminates the new scarring from acne immediately and fades the old scars just as well.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;A natural alternative to chemical peel.</li>
            <li>Else, find another &#x27;natural&#x27; bleaching cream.</li>
            <li>At first, nothing was happening- but after speaking to a registered nurse, who works for a dermatologist, she said that it takes time and as long as it had Hydroquinone (2%, which is the max that is allowed that is without a prescription)</li>
            <li>After just a week of use twice daily, i notice brown spots on my arms and the back of my hands beginning to fade, absorbs fast and leaves the skin soft with no residue.</li>
            <li>other than that I do not see much whitening effect, may be because its just been 10 days.</li>

            <li> This lightened them just not completely.</li>
            <li> I have dark scars I&#x27;m trying to remove from my back.</li>
            <li> It does irritate the skin so be careful.</li>
            <li> Since I use it as a spot treatment, one jar lasts me roughly 6 months.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing Skin Whitening by Rozge, I did some research, but found minimal reviews on its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> Ask for the lightening creams, they have some in 2%, 3% Hydroquinone and other bleaching agents.  </li>
            <li> I also exfoliated my face every other day and applied a face mask (a pumpkin enzyme 10 minute mask)</li>
            <li> The big disappointment was when I received the jar, to read that the main ingredient is Hydroquinone 2% (which they do not list online.)  </li>
            <li> the only complaint is that after about 30 days it looses it affectiveness</li>
            <li> I have been using the product, day and night, on all the dark spots on my face that I thought were formed from sun exposure.</li>
            <li> After washing my face, I spot treated the areas, then waited at least 5 minutes before applying facial lotion</li>
            <li> Looks like they have used a small quantity of ammonia in it which would be harmful.</li>
            <li> My skin is covered with small bumps cause by the irritation of this product.</li>
            <li> Try it on a small area of your body before use.</li>
            <li> i wish it was alot inside because the cream is very small which cause you to buy about three or so..</li>
            <li> , I wish it was a bit less expensive; but</li>
            <li> thats the only bad thing about it</li>
            <li> I feel there is a very distinctive smell that comes from this product which is very bad.</li>
            <li> Hydroquinone is a rip-off.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, I&#x27;m a picker...</li>
            <li> Was skeptical but it actutally (given some time) works and does fade brown spots!</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very very good product!!!</li>
            <li> performs just as advertised will order again soon have alredy purchased it several time but the only complaint is that after about 30 days it looses it affectiveness</li>
            <li> This product came on time. For packaging I will rate it only 1 as it came with something too big that I had ordered and I was almost about to miss it. Anyways lets come to the product itself. I have been using this for 10 days now. I feel there is a very distinctive smell that comes from this product which is very bad. Looks like they have used a small quantity of ammonia in it which would be harmful. Again, I cannot be sure but that&#x27;s what I feel. other than that I do not see much whitening effect, may be because its just been 10 days. I will update my review soon. I used it for hyperpigmentation but I still I see those on my face.</li>
            <li> After 8 weeks of daily use, which is the amount of time dermatologists recommend using hydroquinone, this product did not work on my hyperpigmentation. I would not purchase this cream again.</li>
            <li> it works… must use it faithfully  covers brown spots..</li>
            <li> I just started using this, not even a month...so Im still unsure of the outcome, though Im not seeing any adverse reaction to my skin.</li>
            <li> Good product and price appropriate</li>
            <li> it works. just used it every night right before bed, that when it worked. i wish it was alot inside because the cream is very small which cause you to buy about three or so..thats the only bad thing about it</li>
            <li> I bought this product, looking for an alternative to those containing hydroquinone.  I got lured by the product&#x27;s description \\&quot;A natural alternative to chemical peel. Will not irritate skin.\\&quot;  The big disappointment was when I received the jar, to read that the main ingredient is Hydroquinone 2% (which they do not list online.)  Paying $30 for 2% Hydroquinone is a rip-off.  I&#x27;ve bought similar effective creams from many local Beauty Supply shops for less than $8 (I&#x27;m sure you can too.)    I experienced a little bit of skin irritation on my face &amp; neck, so I used it on less sensitive skin body parts.  My recommendation is to skip this product and got to your local Beauty Supply shops.  Ask for the lightening creams, they have some in 2%, 3% Hydroquinone and other bleaching agents.  Else, find another &#x27;natural&#x27; bleaching cream.</li>
            <li> ONE OF THE BEST WHITENERS I HAVE USED</li>
            <li> best cream ive ever used. one month beginning to lighten. leaves face so smooth and moisturizing.  not oily.  sensational!. bought two more. use morning and night.</li>
            <li> Unlike most people on here, I have a realist view of these types of creams.&lt;br /&gt;This cream was ok. I used one that was more effective at removing scars. I have dark scars I&#x27;m trying to remove from my back. This lightened them just not completely. It does irritate the skin so be careful.</li>
            <li> this is perfect for lightening scars and skin imperfections on knees, legs, and arms. I like to use this only in the winter on my face though. No sun.</li>
            <li> still waiting for the result but i am seeing some positive change</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for over 18 months now off and on. I love this stuff.  I use it as a spot treatment and it works fabulous!  Sadly, I&#x27;m a picker...when I get  a pimple I squeeze and pick at it. Well this stuff eliminates the new scarring from acne immediately and fades the old scars just as well. It even smells great. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but well worth it! Since I use it as a spot treatment, one jar lasts me roughly 6 months. I had forgotten the name of it when it was time to reorder, but thanks to Amazon all I had to do was look in my order history and Bam...reorder!</li>
            <li> Horrible product. It makes your skin red, and also does the opposite. It is good for scars but not for a clearer skin tone. It makes your skin darker than lighter</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for yrs now, and I will continue to use it.  I have extra oily skin, and this is a great moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t break out my face; not to mention its great for evening out the complexion as well.  I love this stuff, I wish it was a bit less expensive; but oh well</li>
            <li> Before purchasing Skin Whitening by Rozge, I did some research, but found minimal reviews on its effectiveness.  So I took a chance because the price was super reasonable and it had most of the ingredients that more expensive products contain.  I have been using the product, day and night, on all the dark spots on my face that I thought were formed from sun exposure. After washing my face, I spot treated the areas, then waited at least 5 minutes before applying facial lotion (SPF if it was the morning).  This gives the product time to absorb into the skin.  I also exfoliated my face every other day and applied a face mask (a pumpkin enzyme 10 minute mask) once a week.  At first, nothing was happening- but after speaking to a registered nurse, who works for a dermatologist, she said that it takes time and as long as it had Hydroquinone (2%, which is the max that is allowed that is without a prescription) then it should have some effect.  After a month (as the product indicates) I finally saw results! As with all products, results varies depending on how your skin reacts to the chemicals- some people don&#x27;t have results while others do.  I am really pleased with the results of Rozge&#x27;s product! I gave this product three stars because it didn&#x27;t get rid of all the spots, but it did take away the clusters of darkened areas that were pretty noticable.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review was informative and helpful.  Good luck in your search  for a whitening product!</li>
            <li> Do not recommend as it did not make a difference. However company is wonderful  and accepted return and refunded.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 2 stars because I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good product, but definitively not for people with sensitive skin. I love it&#x27;s consistency, light scent, and it&#x27;s fast absorbency on the skin. However, it gave me the skin rash of a life time. My skin is covered with small bumps cause by the irritation of this product. Try it on a small area of your body before use. (FYI it took a week for it to develope.)</li>
            <li> I only used this cream twice to lighten spots on my hands.  The cream has a very strong smell that I did not like, so I stopped using this cream.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical but it actutally (given some time) works and does fade brown spots!</li>
            <li> Great...works!! As always!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love it ... It exceeded my expectations ....</li>
            <li> cream filled me me this clarifying expectations acne blemishes and hopefully completely eliminate me leave me slick and smooth skin and helps to expression lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using it for better results</li>
            <li> I find this product is working better than others i have tried. After just a week of use twice daily, i notice brown spots on my arms and the back of my hands beginning to fade, absorbs fast and leaves the skin soft with no residue.</li>
