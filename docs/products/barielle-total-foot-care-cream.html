    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>January of 2014:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Barielle foot and hand creams for a number of years, and found them to be excellent products.  </li>
            <li>It is the best!!!!!</li>
            <li>Nothing I have ever tried works as good as this cream</li>
            <li>The cream is not greasy, absorbs nicely and leaves my skin feeling heavenly.</li>
            <li>I found Ididnot need the socks as they were too warm for me.</li>
            <li>This product has a pleasant light scent and I soak my feet, use a pumice stone, then follow up with Barielle foot cream.  </li>
            <li>Nice light scent.</li>
            <li>I am glad I was able to find it.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It is better than any products like this that I have tried from the retail stores.  </li>
            <li>After using this product over 20 years, I did notice that the product in the latest bottles is thinner, perhaps more dilute (?)</li>
            <li>This product is excellent for dry fingers, toes &amp; heels.  </li>
            <li>After a bath I use my Ped Egg gently on the problem areas of my feet, then apply this fabulous, nicely scented cream.</li>
            <li>A great hydrating cream especially with a pair of socks.</li>
            <li>Great product received promptly for present.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product for the past year and find it again to be an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>THE ORIGINAL PLEASE PLEASE LET ME KNOW.</li>
            <li>I love the large size, so that I can slather it on and not worry about running out.</li>
            <li>More than that is pure indulgence, which is what we are all entitled to from time to time.</li>
            <li>I have being using this cream for at least 10 years, I can see the result, wonderful.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many different creams, potions, diets, dietary supplements, u name it, including seeing md,s..</li>
            <li>This is a tried and true solution for getting your feet to be soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>The cream used to be sold in premium department stores and is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>PLEASE BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL FORMULA!!  </li>
            <li>Item as described, arrived quickly, packed well, will buy again, thanks</li>
            <li>This jar that i recieved must be a NEW FORMULA because it doesn&#x27;t work at all!!!  </li>
            <li>I was delighted to find such a large jar at such a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>But the latest 12 oz jar of foot cream is very different from the product I bought last summer.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both of them have very dry, cracking heels which only Barielle has been able to soften.    </li>
            <li>I have used just about every foot creme out there - and this one is the only one that keeps my feet soft.</li>
            <li>My heels get so dry and crusty the finally split and bleed and are very painful..not to mention the cracks get infected.</li>
            <li>One previous reviewer indicated Barielle had been sold and apparently the new owners have changed the formula to boost their profit margin.  </li>

            <li> And had the texture of a heavy cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,the new product is like putting LOTION on your feet and the next day ,after applying and using cotton booties to sleep,  </li>
            <li> So sad to see this destruction of a fine product in the pursuit of profits.</li>
            <li> I have tried other foot creams and always come back to Barielle - it cushions and massages the feet as it heals and prevents future</li>
            <li> of my life I have been plauged with extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> the old formula was restoritive to dried cracking feet and hands OVERNIGHT!  </li>
            <li> Since then, Barielle says they have corrected what was a manufacturing error, and the product is now back to its previous consistency.  </li>
            <li> My feet look like regular feet now and I am having to use the Ped egg less and less.</li>
            <li> Not only is the product different, but the label is poorly applied, clearly different than the previous labels.  </li>
            <li> But you really do not need a lot when using it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seems to have been diluted ... watered down in some fashion.  </li>
            <li> Without a nightly application my poor feet get dry and scaly.  </li>
            <li> there is very little difference.  </li>
            <li> I wrote a negative review of Barielle&#x27;s foot cream in January of 2014.  </li>
            <li> The creme is so thick and luxurious that just a touch works.</li>
            <li> After a serious episode of infected foot cracks a friend of mine gave me a jar of this cream.</li>
            <li> Its AWFUL...................</li>

            <li> BARIELLE TOTAL FOOT CARE CREAM&lt;br /&gt;All of my life I have been plauged with extremely dry skin.I have tried many, many different creams, potions, diets, dietary supplements, u name it, including seeing md,s..I finally got diagnosed with hypothyroid and replacement was added but that made no difference in my skin.My heels get so dry and crusty the finally split and bleed and are very painful..not to mention the cracks get infected.And yes, I do cream my feet atnight and wear socksto bed and socks in my garden shoes.After a serious episode of infected foot cracks a friend of mine gave me a jar of this cream.Initially I did wear cotton socks after applying the cream at night.The cream is not greasy, absorbs nicely and leaves my skin feeling heavenly.I found Ididnot need the socks as they were too warm for me.After a bath I use my Ped Egg gently on the problem areas of my feet, then apply this fabulous, nicely scented cream.My feet look like regular feet now and I am having to use the Ped egg less and less.I can now wear sandals without embarrassment and no longer have thecracks to get infected.This cream has truly been a life changer for me!I also use it on my hands and legs and they too look great!My doctors cannot beleive the improvement.</li>
            <li> Does the job without being too oily. Nice light scent.</li>
            <li> This product has a pleasant light scent and I soak my feet, use a pumice stone, then follow up with Barielle foot cream.  This product is not inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This is a tried and true solution for getting your feet to be soft and healthy.  The cream used to be sold in premium department stores and is worth the price.  I am glad I was able to find it.</li>
            <li> used for years and have the smoothest feet and elbows</li>
            <li> I wrote a negative review of Barielle&#x27;s foot cream in January of 2014.  That review is below.  Since then, Barielle says they have corrected what was a manufacturing error, and the product is now back to its previous consistency.  I&#x27;ve used the product for the past year and find it again to be an excellent product.  I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From January of 2014:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Barielle foot and hand creams for a number of years, and found them to be excellent products.  But the latest 12 oz jar of foot cream is very different from the product I bought last summer.  It&#x27;s seems to have been diluted ... watered down in some fashion.  It doesn&#x27;t have the same creamy texture as before.  One previous reviewer indicated Barielle had been sold and apparently the new owners have changed the formula to boost their profit margin.  Not only is the product different, but the label is poorly applied, clearly different than the previous labels.  Will have to look for another product for my feet.</li>
            <li> I have used this foot cream for twenty years. But not anymore. This product has been diluted until it runs instead of spreads. It no longer provides the coverage it did a short time ago. So sad to see this destruction of a fine product in the pursuit of profits.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years!  Without a nightly application my poor feet get dry and scaly.  I was delighted to find such a large jar at such a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> A great hydrating cream especially with a pair of socks.</li>
            <li> I have tried other foot creams and always come back to Barielle - it cushions and massages the feet as it heals and prevents future calluses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marless Thomas</li>
            <li> Item as described, arrived quickly, packed well, will buy again, thanks</li>
            <li> I have been using this foot cream for years now and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Nothing I have ever tried works as good as this cream and I have tried them all. It is the best!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been a barielle foot cream user for 30 some years!!!!  This jar that i recieved must be a NEW FORMULA because it doesn&#x27;t work at all!!!  the old formula was restoritive to dried cracking feet and hands OVERNIGHT!  And had the texture of a heavy cream,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,the new product is like putting LOTION on your feet and the next day ,after applying and using cotton booties to sleep,  there is very little difference.  Its AWFUL...................PLEASE BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL FORMULA!!  OR IF THERE IS ANYONE OUT THERE WHO HAS SOME LEFTOVER STOCK OF THE ORIGINAL PLEASE PLEASE LET ME KNOW.</li>
            <li> Great product received promptly for present.</li>
            <li> I have used just about every foot creme out there - and this one is the only one that keeps my feet soft. I love the large size, so that I can slather it on and not worry about running out. But you really do not need a lot when using it! The creme is so thick and luxurious that just a touch works. More than that is pure indulgence, which is what we are all entitled to from time to time.</li>
            <li> I have being using this cream for at least 10 years, I can see the result, wonderful.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for dry fingers, toes &amp; heels.  It is better than any products like this that I have tried from the retail stores.  My husband and son use it nightly, as do I (when I remember). Both of them have very dry, cracking heels which only Barielle has been able to soften.    After using this product over 20 years, I did notice that the product in the latest bottles is thinner, perhaps more dilute (?) but still works well.</li>
