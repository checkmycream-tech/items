            <li>The shampoo smells great.</li>

            <li>The conditioner wasn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
            <li>This product gave me great results.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo felt great as soon as I used it.</li>

            <li>The shampoo and conditioner were great</li>
            <li>I have used Herbal Essence products for years and am always happy with my results.</li>
            <li>The shampoo seemed to really do a great job cleaning</li>
            <li>and like I said smelled great.  </li>

            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>When I rinsed it out, my hair smelled amazing!</li>
            <li>I want to start off by saying this product smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I noticed my hair still smelt amazing!</li>
            <li>The first thing I was impressed with , was how wonderful the product smelled.  </li>
            <li>It feels healthier and it smells nice too!</li>
            <li>Very happy :)</li>
            <li>2-3: Still good to great results.&lt;br /&gt;Days</li>
            <li>I loved every thing about it</li>
            <li>it was so silky smooth, and the treatment just gave it the perfect touch!</li>
            <li>however this product has the perfect smooth texture.</li>
            <li>The shampoo itself may have smelled good, but once rinsed out my hair felt</li>
            <li>conditioner was doing what conditioner does.. it smelled soo good.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t comb through my hair without spraying a fair amount of detangler in it.</li>
            <li>This worked fairly well on my hair, which is medium thickness and length.</li>
            <li>and I think this would be a good system for people with thicker hair.  </li>
            <li>I used the products for about a week, loved the shampoo</li>
            <li>This herbal essences product has a bright lemon-herb scent during use that remains on my hair for a good part of the day.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a good bit of lather</li>
            <li>I loved the intensive cream, though.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get a good coating on my hair-</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conditioner: Good, lightweight conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very fresh and energizing scent, perfect way to start the day.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with all three products.</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love great smelling hair?</li>
            <li>and I was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very refreshing, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>The lemon scent is very refreshing</li>
            <li>I liked the conditioner as well, and it smelled so good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scent: Pleasant and floral/herbal, and very strong.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels sexy!</li>
            <li>and I love the way it made my hair feel!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to my friends for sure!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I was able to straighten my hair with almost no frizz!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love these products!</li>
            <li>I love how the shampoo and conditioner so that got it one star!</li>
            <li>After using these products for over a week my hair feels softer and has more volume now!</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?!</li>
            <li>My first impression was that they all smell great!  </li>
            <li>and I would recommend this product for sure!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the intensive treatment!</li>
            <li>the smell was amazing</li>
            <li>The smell was amazing.</li>
            <li>The conditioner, I think it really amazing.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even begin to explain how amazing the leave in conditioner is.</li>
            <li>Thank the Heaven Gods for this amazing product.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing with that lemon grass scent.</li>
            <li>The lemon fades into the rest of the scents and evens out into the amazing smell I was just talking about.</li>
            <li>I liked the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The intensive treatment also gave nice results.  </li>
            <li>While it smelled nice</li>
            <li>A nice clarifying shampoo to use once a week or so to get all the styling products out.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t feel like it would get the job done on its own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I was sent these products for review purposes from influenster, all opinions are my own*</li>
            <li>I honestly can say that I won&#x27;t purchase this collection persay</li>
            <li>With that being said, the one product that I really liked was the intensive treatment.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, herbal smell to it.</li>
            <li>and I liked it since the scent grew on</li>
            <li>I really liked the results of this product.  </li>
            <li>Kind of smells like cleaner.</li>
            <li>The intensive treatment has a nice consistency to it.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo was nice.</li>
            <li>My hair felt really nice after I rinsed it out.</li>
            <li>I also noticed the lemon helped create a nice shine.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo went on nicely and did the job in one washing</li>
            <li>The conditioner has a silky consistency and applied nicely as well.  </li>
            <li>but it would be nice for a morning shower to help wake you up.</li>
            <li>and I really liked it.</li>
            <li>I really liked the smell in the shower</li>
            <li>I then used the treatment which had a nice texture as well.  </li>
            <li>I liked them a lot, 10/10, will use again.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of them, the shampoo lathers nicely and rinses well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest, I am a hair care snob.  </li>
            <li>It has a very nice, light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It felt great and rinsed clean.</li>
            <li>Shampoo smelled wonderful and I used the amount I normally would use</li>
            <li>The thing that stuck out the most to me was the amazing scent of these products, and my hair smelled amazing all the way until I went to bed at night.</li>
            <li>SO clean and refreshing not overly fragrant, just a light great scent!  </li>
            <li>The conditioner smelled just as good as the shampoo and rinsed out easily.</li>
            <li>They are all very easy to rinse out</li>
            <li>It has a very strong smell of lemon and basil.  </li>
            <li>Just like the shampoo its very light textured and smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>My hair felt so clean and so nice!  </li>
            <li>I was so happy and excited to receive this bundle for free from Influenster!  </li>
            <li>This trio was not my favorite,  but it smells really nice.</li>
            <li>The conditioner smells nice also, but I would not be able to use it every day.  </li>
            <li>One of the things I liked the most about it was my day two hair did not feel as oily</li>
            <li>The intensive treatment was what I liked the most.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smell any basil in it, but I&#x27;m kind of glad of that.</li>
            <li>I am a huge &amp;#34;has to smell good in order to put it on my body&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I was extremely impressed with the conditioners, my hair was so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Firstly  I would like to say that these items smell great.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell of the shampoo,  hints of Peppermint &amp;  gave that cool tingly feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;overall super happy with the detoxifying line, cant wait to get the full size!</li>
            <li>The smell of a product, along with the way a product performs, is very important to me.  </li>
            <li>I liked the scent, it was crisp and bright.</li>
            <li>I received this produce free to test and review and really enjoyed using it!</li>
            <li>I happily received this bundle for free to test &amp; review as i&#x27;m already a loyal herbal essences user.</li>
            <li>I recieved this bundle for free to test and review, i was very excited to use it!</li>
            <li>The lemon basil scent was refreshing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice light lemon smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say I love it</li>
            <li>The conditioner is as equally satisfying as the shampoo.</li>
            <li>So I thought that this product would be perfect for a pick me up in getting moisture back into my hair.</li>
            <li>love the way my hair smells throughout the day...and can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li>I used the Intensive treatment and my hair felt a bit better at the ends.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of all the products.  </li>
            <li>Okay now on with my review.</li>
            <li>I felt my hair need something more</li>
            <li>First off, the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li>Not to mention i got this product for free to test and review!</li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I love the silkiness of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I always love Herbal Essences.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is ok:</li>
            <li>so my volumizing products worked better).</li>
            <li>The intensive treatment I am in love with: it was the thicker conditioner I was expecting but gave so much softening and strength to my hair, and the scent is great.</li>
            <li>That being said, I did feel that my hair needed more moisturizing after I rinsed the conditioner out.</li>
            <li>The intensive treatment seemed to leave my hair a lot more moisturized than the conditioner did.</li>
            <li>The reason being is that my hair has never felt better.</li>
            <li>and I am thoroughly pleased with this product that I received from Influenster to test and review.  </li>
            <li>I used all three products together and enjoyed the shampoo and intensive treatment the most.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too picky about conditioners (mostly shampoos)  </li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>I received the line from a Vox Box and I have enjoyed using the products.</li>
            <li>However, I bleached my hair about a week ago and the treatment is now my favorite product of the line.</li>
            <li>I love this product my hair feels so much better since i started using it</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the lemons as I was using it in my shower.</li>
            <li>I didn’t notice a reduction in the static in my hair though.</li>
            <li>It did an okay job.  </li>
            <li>Upon walking around the house after my great shower, I still smell the products and my hair is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this combo.</li>
            <li>But what I like the most out of all the three products is the treatment.</li>
            <li>I mostly used just the shampoo and conditioner and was more than satisfied.</li>
            <li>Firstly, The shampoo has an amazing smell to it!</li>
            <li>You want to use this maybe once a week, you don&#x27;t want to finish up the magical moments with this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>I recieved these products compliments of influencer and am so glad I had the opportunity to try them.</li>
            <li>I really love this line of products that I received from Influenster to review.</li>
            <li>I tried the shampoo and loved how it cleaned my hair and smelled so fresh and lemony.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these products to others as I was really impressed with the quality for the price.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner were okay</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I really love the lemon smell of the products.</li>
            <li>I love how these products made my hair feel and look.</li>
            <li>This is a product I would spend money on after my sample is gone :)</li>
            <li>It smells refreshing and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>even the static that comes with winter times was gone.</li>
            <li>conditioner wasn&#x27;t quite as appealing.</li>
            <li>and I found that I really enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the shampoo-</li>
            <li>also really love the freshness of this scent.</li>
            <li>The Thai Lemon Basil is surprisingly refreshing.</li>
            <li>but I had more volume than ever.</li>
            <li>really love the idea of a detox for your hair--much like bodies and mind</li>
            <li>Thicker, creamer, for more intense treatment of damaged ends, or in this case, to re-moisturize the ends after using the clarifying shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: GREAT results.  </li>
            <li>Styling is getting more challenging.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As soon as I got them i smelled them and i loved the smell right away.</li>
            <li>It left my hair shiny smelling delicious and nice and clean.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>the smells have a very clean and refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>I like the consistency, very rich and silky.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo has a nice, rich, lather.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo had a medium lather, so I felt like my hair was getting nice and clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of this whole line is amazing!</li>
            <li>and it did pretty good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Shampoo: To start with -- this shampoo smells pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>First off, I LOVED the smell.  </li>
            <li>i was extremely fortunate to recieve this product for a free testing it has been incredibly amazing to use.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for the dry winters here in Colorado.</li>
            <li>They have a great clean scent and leave your hair super clean yet</li>
            <li>The products smell SO good, and they do a really good job of getting your hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Next, the shampoo lathers rather nicely, and the conditioner was great for detangling.  </li>
            <li>However, this conditioner felt very light in my hands, and after using it my hair felt smooth and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I recently received this product free to test and review and absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li>using on the ends worked just fine and my hair a bit more manageable and not so fly-away...</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner is great, leaves my hair smelling good for days and my hair doesn&#x27;t get as ouly as it does with other shampoo and conditioners.</li>
            <li>I shower at night and in the morning my hair is still shiny and soft without fly aways.</li>
            <li>The smell again is lovely, and my ends feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>so I feel like I cant give the intense treatment as good of a critique.</li>
            <li>I was lucky to have received this amazing product for FREE from Influenster for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li>my favorite part has to be the after shower hair brushing and how smooth and easy it was.</li>
            <li>So excited to be able to test and review it.  </li>
            <li>I was excited because I love hair products, makeup, skin care, etc.</li>
            <li>This is the most incredible smelling product I have used and will definitely be going to purchase full size bottles of this product line.</li>
            <li>the shampoo n conditioner and hair treatment made my hair feel healthy and clean and</li>
            <li>It feels lightweight and is easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li>It washes out easily.  </li>
            <li>My favorite is the mask, which has such a great texture.</li>
            <li>It was too strong for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like or dislike the smell of the three of them because it&#x27;s not too strong, but it&#x27;s also not a smell I would request.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and the treatment is amazing my hair has never felt so soft and light</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>the first thing I noticed was the scent, which was AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I think that for this price range, these products are pretty effective.</li>
            <li>Mostly because I don&#x27;t want greasy hair and since my hair is so long I need a great conditioner for easy care once I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>My hair was silky, smooth and easy to comb.</li>
            <li>Let me start out by saying my hair is color treated and on the fine side.</li>
            <li>First I would like to say that it has a really nice light smell of lemons.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, wavy, and frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have a fine hear, but quite a bit of it.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that I don&#x27;t have as many flyaways as usual, which is wonderful bonus in south Louisiana humidity.</li>
            <li>and it seemed to work fine on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I do think that someone with longer hair may need a heavier conditioner or an added product post-shower to fully detangle their hair, but for shorter or less tangle prone hair types, this system is perfect!</li>
            <li>I have fine, oily hair that gets flaky looking when I don&#x27;t get all my hair products (hair spray) out in the shower.</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t put it at the top of my head since I get oily so quick).</li>
            <li>The products smell great and left my hair feeling light, smooth, and really clean!  </li>
            <li>The smell is actually quite refreshing and invigorating, I always prefer citrus smelling products, so that was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>I received this as a free trial and overall great product, love the smell, my hair feels clean and light.</li>
            <li>And  bonus, they have very light fresh smell..</li>
            <li>I started with the detoxifying shampoo which was light and smooth in my hand, which made me feel secure putting it in my hair.</li>
            <li>That is a HUGE plus for me.</li>

            <li>I received this product as a voxbox for free to test and review.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE that super clean feeling.</li>
            <li>The conditioner was a bit too light and sort of dried my hair out, but when paired with the treatment product it was the perfect combination.  </li>
            <li>I love that the system is available as a bundle - they&#x27;re worth having on hand if you do any traveling.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I was extremely excited to receive these products free to test and review.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a decent lather and the fragrance lingers on your hair nicely afterwards.  </li>
            <li>My hair has much more body and is less fly away.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed with the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this</li>
            <li>so I was excited to see what it could do for my dryness.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got to take a shower</li>
            <li>(Its so soft I cannot help myself) and It was still soft as it was when I got out of the shower, smelled great, and most of all.....</li>
            <li>My hair was so light and shiny and full of bounce.</li>
            <li>Hair turned out nice and soft but the smell was nowhere near as good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>First off, the smell is lovely.</li>
            <li>I have very fine straight hair and use a lot of product to obtain some volume.</li>
            <li>My husband even noticed it and how much he liked the new scent.</li>
            <li>I was one of the lucky ones chosen to receive this bundle for free through Influenster to use and review.  </li>
            <li>and my hair and head had that squeeky clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>and I felt that I had to use a lot of shampoo to feel clean and the conditioner didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling silky like</li>
            <li>The Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying collection is nothing short of wonderful.  </li>
            <li>recommend to anyone, it give your a clean polished look.</li>
            <li>My hair feels squeaky clean after using the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I smelled some lemon, which to me, always smells clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and energizing.</li>
            <li>My hair still felt clean.  </li>
            <li>Washes easily from my hair and leaves hair feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>After rinsing, my hair felt and smelled clean.  </li>
            <li>What I love the most was it left my hair easy to comb after using all 3.</li>
            <li>Although not very thick, I actually liked that because it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The smell of lemons is very relaxing, clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super creamy and rich and you want to leave in for about three minutes to let it work</li>
            <li>Even thought I got it for free for review, the price is actually pretty cheap and affordable.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend everyone to try these products, they also smell so good.</li>
            <li>but I really loved the deep treatment.</li>
            <li>Once I received my box I immediately put them in my shower to use the next morning and already loved the scent.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I absolutely loved these products and will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li>It was a light, fresh smell.</li>
            <li>It has much more body and looks much healthier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely keep the shampoo in mind when I need a good detox.  </li>
            <li>No waxy build up feel, just nice and silky soft.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I used it for a week and have had a good experience.</li>
            <li>thing I didn&#x27;t love about this is that the conditioner is really watery.</li>
            <li>The conditioner and intense repair was fantastic!</li>
            <li>so I felt I couldn&#x27;t give you guys a fair enough review, so I decided to go out and buy the full sizes.</li>
            <li>The shampoo didn&#x27;t lather as much as most shampoos, but it still did a good job at cleansing my hair without drying it out or weighing it down.</li>
            <li>shampoo was clean, lathered nicely and left my hair feeling light and clean.</li>
            <li>and it was nice and lightweight, yet conditioning enough for my shoulder length, fine hair.</li>
            <li>First I have fine curly/ wavy hair</li>
            <li>My hair gets oily quick</li>
            <li>It rinsed out quickly.  </li>
            <li>so I put that in and quickly rinsed it out.  </li>
            <li>I was one of the lucky ones chosen to receive this bundle for testing and reviewing purposes from Influenster.  </li>
            <li>Wild Natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner are great.</li>
            <li>Not only does it perfume your shower with this amazing scent, but your hair feels soft and healthy all day!</li>
            <li>But I do love the smell and the fresh, light, soft feeling of my hair after using!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and at first the treatment seemed like to much for strands.</li>
            <li>This product works better than my $30 leave in conditer from a high end brand</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t add any extra product before drying my hair and I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>The shampoo was more runny than my normal shampoo, yet still lathered quite well.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I liked about it was the fresh smell of cassia!</li>
            <li>First I would like to mention that I received the kit free to sample from Influenster.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Running my brush through it released no furious crackles of static electricity like it normally does.</li>
            <li>I like the normal herbal essence line and love the idea of the naturals line as well.</li>
            <li>It lathered nicely and it didn&#x27;t take a ton of the product to clean my entire head of hair.</li>
            <li>Not over powering, yet enough to smell nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>The products left my hair clean and smelling amazing.</li>
            <li>My hair looks great, but feels weighed down.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this set is that the scent is light, fresh, and lemony.</li>
            <li>so I was definitely intrigued to use the intensive treatment, however this was my favorite part!</li>
            <li>One, it LOOKED more natural!</li>
            <li>It was invigorating first thing in the morning!</li>
            <li>which I like and those last two reasons have earned it two more stars!</li>
            <li>When i used the product the first time one thing i noticed was the smell!</li>
            <li>Overall I really enjoyed this kit!</li>
            <li>I will likely purchase more to add to my hair care routine!  </li>
            <li>For reference, I have shoulder-length, straight, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner were fairly light, which is great for my fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I really think this is the best smell of all the other new</li>
            <li>received the whole collection (shampoo, conditioner and intensive treatment) free to test and review from Influenster/VoxBox</li>
            <li>All-in-all, I really like this product line and will continue to use it even after these free trial products run out.</li>
            <li>: I liked this treatment better than the shampoo and conditioner for a few reasons.</li>
            <li>This product line did an amazing job at cleaning my hair with only one wash and rinse.</li>
            <li>I received the product(s) complimentary to test and review</li>
            <li>I would only use this once a week just because of my kind of hair.  </li>
            <li>I received these products complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>I went a couple day without washing after and the fresh scent was still there.</li>
            <li>I received these products complimentary to test and review.</li>
            <li>I received this kit complimentary from Influenster to try and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The following 2 time I tried the set it made my hair nice and shiny</li>
            <li>I can honestly say this actually did!</li>
            <li>I really liked the shampoo because it left my hair feeling a lot cleaner than others I have used.</li>
            <li>However, it did not get the frizz out of my hair like it says it will, but I don&#x27;t hold that against them because no products that I&#x27;ve tried so far have been able to get the frizz out of my hair.</li>
            <li>This will be the next kind I buy.</li>
            <li>I really liked the shampoo/conditioner and deep conditioning treatment!</li>
            <li>I really liked it, I am not a big fan of Herbal Essences</li>
            <li>I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, the shampoo lathered up nicely.  </li>
            <li>I have to say I absolute Love the smell of all 3 Products.. its a very clean,fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure when to use the soft treatment</li>
            <li>Powerful scent, and not a pleasing one.</li>
            <li>These products were complimentary to try and review.</li>
            <li>After just the first use of all three products, my hair is full &amp; a lot of bounce.</li>
            <li>It also had such a nice smell.</li>
            <li>I feel the conditioner did a nice job by itself that the intensive treatment wasn&#x27;t necessary (For me).  </li>
            <li>I received a complimentary sample of these products for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>I received these products in a complimentary trial and have been using them for about a week.</li>
            <li>It reminded me of something from my childhood that I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on,  but overall it was nice.</li>
            <li>I liked the overall effect it had on my hair.  </li>
            <li>First things first, I received this set free to test and review, from Influenster.</li>
            <li>(Which was actually really exciting, to be honest.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also have my hair colored at a salon using the most natural ingredient hair color line that I could</li>
            <li>so I use a lot of product and this seemed to give me a fresh start.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and healthy looking afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently received this bundle free to test and review, and it couldn&#x27;t have come at a better time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, fresh, citrusy and you really can smell it throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use very much of the shampoo, because it doesn&#x27;t work very well with my fine hair</li>
            <li>When I initially opened the product the first thing I fell in love with was the smell!</li>
            <li>was not overly excited to really sample this product, since I am not a drugstore brand user of hair products, but I was obligated, so I did.  </li>
            <li>so I went right for the intensive treatment and applied that and rinsed it out immediately with no soak time.</li>
            <li>I noticed my hair felt softer right away.</li>
            <li>Right after I wash my hair I want everyone to smell that citrus smell...</li>
            <li>After I blow dryed my hair, it was very soft and had a very clean crisp smell.</li>
            <li>I was not a fan of this scent however, it did smell clean, and did not leave much smell as the day went on.</li>
            <li>It does clean very well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to have your hands feeling soft rather then sticky and dry.</li>
            <li>First, the aroma of the products is so fresh.  </li>
            <li>I have used them several times and really enjoy the light, fresh scents.</li>
            <li>I just tried the herbal essence natural wild shampoo and conditioners this week as a sample/tester from Influenster and I am in love!</li>
            <li>Great for fine, thin curly hair.</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t feel weighed down, which is good since I need all the help I can get to add body.</li>
            <li>Then I was the most excited to use the intesive treatment because of my dry hair..</li>
            <li>I live in the midwest and in the middle of winter I need a good conditioner to avoid the static and to just give some extra moisture.  </li>
            <li>I was so surprised with how good these products actually made me hair feel/</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I really appreciated the natural aspect of the product itself as compared to more chemical laden hair products.</li>
            <li>My hair feels very clean and extremely soft but sitting here as my hair dries all I can smell is this chemical like stench like I just had some major dye work done at a cheap Salon.</li>
            <li>I washed with the shampoo and it had a good amount of lather without being too much as some other shampoos are.  </li>
            <li>I was left with my hair feeling clean, light, and bouncy.</li>
            <li>Great thick lather.</li>
            <li>When I first received the sample I was thinking that I would start with just the shampoo and conditioner and see what happened</li>
            <li>Over all I love this product and would definitely use it again given the chance.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product not only to detoxify your hair but to strengthen and make it healthy.</li>
            <li>Thanks again influenster!</li>
            <li>Got the voxbox of Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying collection for free for my review.</li>
            <li>However, I did have higher expectations than what I got.</li>
            <li>Secondly, it smelled more lemony.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t the hugest fan of the smell when I first got it</li>
            <li>Definitely not the most moisturizing hair mask I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I think the Macadamia one or the L&#x27;oreal one in the yellow bucket is much better.</li>
            <li>I had back surgery 3 weeks ago and just now being able to</li>
            <li>I started with the shampoo first.</li>
            <li>They have a great lasting smell but overall didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall I think the products are okay..</li>
            <li>The first day I used just the shampoo (out of habit of not using conditioner)</li>
            <li>I love citrusy smelling products, especially when I use them in the morning.</li>
            <li>Super fresh, clean, and utterly addictive.</li>
            <li>Overall the system is ok.  </li>
            <li>I did use the intensive treatment as a daily conditioner and that was better.</li>
            <li>I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying kit for free to test and review through influenster.</li>
            <li>I was hesitate at first to use this product because it also reminded me of Clorox wipes</li>
            <li>First, I used the shampoo, then the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I definitely think if you opt to try these products that you make sure to use all 3.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when using these products was the scent.</li>
            <li>This first thing I noticed was the smell of the product.  </li>
            <li>I usually only use shampoo so this is a lot more steps than I am used to.  </li>
            <li>and I will most likely purchase this</li>
            <li>This review is based on a free sample I received in a voxbox of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying shampoo, conditioner, and intensive treatment through my influenster membership.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only buy top of the line toiletries and appliances for my hair.  </li>
            <li>it really revived it!</li>
            <li>a few times I feel that I can give a fair assessment.</li>
            <li>Hair feels super clean, it&#x27;s really shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Then I used the conditioner which had a good texture without being too heavy.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo smells great and the conditioner and intense treatment left my hair silky smooth and manageable without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>My hair feels super soft after using this just ONE time!!</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this bundle to for free to test and review.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get a free sample of it</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to try this set out for free.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get this products for free to test out.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive herbal essences wild natural detoxifying kit shampoo,  conditioner,  and intesive treatment free to test.</li>
            <li>The shampoo left my hair feeling very clean yet still moisturized.</li>
            <li>The shampoo left my hair very clean and without buildup.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, dry and treated hair.  </li>
            <li>Although I liked the scent of all three products, I felt like the quality did not stand up to other brands.</li>
            <li>but I agree with the comments about the wonderful smell that my hair has after washing not lasting long enough.</li>
            <li>I received whole set with the shampoo, conditioner, and intensive repair treatment herbal essences natural for free to sample from Influenster in a VoxBox.</li>
            <li>The intense treatment felt more like a regular conditioner consistency, which I preferred.</li>
            <li>so I felt that in order to fairly asses it and compare it to past shampoo and conditioner I must stay consistent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just the Shampoo and Conditioner and it totally takes care of my static problems and really makes my hair shine.</li>
            <li>my hair combed very easy with my wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>It left my hair clean, smells fab and fresh.</li>
            <li>I especially loved that the intensive treatment did not leave my hair greasy or weighed down as many such treatments usually do.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying full size bottles of this product!</li>
            <li>Ladies (or gentleman, or human people reading this review), you will have other ladies (or gentleman, or human people) sneaking sniffs of your awesome hair and wondering where you got your shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I live in a dry climate so the deep conditioner is going to be a great summer staple for me</li>
            <li>After blow drying my hair straight to see the results, the entire regimen left my hair feeling very light and squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>love the smell, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, or leave it feeling oily.</li>
            <li>I still had to use some dry shampoo at my roots, but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>It is a fresh and pretty natural smell, so I do like that.</li>
            <li>It was easy to come through my hair after my shower and my hair had an overall lighter and cleaner feel when I styled it.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair that tends to get frizzy pretty fast.</li>
            <li>As I mentioned my hair is short and very healthy overall</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;intensive treatment&amp;#34; is by far the best, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The product not only leaves your hair smooth and silky but also leaves your hands super soft!.</li>
            <li>I let my hair air dry, like I normally do, and my hair felt clean and light.</li>
            <li>It was rejuvenating and fresh, not usually a scent I would choose</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice clean herbal smell that stays long after your hair is dry.</li>
            <li>I usually only wash my hair once or twice a week and these seemed to keep my hair pretty clean inbetween washington.  </li>
            <li>The scent has a clean, perfume smell but it was a little strong for me.</li>
            <li>I received the Herbal Essences Wild Natural shampoo, conditioner, and intensive treatment for free to test and review.</li>
            <li>Intensive Treatment is just that, intense.</li>
            <li>Again the scent was very pleasing.</li>
            <li>It lathers and cleans very well.</li>
            <li>It is a much thicker and nicer formula than the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Thanks Herbal Essence and Influencer for this product.  </li>
            <li>I felt that the intensive treatment really helped moisturize my hair and would like to use this product in my weekly routine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really want basil scent in my hair.</li>
            <li>I also have the detoxifying versions since I really have oily hair</li>
            <li>After trying it for about two weeks I have come to really like all three products in the package.  </li>
            <li>but it was way too much foam.  </li>
            <li>really wanted to like these products</li>
            <li>After styling my hair, it was much shinier and smoother than before I used these products.  </li>
            <li>so when I applied it I couldn’t really tell where I had it in my hair and not.</li>
            <li>The shampoo absolutely detoxed my hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like the line.</li>
            <li>My curls were very defined.</li>
            <li>This set was actually given to me to try out (FREE) from influenster.</li>
            <li>I received my Herbal Essence Wild Naturals complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li>I got this product free to test and review and the scent is similar to Bath &amp; Body Works- Kitchen Lemon.</li>
            <li>but it has left my hair silky and knot free.</li>
            <li>but I dont really know if it did that to my hair or not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent was very lemony and basil smelling.</li>
            <li>I am a frequent Herbal Essences user, and I received this package complimentary for review from Influenster.  </li>
            <li>It is straight, but has some wave to it.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li>It stayed smoother much longer</li>
            <li>The whole process was a bit too much for my hair</li>
            <li>When you pop the cap the scent is very lemon-y</li>
            <li>Do I want this much lemon in my life?&#x27;</li>
            <li>I am covering up grays, so that isn’t really ideal.&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li>but otherwise is your standard chemical filled product.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and wont leave hair feel coated.</li>
            <li>Whenever I use it my hair as a whole looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li>I received complimentary samples of Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Collection to test and review.  </li>
            <li>I have a love/hate relationship with clarifying/detox shampoos, so I was ready to try something new.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved how thick and foamy</li>
            <li>but I was concerned with using the deep conditioner on top of the other conditioner, but it was perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit runny compared to the usual thicker conditioners I use, the scenting great, and it does a decent job of providing strength to my fine hair (and with it being thinner, it helped with not weighing down my hair</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to hear that I would be receiving these hair products for free a few weeks ago!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s thick and smelled awesome, the conditioner on the other hand not so much.</li>
            <li>Overall good products, wish they didnt that SLS and other chemicals.</li>
            <li>: Good clarifying shampoo that definitely cleaned away styling product and other hair product residue.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but I have a full head of hair so it can get heavy.</li>
            <li>I would have enjoyed it had it been a product without Parabens and other harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>i was able to do it every other night and not have oily hair.</li>
            <li>The only thing I did not like was that the conditioner and/or treatment left the very top of my head near my part feeling and looking a bit oily.  </li>
            <li>I blow dried my hair like usual, and it turned out wonderful!</li>
            <li>Even the next morning my hair still felt clean.</li>
            <li>Hair definitely felt clean after rinsing.</li>
            <li>The conditioner was more watery then I expected but it distributed through my hair and left it smooth and soft</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that has little body.</li>
            <li>Often times detoxifying hair products dry out my fine hair, but that was not the case with these.</li>
            <li>but once I put a Lil dry shampoo in there it was fine.</li>
            <li>My hair was also pretty soft after rinsing the shampoo out.</li>
            <li>First of all if you are looking for something that is actually completely natural, this is not that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying the full sizes.</li>
            <li>the conditioner was amazing, mine was a little watery compared to my regular conditioner, but it left my hair super soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if they have improved that much, or if it was really just the deep treatment that left my hair with more body, and super smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, limp hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and extremely limp.</li>
            <li>but I think it would be safe to use with every shampoo because it didn&#x27;t feel like a deep conditioner that you would only want to use once a week.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend using all three products together, with the intensive treatment being the most essential.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t lather very foamy, which I liked, because another shampoo I use lathers up so thick</li>
            <li>It left my hair felling really soft and free.</li>
            <li>After receiving the Wild Naturals Detoxifying Collection (as a complimentary sample pack for reviewing purposes) I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I used the bundle all together as directed and not only was my hair soft and smooth</li>
            <li>my scalp is starting to compensate for the daily clarifying shampoo use by producing more oil.  </li>
            <li>, it made it very soft seems to lock in moisture really well too.</li>
            <li>Hair was VERY soft and shiny, though!  </li>
            <li>No more fly away, dry looking,</li>
            <li>Secondly this product left my hair feeling so clean and refreshed like I just walked out of the salon with a fresh new cut.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend 👍</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly disliked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If your looking for a lightweight hair care product I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>my hair was dry, I was pleasantly surprised to find that my hair did not feel weighed down, but very light, bouncy, and smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair is quite healthy already, (rarely blow dry, minimal product, cuts every 6 weeks)</li>
            <li>i also noticed that i was able to go a little longer without having to shampoo my hair</li>
            <li>Left my hair so soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>The intensive treatment was basically what I was hoping the normal conditioner would be like.</li>
            <li>The smell of fresh lemons hits you the moment you open the bottle.  </li>
            <li>but once I used Intensive treatment conditioner it has left my hair smelling fresh and no tangled up hair.</li>
            <li>I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, and I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again when my samples run out.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I did receive this complimentary to review publicly.  </li>
            <li>After I use my normal shampoo/conditioner regimine, my hair does have quite a bit of body.</li>
            <li>However, if I didn’t color my hair, I would use this product about 2-3 times/month as a break from your normal hair care routine to spruce things up.  </li>
            <li>I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing and review processes only.</li>
            <li>I liked that because it wasn&#x27;t too thick in texture.</li>
            <li>When i tried the shampoo i could feel it super clean, but because i also have a sensitive scalp after a few uses it did begin to irritate it.</li>
            <li>I would like to try some of the other volumizing systems, because my hair is so fine.  </li>
            <li>The texture is very light and it seemed like I jad to use a little more shampoo then usual.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, less frizzy and more manageable.</li>
            <li>After using all 3 products together for 2 weeks now, I can definitely notice less fly aways and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as dry.</li>
            <li>hair is really long and tangles very easily, so I have to be careful which shampoos and conditioners</li>
            <li>I was sent the bundle to test, I am in my late 40&#x27;s and my hair has changed (as well as everything else LOL) and is very dry.</li>
            <li>(I live in New England and</li>
            <li>This bundle left my hair light and with noticeable volume, even the deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer, my hair did seem to dry more quickly than usual.</li>
            <li>It makes you feel wild and natural!!</li>
            <li>Before using this product I had build up (similar to dandruff) from other conditioners with this product my hair is now build up free!</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner work well by themselves, and I was happy that the conditioner wasn&#x27;t thick and didn&#x27;t make my hair oily like other conditioners do.</li>
            <li>(usually I go for more tropical flavored smells) but it started to grow on me.</li>
            <li>Normally my hair is soft silky and feels close to &amp;#34;bunny fur&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I did exactly the same process of massaging it into my scalp and rinsing it.  </li>
            <li>I usually have a ton of static electricity in the winter with flyaways.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually use clarifying shampoos for so many days in a row, but for testing/feedback purposes, I felt obliged to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it does make it look smooth and silky but not weighted down</li>
            <li>It made my ends smooth without weighing them down or getting greasy.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner and treatment keep my hair feeling silky and smooth without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>it leaves your hair soft, shiny, and frizz free, but it will leave your hair kind of dull after a few days.</li>
            <li>I liked the conditioner and deep conditioner too, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll stray from my salon products.</li>
            <li>The conditioner in this collection is light and made my hair feel soft, without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to be fine and straggly, and a little frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Ok i have fine, thin, dry hair.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
            <li>It states that this detoxifies impurities from your hair; I am not sure how to tell if that is really happening or not, but as for the way my hair smells and feels, I will definitely be purchasing this kind in the future.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner used together left my hair very clean and not weighed down.</li>
            <li>The Shampoo:  nice and rick lather, very thick.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually use products with very strong scents, so this was a big change for me.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:</li>
            <li>I have very fine and thin hair and normally use a clean rinse rather than conditioner for fear of weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li>Also, from what I remember of Herbal Essences was the clear bottle with the flowers on it from my grandma&#x27;s bathroom, that I used probably over 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>and I am so pleasantly surprised by this</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your hair too soft that you can&#x27;t style it</li>
            <li>I received complementary samples of the herbal essences wild naturals detoxifying shampoo, conditioner, and treatment from a VoxBox so that I could review them.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these products.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like these product.  </li>
            <li>After using this product for a few  days I have noticed my hair thicker and feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>it made my hair so soft and shiny</li>
            <li>After using this bundle, my hair became soft, and it doesn&#x27;t become oily within two days like it used to.</li>
            <li>Overall, the scent of these is very lemon-ish.</li>
            <li>The conditioners leave your hair soft, silky and manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft and silky all day.</li>
            <li>(I have a 3-month old) and use them.</li>
            <li>Now on to the third product, which was the intense treatment.</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft</li>
            <li>i just cant get over how soft my hair feels.</li>
            <li>After washing out my hair felt really soft even before conditioning.  </li>
            <li>As far as the scent goes, I am really sensitive to fragrance, and I found this to have somewhat of a medicinal smell but leaning towards fruity.</li>
            <li>All three products felt quite light, nothing too heavy -</li>
            <li>this product is completely life changing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them twice so far.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a marked difference after using the intensive treatment.  </li>
            <li>My hair was soft and had volume.</li>
            <li>My hair was shiny and felt soft, while my scalp felt cleaner .&lt;br /&gt;Days</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and lemony, but not too overpowering and didn&#x27;t linger that much once my hair air dried.</li>
            <li>The intensive treatment I used mainly on my ends because of my fine and thin hair, I felt intensive treatment would be too much product and make my hair look oily..</li>
            <li>Secondly, I use a lot of product in my hair and this shampoo left my hair feeling so clean and the conditioner left it feeling soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used the shampoo and conditioner, I let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li>So my hair is pretty dry</li>
            <li>The shampoo alone did leave my hair feeling pretty dry so the conditioner is a must!</li>
            <li>The conditioner also seems to have put a serious dent in all my static and frizz.</li>
            <li>This product felt light with no weigh down!!  </li>
            <li>My hair felt nice and soft after it dried and it didn&#x27;t take as long to dry, for some reason.</li>
            <li>I have long, straight hair</li>
            <li>have very fine, thin, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>With this shampoo and conditioner my hair has been silky smooth and has very few tangles.</li>
            <li>I was concerned at first that I would not benefit from a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t feel as &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; and smooth as other products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of product and dry shampoo, and I felt the &amp;#34;detoxifying&amp;#34; products really stripped my hair of all of that.</li>
            <li>The intensive treatment really helped my hair with it being so dry and damaged in this winter weather.</li>
            <li>The Intensive Treatment though really helps lock in moisture and take care of all of my dry split</li>
            <li>The deep conditioner smelled the same and was very slippery.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair really soft and it was still soft the next day.</li>
            <li>i seen a major difference in my hair</li>
            <li>The first time that I used it my hair turned into a giant poof, however it felt like a product that would do that following the initial use.</li>
            <li>I normally let my hair air dry naturally, and I did that each time I used this product as well.</li>
            <li>After the full 7 days of using all three products I definitely noticed smoother less tangled hair.</li>
            <li>It was a light fragrance, and once my hair dried the more medicinal smell went away and left behind the fruity scent.</li>
            <li>My hair is quite fine and tends toward dull and lifeless if I&#x27;m not careful with my hair products.</li>
            <li>My hair gets oily fairly quickly, so I generally avoid conditioner altogether.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that using 3 hair products does make your shower longer and isn&#x27;t as conducive for busy morning routines.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the shampoo and conditioner by themselves would have left my hair as soft as the triple combo did.</li>
            <li>They left my hair soft, my scalp rejuvenated and kept the relaxing fragrance on my hair for hours.</li>
            <li>I have very thin,  dry, and long hair and especially in the winter it gets tangled easily and staticky, so those are the issues I look for improvement in the most.</li>
            <li>Good-sized so that the product flows out easily, but small enough to bring for travel or if you&#x27;re only using it once a week or for a 1 week detox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been a Herbal Essence fan for a long time and these new products do not disappoint.</li>
            <li>My hair normally runs fairly dry.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using these products I&#x27;ve also gotten compliments on how shiny and pretty my hair is, so it&#x27;s noticeably different to other people as well.</li>
            <li>Upon first putting the shampoo on my hair it felt a little dry like most others do to my hair, making my hair feel hard, but as soon as I put in and rinsed out the conditioner</li>
            <li>The conditioner I was not as thrilled with, the product was very thin</li>
            <li>The product was thick and creamy and I only needed about a tablespoon to coat the ends of my hair which is shoulder length and fine in texture.</li>
            <li>I often have a hard time finding products that leave my hair feeling clean and not weighed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not sure I want to use a product that completely strips my hair first, then uses lots of chemicals to get a desired result.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was a little worried when I first got it, because there are 2 conditioners.</li>
            <li>I used Herbal Essences years ago but switched to a salon product due to my fine, limp hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the whole system, including this intensive treatment, every other day for the last week.</li>
            <li>When I used this trio, it worked thwthe first time, but every time after that, my hair was limp and greasy.</li>
            <li>but with my thin hair it somewhat left it feeling and looking oily but definitely helped with the static and dryness.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is not as heavy and thick as many other conditioners, so I felt like I had to use a lot more than I usually do when conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li>The conditioner was very light in texture, which I was surprised, because usually conditioner is thick.</li>
            <li>after the first use i cold tell a huge improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li>It had a great scent, but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t feel like the scent stayed with my hair throughout the day or even past the morning hours.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant testing this because I am very picky about my hair care.</li>

            <li> The shampoo smells great.</li>

            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> When I rinsed it out, my hair smelled amazing!</li>
            <li> I want to start off by saying this product smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I noticed my hair still smelt amazing!</li>
            <li> The first thing I was impressed with , was how wonderful the product smelled.  </li>
            <li> It feels healthier and it smells nice too!</li>
            <li> Very happy :)</li>
            <li> 2-3: Still good to great results.&lt;br /&gt;Days</li>
            <li> I loved every thing about it</li>
            <li> it was so silky smooth, and the treatment just gave it the perfect touch!</li>
            <li> however this product has the perfect smooth texture.</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself may have smelled good, but once rinsed out my hair felt</li>
            <li> conditioner was doing what conditioner does.. it smelled soo good.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t comb through my hair without spraying a fair amount of detangler in it.</li>
            <li> This worked fairly well on my hair, which is medium thickness and length.</li>
            <li> and I think this would be a good system for people with thicker hair.  </li>
            <li> I used the products for about a week, loved the shampoo</li>
            <li> This herbal essences product has a bright lemon-herb scent during use that remains on my hair for a good part of the day.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a good bit of lather</li>
            <li> I loved the intensive cream, though.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get a good coating on my hair-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conditioner: Good, lightweight conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very fresh and energizing scent, perfect way to start the day.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with all three products.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love great smelling hair?</li>
            <li> and I was very pleased.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very refreshing, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> The lemon scent is very refreshing</li>
            <li> I liked the conditioner as well, and it smelled so good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scent: Pleasant and floral/herbal, and very strong.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels sexy!</li>
            <li> and I love the way it made my hair feel!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to my friends for sure!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I was able to straighten my hair with almost no frizz!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love these products!</li>
            <li> I love how the shampoo and conditioner so that got it one star!</li>
            <li> After using these products for over a week my hair feels softer and has more volume now!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?!</li>
            <li> My first impression was that they all smell great!  </li>
            <li> and I would recommend this product for sure!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the intensive treatment!</li>
            <li> the smell was amazing</li>
            <li> The smell was amazing.</li>
            <li> The conditioner, I think it really amazing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to explain how amazing the leave in conditioner is.</li>
            <li> Thank the Heaven Gods for this amazing product.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing with that lemon grass scent.</li>
            <li> The lemon fades into the rest of the scents and evens out into the amazing smell I was just talking about.</li>
            <li> I liked the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The intensive treatment also gave nice results.  </li>
            <li> While it smelled nice</li>
            <li> A nice clarifying shampoo to use once a week or so to get all the styling products out.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t feel like it would get the job done on its own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I was sent these products for review purposes from influenster, all opinions are my own*</li>
            <li> I honestly can say that I won&#x27;t purchase this collection persay</li>
            <li> With that being said, the one product that I really liked was the intensive treatment.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, herbal smell to it.</li>
            <li> and I liked it since the scent grew on</li>
            <li> I really liked the results of this product.  </li>
            <li> Kind of smells like cleaner.</li>
            <li> The intensive treatment has a nice consistency to it.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo was nice.</li>
            <li> My hair felt really nice after I rinsed it out.</li>
            <li> I also noticed the lemon helped create a nice shine.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo went on nicely and did the job in one washing</li>
            <li> The conditioner has a silky consistency and applied nicely as well.  </li>
            <li> but it would be nice for a morning shower to help wake you up.</li>
            <li> and I really liked it.</li>
            <li> I really liked the smell in the shower</li>
            <li> I then used the treatment which had a nice texture as well.  </li>
            <li> I liked them a lot, 10/10, will use again.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of them, the shampoo lathers nicely and rinses well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest, I am a hair care snob.  </li>
            <li> It has a very nice, light fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It felt great and rinsed clean.</li>
            <li> Shampoo smelled wonderful and I used the amount I normally would use</li>
            <li> The thing that stuck out the most to me was the amazing scent of these products, and my hair smelled amazing all the way until I went to bed at night.</li>
            <li> SO clean and refreshing not overly fragrant, just a light great scent!  </li>
            <li> The conditioner smelled just as good as the shampoo and rinsed out easily.</li>
            <li> They are all very easy to rinse out</li>
            <li> It has a very strong smell of lemon and basil.  </li>
            <li> Just like the shampoo its very light textured and smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> My hair felt so clean and so nice!  </li>
            <li> I was so happy and excited to receive this bundle for free from Influenster!  </li>
            <li> This trio was not my favorite,  but it smells really nice.</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells nice also, but I would not be able to use it every day.  </li>
            <li> One of the things I liked the most about it was my day two hair did not feel as oily</li>
            <li> The intensive treatment was what I liked the most.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell any basil in it, but I&#x27;m kind of glad of that.</li>
            <li> I am a huge &amp;#34;has to smell good in order to put it on my body&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was extremely impressed with the conditioners, my hair was so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Firstly  I would like to say that these items smell great.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of the shampoo,  hints of Peppermint &amp;  gave that cool tingly feeling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;overall super happy with the detoxifying line, cant wait to get the full size!</li>
            <li> The smell of a product, along with the way a product performs, is very important to me.  </li>
            <li> I liked the scent, it was crisp and bright.</li>
            <li> I received this produce free to test and review and really enjoyed using it!</li>
            <li> I happily received this bundle for free to test &amp; review as i&#x27;m already a loyal herbal essences user.</li>
            <li> I recieved this bundle for free to test and review, i was very excited to use it!</li>
            <li> The lemon basil scent was refreshing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice light lemon smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say I love it</li>
            <li> The conditioner is as equally satisfying as the shampoo.</li>
            <li> So I thought that this product would be perfect for a pick me up in getting moisture back into my hair.</li>
            <li> love the way my hair smells throughout the day...and can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li> I used the Intensive treatment and my hair felt a bit better at the ends.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of all the products.  </li>
            <li> Okay now on with my review.</li>
            <li> I felt my hair need something more</li>
            <li> First off, the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> Not to mention i got this product for free to test and review!</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> I love the silkiness of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I always love Herbal Essences.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is ok:</li>
            <li> so my volumizing products worked better).</li>
            <li> The intensive treatment I am in love with: it was the thicker conditioner I was expecting but gave so much softening and strength to my hair, and the scent is great.</li>
            <li> That being said, I did feel that my hair needed more moisturizing after I rinsed the conditioner out.</li>
            <li> The intensive treatment seemed to leave my hair a lot more moisturized than the conditioner did.</li>
            <li> The reason being is that my hair has never felt better.</li>
            <li> and I am thoroughly pleased with this product that I received from Influenster to test and review.  </li>
            <li> I used all three products together and enjoyed the shampoo and intensive treatment the most.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too picky about conditioners (mostly shampoos)  </li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> I received the line from a Vox Box and I have enjoyed using the products.</li>
            <li> However, I bleached my hair about a week ago and the treatment is now my favorite product of the line.</li>
            <li> I love this product my hair feels so much better since i started using it</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the lemons as I was using it in my shower.</li>
            <li> I didn’t notice a reduction in the static in my hair though.</li>
            <li> It did an okay job.  </li>
            <li> Upon walking around the house after my great shower, I still smell the products and my hair is nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this combo.</li>
            <li> But what I like the most out of all the three products is the treatment.</li>
            <li> I mostly used just the shampoo and conditioner and was more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> Firstly, The shampoo has an amazing smell to it!</li>
            <li> You want to use this maybe once a week, you don&#x27;t want to finish up the magical moments with this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> I recieved these products compliments of influencer and am so glad I had the opportunity to try them.</li>
            <li> I really love this line of products that I received from Influenster to review.</li>
            <li> I tried the shampoo and loved how it cleaned my hair and smelled so fresh and lemony.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these products to others as I was really impressed with the quality for the price.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner were okay</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I really love the lemon smell of the products.</li>
            <li> I love how these products made my hair feel and look.</li>
            <li> This is a product I would spend money on after my sample is gone :)</li>
            <li> It smells refreshing and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> even the static that comes with winter times was gone.</li>
            <li> conditioner wasn&#x27;t quite as appealing.</li>
            <li> and I found that I really enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the shampoo-</li>
            <li> also really love the freshness of this scent.</li>
            <li> The Thai Lemon Basil is surprisingly refreshing.</li>
            <li> but I had more volume than ever.</li>
            <li> really love the idea of a detox for your hair--much like bodies and mind</li>
            <li> Thicker, creamer, for more intense treatment of damaged ends, or in this case, to re-moisturize the ends after using the clarifying shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: GREAT results.  </li>
            <li> Styling is getting more challenging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As soon as I got them i smelled them and i loved the smell right away.</li>
            <li> It left my hair shiny smelling delicious and nice and clean.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li> the smells have a very clean and refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency, very rich and silky.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo has a nice, rich, lather.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo had a medium lather, so I felt like my hair was getting nice and clean</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of this whole line is amazing!</li>
            <li> and it did pretty good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Shampoo: To start with -- this shampoo smells pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> First off, I LOVED the smell.  </li>
            <li> i was extremely fortunate to recieve this product for a free testing it has been incredibly amazing to use.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for the dry winters here in Colorado.</li>
            <li> They have a great clean scent and leave your hair super clean yet</li>
            <li> The products smell SO good, and they do a really good job of getting your hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Next, the shampoo lathers rather nicely, and the conditioner was great for detangling.  </li>
            <li> However, this conditioner felt very light in my hands, and after using it my hair felt smooth and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I recently received this product free to test and review and absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> using on the ends worked just fine and my hair a bit more manageable and not so fly-away...</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is great, leaves my hair smelling good for days and my hair doesn&#x27;t get as ouly as it does with other shampoo and conditioners.</li>
            <li> I shower at night and in the morning my hair is still shiny and soft without fly aways.</li>
            <li> The smell again is lovely, and my ends feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> so I feel like I cant give the intense treatment as good of a critique.</li>
            <li> I was lucky to have received this amazing product for FREE from Influenster for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> my favorite part has to be the after shower hair brushing and how smooth and easy it was.</li>
            <li> So excited to be able to test and review it.  </li>
            <li> I was excited because I love hair products, makeup, skin care, etc.</li>
            <li> This is the most incredible smelling product I have used and will definitely be going to purchase full size bottles of this product line.</li>
            <li> the shampoo n conditioner and hair treatment made my hair feel healthy and clean and</li>
            <li> It feels lightweight and is easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li> It washes out easily.  </li>
            <li> My favorite is the mask, which has such a great texture.</li>
            <li> It was too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like or dislike the smell of the three of them because it&#x27;s not too strong, but it&#x27;s also not a smell I would request.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and the treatment is amazing my hair has never felt so soft and light</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> the first thing I noticed was the scent, which was AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I think that for this price range, these products are pretty effective.</li>
            <li> Mostly because I don&#x27;t want greasy hair and since my hair is so long I need a great conditioner for easy care once I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> My hair was silky, smooth and easy to comb.</li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying my hair is color treated and on the fine side.</li>
            <li> First I would like to say that it has a really nice light smell of lemons.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, wavy, and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have a fine hear, but quite a bit of it.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that I don&#x27;t have as many flyaways as usual, which is wonderful bonus in south Louisiana humidity.</li>
            <li> and it seemed to work fine on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I do think that someone with longer hair may need a heavier conditioner or an added product post-shower to fully detangle their hair, but for shorter or less tangle prone hair types, this system is perfect!</li>
            <li> I have fine, oily hair that gets flaky looking when I don&#x27;t get all my hair products (hair spray) out in the shower.</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t put it at the top of my head since I get oily so quick).</li>
            <li> The products smell great and left my hair feeling light, smooth, and really clean!  </li>
            <li> The smell is actually quite refreshing and invigorating, I always prefer citrus smelling products, so that was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free trial and overall great product, love the smell, my hair feels clean and light.</li>
            <li> And  bonus, they have very light fresh smell..</li>
            <li> I started with the detoxifying shampoo which was light and smooth in my hand, which made me feel secure putting it in my hair.</li>
            <li> That is a HUGE plus for me.</li>

            <li> I received this product as a voxbox for free to test and review.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE that super clean feeling.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was a bit too light and sort of dried my hair out, but when paired with the treatment product it was the perfect combination.  </li>
            <li> I love that the system is available as a bundle - they&#x27;re worth having on hand if you do any traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The thai basil scent is very fresh.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathered great and left my hair squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> The shampoo had a nice lather and seemed to clean my hair really well.</li>
            <li> The detoxifying shampoo made my hair feel very clean and freshly scented.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely excited to receive these products free to test and review.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a decent lather and the fragrance lingers on your hair nicely afterwards.  </li>
            <li> My hair has much more body and is less fly away.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed with the way it smells.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this</li>
            <li> so I was excited to see what it could do for my dryness.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got to take a shower</li>
            <li> (Its so soft I cannot help myself) and It was still soft as it was when I got out of the shower, smelled great, and most of all.....</li>
            <li> My hair was so light and shiny and full of bounce.</li>
            <li> Hair turned out nice and soft but the smell was nowhere near as good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> First off, the smell is lovely.</li>
            <li> I have very fine straight hair and use a lot of product to obtain some volume.</li>
            <li> My husband even noticed it and how much he liked the new scent.</li>
            <li> I was one of the lucky ones chosen to receive this bundle for free through Influenster to use and review.  </li>
            <li> and my hair and head had that squeeky clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> and I felt that I had to use a lot of shampoo to feel clean and the conditioner didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling silky like</li>
            <li> The Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying collection is nothing short of wonderful.  </li>
            <li> recommend to anyone, it give your a clean polished look.</li>
            <li> My hair feels squeaky clean after using the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I smelled some lemon, which to me, always smells clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clean and energizing.</li>
            <li> My hair still felt clean.  </li>
            <li> Washes easily from my hair and leaves hair feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> After rinsing, my hair felt and smelled clean.  </li>
            <li> What I love the most was it left my hair easy to comb after using all 3.</li>
            <li> Although not very thick, I actually liked that because it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The smell of lemons is very relaxing, clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super creamy and rich and you want to leave in for about three minutes to let it work</li>
            <li> Even thought I got it for free for review, the price is actually pretty cheap and affordable.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend everyone to try these products, they also smell so good.</li>
            <li> but I really loved the deep treatment.</li>
            <li> Once I received my box I immediately put them in my shower to use the next morning and already loved the scent.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I absolutely loved these products and will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> It was a light, fresh smell.</li>
            <li> It has much more body and looks much healthier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely keep the shampoo in mind when I need a good detox.  </li>
            <li> No waxy build up feel, just nice and silky soft.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I used it for a week and have had a good experience.</li>
            <li> thing I didn&#x27;t love about this is that the conditioner is really watery.</li>
            <li> The conditioner and intense repair was fantastic!</li>
            <li> so I felt I couldn&#x27;t give you guys a fair enough review, so I decided to go out and buy the full sizes.</li>
            <li> The shampoo didn&#x27;t lather as much as most shampoos, but it still did a good job at cleansing my hair without drying it out or weighing it down.</li>
            <li> shampoo was clean, lathered nicely and left my hair feeling light and clean.</li>
            <li> and it was nice and lightweight, yet conditioning enough for my shoulder length, fine hair.</li>
            <li> First I have fine curly/ wavy hair</li>
            <li> My hair gets oily quick</li>
            <li> It rinsed out quickly.  </li>
            <li> so I put that in and quickly rinsed it out.  </li>
            <li> I was one of the lucky ones chosen to receive this bundle for testing and reviewing purposes from Influenster.  </li>
            <li> Wild Natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner are great.</li>
            <li> Not only does it perfume your shower with this amazing scent, but your hair feels soft and healthy all day!</li>
            <li> But I do love the smell and the fresh, light, soft feeling of my hair after using!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and at first the treatment seemed like to much for strands.</li>
            <li> This product works better than my $30 leave in conditer from a high end brand</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t add any extra product before drying my hair and I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was more runny than my normal shampoo, yet still lathered quite well.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I liked about it was the fresh smell of cassia!</li>
            <li> First I would like to mention that I received the kit free to sample from Influenster.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Running my brush through it released no furious crackles of static electricity like it normally does.</li>
            <li> I like the normal herbal essence line and love the idea of the naturals line as well.</li>
            <li> It lathered nicely and it didn&#x27;t take a ton of the product to clean my entire head of hair.</li>
            <li> Not over powering, yet enough to smell nice and clean.  </li>
            <li> The products left my hair clean and smelling amazing.</li>
            <li> My hair looks great, but feels weighed down.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this set is that the scent is light, fresh, and lemony.</li>
            <li> so I was definitely intrigued to use the intensive treatment, however this was my favorite part!</li>
            <li> One, it LOOKED more natural!</li>
            <li> It was invigorating first thing in the morning!</li>
            <li> which I like and those last two reasons have earned it two more stars!</li>
            <li> When i used the product the first time one thing i noticed was the smell!</li>
            <li> Overall I really enjoyed this kit!</li>
            <li> I will likely purchase more to add to my hair care routine!  </li>
            <li> For reference, I have shoulder-length, straight, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner were fairly light, which is great for my fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I really think this is the best smell of all the other new</li>
            <li> received the whole collection (shampoo, conditioner and intensive treatment) free to test and review from Influenster/VoxBox</li>
            <li> All-in-all, I really like this product line and will continue to use it even after these free trial products run out.</li>
            <li> : I liked this treatment better than the shampoo and conditioner for a few reasons.</li>
            <li> This product line did an amazing job at cleaning my hair with only one wash and rinse.</li>
            <li> I received the product(s) complimentary to test and review</li>
            <li> I would only use this once a week just because of my kind of hair.  </li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I went a couple day without washing after and the fresh scent was still there.</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary to test and review.</li>
            <li> I received this kit complimentary from Influenster to try and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The following 2 time I tried the set it made my hair nice and shiny</li>
            <li> I can honestly say this actually did!</li>
            <li> I really liked the shampoo because it left my hair feeling a lot cleaner than others I have used.</li>
            <li> However, it did not get the frizz out of my hair like it says it will, but I don&#x27;t hold that against them because no products that I&#x27;ve tried so far have been able to get the frizz out of my hair.</li>
            <li> This will be the next kind I buy.</li>
            <li> I really liked the shampoo/conditioner and deep conditioning treatment!</li>
            <li> I really liked it, I am not a big fan of Herbal Essences</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, the shampoo lathered up nicely.  </li>
            <li> I have to say I absolute Love the smell of all 3 Products.. its a very clean,fresh smell.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure when to use the soft treatment</li>
            <li> Powerful scent, and not a pleasing one.</li>
            <li> These products were complimentary to try and review.</li>
            <li> After just the first use of all three products, my hair is full &amp; a lot of bounce.</li>
            <li> It also had such a nice smell.</li>
            <li> I feel the conditioner did a nice job by itself that the intensive treatment wasn&#x27;t necessary (For me).  </li>
            <li> I received a complimentary sample of these products for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I received these products in a complimentary trial and have been using them for about a week.</li>
            <li> It reminded me of something from my childhood that I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on,  but overall it was nice.</li>
            <li> I liked the overall effect it had on my hair.  </li>
            <li> First things first, I received this set free to test and review, from Influenster.</li>
            <li> (Which was actually really exciting, to be honest.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have my hair colored at a salon using the most natural ingredient hair color line that I could</li>
            <li> so I use a lot of product and this seemed to give me a fresh start.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and healthy looking afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently received this bundle free to test and review, and it couldn&#x27;t have come at a better time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, fresh, citrusy and you really can smell it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use very much of the shampoo, because it doesn&#x27;t work very well with my fine hair</li>
            <li> When I initially opened the product the first thing I fell in love with was the smell!</li>
            <li> was not overly excited to really sample this product, since I am not a drugstore brand user of hair products, but I was obligated, so I did.  </li>
            <li> so I went right for the intensive treatment and applied that and rinsed it out immediately with no soak time.</li>
            <li> I noticed my hair felt softer right away.</li>
            <li> Right after I wash my hair I want everyone to smell that citrus smell...</li>
            <li> After I blow dryed my hair, it was very soft and had a very clean crisp smell.</li>
            <li> I was not a fan of this scent however, it did smell clean, and did not leave much smell as the day went on.</li>
            <li> It does clean very well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to have your hands feeling soft rather then sticky and dry.</li>
            <li> First, the aroma of the products is so fresh.  </li>
            <li> I have used them several times and really enjoy the light, fresh scents.</li>
            <li> I just tried the herbal essence natural wild shampoo and conditioners this week as a sample/tester from Influenster and I am in love!</li>
            <li> Great for fine, thin curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t feel weighed down, which is good since I need all the help I can get to add body.</li>
            <li> Then I was the most excited to use the intesive treatment because of my dry hair..</li>
            <li> I live in the midwest and in the middle of winter I need a good conditioner to avoid the static and to just give some extra moisture.  </li>
            <li> I was so surprised with how good these products actually made me hair feel/</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I really appreciated the natural aspect of the product itself as compared to more chemical laden hair products.</li>
            <li> My hair feels very clean and extremely soft but sitting here as my hair dries all I can smell is this chemical like stench like I just had some major dye work done at a cheap Salon.</li>
            <li> I washed with the shampoo and it had a good amount of lather without being too much as some other shampoos are.  </li>
            <li> I was left with my hair feeling clean, light, and bouncy.</li>
            <li> Great thick lather.</li>
            <li> When I first received the sample I was thinking that I would start with just the shampoo and conditioner and see what happened</li>
            <li> Over all I love this product and would definitely use it again given the chance.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product not only to detoxify your hair but to strengthen and make it healthy.</li>
            <li> Thanks again influenster!</li>
            <li> Got the voxbox of Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying collection for free for my review.</li>
            <li> However, I did have higher expectations than what I got.</li>
            <li> Secondly, it smelled more lemony.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t the hugest fan of the smell when I first got it</li>
            <li> Definitely not the most moisturizing hair mask I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I think the Macadamia one or the L&#x27;oreal one in the yellow bucket is much better.</li>
            <li> I had back surgery 3 weeks ago and just now being able to</li>
            <li> I started with the shampoo first.</li>
            <li> They have a great lasting smell but overall didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Overall I think the products are okay..</li>
            <li> The first day I used just the shampoo (out of habit of not using conditioner)</li>
            <li> I love citrusy smelling products, especially when I use them in the morning.</li>
            <li> Super fresh, clean, and utterly addictive.</li>
            <li> Overall the system is ok.  </li>
            <li> I did use the intensive treatment as a daily conditioner and that was better.</li>
            <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying kit for free to test and review through influenster.</li>
            <li> I was hesitate at first to use this product because it also reminded me of Clorox wipes</li>
            <li> First, I used the shampoo, then the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I definitely think if you opt to try these products that you make sure to use all 3.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when using these products was the scent.</li>
            <li> This first thing I noticed was the smell of the product.  </li>
            <li> I usually only use shampoo so this is a lot more steps than I am used to.  </li>
            <li> and I will most likely purchase this</li>
            <li> This review is based on a free sample I received in a voxbox of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying shampoo, conditioner, and intensive treatment through my influenster membership.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only buy top of the line toiletries and appliances for my hair.  </li>
            <li> it really revived it!</li>
            <li> a few times I feel that I can give a fair assessment.</li>
            <li> Hair feels super clean, it&#x27;s really shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Then I used the conditioner which had a good texture without being too heavy.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo smells great and the conditioner and intense treatment left my hair silky smooth and manageable without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> My hair feels super soft after using this just ONE time!!</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this bundle to for free to test and review.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get a free sample of it</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try this set out for free.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get this products for free to test out.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive herbal essences wild natural detoxifying kit shampoo,  conditioner,  and intesive treatment free to test.</li>
            <li> The shampoo left my hair feeling very clean yet still moisturized.</li>
            <li> The shampoo left my hair very clean and without buildup.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, dry and treated hair.  </li>
            <li> Although I liked the scent of all three products, I felt like the quality did not stand up to other brands.</li>
            <li> but I agree with the comments about the wonderful smell that my hair has after washing not lasting long enough.</li>
            <li> I received whole set with the shampoo, conditioner, and intensive repair treatment herbal essences natural for free to sample from Influenster in a VoxBox.</li>
            <li> The intense treatment felt more like a regular conditioner consistency, which I preferred.</li>
            <li> so I felt that in order to fairly asses it and compare it to past shampoo and conditioner I must stay consistent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just the Shampoo and Conditioner and it totally takes care of my static problems and really makes my hair shine.</li>
            <li> my hair combed very easy with my wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> It left my hair clean, smells fab and fresh.</li>
            <li> I especially loved that the intensive treatment did not leave my hair greasy or weighed down as many such treatments usually do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying full size bottles of this product!</li>
            <li> Ladies (or gentleman, or human people reading this review), you will have other ladies (or gentleman, or human people) sneaking sniffs of your awesome hair and wondering where you got your shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I live in a dry climate so the deep conditioner is going to be a great summer staple for me</li>
            <li> After blow drying my hair straight to see the results, the entire regimen left my hair feeling very light and squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> love the smell, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, or leave it feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I still had to use some dry shampoo at my roots, but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> It is a fresh and pretty natural smell, so I do like that.</li>
            <li> It was easy to come through my hair after my shower and my hair had an overall lighter and cleaner feel when I styled it.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair that tends to get frizzy pretty fast.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned my hair is short and very healthy overall</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;intensive treatment&amp;#34; is by far the best, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The product not only leaves your hair smooth and silky but also leaves your hands super soft!.</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry, like I normally do, and my hair felt clean and light.</li>
            <li> It was rejuvenating and fresh, not usually a scent I would choose</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice clean herbal smell that stays long after your hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I usually only wash my hair once or twice a week and these seemed to keep my hair pretty clean inbetween washington.  </li>
            <li> The scent has a clean, perfume smell but it was a little strong for me.</li>
            <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Natural shampoo, conditioner, and intensive treatment for free to test and review.</li>
            <li> Intensive Treatment is just that, intense.</li>
            <li> Again the scent was very pleasing.</li>
            <li> It lathers and cleans very well.</li>
            <li> It is a much thicker and nicer formula than the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Thanks Herbal Essence and Influencer for this product.  </li>
            <li> I felt that the intensive treatment really helped moisturize my hair and would like to use this product in my weekly routine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really want basil scent in my hair.</li>
            <li> I also have the detoxifying versions since I really have oily hair</li>
            <li> After trying it for about two weeks I have come to really like all three products in the package.  </li>
            <li> but it was way too much foam.  </li>
            <li> really wanted to like these products</li>
            <li> After styling my hair, it was much shinier and smoother than before I used these products.  </li>
            <li> so when I applied it I couldn’t really tell where I had it in my hair and not.</li>
            <li> The shampoo absolutely detoxed my hair.  </li>
            <li> I really like the line.</li>
            <li> My curls were very defined.</li>
            <li> This set was actually given to me to try out (FREE) from influenster.</li>
            <li> I received my Herbal Essence Wild Naturals complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li> I got this product free to test and review and the scent is similar to Bath &amp; Body Works- Kitchen Lemon.</li>
            <li> but it has left my hair silky and knot free.</li>
            <li> but I dont really know if it did that to my hair or not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent was very lemony and basil smelling.</li>
            <li> I am a frequent Herbal Essences user, and I received this package complimentary for review from Influenster.  </li>
            <li> It is straight, but has some wave to it.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li> It stayed smoother much longer</li>
            <li> The whole process was a bit too much for my hair</li>
            <li> When you pop the cap the scent is very lemon-y</li>
            <li> Do I want this much lemon in my life?&#x27;</li>
            <li> I am covering up grays, so that isn’t really ideal.&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li> but otherwise is your standard chemical filled product.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and wont leave hair feel coated.</li>
            <li> Whenever I use it my hair as a whole looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li> I received complimentary samples of Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Collection to test and review.  </li>
            <li> I have a love/hate relationship with clarifying/detox shampoos, so I was ready to try something new.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved how thick and foamy</li>
            <li> but I was concerned with using the deep conditioner on top of the other conditioner, but it was perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit runny compared to the usual thicker conditioners I use, the scenting great, and it does a decent job of providing strength to my fine hair (and with it being thinner, it helped with not weighing down my hair</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to hear that I would be receiving these hair products for free a few weeks ago!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s thick and smelled awesome, the conditioner on the other hand not so much.</li>
            <li> Overall good products, wish they didnt that SLS and other chemicals.</li>
            <li> : Good clarifying shampoo that definitely cleaned away styling product and other hair product residue.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but I have a full head of hair so it can get heavy.</li>
            <li> I would have enjoyed it had it been a product without Parabens and other harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li> i was able to do it every other night and not have oily hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing I did not like was that the conditioner and/or treatment left the very top of my head near my part feeling and looking a bit oily.  </li>
            <li> I blow dried my hair like usual, and it turned out wonderful!</li>
            <li> Even the next morning my hair still felt clean.</li>
            <li> Hair definitely felt clean after rinsing.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was more watery then I expected but it distributed through my hair and left it smooth and soft</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that has little body.</li>
            <li> Often times detoxifying hair products dry out my fine hair, but that was not the case with these.</li>
            <li> but once I put a Lil dry shampoo in there it was fine.</li>
            <li> My hair was also pretty soft after rinsing the shampoo out.</li>
            <li> First of all if you are looking for something that is actually completely natural, this is not that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying the full sizes.</li>
            <li> the conditioner was amazing, mine was a little watery compared to my regular conditioner, but it left my hair super soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they have improved that much, or if it was really just the deep treatment that left my hair with more body, and super smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, limp hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and extremely limp.</li>
            <li> but I think it would be safe to use with every shampoo because it didn&#x27;t feel like a deep conditioner that you would only want to use once a week.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend using all three products together, with the intensive treatment being the most essential.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t lather very foamy, which I liked, because another shampoo I use lathers up so thick</li>
            <li> It left my hair felling really soft and free.</li>
            <li> After receiving the Wild Naturals Detoxifying Collection (as a complimentary sample pack for reviewing purposes) I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I used the bundle all together as directed and not only was my hair soft and smooth</li>
            <li> my scalp is starting to compensate for the daily clarifying shampoo use by producing more oil.  </li>
            <li> , it made it very soft seems to lock in moisture really well too.</li>
            <li> Hair was VERY soft and shiny, though!  </li>
            <li> No more fly away, dry looking,</li>
            <li> Secondly this product left my hair feeling so clean and refreshed like I just walked out of the salon with a fresh new cut.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend 👍</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly disliked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your looking for a lightweight hair care product I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> my hair was dry, I was pleasantly surprised to find that my hair did not feel weighed down, but very light, bouncy, and smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair is quite healthy already, (rarely blow dry, minimal product, cuts every 6 weeks)</li>
            <li> i also noticed that i was able to go a little longer without having to shampoo my hair</li>
            <li> Left my hair so soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> The intensive treatment was basically what I was hoping the normal conditioner would be like.</li>
            <li> The smell of fresh lemons hits you the moment you open the bottle.  </li>
            <li> but once I used Intensive treatment conditioner it has left my hair smelling fresh and no tangled up hair.</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, and I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again when my samples run out.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I did receive this complimentary to review publicly.  </li>
            <li> After I use my normal shampoo/conditioner regimine, my hair does have quite a bit of body.</li>
            <li> However, if I didn’t color my hair, I would use this product about 2-3 times/month as a break from your normal hair care routine to spruce things up.  </li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing and review processes only.</li>
            <li> I liked that because it wasn&#x27;t too thick in texture.</li>
            <li> When i tried the shampoo i could feel it super clean, but because i also have a sensitive scalp after a few uses it did begin to irritate it.</li>
            <li> I would like to try some of the other volumizing systems, because my hair is so fine.  </li>
            <li> The texture is very light and it seemed like I jad to use a little more shampoo then usual.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, less frizzy and more manageable.</li>
            <li> After using all 3 products together for 2 weeks now, I can definitely notice less fly aways and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as dry.</li>
            <li> hair is really long and tangles very easily, so I have to be careful which shampoos and conditioners</li>
            <li> I was sent the bundle to test, I am in my late 40&#x27;s and my hair has changed (as well as everything else LOL) and is very dry.</li>
            <li> (I live in New England and</li>
            <li> This bundle left my hair light and with noticeable volume, even the deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, my hair did seem to dry more quickly than usual.</li>
            <li> It makes you feel wild and natural!!</li>
            <li> Before using this product I had build up (similar to dandruff) from other conditioners with this product my hair is now build up free!</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner work well by themselves, and I was happy that the conditioner wasn&#x27;t thick and didn&#x27;t make my hair oily like other conditioners do.</li>
            <li> (usually I go for more tropical flavored smells) but it started to grow on me.</li>
            <li> Normally my hair is soft silky and feels close to &amp;#34;bunny fur&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I did exactly the same process of massaging it into my scalp and rinsing it.  </li>
            <li> I usually have a ton of static electricity in the winter with flyaways.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use clarifying shampoos for so many days in a row, but for testing/feedback purposes, I felt obliged to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it does make it look smooth and silky but not weighted down</li>
            <li> It made my ends smooth without weighing them down or getting greasy.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner and treatment keep my hair feeling silky and smooth without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> it leaves your hair soft, shiny, and frizz free, but it will leave your hair kind of dull after a few days.</li>
            <li> I liked the conditioner and deep conditioner too, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll stray from my salon products.</li>
            <li> The conditioner in this collection is light and made my hair feel soft, without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be fine and straggly, and a little frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Ok i have fine, thin, dry hair.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
            <li> It states that this detoxifies impurities from your hair; I am not sure how to tell if that is really happening or not, but as for the way my hair smells and feels, I will definitely be purchasing this kind in the future.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner used together left my hair very clean and not weighed down.</li>
            <li> The Shampoo:  nice and rick lather, very thick.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use products with very strong scents, so this was a big change for me.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:</li>
            <li> I have very fine and thin hair and normally use a clean rinse rather than conditioner for fear of weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> Also, from what I remember of Herbal Essences was the clear bottle with the flowers on it from my grandma&#x27;s bathroom, that I used probably over 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> and I am so pleasantly surprised by this</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair too soft that you can&#x27;t style it</li>
            <li> I received complementary samples of the herbal essences wild naturals detoxifying shampoo, conditioner, and treatment from a VoxBox so that I could review them.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these products.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like these product.  </li>
            <li> After using this product for a few  days I have noticed my hair thicker and feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> it made my hair so soft and shiny</li>
            <li> After using this bundle, my hair became soft, and it doesn&#x27;t become oily within two days like it used to.</li>
            <li> Overall, the scent of these is very lemon-ish.</li>
            <li> The conditioners leave your hair soft, silky and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair was so soft and silky all day.</li>
            <li> (I have a 3-month old) and use them.</li>
            <li> Now on to the third product, which was the intense treatment.</li>
            <li> My hair was so soft</li>
            <li> i just cant get over how soft my hair feels.</li>
            <li> After washing out my hair felt really soft even before conditioning.  </li>
            <li> As far as the scent goes, I am really sensitive to fragrance, and I found this to have somewhat of a medicinal smell but leaning towards fruity.</li>
            <li> All three products felt quite light, nothing too heavy -</li>
            <li> this product is completely life changing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them twice so far.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a marked difference after using the intensive treatment.  </li>
            <li> My hair was soft and had volume.</li>
            <li> My hair was shiny and felt soft, while my scalp felt cleaner .&lt;br /&gt;Days</li>
            <li> The smell is fresh and lemony, but not too overpowering and didn&#x27;t linger that much once my hair air dried.</li>
            <li> The intensive treatment I used mainly on my ends because of my fine and thin hair, I felt intensive treatment would be too much product and make my hair look oily..</li>
            <li> Secondly, I use a lot of product in my hair and this shampoo left my hair feeling so clean and the conditioner left it feeling soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used the shampoo and conditioner, I let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> So my hair is pretty dry</li>
            <li> The shampoo alone did leave my hair feeling pretty dry so the conditioner is a must!</li>
            <li> The conditioner also seems to have put a serious dent in all my static and frizz.</li>
            <li> This product felt light with no weigh down!!  </li>
            <li> My hair felt nice and soft after it dried and it didn&#x27;t take as long to dry, for some reason.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight hair</li>
            <li> have very fine, thin, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> With this shampoo and conditioner my hair has been silky smooth and has very few tangles.</li>
            <li> I was concerned at first that I would not benefit from a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t feel as &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; and smooth as other products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of product and dry shampoo, and I felt the &amp;#34;detoxifying&amp;#34; products really stripped my hair of all of that.</li>
            <li> The intensive treatment really helped my hair with it being so dry and damaged in this winter weather.</li>
            <li> The Intensive Treatment though really helps lock in moisture and take care of all of my dry split</li>
            <li> The deep conditioner smelled the same and was very slippery.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair really soft and it was still soft the next day.</li>
            <li> i seen a major difference in my hair</li>
            <li> The first time that I used it my hair turned into a giant poof, however it felt like a product that would do that following the initial use.</li>
            <li> I normally let my hair air dry naturally, and I did that each time I used this product as well.</li>
            <li> After the full 7 days of using all three products I definitely noticed smoother less tangled hair.</li>
            <li> It was a light fragrance, and once my hair dried the more medicinal smell went away and left behind the fruity scent.</li>
            <li> My hair is quite fine and tends toward dull and lifeless if I&#x27;m not careful with my hair products.</li>
            <li> My hair gets oily fairly quickly, so I generally avoid conditioner altogether.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that using 3 hair products does make your shower longer and isn&#x27;t as conducive for busy morning routines.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the shampoo and conditioner by themselves would have left my hair as soft as the triple combo did.</li>
            <li> They left my hair soft, my scalp rejuvenated and kept the relaxing fragrance on my hair for hours.</li>
            <li> I have very thin,  dry, and long hair and especially in the winter it gets tangled easily and staticky, so those are the issues I look for improvement in the most.</li>
            <li> Good-sized so that the product flows out easily, but small enough to bring for travel or if you&#x27;re only using it once a week or for a 1 week detox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been a Herbal Essence fan for a long time and these new products do not disappoint.</li>
            <li> My hair normally runs fairly dry.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using these products I&#x27;ve also gotten compliments on how shiny and pretty my hair is, so it&#x27;s noticeably different to other people as well.</li>
            <li> Upon first putting the shampoo on my hair it felt a little dry like most others do to my hair, making my hair feel hard, but as soon as I put in and rinsed out the conditioner</li>
            <li> The conditioner I was not as thrilled with, the product was very thin</li>
            <li> The product was thick and creamy and I only needed about a tablespoon to coat the ends of my hair which is shoulder length and fine in texture.</li>
            <li> I often have a hard time finding products that leave my hair feeling clean and not weighed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure I want to use a product that completely strips my hair first, then uses lots of chemicals to get a desired result.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a little worried when I first got it, because there are 2 conditioners.</li>
            <li> I used Herbal Essences years ago but switched to a salon product due to my fine, limp hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the whole system, including this intensive treatment, every other day for the last week.</li>
            <li> When I used this trio, it worked thwthe first time, but every time after that, my hair was limp and greasy.</li>
            <li> but with my thin hair it somewhat left it feeling and looking oily but definitely helped with the static and dryness.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is not as heavy and thick as many other conditioners, so I felt like I had to use a lot more than I usually do when conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was very light in texture, which I was surprised, because usually conditioner is thick.</li>
            <li> after the first use i cold tell a huge improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li> It had a great scent, but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t feel like the scent stayed with my hair throughout the day or even past the morning hours.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant testing this because I am very picky about my hair care.</li>
            <li> But I need not have been concerned, after using all 3 products my hair was actually less oily the next morning than normal.</li>
            <li> I also have a lot of trouble with conditioners weighing down my hair and causing it to be super oily.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to scents due to migraines, but found the fragrance to be quite relaxing.</li>
            <li> I have thin naturally curly/wavy/straight/ crappy hair and because of that I have learned that the first time that I use something on my hair is not the actual results.</li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t weighted down and was very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair that as time goes by gets a little greyer and dryer.</li>
            <li> My hairs is fine and thin and also really dry this time of year after using this bundle even just the 1st time</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have to blow dry my hair and it dried very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my hair was starting to get shinier and it wasn&#x27;t as dry as before after only a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Many clarifying shampoos (even major salon brands) tend to be very harsh and leave your hair feeling unappealing.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that I did not have to brush my hair as much during the day as usual.  </li>
            <li> Thirdly, I left it in for as long as the directions stated, and my was softer and shinier after I rinsed</li>
            <li> I use a flat iron and wash my hair 3-4 times a week.  </li>
            <li> All tho it didnt last as long as I would like it too.</li>
            <li> Therefore, when I repurchase these, I will skip the normal conditioner and replace it with the intensive treatment as an everyday conditioner.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that all 3 times my hair dried faster than normal.</li>
            <li> My hair was left feeling clean with the shampoo, but it also was a little hard to style.  </li>
            <li> The winters where I live can be quite harsh also as a skier and can damage my hair quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I have very long, lower back length hair</li>
            <li> to no avail, my hair turned out very flat.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid that the deep conditioner would make my hair lump, but again I was pleasantly pleased.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair that get weighed down pretty easily if a product is too thick or creamy.</li>
            <li> but after a week of using this product I am left dry and borderline brittle!...</li>
            <li> (I could tell all products were out of my strands with only one wash instead of multiple washes from other brands).</li>
            <li> not your typical herbal essences scent- a little more subtle.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t take a long time to rinse it out.</li>
            <li> and I could smell it on my hair for a long time afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these 2 products for a week and before trying them out my hair was not soft.</li>
            <li> It does have a few natural ingredients</li>
            <li> but I was really looking forward to  the intensive treatment which was thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> I do recommend using these products together, but I will likely alternate at least every other day with a volumizing shampoo and conditioner for my particular hair type and needs.  </li>
            <li> I dried my hair with my blowdryer and my head upside down to get as much body as I could..</li>
            <li> hair is so picky with what I use on it, iv tried everything from drugstore to professional products and so very few actually work for me.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t wash daily it becomes oily and wet looking, and my scalp becomes dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, but I use a flat iron on occasion and usually still have some frizz to my hair.</li>
            <li> It smelled different than the other products and my hair felt greasy.</li>
            <li> Overall, the three together did make my hair feel cleaner, fresher, and lighter than other products that I have tried.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers mentioned a lack of later, that didn&#x27;t bother me in fact</li>
            <li> My ends still looked and felt dry</li>
            <li> My hair is almost dry now</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry to see how well it performed against frizz.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed my hair get dry faster after I use the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have dry brittle damaged hair</li>
            <li> so I must shampoo often, leading to dry hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is normally dry.</li>
            <li> I have long, naturally blond hair and usually have an issue keeping volume.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was very thick but not difficult to rinse out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I do not normally use this type of conditioner but went for it.  </li>
            <li> I learned my lesson early on about applying the mask and conditioner too close to my scalp, as it became oily 3x faster than usual.</li>
            <li> You just shampoo in the shower like you normally would then apply and leave on for at least 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> The final step was the intense cleaner which was a nasty brown color, but made my hair SO silky smooth!</li>
            <li> It came out as thick as normal conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have very oily hair and have to be careful with conditioners because they usually weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> and I can say it is definitely softer and fluffed and doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down.</li>
            <li> 4-6: Starting to feel weighed down, and</li>
            <li> I recommend using this product if you have dry and damaged hair that needs some reviving!</li>
            <li> I found It left my hair manageable but no more than my current shampoo.</li>
            <li> but I am anxious to try out one of the other Wild Naturals collections.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is the opposite, it&#x27;s a little thinner than I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li> The conditioner was very unimpressive, it had a very thick texture to it nothing fancy about it</li>
            <li> and it left a sticky residue in my hair that was there immediately after my hair dried.</li>
            <li> it left my hair too limp and too soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times, and the same results occur.</li>
            <li> The conditioner worked as expected  as well.</li>
            <li> I am constantly looking for treatments/conditioners to help my limp, frizzy ends.</li>
            <li> I blow dried my hair and ran a flat iron through it</li>
            <li> I have average hair, sometimes dry due to dyeing, drying and heating I do.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was a little runny but after using the treatment conditioner my hair dried so soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> other conditioners.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than what I already mentioned, but hair feels and looks noticeably cleaner.</li>
            <li> The only thing I couldn&#x27;t get past was the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that it added any volume, but my hair was left feeling cleaner than before I started using this set.</li>
            <li> I was worried about how the products would make my hair feel, as in the past, Herbal Essences shampoos have left a waxy film on my hair.</li>
            <li> and I only need a small amount per wash.</li>
            <li> it is really dry and cold right now)</li>
            <li> My hair stilled felt a little dry.</li>
            <li> This product reduced them to a very minimal.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend even for people that have thin hair such as myself.</li>
            <li> The second thing is how thick the shampoo is so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a dramatic change from this product nor did I find the ingredients seeming different than your regular shampoo</li>
            <li> My only downside is I still have the itchy scalp that is so hard to get rid of.</li>
            <li> Kinda like that lingering chemical smell in the air when you walk into an average Salon.  </li>
            <li> The intensive treatment is thick and I didn&#x27;t like it as well as the conditioner, so I&#x27;ve only used that once.  </li>
            <li> It brought life to my hair without weighing it down or making it greasy, which is a big deal as my hair is thin and dry at the ends-</li>
            <li> and I found my hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down by the product.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> The conditioner seemed somewhat watered down and after rinsing it out of my hair</li>
            <li> I used a half dollar amount of the intensive treatment on the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> Also my hair is less knotty.</li>
            <li> However, I typically use shampoo and conditioner that&#x27;s typically targeted toward anti-breakage because that&#x27;s an issue for me.</li>
            <li> I typically use the volumizing collection.</li>
            <li> Typical shampoo/conditioner bottles/tubes.  </li>
            <li> And it seems my hair gets a little weighed down and greasy feeling by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I live in the midwest where it is currently cold and dry.</li>
            <li> It was dry and dull.</li>
            <li> I also used the set of the on my 7 year old son, his hair is long and needs the extra conditioning because it gets knotted up bad, his hair dried to a non tangled softness!</li>
            <li> When I opened the package I was a little hesitant because I despise the smell of lemon</li>
            <li> This shampoo left my hair limp and very hard to style.  </li>
            <li> My scalp was dry and my hair was brittle, I seriously did not know what to use because i&#x27;ve tried almost everything.</li>
            <li> My hair has been unhappy with the change over from winter to spring, but this really helps.</li>
            <li> Then I applied the treatment and combed through clipped it up and let it sit for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> All three have a heavy lemon and basil scent, which remind me of dish washing soap.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair too limp.  </li>
            <li> I started off with the shampoo and my hair felt dried out, but I still gave it a chance.</li>
            <li> so I let it sit in my hair for a few minutes even though it does not say too.</li>
            <li> I have uneven wavy hair and straighten my hair every day.  </li>
            <li> I think lather is a sign of harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo has sulfates in it, which I&#x27;m not a huge fan of to begin with.</li>
            <li> I was not a huge fan of the scent.</li>
            <li> I still had a little frizz, but not quite as much as I usually do.</li>
            <li> I was not a huge fan of the shampoo or conditioner from herbal essences in the past.  </li>
            <li> My hair type is dry, color treated and thin.</li>
            <li> I would use the shampoo and conditioner as a once a month treatment but these products leave my hair limp and hard to style.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the detoxifying effect is supposed to be.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I would buy the conditioner, but I did like the shampoo and intensive treatment.</li>
            <li> The sizes were fairly small and I finished them in about 3 days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the detoxifying aspect is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure about the &amp;#34;detoxifying&amp;#34; or purifies my hair.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use hair products unless they&#x27;re from the salon, but I figured I&#x27;d give these a try.</li>
            <li> I styled my hair as usual afterwards with a spray-in texurizer, and blowout spray.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner was a bit disappointing, it covered poorly and didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> The only negative I can review on this product is the conditioner, it seemed very thin</li>
            <li> I also have to deal with hard water, which takes a toll on my hair.</li>
            <li> The conditioner felt a little thin to me but seemed to add moisture when I rinsed it out.</li>
            <li> Some shampoos and conditioners are thick</li>
            <li> On the other hand OMG!!!!</li>
            <li> I will continue using the products even after my small bottles are exhausted.</li>
            <li> Again this product is very thick, and I was a bit concerned that it would weigh my hair</li>
            <li> so find a set that works is hard and can be expensive.</li>
            <li> and when I am not happy I always return.  </li>
            <li> My hair looked limp and dirty.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair but have a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> The smell got worse.</li>
            <li> My hair is really dry and static-y this time of year because of the cold winter months, but this gave my hair the boost it needed!</li>
            <li> but I was not left completely disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always wary of conditioners because sometimes it seems like they leave my hair feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical at what the &amp;#34;Detoxifying&amp;#34; would do to it.  </li>
            <li> I am obsessed.</li>
            <li> I received this set from influenster.com to sample for review and I am absolutely obsessed!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad, just not a &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and I hate the feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : I hated this.</li>
            <li> but oh my gosh I was wrong!!!  </li>
            <li> But I hated how they made my hair feel!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received the product(s) complimentary to test and review and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. The lemon basil scent was refreshing. The shampoo lathered great and left my hair squeaky clean. The conditioner was more watery then I expected but it distributed through my hair and left it smooth and soft but I was really looking forward to  the intensive treatment which was thick and creamy. It felt great and rinsed clean. My hair was silky, smooth and easy to comb. When I dried and styled it, my hair was very manageable. I would recommend this product set.</li>
            <li> I recieved these these 3 products fron influenster to try and review! This line smells amazing! I used a half dollar amount of the intensive treatment on the ends of my hair. I try not to use conditioners too close to my roots to avoid greasiness. It left my hair shiny smelling delicious and nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I recieved this bundle for free to test and review, i was very excited to use it! It has a lemon scent to it which i thought smelt amazing! My hairs is fine and thin and also really dry this time of year after using this bundle even just the 1st time i seen a major difference in my hair, it made it very soft seems to lock in moisture really well too. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying full size bottles of this product!</li>
            <li> I received this set from Influenster to try for free.  I may not have picked this up to try otherwise but I certa will be purchasing it from now on. The first thing I noticed was the pleasant fragrance.  It&#x27;s a nice light lemon smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  The shampoo has a decent lather and the fragrance lingers on your hair nicely afterwards.  Some shampoos make my head itch but I didn&#x27;t have that issue with this one.  I liked the conditioner.  Although not very thick, I actually liked that because it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy afterwards.  The intensive treatment also gave nice results.  I would only use this once a week just because of my kind of hair.  Great products!</li>
            <li> Got this starter kit free from Influenster to review and I have to say I love it the shampoo n conditioner and hair treatment made my hair feel healthy and clean and the smell was amazing I loved every thing about it I highly recommend 👍</li>
            <li> I received these products free to review and test from Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine, thin, color treated hair. I often have a hard time finding products that leave my hair feeling clean and not weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has a fantastic smell. It lathered nicely and it didn&#x27;t take a ton of the product to clean my entire head of hair. I then followed up with the conditioner, letting it sit in my hair for about three minutes. The conditioner was very thick but not difficult to rinse out of my hair. Finally I used the intensive treatment, which I also let sit in my hair for about three to five minutes. Again this product is very thick, and I was a bit concerned that it would weigh my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once my hair was dry, I was pleasantly surprised to find that my hair did not feel weighed down, but very light, bouncy, and smooth. I didn&#x27;t even have to blow dry my hair and it dried very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would say this is a great set of products for a very good price.</li>
            <li> I was one of the lucky ones chosen to receive this bundle for free through Influenster to use and review.  My review starts with the shampoo...the smell is AWSOME, lathered well and my hair and head had that squeeky clean feeling.  The conditioner again the smell is AWSOME a, distributed well all over head and scalp. I have very fine and thin hair and normally use a clean rinse rather than conditioner for fear of weighing down my hair. This product felt light with no weigh down!!  The intensive treatment I used mainly on my ends because of my fine and thin hair, I felt intensive treatment would be too much product and make my hair look oily..using on the ends worked just fine and my hair a bit more manageable and not so fly-away...oh and that smell...AWSOME!  I will definitely by the shampoo and conditioner again!!</li>
            <li> I received this set from Influenster to review.  While it smelled nice I choose not to use products that contain harmful chemicals.  I would have enjoyed it had it been a product without Parabens and other harmful chemicals.  Bummer!</li>
            <li> When I used this trio, it worked thwthe first time, but every time after that, my hair was limp and greasy. This trio was not my favorite,  but it smells really nice.</li>
            <li> Although I liked the scent of all three products, I felt like the quality did not stand up to other brands. I have very long, lower back length hair and I felt that I had to use a lot of shampoo to feel clean and the conditioner didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling silky like other conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**received the products free to try and review**</li>
            <li> The Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying collection is nothing short of wonderful.  received the whole collection (shampoo, conditioner and intensive treatment) free to test and review from Influenster/VoxBox and I am so pleasantly surprised by this system.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo was clean, lathered nicely and left my hair feeling light and clean. The conditioner is as equally satisfying as the shampoo. I was concerned at first that I would not benefit from a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t feel as &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; and smooth as other products I have used in the past. It feels lightweight and is easy to rinse out. Brushing through the tangles was easier..but the real result was once I dried my hair. My hair remained lightweight, shiny and SO FREAKING SOFT.&lt;br /&gt;The Intensive Treatment is just that, intense. I have average hair, sometimes dry due to dyeing, drying and heating I do. So I thought that this product would be perfect for a pick me up in getting moisture back into my hair. I&#x27;ve used the whole system, including this intensive treatment, every other day for the last week. And it seems my hair gets a little weighed down and greasy feeling by the end of the day. After I switched to doing the Intensive Treatment only 2 times a week, this has been remedied. The instructions on the back of the product don&#x27;t give specifics of use.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way my hair smells throughout the day...and can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary for testing purposes. This stuff smells SO good! I wanna leave it on all day! My hair feels super soft after using this just ONE time!! Even thought I got it for free for review, the price is actually pretty cheap and affordable. Which is definitely something I see myself buying. Other than what I already mentioned, but hair feels and looks noticeably cleaner. My boyfriend couldn&#x27;t stop playing and smelling with my hair.  My hair looks and feels sexy!</li>
            <li> I recieved this set for free to test and try and I love the way it made my hair feel! My hair is super soft and shiny! I would recommend this product to my friends for sure!</li>
            <li> I just tried the herbal essence natural wild shampoo and conditioners this week as a sample/tester from Influenster and I am in love! Not only does it perfume your shower with this amazing scent, but your hair feels soft and healthy all day! I use this with the rejuvenating shampoo and conditioner daily. It is perfect for the dry winters here in Colorado. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair too soft that you can&#x27;t style it but it does make it look smooth and silky but not weighted down so you get the desired volume. It is the perfect recipe for great a great hair day!</li>
            <li> I received complementary samples of the herbal essences wild naturals detoxifying shampoo, conditioner, and treatment from a VoxBox so that I could review them. The shampoo smells great. Without being overpowering. The thai basil scent is very fresh. Great thick lather. A nice clarifying shampoo to use once a week or so to get all the styling products out. Then I applied the treatment and combed through clipped it up and let it sit for a few minutes. Again the scent was very pleasing. The product was thick and creamy and I only needed about a tablespoon to coat the ends of my hair which is shoulder length and fine in texture. It made my ends smooth without weighing them down or getting greasy.  I went a couple day without washing after and the fresh scent was still there. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary to test and review. I have fine, thin hair. The shampoo had a medium lather, so I felt like my hair was getting nice and clean but it didn&#x27;t take a long time to rinse it out. The conditioner was light but I didn&#x27;t feel like it would get the job done on its own. The intense treatment felt more like a regular conditioner consistency, which I preferred. The directions for the treatment didn&#x27;t indicate how often to use it but I think it would be safe to use with every shampoo because it didn&#x27;t feel like a deep conditioner that you would only want to use once a week. My hair felt nice and soft after it dried and it didn&#x27;t take as long to dry, for some reason. My hair didn&#x27;t feel weighed down, which is good since I need all the help I can get to add body. The scent has a clean, perfume smell but it was a little strong for me. I prefer a fruity fragrance rather than a perfume. All in all, this product got the job done.</li>
            <li> I received this kit complimentary from Influenster to try and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, or leave it feeling oily. It lathers and cleans very well. The only thing i don&#x27;t like is having to use two different products after shampooing. I prefer to shampoo, then use either a conditioner or treatment, not both.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these products. Often times detoxifying hair products dry out my fine hair, but that was not the case with these. The shampoo left my hair feeling very clean yet still moisturized. I will definitely be repurchasing it again. The conditioner I was not as thrilled with, the product was very thin so I felt that I needed a lot of product to fully coat my hair. After it was washed out my hair did feel smoother, but it took a lot of product to get there. The intensive treatment was basically what I was hoping the normal conditioner would be like. It is a much thicker and nicer formula than the conditioner. Therefore, when I repurchase these, I will skip the normal conditioner and replace it with the intensive treatment as an everyday conditioner. Overall, I would recommend the shampoo and intensive conditioner. They have a great clean scent and leave your hair super clean yet moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;*I was sent these products for review purposes from influenster, all opinions are my own*</li>
            <li> I received this bundle from Influesnster for free to test out. Let me start out by saying my hair is color treated and on the fine side. The first time I used the shampoo and conditioner, I let my hair air dry. The conditioner wasn&#x27;t all that great. My ends still looked and felt dry but my roots looked greasy but once I put a Lil dry shampoo in there it was fine. The next time I used it I used the Intensive treatment and my hair felt a bit better at the ends. My roots were still greasy. I blow dried my hair and ran a flat iron through it and it did pretty good. I still had to use some dry shampoo at my roots, but that&#x27;s OK. The only thing I couldn&#x27;t get past was the smell. I just didn&#x27;t like it. It was too strong for me. I honestly can say that I won&#x27;t purchase this collection persay but I am anxious to try out one of the other Wild Naturals collections.</li>
            <li> I received this bundle kit as a influenster vox box.  I love the smell of all the products.  The shampoo has a nice, rich, lather.  It washes out easily.  I&#x27;m not sure what the detoxifying effect is supposed to be.  My hair was left feeling clean with the shampoo, but it also was a little hard to style.  The conditioner smells nice also, but I would not be able to use it every day.  I would use the shampoo and conditioner as a once a month treatment but these products leave my hair limp and hard to style.  I did not like the intensive conditioner treatment at all.  It smelled different than the other products and my hair felt greasy.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this bundle to for free to test and review. Now that I have used it a few times I feel that I can give a fair assessment. First I would like to say that it has a really nice light smell of lemons. Okay now on with my review. I have thin naturally curly/wavy/straight/ crappy hair and because of that I have learned that the first time that I use something on my hair is not the actual results. Every time that I used this set I started off with shampooing my hair. The shampoo had a nice lather and seemed to clean my hair really well. I then put the conditioner in my hair and let it soak in while I shaved. It doesn&#x27;t say to do that but that is what I do with every conditioner so I felt that in order to fairly asses it and compare it to past shampoo and conditioner I must stay consistent. The conditioner felt a little thin to me but seemed to add moisture when I rinsed it out. When I first received the sample I was thinking that I would start with just the shampoo and conditioner and see what happened but once I rinsed out the conditioner I felt my hair need something more (I live in New England and it is really dry and cold right now) so I went right for the intensive treatment and applied that and rinsed it out immediately with no soak time. The first time that I used it my hair turned into a giant poof, however it felt like a product that would do that following the initial use. It is the second and third use that determined how it works. The following 2 time I tried the set it made my hair nice and shiny so the poof was gone. I also noticed that all 3 times my hair dried faster than normal. Overall I really like these product.  I feel like the shampoo and conditioner alone is not enough for my hair type, or maybe the current weather here. With that being said, the one product that I really liked was the intensive treatment. However I could definitely see some people not needing the intensive treatment for their hair. I feel like the intensive treatment might have to become a part of my regular hair routine!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of these products to try and review, and I was really happy with them! I have thin hair that get weighed down pretty easily if a product is too thick or creamy. This bundle left my hair light and with noticeable volume, even the deep conditioner. I liked the scent, it was crisp and bright.</li>
            <li> I received this bundle as a promotional gift and I love it!!! First off, the smell is amazing! It&#x27;s a very fresh and energizing scent, perfect way to start the day. Secondly, I use a lot of product in my hair and this shampoo left my hair feeling so clean and the conditioner left it feeling soft and silky.  I will definitely be buying this when I run out. Fantastic value for the price point.</li>
            <li> This bundle is great! I started with the detoxifying shampoo which was light and smooth in my hand, which made me feel secure putting it in my hair. I then used the conditioner which instantly made my hair feel smoother. I was not a fan of this scent however, it did smell clean, and did not leave much smell as the day went on. However as an initial impression i was not a fan of the ginger citrus combination. The final step was the intense cleaner which was a nasty brown color, but made my hair SO silky smooth! Over all I love this product and would definitely use it again given the chance. Not to mention i got this product for free to test and review!</li>
            <li> *I received these products free for testing purposes*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is so picky with what I use on it, iv tried everything from drugstore to professional products and so very few actually work for me. I can honestly say this actually did! I was so surprised with how good these products actually made me hair feel/look. Upon first putting the shampoo on my hair it felt a little dry like most others do to my hair, making my hair feel hard, but as soon as I put in and rinsed out the conditioner it was so silky smooth, and the treatment just gave it the perfect touch! Definitely recommend everyone to try these products, they also smell so good.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I was lucky to have received this amazing product for FREE from Influenster for reviewing purposes. The herbal essences detoxifying kit has a wonderful smell. The smell of fresh lemons hits you the moment you open the bottle.  Some shampoos and conditioners are thick others are too milky in texture however this product has the perfect smooth texture. The product not only leaves your hair smooth and silky but also leaves your hands super soft!. It&#x27;s great to have your hands feeling soft rather then sticky and dry. This kit comes with three products one shampoo, one conditioner and a treatment. After using this product for a few  days I have noticed my hair thicker and feeling smooth. Before using this product I had build up (similar to dandruff) from other conditioners with this product my hair is now build up free! Also my hair is less knotty. My hair brush runs smoothly through my hair. I don&#x27;t have to fight with knots. This product gave me great results.  I recommend this product not only to detoxify your hair but to strengthen and make it healthy. Thanks again influenster!</li>
            <li> I received whole set with the shampoo, conditioner, and intensive repair treatment herbal essences natural for free to sample from Influenster in a VoxBox. I really liked the shampoo because it left my hair feeling a lot cleaner than others I have used. I don&#x27;t like or dislike the smell of the three of them because it&#x27;s not too strong, but it&#x27;s also not a smell I would request. It is a fresh and pretty natural smell, so I do like that. I&#x27;m always wary of conditioners because sometimes it seems like they leave my hair feeling greasy. However, this conditioner felt very light in my hands, and after using it my hair felt smooth and not greasy at all. I also like how the intensive treatment made my hair feel. However, it did not get the frizz out of my hair like it says it will, but I don&#x27;t hold that against them because no products that I&#x27;ve tried so far have been able to get the frizz out of my hair. Overall, the three together did make my hair feel cleaner, fresher, and lighter than other products that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I received this starter kit free to try through Influenster.  The smell is wonderful and it makes my hair so silky and shiny.  I have very oily hair and have to be careful with conditioners because they usually weigh my hair down.  This conditioner is great and the intensive treatment is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I received this product to test and review through Influester. When I initially opened the product the first thing I fell in love with was the smell! It had a great scent, but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t feel like the scent stayed with my hair throughout the day or even past the morning hours. The shampoo felt great as soon as I used it. My hair definitely felt cleaner after using it, and washed out any products that were in my hair with ease. The shampoo alone did leave my hair feeling pretty dry so the conditioner is a must! As for the conditioner, as soon as I massaged it into my hair I could tell the difference in the texture of my hair. It felt smoother and silkier. I usually only use shampoo and conditioner so I was definitely intrigued to use the intensive treatment, however this was my favorite part! If I could only use one of these three products I would chose the intensive treatment evey time! My hair stilled felt a little dry. Even after using the conditioner but once I used the intensive treatment I feel my hair was smoother! It was easy to come through my hair after my shower and my hair had an overall lighter and cleaner feel when I styled it. One of the things I liked the most about it was my day two hair did not feel as oily and I did not need to wash my hair out of necessity! I would definitely recommend using all three products together, with the intensive treatment being the most essential. The only drawback is that using 3 hair products does make your shower longer and isn&#x27;t as conducive for busy morning routines.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  I received this from Influencer.  It is a great product.  I love the smell.  SO clean and refreshing not overly fragrant, just a light great scent!  My hair tends to be fine and straggly, and a little frizzy.  This product smoothed out my hair.  My hair felt so clean and so nice!  I love the silkiness of my hair.  Thanks Herbal Essence and Influencer for this product.  I always love Herbal Essences.  I sometimes try something else and when I am not happy I always return.  This will be the next kind I buy.</li>
            <li> Got the voxbox of Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying collection for free for my review. The shampoo smelled like mint, which for me I like. The conditioner was a little runny but after using the treatment conditioner my hair dried so soft and fluffy. I also used the set of the on my 7 year old son, his hair is long and needs the extra conditioning because it gets knotted up bad, his hair dried to a non tangled softness!</li>
            <li> I really liked the shampoo/conditioner and deep conditioning treatment! I was lucky enough to get a free sample of it so I can test it and review it. I really liked it, I am not a big fan of Herbal Essences but I really loved the deep treatment. I would def. recommend to anyone, it give your a clean polished look.</li>
            <li> I received this bundle free to use and test.  The smell of a product, along with the way a product performs, is very important to me.  I was not disappointed with the way it smells.  It has a very nice, light fragrance.  Not over powering, yet enough to smell nice and clean.  I was afraid that the deep conditioner would make my hair lump, but again I was pleasantly pleased.  I think anyone would enjoy using these products.</li>
            <li> I got this awesome bundle from influenster and I love it. it made my hair so soft and shiny and I love it!</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited to receive these products free to test and review. Once I received my box I immediately put them in my shower to use the next morning and already loved the scent. I have very fine straight hair and use a lot of product to obtain some volume. The shampoo is amazing: doesn&#x27;t get too foamy, smells great, and leaves that awesome &#x27;stripped&#x27; feelings of cleanliness when you rinse it out (I could tell all products were out of my strands with only one wash instead of multiple washes from other brands). The conditioner is ok: it&#x27;s a bit runny compared to the usual thicker conditioners I use, the scenting great, and it does a decent job of providing strength to my fine hair (and with it being thinner, it helped with not weighing down my hair so my volumizing products worked better). The intensive treatment I am in love with: it was the thicker conditioner I was expecting but gave so much softening and strength to my hair, and the scent is great. All-in-all, I really like this product line and will continue to use it even after these free trial products run out.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try this set out for free. The shampoo and conditioner were great but I was concerned with using the deep conditioner on top of the other conditioner, but it was perfectly fine. I didn&#x27;t add any extra product before drying my hair and I was very pleased with the results. Would definitely recommend even for people that have thin hair such as myself.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to hear that I would be receiving these hair products for free a few weeks ago! These products were being sent to me for free as part of a test and review program on influenster.com. I tried them out for about four days in total. Here we go:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shampoo: To start with -- this shampoo smells pretty darn good. However, I did have higher expectations than what I got. The shampoo itself may have smelled good, but once rinsed out my hair felt dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conditioner: In hopes of restoring some moisture to my hair, I used the conditioner and then left it in five minutes! I rinsed it out, but my hair felt only a bit softer and I could tell it would tangle after drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Intensive Treatment: I liked this treatment better than the shampoo and conditioner for a few reasons. One, it LOOKED more natural! Secondly, it smelled more lemony. Thirdly, I left it in for as long as the directions stated, and my was softer and shinier after I rinsed it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I really appreciated the natural aspect of the product itself as compared to more chemical laden hair products.</li>
            <li> I received this to try from inflencter. I found this product to have a light scent and I found my hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down by the product. I found It left my hair manageable but no more than my current shampoo. I do have to agree with the reviewers who question the detoxifying. I didn&#x27;t notice a dramatic change from this product nor did I find the ingredients seeming different than your regular shampoo</li>
            <li> I received this set free to test and review. My hair is fine, wavy, and frizzy. The first thing I noticed about this set is that the scent is light, fresh, and lemony. The shampoo didn&#x27;t lather as much as most shampoos, but it still did a good job at cleansing my hair without drying it out or weighing it down. The conditioner is not as heavy and thick as many other conditioners, so I felt like I had to use a lot more than I usually do when conditioning my hair. That being said, I did feel that my hair needed more moisturizing after I rinsed the conditioner out. After shampooing and conditioning, I let the intensive treatment sit in my hair as I finished washing the rest of my body. The intensive treatment seemed to leave my hair a lot more moisturized than the conditioner did. I let my hair air dry, like I normally do, and my hair felt clean and light. I&#x27;m not sure that it added any volume, but my hair was left feeling cleaner than before I started using this set. I&#x27;m not sure that I would buy the conditioner, but I did like the shampoo and intensive treatment.</li>
            <li> I received these three products free from Influenster to review. I have used the shampoo and conditioner for about 10 days now. I have use the Intensive treatment once. Very pleased with all three products. Hair feels super clean, it&#x27;s really shiny and soft. Conditioner detangles almost immediately and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair. I will continue using the products even after my small bottles are exhausted. I also like the light scent.</li>
            <li> I am giving this product five stars and I do not do that often. The reason being is that my hair has never felt better. My scalp was dry and my hair was brittle, I seriously did not know what to use because i&#x27;ve tried almost everything. After using this bundle, my hair became soft, and it doesn&#x27;t become oily within two days like it used to. The shampoo and conditioner work well by themselves, and I was happy that the conditioner wasn&#x27;t thick and didn&#x27;t make my hair oily like other conditioners do. The intensive treatment was what I liked the most. I had an awesome experience with this and I am thoroughly pleased with this product that I received from Influenster to test and review.  I will definitely be buying this soon after I use up my current bundle!</li>
            <li> \The shampoo is a bit drying, so I only use it a couple days a week. It has a nice, herbal smell to it. My favorite is the mask, which has such a great texture. I especially like it for days when I want my hair to have some body to it. If I had to recommend one out of the three, I would definitely go with the moisturizing hair mask.&lt;br /&gt;*I received this as a sample from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I received these products free to review as part of a VoxBox campaign through Influenster. I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner every day for almost two weeks now, and I&#x27;ve used the the intensive treatment twice. I&#x27;m very happy with how well these products work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is really long and tangles very easily, so I have to be careful which shampoos and conditioners I use or else I end up with a tangled mass of hair. With this shampoo and conditioner my hair has been silky smooth and has very few tangles. That is a HUGE plus for me. Since I&#x27;ve been using these products I&#x27;ve also gotten compliments on how shiny and pretty my hair is, so it&#x27;s noticeably different to other people as well.</li>
            <li> I received this bundle free from influenster. I have used Herbal Essence products for years and am always happy with my results. I loved this detoxifying kit! The smell was the 1st thing I noticed. Who doesn&#x27;t love great smelling hair? I noticed my hair felt softer right away. After using all 3 products together for 2 weeks now, I can definitely notice less fly aways and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as dry. I will definitely be adding this to my hair care line up.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences always has the best smelling products! I received this produce free to test and review and really enjoyed using it! I used all three products together and enjoyed the shampoo and intensive treatment the most. I felt that the intensive treatment really helped moisturize my hair and would like to use this product in my weekly routine. I loved the way it made my hair feel after using it!</li>
            <li> Overall, the scent of these is very lemon-ish. I don&#x27;t smell any basil in it, but I&#x27;m kind of glad of that. I don&#x27;t really want basil scent in my hair. I wasn&#x27;t the hugest fan of the smell when I first got it (usually I go for more tropical flavored smells) but it started to grow on me. I also have the detoxifying versions since I really have oily hair and I LOVE that super clean feeling. My hair gets oily quick and I hate the feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo (1/5 stars): I hated this. I thought it was NOT deep cleaning at all and it left a sticky residue in my hair that was there immediately after my hair dried. My hair looked limp and dirty. Highly disliked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner (4/5 stars): It did the job. It was moisturizing on the ends of my hair (I didn&#x27;t put it at the top of my head since I get oily so quick). I&#x27;m not too picky about conditioners (mostly shampoos)  and I liked it since the scent grew on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mask (2/5 stars): Definitely not the most moisturizing hair mask I&#x27;ve used. I think the Macadamia one or the L&#x27;oreal one in the yellow bucket is much better. It was okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this from an Influenster box**</li>
            <li> I received this trial package for free from Influenster.  After trying it for about two weeks I have come to really like all three products in the package.  The detoxifying shampoo made my hair feel very clean and freshly scented.  The conditioner was a bit too light and sort of dried my hair out, but when paired with the treatment product it was the perfect combination.  Left my hair so soft and clean.  I would definitely recommend these three products together!</li>
            <li> I have been using this Herbal Essence trio for about 10 days and I love them. I have been a Herbal Essence fan for a long time and these new products do not disappoint. I have very fine thin hair that as time goes by gets a little greyer and dryer. These products when used together have made my hair fuller and nourished. No more fly away, dry looking, no bounce hair. Right after I wash my hair I want everyone to smell that citrus smell...but I agree with the comments about the wonderful smell that my hair has after washing not lasting long enough. I&#x27;m very happy to have been given this Vox box to try these products. Without receiving these to test I would never have known that this is the system for my hair.</li>
            <li> I received this trio from  Influenster for free.  So excited to be able to test and review it.  I had back surgery 3 weeks ago and just now being able to &amp;#34;test drive&amp;#34; it.  I used Herbal Essences years ago but switched to a salon product due to my fine, limp hair. Shampoo smelled wonderful and I used the amount I normally would use but it was way too much foam.  I do not normally use this type of conditioner but went for it.  Now I know why I have tried so any products over the years...it left my hair too limp and too soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like these products but they are just not for me and my hair.</li>
            <li> I received the line from a Vox Box and I have enjoyed using the products. My hair feels squeaky clean after using the shampoo and conditioner. I have very fine hair and at first the treatment seemed like to much for strands. However, I bleached my hair about a week ago and the treatment is now my favorite product of the line. It definitely adds silkyness and smoothness, plus moisture.</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.  I used all 3 products today and I was very pleased.  First, the aroma of the products is so fresh.  I smelled some lemon, which to me, always smells clean.  Secondly, the shampoo lathered up nicely.  I followed this by using the condition and then the conditioning hair treatment.  My hir felt extremely smooth and light.  After styling my hair, it was much shinier and smoother than before I used these products.  I nightly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have to say I absolute Love the smell of all 3 Products.. its a very clean,fresh smell.  I was excited to receive this because I like to change up my shampoo, conditioner every couple of bottles. So my hair is pretty dry so I was excited to see what it could do for my dryness. The shampoo lathered very good ... conditioner was doing what conditioner does.. it smelled soo good. Then I was the most excited to use the intesive treatment because of my dry hair.. and I have to say after I used it and washed it out... my hair combed very easy with my wide tooth comb. After I blow dryed my hair, it was very soft and had a very clean crisp smell. I would  defintely buy these Product ... especially the intesive treatment. I really liked the results of this product.  I received this kit threw Influenster to Test &amp; Review.</li>
            <li> I recieved these products to test and review. Ok i have fine, thin, dry hair. The smell of lemons is very relaxing, clean and refreshing. I started with the shampoo first. The texture is very light and it seemed like I jad to use a little more shampoo then usual. It rinsed out quickly.  Conditioner was next. Just like the shampoo its very light textured and smell is amazing. I wasn&#x27;t sure when to use the soft treatment so I put that in and quickly rinsed it out.  My hair is almost dry now and I can say it is definitely softer and fluffed and doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down. This product is something I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I received these products for free to test.  They have a great lasting smell but overall didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.  I have thin hair but have a lot of it.  The shampoo seemed to really do a great job cleaning and like I said smelled great.  The conditioner seemed somewhat watered down and after rinsing it out of my hair I realized that it just wasn&#x27;t enough.  I live in the midwest and in the middle of winter I need a good conditioner to avoid the static and to just give some extra moisture.  I then used the Intensive Treatment which seemed to help a lot but with my thin hair it somewhat left it feeling and looking oily but definitely helped with the static and dryness.  Overall I think the products are okay..but probably not the best for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I received these products to test and review. When I received the product, I could immediately smell it through the box!  Powerful scent, and not a pleasing one. Kind of smells like cleaner. I have a fine hear, but quite a bit of it. My hair is quite healthy already, (rarely blow dry, minimal product, cuts every 6 weeks) so I was skeptical at what the &amp;#34;Detoxifying&amp;#34; would do to it.  I fight daily to get some lift into my hair, and this three-pack definitely did not help.  The shampoo has sulfates in it, which I&#x27;m not a huge fan of to begin with. The first day I used just the shampoo (out of habit of not using conditioner) I couldn&#x27;t comb through my hair without spraying a fair amount of detangler in it. The next day, I used the shampoo, a tiny bit of conditioner (my hair gets so greasy with conditioner) and a slightly larger amount of the intensifying treatment.  I could definitely run a brush through it, immediately out of the shower.  I dried my hair with my blowdryer and my head upside down to get as much body as I could.. to no avail, my hair turned out very flat.  Hair was VERY soft and shiny, though!  I&#x27;m just not sure I want to use a product that completely strips my hair first, then uses lots of chemicals to get a desired result.</li>
            <li> I love this product my hair feels so much better since i started using it</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers great and smells awesome. The conditioners leave your hair soft, silky and manageable. Great for fine, thin curly hair. These products were complimentary to try and review.</li>
            <li> I received this bundle for free in my mailbox. I have very fine, limp hair. After just the first use of all three products, my hair is full &amp; a lot of bounce. I love the smell of the lemons as I was using it in my shower. Once I blow dryed my hair, the smell stayed in my hair. Very nice products!</li>
            <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Natural shampoo, conditioner, and intensive treatment for free to test and review. The thing that stuck out the most to me was the amazing scent of these products, and my hair smelled amazing all the way until I went to bed at night. I have very thin,  dry, and long hair and especially in the winter it gets tangled easily and staticky, so those are the issues I look for improvement in the most. After the full 7 days of using all three products I definitely noticed smoother less tangled hair. My hair was so soft and silky all day. I didn’t notice a reduction in the static in my hair though. The only negative I can review on this product is the conditioner, it seemed very thin so when I applied it I couldn’t really tell where I had it in my hair and not. Otherwise I absolutely loved these products and will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> I received this bundle from Influenster to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this whole line is amazing! It&#x27;s clean and energizing. This worked fairly well on my hair, which is medium thickness and length. It smoothed and softened my hair. However, I typically use shampoo and conditioner that&#x27;s typically targeted toward anti-breakage because that&#x27;s an issue for me. And these products don&#x27;t help with that at all. But, if you&#x27;re looking for some extra shine and softness, I do recommend this line!</li>
            <li> I received these products free to test and review.  All three have a heavy lemon and basil scent, which remind me of dish washing soap.  I have oily hair and use various products that like to stay in my hair.  The shampoo absolutely detoxed my hair.  It took all the hair product residues and oils out.  The shampoo was more runny than my normal shampoo, yet still lathered quite well.  The conditioner was also the same consistency.  However, it did not leave my hair feeling greasy afterwards.  My hair still felt clean.  The intensive treatment has a nice consistency to it.  I let my hair air dry to see how well it performed against frizz.  It did an okay job.  I still had a little frizz, but not quite as much as I usually do.</li>
            <li> I received this set from influenster.com to sample for review and I am absolutely obsessed! The smell is amazing and the treatment is amazing my hair has never felt so soft and light</li>
            <li> I received these products to test and review. I was excited because I love hair products, makeup, skin care, etc. Also, from what I remember of Herbal Essences was the clear bottle with the flowers on it from my grandma&#x27;s bathroom, that I used probably over 10 years ago. Upon opening the box, I could already smell the products. It was a light, fresh smell. I was so excited when I got to take a shower (I have a 3-month old) and use them. The shampoo was nice. It didn&#x27;t lather very foamy, which I liked, because another shampoo I use lathers up so thick and it seems like it takes forever to get out of my hair. My hair was also pretty soft after rinsing the shampoo out. The conditioner was very light in texture, which I was surprised, because usually conditioner is thick. I liked the conditioner as well, and it smelled so good. My hair felt really nice after I rinsed it out. Now on to the third product, which was the intense treatment. It came out as thick as normal conditioner. I liked that because it wasn&#x27;t too thick in texture. It also had such a nice smell. When I rinsed it out, my hair smelled amazing! Upon walking around the house after my great shower, I still smell the products and my hair is nice and soft. I would definitely buy these in the store!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this combo. My hair has much more body and is less fly away. It has much more body and looks much healthier.</li>
            <li> I only received these items about two weeks ago*, and have used them twice since. I generally only wash my hair once or twice a week, so I haven&#x27;t gotten a ton of use out of them yet, but I&#x27;ve managed to form an opinion. I really like the line. I used the shampoo, conditioner, and deep conditioning treatment all at the same time. After I lathered the shampoo, I applied the conditioner to the ends of my hair for about 30 seconds. After I rinsed that, I applied the deeper treatment onto the ends of my hair and clipped it up for about 10 minutes (the remaining time in the shower).  The smell was amazing. I love citrusy smelling products, especially when I use them in the morning. I was worried about how the products would make my hair feel, as in the past, Herbal Essences shampoos have left a waxy film on my hair. However, I didn&#x27;t experience that with this line. I use a lot of product and dry shampoo, and I felt the &amp;#34;detoxifying&amp;#34; products really stripped my hair of all of that. I was left with my hair feeling clean, light, and bouncy. I also noticed the lemon helped create a nice shine.  I&#x27;ll definitely keep the shampoo in mind when I need a good detox.  *Disclaimer: I received this bundle for free to test and review.</li>
            <li> I got these products for testing purpose and I have been using them for about a week now. I have noticed my hair get dry faster after I use the shampoo. I have very curly hair that tends to get frizzy pretty fast. The conditioner, I think it really amazing. It sort of covers for the shampoo. But what I like the most out of all the three products is the treatment. It left my hair felling really soft and free. My curls were very defined. All together I think these products are great. And  bonus, they have very light fresh smell..</li>
            <li> I received this product for free to test from Influenster. I was a little hesitant testing this because I am very picky about my hair care. Mostly because I don&#x27;t want greasy hair and since my hair is so long I need a great conditioner for easy care once I get out of the shower. This product exceeded expectations. I am obsessed. I mostly used just the shampoo and conditioner and was more than satisfied. My hair was so soft I felt like I had just left the salon. I literally worked 12 hours, ran a 5k and played with my hair constantly (Its so soft I cannot help myself) and It was still soft as it was when I got out of the shower, smelled great, and most of all..... it wasn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> This set was actually given to me to try out (FREE) from influenster. The sizes were fairly small and I finished them in about 3 days so I felt I couldn&#x27;t give you guys a fair enough review, so I decided to go out and buy the full sizes. Firstly, The shampoo has an amazing smell to it! Super fresh, clean, and utterly addictive. It does clean very well but that&#x27;s about it. The conditioner was very unimpressive, it had a very thick texture to it nothing fancy about it so I would miss this product. The only thing I liked about it was the fresh smell of cassia! On the other hand OMG!!!! You definitely do not want to miss this! I can&#x27;t even begin to explain how amazing the leave in conditioner is. Thank the Heaven Gods for this amazing product. You want to use this maybe once a week, you don&#x27;t want to finish up the magical moments with this product. It&#x27;s super creamy and rich and you want to leave in for about three minutes to let it work it&#x27;s magic. As soon as you rinse this product you can instantly feel the difference in the overall texture in your hair. It leaves your hair shinny, silky, and literally erases all the damage you may have. This product works better than my $30 leave in conditer from a high end brand so it&#x27;s pretty amazing. You definitely do not want to miss this conditioner out!</li>
            <li> I recieved these products compliments of influencer and am so glad I had the opportunity to try them. I have used them several times and really enjoy the light, fresh scents. It was invigorating first thing in the morning! My hair is naturally curly, but I use a flat iron on occasion and usually still have some frizz to my hair. After using the shampoo, conditioner, and deep conditioner I was able to straighten my hair with almost no frizz! I was extremely impressed with the conditioners, my hair was so soft and smooth! I definitely recommend these products!!</li>
            <li> I got this product free to try and review as a member of the influenster team.  The Shampoo:  nice and rick lather, very thick.  Washes easily from my hair and leaves hair feeling clean and fresh.  The scent seemed to last throughout the day.  This shampoo left my hair limp and very hard to style.  The Conditioner: I like the consistency, very rich and silky.  I like the scent.  Leaves my hair too limp.  The Conditioner Treatment:  I did not like the scent.  Made my hair greasy.  Overall the system is ok.  I would like to try some of the other volumizing systems, because my hair is so fine.  The scent is great and I think this would be a good system for people with thicker hair.  I&#x27;m not sure what the detoxifying aspect is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I was sent the bundle to test, I am in my late 40&#x27;s and my hair has changed (as well as everything else LOL) and is very dry. I used the products for about a week, loved the shampoo, it&#x27;s thick and smelled awesome, the conditioner on the other hand not so much. I could only use a couple time. It was thinner than the shampoo, I don&#x27;t get that. I did use the intensive treatment as a daily conditioner and that was better.</li>
            <li> I received my Herbal Essence Wild Naturals complimentary from Influenster. I have dry brittle damaged hair and I absolutely love these products! The shampoo smells great and the conditioner and intense treatment left my hair silky smooth and manageable without weighing my hair down. The scent is very refreshing, not overpowering.  I switched to these products because they make hair looks great!</li>
            <li> I really love this line of products that I received from Influenster to review. The smell is wonderfully invigorating and is the best way to wake up in the morning. I learned my lesson early on about applying the mask and conditioner too close to my scalp, as it became oily 3x faster than usual. Now, I simply work it into my hair about halfway up my strands and that does the trick! I can&#x27;t use very much of the shampoo, because it doesn&#x27;t work very well with my fine hair, I find that it is just too drying. However, I live in a dry climate so the deep conditioner is going to be a great summer staple for me</li>
            <li> I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying kit for free to test and review through influenster. I want to start off by saying this product smells AMAZING! Secondly this product left my hair feeling so clean and refreshed like I just walked out of the salon with a fresh new cut. My hair was so light and shiny and full of bounce. i just cant get over how soft my hair feels. If your looking for a lightweight hair care product I would highly recommend this product. It makes you feel wild and natural!!</li>
            <li> I received this free from Influenster, in exchange for reviewing the products.  I have very fine, dry and treated hair.  I tried the shampoo and loved how it cleaned my hair and smelled so fresh and lemony. I work out daily, work in my garden, camp and hike a lot so I must shampoo often, leading to dry hair.  The conditioner smelled just as good as the shampoo and rinsed out easily. The deep conditioner smelled the same and was very slippery.  I felt like it didn&#x27;t quite rinse out all the way, but that may be from my water softener. I blow dried my hair like usual, and it turned out wonderful! I felt no residue, it was not greasy and it tamed my flyaway, frizzy hair while leaving a light, lemony fragrance.  I feel privileged to have been a part of testing this product and will definitely be buying it.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I was one of the lucky ones chosen to receive this bundle for testing and reviewing purposes from Influenster.  The first thing I was impressed with , was how wonderful the product smelled.  I am a huge &amp;#34;has to smell good in order to put it on my body&amp;#34; type person and this did not disappoint.  The shampoo went on nicely and did the job in one washing (I sometimes have to wash twice in order to get that nice-and-clean feel.  The conditioner has a silky consistency and applied nicely as well.  After rinsing, my hair felt and smelled clean.  No waxy build up feel, just nice and silky soft.  The intensive treatment is thick and I didn&#x27;t like it as well as the conditioner, so I&#x27;ve only used that once.  I feel the conditioner did a nice job by itself that the intensive treatment wasn&#x27;t necessary (For me).  For comparison purposes, I have shoulder length, dry-ish hair.  I use a flat iron and wash my hair 3-4 times a week.  I would definitely recommend these products to others as I was really impressed with the quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I got this product free to test and review and the scent is similar to Bath &amp; Body Works- Kitchen Lemon. I was hesitate at first to use this product because it also reminded me of Clorox wipes but it has left my hair silky and knot free. What I love the most was it left my hair easy to comb after using all 3. I started off with the shampoo and my hair felt dried out, but I still gave it a chance. Next, I used the conditioner and it has a water/liquid consistency but once I used Intensive treatment conditioner it has left my hair smelling fresh and no tangled up hair. The shampoo and conditioner were okay but I would recommend using the Intensive treatment.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive herbal essences wild natural detoxifying kit shampoo,  conditioner,  and intesive treatment free to test. The smell is amazing with that lemon grass scent. All tho it didnt last as long as I would like it too. I loved how thick and foamy the shampoo was when lathering through my hair. After washing out my hair felt really soft even before conditioning.  Even the next morning my hair still felt clean. Which I love.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m not really sure about the &amp;#34;detoxifying&amp;#34; or purifies my hair. I think thats a great way to sell products but I dont really know if it did that to my hair or not.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I received these products free for testing purposes from Influenster. If you would like to receive free products use this link to join: www.influenster.com/r/964848 First, I used the shampoo, then the conditioner. I used the intensive treatment last and let it sit on my hair for a minute or two, then I rinsed it out. It made my hair really soft and it was still soft the next day. The intensive treatment really helped my hair with it being so dry and damaged in this winter weather. The scent was very lemony and basil smelling. It was rejuvenating and fresh, not usually a scent I would choose but it would be nice for a morning shower to help wake you up.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is great, leaves my hair smelling good for days and my hair doesn&#x27;t get as ouly as it does with other shampoo and conditioners. Would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, and I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again when my samples run out. The products smell SO good, and they do a really good job of getting your hair clean and soft. I haven&#x27;t had the chance to test the deep conditioning treatment yet, but if it&#x27;s anything like the shampoo and conditioner I know I&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I am a frequent Herbal Essences user, and I received this package complimentary for review from Influenster.  First off, I LOVED the smell.  I found myself smelling my hair all day because I couldn&#x27;t get enough.  I have never used the Intensive Treatment conditioning before, and I definitely like it.  It states that this detoxifies impurities from your hair; I am not sure how to tell if that is really happening or not, but as for the way my hair smells and feels, I will definitely be purchasing this kind in the future.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get this products for free to test out. I really love the lemon smell of the products. My hair looks and feels great after using the shampoo conditioner and treatment.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I did receive this complimentary to review publicly.  I was not a huge fan of the shampoo or conditioner from herbal essences in the past.  I&#x27;m not sure if they have improved that much, or if it was really just the deep treatment that left my hair with more body, and super smooth.  I have not yet tried to leave the deep treatment out of the routine yet, I might do that next to see if that is truly the difference.  Overall, I used it for a week and have had a good experience.</li>
            <li> I received these products for free to sample and review. My hair is normally dry. I have fine hair, but I have a full head of hair so it can get heavy. I live in the midwest where it is currently cold and dry. I also have to deal with hard water, which takes a toll on my hair. After I use my normal shampoo/conditioner regimine, my hair does have quite a bit of body. It is straight, but has some wave to it. After using this regimine, my hair had no body. I have used it a few times, and the same results occur. I normally let my hair air dry naturally, and I did that each time I used this product as well. Like another reviewer, my hair did seem to dry more quickly than usual. As far as the scent goes, I am really sensitive to fragrance, and I found this to have somewhat of a medicinal smell but leaning towards fruity. It was a light fragrance, and once my hair dried the more medicinal smell went away and left behind the fruity scent. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a citrus smell though. I definitely think if you opt to try these products that you make sure to use all 3. I don&#x27;t think the shampoo and conditioner by themselves would have left my hair as soft as the triple combo did.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary sample of these products for testing purposes. I have used all three of these items now for over a week. I have very fine hair that has little body. The winters where I live can be quite harsh also as a skier and can damage my hair quite a bit. The first thing I noticed when using these products was the scent. I am sensitive to scents due to migraines, but found the fragrance to be quite relaxing. All three products felt quite light, nothing too heavy - but they did the trick. They left my hair soft, my scalp rejuvenated and kept the relaxing fragrance on my hair for hours. I would continue using this product in the future.</li>
            <li> Got this bundle as a try and review from influesnster.com I love how the shampoo and conditioner so that got it one star! But I hated how they made my hair feel! Normally my hair is soft silky and feels close to &amp;#34;bunny fur&amp;#34; (what my husband tells me!) but after a week of using this product I am left dry and borderline brittle!... I started using the third tube with the scalp treatment or conditioning treatment whichever it is and I actually fairly like that product! It has helped with the dryness a bit and I feel somewhat refreshed after using it! They are all very easy to rinse out which I like and those last two reasons have earned it two more stars! I don&#x27;t see myself using these products again after I finish what&#x27;s left but I was not left completely disappointed!</li>
            <li> I received these products in a complimentary trial and have been using them for about a week. My hair is quite fine and tends toward dull and lifeless if I&#x27;m not careful with my hair products. If I don&#x27;t wash daily it becomes oily and wet looking, and my scalp becomes dry and itchy. This herbal essences product has a bright lemon-herb scent during use that remains on my hair for a good part of the day. The shampoo has a good bit of lather and I only need a small amount per wash. The conditioner and treatment keep my hair feeling silky and smooth without weighing it down. I also noticed that I don&#x27;t have as many flyaways as usual, which is wonderful bonus in south Louisiana humidity. My only downside is I still have the itchy scalp that is so hard to get rid of. I would recommend this product and plan to purchase when my trail runs out.</li>
            <li> I love how these products made my hair feel and look. I was not a huge fan of the scent. It reminded me of something from my childhood that I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on,  but overall it was nice.</li>
            <li> First I would like to mention that I received the kit free to sample from Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with a shampoo, conditioner and a deep conditioner all sample size. When i used the product the first time one thing i noticed was the smell! It&#x27;s a nice clean herbal smell that stays long after your hair is dry. My hair type is dry, color treated and thin. The second thing is how thick the shampoo is so a little goes a long way. The conditioner is the opposite, it&#x27;s a little thinner than I&#x27;m used to so I let it sit in my hair for a few minutes even though it does not say too. After I used that conditioner I used the deep conditioner and let that one sit in for the same amount of time. After blow drying my hair I noticed my hair still smelt amazing! My hair wasn&#x27;t weighted down and was very soft. This is a product I would spend money on after my sample is gone :)</li>
            <li> I received the products free via influenster. Firstly  I would like to say that these items smell great. the smells have a very clean and refreshing scent. The shampoo does a great job cleaning hair without all the excess suds. The &amp;#34;intensive treatment&amp;#34; is by far the best, a little goes a long way. I shower at night and in the morning my hair is still shiny and soft without fly aways. Definitely would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got this bundle to review from Influenster as a VoxBox and I am so happy. I was not an Herbal Essence product user until now. I will be buying and using this product on a regular basis. It smells refreshing and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> i was extremely fortunate to recieve this product for a free testing it has been incredibly amazing to use. after the first use i cold tell a huge improvement in my hair. it was a lot softer and smoother and all frizz was gone. even the static that comes with winter times was gone. i also noticed that i was able to go a little longer without having to shampoo my hair i was able to do it every other night and not have oily hair. this product is completely life changing and i highly recommend it. i will be switching to this product. my favorite part has to be the after shower hair brushing and how smooth and easy it was. my brush just glided through it not problems. everyone needs to try out this product !!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product to test and I really liked it. The products left my hair clean and smelling amazing. It is very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. Will definitely be buying this soon!</li>
            <li> I happily received this bundle for free to test &amp; review as i&#x27;m already a loyal herbal essences user. I typically use the volumizing collection. I loved the smell of the shampoo,  hints of Peppermint &amp;  gave that cool tingly feeling. Hair definitely felt clean after rinsing. No leftover oils or residue feeling what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner wasn&#x27;t quite as appealing. Hair turned out nice and soft but the smell was nowhere near as good. Kinda like that lingering chemical smell in the air when you walk into an average Salon.  I had the same issue with the intensive treatment. The smell got worse. My hair feels very clean and extremely soft but sitting here as my hair dries all I can smell is this chemical like stench like I just had some major dye work done at a cheap Salon. Other than that it&#x27;s not a bad product. I&#x27;d give it five stars if the smell didn&#x27;t make me wanna go rewash my hair.</li>
            <li> I received this set of products free through Influenster for testing and reviewing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had these for about a week now.  My hair is very fine and extremely limp. It has no body and I don&#x27;t bother to style it anymore because it just doesn&#x27;t hold.  This first thing I noticed was the smell of the product.  It has a very strong smell of lemon and basil.  I really liked the smell in the shower and I could smell it on my hair for a long time afterwards.  I washed with the shampoo and it had a good amount of lather without being too much as some other shampoos are.  I rinsed immediately after lathering and working it into my scalp.  Then I used the conditioner which had a good texture without being too heavy.  I did the same by working it into my hair/scalp and then rinsing immediately.  I then used the treatment which had a nice texture as well.  I did exactly the same process of massaging it into my scalp and rinsing it.  I usually only use shampoo so this is a lot more steps than I am used to.  My hair normally runs fairly dry.  I liked the overall effect it had on my hair.  I usually have a ton of static electricity in the winter with flyaways.  This product reduced them to a very minimal.  I also noticed that I did not have to brush my hair as much during the day as usual.  It always gets straggly looking throughout the day and I am constantly brushing it.  It stayed smoother much longer and I only had to brush it a time or two at work.  The only thing I did not like was that the conditioner and/or treatment left the very top of my head near my part feeling and looking a bit oily.  Overall a great product line and I will most likely purchase this but will probably only use the shampoo and conditioner during the winter.  The whole process was a bit too much for my hair and I will probably just use the shampoo during the spring and summer months.</li>
            <li> First things first, I received this set free to test and review, from Influenster. (Which was actually really exciting, to be honest.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened this box the first thing I noticed was the scent, which was AMAZING. Just the scent got me pumped to try this out. When you pop the cap the scent is very lemon-y and you may hesitate. &#x27;Do I want this much lemon in my life?&#x27; You do, though, you totally do. Take the plunge. The lemon fades into the rest of the scents and evens out into the amazing smell I was just talking about. And it lasts. Ladies (or gentleman, or human people reading this review), you will have other ladies (or gentleman, or human people) sneaking sniffs of your awesome hair and wondering where you got your shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried when I first got it, because there are 2 conditioners. My hair gets oily fairly quickly, so I generally avoid conditioner altogether. But I need not have been concerned, after using all 3 products my hair was actually less oily the next morning than normal. The conditioner also seems to have put a serious dent in all my static and frizz. Running my brush through it released no furious crackles of static electricity like it normally does. My hair also feels softer and there&#x27;s no frizz &#x27;fro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would definitely recommend this set of products. I liked them a lot, 10/10, will use again.</li>
            <li> I received these products to test for free from Influenster. I usually don&#x27;t use hair products unless they&#x27;re from the salon, but I figured I&#x27;d give these a try. I&#x27;ve used them twice so far.  I like the smell of them, the shampoo lathers nicely and rinses well. I have long, straight hair and it seemed to work fine on my hair.  I usually only wash my hair once or twice a week and these seemed to keep my hair pretty clean inbetween washington.  I liked the conditioner and deep conditioner too, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll stray from my salon products.</li>
            <li> This review is based on a free sample I received in a voxbox of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying shampoo, conditioner, and intensive treatment through my influenster membership.&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I am a hair care snob.  I only buy top of the line toiletries and appliances for my hair.  I have uneven wavy hair and straighten my hair every day.  I also have my hair colored at a salon using the most natural ingredient hair color line that I could find.&lt;br /&gt;I was not overly excited to really sample this product, since I am not a drugstore brand user of hair products, but I was obligated, so I did.  The smell is actually quite refreshing and invigorating, I always prefer citrus smelling products, so that was a pleasant surprise. Next, the shampoo lathers rather nicely, and the conditioner was great for detangling.  After blow drying my hair straight to see the results, the entire regimen left my hair feeling very light and squeaky clean.  I did feel like it stripped my hair color a bit, making it lighter.  I am covering up grays, so that isn’t really ideal.&lt;br /&gt;Due to my concern with the stripping of hair color, I would not use this product again.  However, if I didn’t color my hair, I would use this product about 2-3 times/month as a break from your normal hair care routine to spruce things up.  I do not think it is an ideal every day product.</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing and review processes only. I&#x27;ve had these 2 products for a week and before trying them out my hair was not soft. It was dry and dull. Once I started using these products I noticed my hair was starting to get shinier and it wasn&#x27;t as dry as before after only a couple of uses. After using these products for over a week my hair feels softer and has more volume now! It feels healthier and it smells nice too! I recommend using this product if you have dry and damaged hair that needs some reviving! It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> It left my hair clean, smells fab and fresh. What&#x27;s not to love?!</li>
            <li> I received this system for free to test out and I found that I really enjoyed using it. I used the deep conditioner separately with another shampoo and it was nice and lightweight, yet conditioning enough for my shoulder length, fine hair. The shampoo and conditioner used together left my hair very clean and not weighed down. The smell is fresh and lemony, but not too overpowering and didn&#x27;t linger that much once my hair air dried. I like the normal herbal essence line and love the idea of the naturals line as well. I think that for this price range, these products are pretty effective. I do think that someone with longer hair may need a heavier conditioner or an added product post-shower to fully detangle their hair, but for shorter or less tangle prone hair types, this system is perfect!</li>
            <li> After receiving the Wild Naturals Detoxifying Collection (as a complimentary sample pack for reviewing purposes) I was pleasantly surprised.  My first impression was that they all smell great!  The shampoo had a gentle, but effective the detoxifying element.  Many clarifying shampoos (even major salon brands) tend to be very harsh and leave your hair feeling unappealing.  This shampoo had a sufficient clarifying effect without the downsides.  As other reviewers mentioned a lack of later, that didn&#x27;t bother me in fact I think lather is a sign of harsh chemicals.  The conditioner in this collection is light and made my hair feel soft, without weighing it down. I didn&#x27;t notice a marked difference after using the intensive treatment.  It wasn&#x27;t bad, just not a &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I received this kit to try for free from Influenster. I enjoyed the shampoo- it worked well and smelt wonderful. The conditioner was a bit disappointing, it covered poorly and didn&#x27;t do much. I loved the intensive cream, though. It brought life to my hair without weighing it down or making it greasy, which is a big deal as my hair is thin and dry at the ends- it really revived it! Overall I really enjoyed this kit!</li>
            <li> I received these from Influenster for free to try out and review them. First I have fine curly/ wavy hair so find a set that works is hard and can be expensive. As soon as I got them i smelled them and i loved the smell right away. When i tried the shampoo i could feel it super clean, but because i also have a sensitive scalp after a few uses it did begin to irritate it. the conditioner was amazing, mine was a little watery compared to my regular conditioner, but it left my hair super soft and clean. the intensive treatment was really good, i found it to be best if you just use it once a week as opposed to 2 to 3 times a week. it leaves your hair soft, shiny, and frizz free, but it will leave your hair kind of dull after a few days. I would say give it a try.</li>
            <li> I received this bundle free to test and review. First of all if you are looking for something that is actually completely natural, this is not that. It does have a few natural ingredients but otherwise is your standard chemical filled product. They do seem to work well and like they are supposed to. The shampoo left my hair very clean and without buildup. My hair is short so I use a lot of product and this seemed to give me a fresh start. My itchy scalp issue was gone. The conditioner worked as expected  as well. It is very lightweight and wont leave hair feel coated. My hair was soft and had volume. The deep treatment worked well on my lightened pieces of hair that have damage. You just shampoo in the shower like you normally would then apply and leave on for at least 5 minutes. You can use that time to shave your legs or exfoliate. As I mentioned my hair is short and very healthy overall so I feel like I cant give the intense treatment as good of a critique. Overall good products, wish they didnt that SLS and other chemicals.</li>
            <li> I used this for about a week and what I loved about it was that it smells awesome- not your typical herbal essences scent- a little more subtle. My hair was soft and healthy looking afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I didn&#x27;t love about this is that the conditioner is really watery. I couldn&#x27;t get a good coating on my hair- it just kinda slops out of your hands when you&#x27;re trying to put it in your hair. What it doesn&#x27;t do, the intensive hair mask (step 3) makes up for.</li>
            <li> I recently received this bundle free to test and review, and it couldn&#x27;t have come at a better time. I try to switch up my shampoos and conditioners each time I run out and my current brand was running low. My hair is really dry and static-y this time of year because of the cold winter months, but this gave my hair the boost it needed! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying the full sizes. I&#x27;ve tried just the Shampoo and Conditioner and it totally takes care of my static problems and really makes my hair shine. The Intensive Treatment though really helps lock in moisture and take care of all of my dry split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really love the freshness of this scent. I&#x27;m used to flowery/perfume scents. The Thai Lemon Basil is surprisingly refreshing. My husband even noticed it and how much he liked the new scent.</li>
            <li> I recently received this product free to test and review and absolutely love it!!! I have long, naturally blond hair and usually have an issue keeping volume. I used the bundle all together as directed and not only was my hair soft and smooth but I had more volume than ever. I also noticed that some brassiness had come out of my blond locks, always a plus! The lemon scent is very refreshing and I would recommend this product for sure! Very happy :)</li>
            <li> I received this set of products free through Influenster for testing and reviewing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the idea of a detox for your hair--much like bodies and mind, hair needs it too! First off, the smell is lovely. Don&#x27;t be&lt;br /&gt; put off by the name &#x27;lemon basil It&#x27;s light, fresh, citrusy and you really can smell it throughout the day. I really think this is the best smell of all the other new Wild Natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo and conditioner are great. My hair is soft, less frizzy and more manageable. My hair has been unhappy with the change over from winter to spring, but this really helps. I absolutely LOVE the intensive treatment! I am constantly looking for treatments/conditioners to help my limp, frizzy ends. And this works SO well! I wish it came in a gigantic size! The smell again is lovely, and my ends feel silky smooth. Whenever I use it my hair as a whole looks so much healthier. I think this may be my go-to hair treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall super happy with the detoxifying line, cant wait to get the full size!</li>
            <li> I received complimentary samples of Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Collection to test and review.  The products smell great and left my hair feeling light, smooth, and really clean!  I will likely purchase more to add to my hair care routine!  The shampoo and conditioner were fairly light, which is great for my fine, thin hair.  I especially loved that the intensive treatment did not leave my hair greasy or weighed down as many such treatments usually do.  I do recommend using these products together, but I will likely alternate at least every other day with a volumizing shampoo and conditioner for my particular hair type and needs.  But I do love the smell and the fresh, light, soft feeling of my hair after using!</li>
            <li> I received this product as a voxbox for free to test and review. When I opened the package I was a little hesitant because I despise the smell of lemon but oh my gosh I was wrong!!!  This is the most incredible smelling product I have used and will definitely be going to purchase full size bottles of this product line. I have fine, oily hair that gets flaky looking when I don&#x27;t get all my hair products (hair spray) out in the shower. This product line did an amazing job at cleaning my hair with only one wash and rinse. I also have a lot of trouble with conditioners weighing down my hair and causing it to be super oily. The conditioner and intense repair was fantastic! I will be recommending this product to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free trial and overall great product, love the smell, my hair feels clean and light. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was so happy and excited to receive this bundle for free from Influenster!  I have a love/hate relationship with clarifying/detox shampoos, so I was ready to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;Scent: Pleasant and floral/herbal, and very strong.  I don&#x27;t usually use products with very strong scents, so this was a big change for me.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: Typical shampoo/conditioner bottles/tubes.  Good-sized so that the product flows out easily, but small enough to bring for travel or if you&#x27;re only using it once a week or for a 1 week detox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product testing.  For reference, I have shoulder-length, straight, fine hair.  Used DAILY for 7 days.&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo: Good clarifying shampoo that definitely cleaned away styling product and other hair product residue.  My hair didn&#x27;t feel overly stripped afterwards, but it was definitely &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean.&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner: Good, lightweight conditioner.  I only apply to the middle/ends and never to the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Treatment: Thicker, creamer, for more intense treatment of damaged ends, or in this case, to re-moisturize the ends after using the clarifying shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: GREAT results.  I styled my hair as usual afterwards with a spray-in texurizer, and blowout spray.  My hair was shiny and felt soft, while my scalp felt cleaner .&lt;br /&gt;Days 2-3: Still good to great results.&lt;br /&gt;Days 4-6: Starting to feel weighed down, and my scalp is starting to compensate for the daily clarifying shampoo use by producing more oil.  Styling is getting more challenging.&lt;br /&gt;Day 7: Last day (today).  My hair looks great, but feels weighed down.  It&#x27;s 11am and I feel the oil ;-)&lt;br /&gt;**Note** I don&#x27;t usually use clarifying shampoos for so many days in a row, but for testing/feedback purposes, I felt obliged to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely use this again, but not as a daily regimen.  The clarifying shampoo is awesome and I plan to use it once every 5-10 days to detox, and I&#x27;ll use the conditioner and Intensive Treatment with it.  I&#x27;ll also use the intensive treatment as a mask on my ends when needed to treat any dryness from blowdrying or ironing.  I love that the system is available as a bundle - they&#x27;re worth having on hand if you do any traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!  Thank you, Herbal Essences and Voxbox/Influenster!</li>
