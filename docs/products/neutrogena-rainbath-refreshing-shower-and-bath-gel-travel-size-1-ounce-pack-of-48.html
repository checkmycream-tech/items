            <li>I do rinse a bit more thoroughly since I don&#x27;t like feeling any residue.  </li>

            <li>Unlike most of gel showers</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve look at many stores for this product even the Company.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this.</li>
            <li>my favorite bath/shower gel.</li>
            <li>We love the fragrance and the ease of use.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>It helps my skin more than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used Neutrogena products for many years, and this is one of our favorites.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena products</li>
            <li>I think here I got a better deal.</li>
            <li>Nice product, makes me feel clean.</li>
            <li>The smell, the easy application and the smooth feeling afterwards is just perfect for me (male).</li>
            <li>Good product and very convenient purchase</li>
            <li>Love this larger size of the product and at a great price</li>
            <li>Might be a tad too strong for some though.</li>
            <li>Product is high quality and bottle size is good for handling and storage.</li>
            <li>use several squirts of this refreshing product and float away in your very own spa-like bath &lt;</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good body wash, it leaves your skin feeling nice and fresh, and the scent is pretty enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She fell in love with Neutrogena Rainbath the very first time she used it.</li>
            <li>This has a very nice and refreshing smell that lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was so nice to have this large bottle reliably resident in the shower...</li>
            <li>While vacationing in Alaska, we stayed in a fabulous Bed and  </li>
            <li>The appealing scent is distinctive ...  somewhat spicy and fresh.</li>
            <li>I remember my Grandmama using this and see why she liked it so much.</li>
            <li>I kept one bottle of a nice hotel in Hawaii, as it is a nice memory for our wedding holidays back in 96.</li>
            <li>It does not leave any perfumey or mediciney residue, just clean smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena products are almost always high quality and effective as described.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a larger version available, which may be more cost effective.  </li>
            <li>Many years ago I first saw the Neutrogena Rainbath during our Holiday trip in the US.</li>
            <li>(I wish they had the 32 ounce in the original scent.)</li>
            <li>and I notice my skin has been looking more and more moisturized and healthy than ever, especially my legs.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used this bath gel before, you just HAVE to try it because after your shower it leaves the whole bathroom smelling like sweet spring rains!!</li>
            <li>Rinses clean.</li>
            <li>An old favorite!</li>
            <li>Its very gentle to the skin that I even blend it with my facial cleanser to make my face smell great.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely scent, and it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li>Price is only fair.</li>
            <li>Its a bit sweet and perfumey and the consistency if just</li>
            <li>It gets you clean without leaving residue, though your skin does feel somewhat more refreshed than having just used a soap block or more traditional bodywash.</li>
            <li>I feel fresh and extremely clean all over.</li>
            <li>but if you want to smell clean and fresh, this is the one to go for.</li>
            <li>This smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Absolutely clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I love this body wash, but Walgreen&#x27;s in my area is starting to eliminate it from stock so I am glad to have a source.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting since Christmas, wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Good for skin that is dry from lots of time in a pool.</li>
            <li>Today I am very pleased that I finally found the exact product as I remembered it.</li>
            <li>Old formula was fantastic!</li>
            <li>On a trip to Germany in August, our hotel had complimentary Neutrogena products in the bath.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>- it has a lovely, spicy and powdery scent, cleanses my skin and leaves me soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>It leaves her skin clean and soft, and the light fragrance is not over-powering.</li>
            <li>this is so mild and refreshing at the same time.</li>
            <li>Used this for a long time and still loving it.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel soft AND clean, unlike many other mosturizing cleansers.  </li>
            <li>Original smells more like expensive fragrance, leaves very nice soft feeling.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Love it wish I got a bigger size</li>
            <li>I love that this still smells exactly the same way it did 25 years ago</li>
            <li>Im about to buy it for the first time on amazon although Ive been using it for years just buying it from drugstores like Walgreens.  </li>
            <li>But the price is always higher so for 16 oz</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find it after so many years of using other products and having forgotten my once favorite soap of choice.   </li>
            <li>some other reviewers mentioned, I do find that it takes quite a bit of the gel to get a nice lather, which would have made this a 5 star product.</li>
            <li>have tried many brands from expensive French soaps to organic vegan brands and by far this gives me the best of everything</li>
            <li>I plan on keeping a large &lt;br /&gt;bottle in our guest bath.  </li>
            <li>so I tried this shower gel based on the reviews and it certainly lives up to its reputation.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try, and really like it.</li>
            <li>pump style makes it much easier to use&lt;br /&gt;Lasts</li>
            <li>/&gt;or use it in your shower for velvety soft and fresh smelling skin</li>
            <li>Pump is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>It came promptly and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>more soap slivers, dropped bars, slipping on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It also does not lather up as much as many other shower gels.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really the main reason I HAVE to have it, just for the lingering scent it gives off....</li>
            <li>pump releases a bit too much in a full squirt, but that&#x27;s just personal preference!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not into bath gels but would highly recommend Neutrogena&#x27;s --</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>This product is 100% identical with the old original as I remember it for the last 20 years.</li>
            <li>Clean Fresh Body wash that last all day long.  </li>
            <li>Smells gorgeous and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I acquired a few little bottles from a hotel and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin as does my daughter and</li>
            <li>The aroma is heavenly and it leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>Some reviews state that the smell is different and obviously with a sweater fragrance than the original product.</li>
            <li>(man, am I getting old)!</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin so soft</li>
            <li>My wife has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It has the old Neutrogena scent, but doesn&#x27;t linger</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and this product doesn&#x27;t rile up my Rosacea at bath time.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon for a reasonable price, in both the 8 and 16 ounce sizes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved the original Rainbath gel for a long time, but it&#x27;s been very hard to find lately in my area (Mid-Atlantic Seaboard).  </li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin AND live in Southern Cali, and the water here is super hard and very drying!</li>
            <li>It rinses clean in any water, hard or soft.</li>
            <li>Bought it for myself and can&#x27;t believe how adult I suddenly feel.</li>
            <li>I like the characteristic Neutrogena scent and find it keeps my skin soft, too.</li>

            <li> use several squirts of this refreshing product and float away in your very own spa-like bath &lt;</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good body wash, it leaves your skin feeling nice and fresh, and the scent is pretty enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She fell in love with Neutrogena Rainbath the very first time she used it.</li>
            <li> This has a very nice and refreshing smell that lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was so nice to have this large bottle reliably resident in the shower...</li>
            <li> While vacationing in Alaska, we stayed in a fabulous Bed and  </li>
            <li> The appealing scent is distinctive ...  somewhat spicy and fresh.</li>
            <li> I remember my Grandmama using this and see why she liked it so much.</li>
            <li> I kept one bottle of a nice hotel in Hawaii, as it is a nice memory for our wedding holidays back in 96.</li>
            <li> It does not leave any perfumey or mediciney residue, just clean smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena products are almost always high quality and effective as described.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a larger version available, which may be more cost effective.  </li>
            <li> Many years ago I first saw the Neutrogena Rainbath during our Holiday trip in the US.</li>
            <li> (I wish they had the 32 ounce in the original scent.)</li>
            <li> and I notice my skin has been looking more and more moisturized and healthy than ever, especially my legs.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used this bath gel before, you just HAVE to try it because after your shower it leaves the whole bathroom smelling like sweet spring rains!!</li>
            <li> Rinses clean.</li>
            <li> An old favorite!</li>
            <li> Its very gentle to the skin that I even blend it with my facial cleanser to make my face smell great.</li>
            <li> It has a lovely scent, and it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li> Price is only fair.</li>
            <li> Its a bit sweet and perfumey and the consistency if just</li>
            <li> It gets you clean without leaving residue, though your skin does feel somewhat more refreshed than having just used a soap block or more traditional bodywash.</li>
            <li> I feel fresh and extremely clean all over.</li>
            <li> but if you want to smell clean and fresh, this is the one to go for.</li>
            <li> This smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Absolutely clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I love this body wash, but Walgreen&#x27;s in my area is starting to eliminate it from stock so I am glad to have a source.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting since Christmas, wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Good for skin that is dry from lots of time in a pool.</li>
            <li> Today I am very pleased that I finally found the exact product as I remembered it.</li>
            <li> Old formula was fantastic!</li>
            <li> On a trip to Germany in August, our hotel had complimentary Neutrogena products in the bath.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> - it has a lovely, spicy and powdery scent, cleanses my skin and leaves me soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> It leaves her skin clean and soft, and the light fragrance is not over-powering.</li>
            <li> this is so mild and refreshing at the same time.</li>
            <li> Used this for a long time and still loving it.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel soft AND clean, unlike many other mosturizing cleansers.  </li>
            <li> Original smells more like expensive fragrance, leaves very nice soft feeling.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love it wish I got a bigger size</li>
            <li> I love that this still smells exactly the same way it did 25 years ago</li>
            <li> Im about to buy it for the first time on amazon although Ive been using it for years just buying it from drugstores like Walgreens.  </li>
            <li> But the price is always higher so for 16 oz</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find it after so many years of using other products and having forgotten my once favorite soap of choice.   </li>
            <li> some other reviewers mentioned, I do find that it takes quite a bit of the gel to get a nice lather, which would have made this a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> have tried many brands from expensive French soaps to organic vegan brands and by far this gives me the best of everything</li>
            <li> I plan on keeping a large &lt;br /&gt;bottle in our guest bath.  </li>
            <li> so I tried this shower gel based on the reviews and it certainly lives up to its reputation.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try, and really like it.</li>
            <li> pump style makes it much easier to use&lt;br /&gt;Lasts</li>
            <li> /&gt;or use it in your shower for velvety soft and fresh smelling skin</li>
            <li> Pump is very convenient.  </li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> It came promptly and was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> more soap slivers, dropped bars, slipping on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It also does not lather up as much as many other shower gels.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really the main reason I HAVE to have it, just for the lingering scent it gives off....</li>
            <li> pump releases a bit too much in a full squirt, but that&#x27;s just personal preference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into bath gels but would highly recommend Neutrogena&#x27;s --</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> This product is 100% identical with the old original as I remember it for the last 20 years.</li>
            <li> Clean Fresh Body wash that last all day long.  </li>
            <li> Smells gorgeous and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I acquired a few little bottles from a hotel and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin as does my daughter and</li>
            <li> The aroma is heavenly and it leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> Some reviews state that the smell is different and obviously with a sweater fragrance than the original product.</li>
            <li> (man, am I getting old)!</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin so soft</li>
            <li> My wife has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It has the old Neutrogena scent, but doesn&#x27;t linger</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this product doesn&#x27;t rile up my Rosacea at bath time.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon for a reasonable price, in both the 8 and 16 ounce sizes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved the original Rainbath gel for a long time, but it&#x27;s been very hard to find lately in my area (Mid-Atlantic Seaboard).  </li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin AND live in Southern Cali, and the water here is super hard and very drying!</li>
            <li> It rinses clean in any water, hard or soft.</li>
            <li> Bought it for myself and can&#x27;t believe how adult I suddenly feel.</li>
            <li> I like the characteristic Neutrogena scent and find it keeps my skin soft, too.</li>
            <li> right not too watery but not too thick either.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling clean with nothing left behind.</li>
            <li> I have completely stop using my other bath wash.</li>
            <li> Pump is a little hard to manage in the shower and get onto the body pouf easily but no biggie.</li>
            <li> Convenient package and enough to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember if the first order came individually boxed, but this order arrived in a plastic bag packed with a few other things I ordered.  </li>
            <li> After 3 attempts with the same disappointment, I am going to stop buying, as now as it is just OK.</li>
            <li> Not a huge problem, but definitely a pain in the butt, and major irritant.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn’t make me too dry.</li>
            <li> I only gave it four stars because it smelled a little manly.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Rainbath for my very picky teenage daughter who dislikes Dove (smells yacky) and Olay (feels weird).</li>
            <li> My hotel samples are now empty, so Here I am today having found it on Amazon and ordering it now.</li>
            <li> The price is half that of the local stores and this size is larger than the usual.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way ..</li>
            <li> No soapy residue feeling, not even tight dry skin.</li>
            <li> The handling during the shipping process caused the pump to be depressed a number of times resulting in soap inside the plastic bag which then leaked onto the other stuff in my shipment.</li>
            <li> matter what other shower gel</li>
            <li> 16 oz bottle lasted me for half a year.</li>
            <li> think it was less drying for my skin, too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find a decent soap for the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The problem arose because a. the plastic bag was not sealed as tightly as it could have been, and b.</li>
            <li> Nothing damaged, just lost a little soap, and my patience.</li>
            <li> but I held the collar firmly in place while turning the pump</li>
            <li> We have been using Neutrogena Rain Bath in the shower for over 5 years and through cold Wisconsin winters where skin drys out easily from the cold dry air.  </li>
            <li> When it changed, first I thought it was maybe a bad batch.</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that it&#x27;s a little difficult to rinse off, almost like using water from a softener.</li>
            <li> I realize that I am coming to the party a little late as this product has been on the market for years.  </li>
            <li> When I finally found it, I found the smaller size only at an outrageous price.</li>
            <li> Was not sure what to expect with the fragrance, but I quite like it!</li>
            <li> A little expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately in my home country the product was not available.</li>
            <li> It was broken when I received it</li>
            <li> A bit expensive</li>
            <li> Too bad I have to continue using the Olay body wash...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love love love this gel. the smell is amazing. Will keep buying for sure...</li>
            <li> Used this for a long time and still loving it.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Keeps my skin so soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Neurtrogena&#x27;s Rainbath Gel for its easy rinsibility (sp). I&#x27;m not into bath gels but would highly recommend Neutrogena&#x27;s -- always lives up to its reputation!</li>
            <li> I love their body oil but this smells way too much like fly spray to be enjoyable (I do have an acute sense of smell so you may find it OK). It also does not lather up as much as many other shower gels.</li>
            <li> Scrubby with the rich lather, great smell, wonderous when you shave your legs. Long lasting since Christmas, wonderful product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> We have been using Neutrogena Rain Bath in the shower for over 5 years and through cold Wisconsin winters where skin drys out easily from the cold dry air.  It does not leave any perfumey or mediciney residue, just clean smooth skin. There is no residue left on the shower enclosure either.</li>
            <li> Good product and very convenient purchase</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this product. It leaves a very pleasant fragrance after shower. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Reorder. Excellent product.  I can&#x27;t remember if the first order came individually boxed, but this order arrived in a plastic bag packed with a few other things I ordered.  The problem arose because a. the plastic bag was not sealed as tightly as it could have been, and b. the pump was not immobilized. The handling during the shipping process caused the pump to be depressed a number of times resulting in soap inside the plastic bag which then leaked onto the other stuff in my shipment. Not a huge problem, but definitely a pain in the butt, and major irritant. Nothing damaged, just lost a little soap, and my patience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered the Rainbath Gel 3x now.  The gel works well for me with my hairy bod.  I do rinse a bit more thoroughly since I don&#x27;t like feeling any residue.  My wife has sensitive skin and she doesn&#x27;t mind the gel either.  I use a sponge to apply.  The design of the bottle is quite attractive and makes a nice addition to our bath. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There is a larger version available, which may be more cost effective.  I haven&#x27;t seen it on Amazon for a while.</li>
            <li> I acquired a few little bottles from a hotel and it worked great.  I only gave it four stars because it smelled a little manly.  My legs were never smoother though and it didn&#x27;t break out my skin like most gels.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used this bath gel before, you just HAVE to try it because after your shower it leaves the whole bathroom smelling like sweet spring rains!! That&#x27;s really the main reason I HAVE to have it, just for the lingering scent it gives off.... well, that &amp; it&#x27;s silkiness... you will love it!</li>
            <li> I used to use Neutrogena bar soap, then years ago switched to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s almond. I decided to give this a try, and really like it. It has the old Neutrogena scent, but doesn&#x27;t linger so you smell like soap all day. My only criticism is that it&#x27;s a little difficult to rinse off, almost like using water from a softener.</li>
            <li> Been using this for over years now and it&#x27;s the only thing that I will use. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> An old favorite! Good for skin that is dry from lots of time in a pool.</li>
            <li> I am so loving my Neutrogena Rainbath Gel. I have been using it ever since it arrived, and could not be happier with the purchase. I have completely stop using my other bath wash. I feel fresh and extremely clean all over. No soapy residue feeling, not even tight dry skin. Just love love love.</li>
            <li> I loved this gel from the day it debuted many years ago. Thankfully, the scent is the same, rather like Neutrogena soap. The pump is nice on the tub ledge and the gel works great in the shower, too. It rinses clean in any water, hard or soft. I like to follow it up with the Neutrogena sesame oil for the body. Great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter what other shower gel I try, I just keep coming back to this. I like the characteristic Neutrogena scent and find it keeps my skin soft, too.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this. Rinses clean. Pump is a little hard to manage in the shower and get onto the body pouf easily but no biggie.</li>
            <li> Many years ago I first saw the Neutrogena Rainbath during our Holiday trip in the US. I was very pleased about its smothness and smell. I kept one bottle of a nice hotel in Hawaii, as it is a nice memory for our wedding holidays back in 96. Since then I was looking for this product. Unfortunately in my home country the product was not available. Today I am very pleased that I finally found the exact product as I remembered it. The smell, the easy application and the smooth feeling afterwards is just perfect for me (male). I highly recommend the product. I also purchased the soap bars. Some reviews state that the smell is different and obviously with a sweater fragrance than the original product. This product is 100% identical with the old original as I remember it for the last 20 years. Just give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret your decision.</li>
            <li> While vacationing in Alaska, we stayed in a fabulous Bed and  &lt;br /&gt;Breakfast that had giant sizes of Neutrogena Rainbath shower gel. &lt;br /&gt;I remembered how much I liked it and how refreshing it is. When &lt;br /&gt;I returned home, I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores so finally I found &lt;br /&gt;it online.   I love the outdoor smell.  I plan on keeping a large &lt;br /&gt;bottle in our guest bath.  Thank you for stocking it!</li>
            <li> Ever since discovering this product a couple of years ago, it&#x27;s become a staple in my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Rich soothing county club-esque scent&lt;br /&gt;Scent is unisex&lt;br /&gt;The pump style makes it much easier to use&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a while (a couple of months of daily use)&lt;br /&gt;Great lather&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;The pump releases a bit too much in a full squirt, but that&#x27;s just personal preference!</li>
            <li> Old formula was fantastic! I would not be without it! When it changed, first I thought it was maybe a bad batch. After 3 attempts with the same disappointment, I am going to stop buying, as now as it is just OK.</li>
            <li> On a trip to Germany in August, our hotel had complimentary Neutrogena products in the bath.  I was surprised to find it after so many years of using other products and having forgotten my once favorite soap of choice.   I love its smell...not floral, not artifically spice, Just neutrogena.  It made my skin feel great. My hotel samples are now empty, so Here I am today having found it on Amazon and ordering it now.</li>
            <li> use several squirts of this refreshing product and float away in your very own spa-like bath &lt;br /&gt;or use it in your shower for velvety soft and fresh smelling skin</li>
            <li> I used this gel at a friend&#x27;s house and had to have some.  Very wonderful fragrance - leaves your skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> This order of Rainbath arrived on time &amp; in good shape. I have been using&lt;br /&gt;this product for 10 years as my bath soap. My skin would feel lost if I&lt;br /&gt;could not use this product when taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;R A Y</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product.  It is a cross between floral and spicy, unlike anything else.  I realize that I am coming to the party a little late as this product has been on the market for years.  What a great discovery!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved the original Rainbath gel for a long time, but it&#x27;s been very hard to find lately in my area (Mid-Atlantic Seaboard).  When I finally found it, I found the smaller size only at an outrageous price. Even so, I bought it, but when I returned to purchase it again, the store no longer carried it. Needless to say, I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon for a reasonable price, in both the 8 and 16 ounce sizes. (I wish they had the 32 ounce in the original scent.) I love the way it makes my skin feel soft AND clean, unlike many other mosturizing cleansers.  The appealing scent is distinctive ...  somewhat spicy and fresh.</li>
            <li> FABULOUS! Smells gorgeous and a little goes a long way! A bit expensive but if you want to smell clean and fresh, this is the one to go for. I would definitely buy it again - just make sure no-one else in the house uses it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to use a Neutrogena product that didn&#x27;t seem to be well made and functional. Rainbath has a pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t over powering like some bodywashes have, and it lathers nicely with a washcloth or bodywash puff. It gets you clean without leaving residue, though your skin does feel somewhat more refreshed than having just used a soap block or more traditional bodywash.</li>
            <li> Unlike most of gel showers Original smells more like expensive fragrance, leaves very nice soft feeling. 16 oz bottle lasted me for half a year.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash, but Walgreen&#x27;s in my area is starting to eliminate it from stock so I am glad to have a source.  Good service Amazon!</li>
            <li> Clean Fresh Body wash that last all day long.  I&#x27;ve look at many stores for this product even the Company.  Amazon seems to have the best price.  Love it.  A Good ole&#x27; Country City Boy from Columbus, Ohio</li>
            <li> My favorite bath gel!! I love it!</li>
            <li> Worth the price. I use four squirts on a bath cloth and a bottle last about 60 days of daily showers. Twice daily showers once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> This has a very nice and refreshing smell that lasts for a long time. Might be a tad too strong for some though. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and my g/f loves it.</li>
            <li> Rain bath soap from nutrogena is one of thier best products in my opinion. The smell while strong is nice and soothing. Nothing else smells like this. It leaves your skin feeling clean with nothing left behind. Great for the bath or shower.</li>
            <li> Nice smell. A little expensive.</li>
            <li> Pump is very convenient.  I have sensitive skin, and this product doesn&#x27;t rile up my Rosacea at bath time.  Lathers quite well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Neutrogena products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> It was broken when I received it</li>
            <li> The original shower gel is the best. It cleans and rinses off well. Its real great when you use a bath sponge and brush. Even in 2014, getting this shower gel as a gift is a treat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for years.  It works great!!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this stuff, gets nice a soapy</li>
            <li> Love this larger size of the product and at a great price</li>
            <li> Love it. I always use it. It has a lovely scent, and it&#x27;s gentle.</li>
            <li> Love it wish I got a bigger size</li>
            <li> Really like this product. Smells wonderful and works great.</li>
            <li> It came promptly and was packaged very well. This product is the best. I swear by Neutrogena Rainbath. I have very sensitive skin as does my daughter and this is so mild and refreshing at the same time.</li>
            <li> This smells fresh and clean. Had a problem opening the pump but I held the collar firmly in place while turning the pump and it popped up finally. Disaster averted. The price is half that of the local stores and this size is larger than the usual.</li>
            <li> I love that this still smells exactly the same way it did 25 years ago (man, am I getting old)! *lol*</li>
            <li> Absolutely clean and fresh.  Great value on this item as part of Subscribe &amp; Save, too!</li>
            <li> I got used to the fragrance, and have used it up.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking of ordering some more.&lt;br /&gt;It was so nice to have this large bottle reliably resident in the shower...&lt;br /&gt;No more soap slivers, dropped bars, slipping on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;I think it was less drying for my skin, too.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good body wash, it leaves your skin feeling nice and fresh, and the scent is pretty enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some other reviewers mentioned, I do find that it takes quite a bit of the gel to get a nice lather, which would have made this a 5 star product.</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin AND live in Southern Cali, and the water here is super hard and very drying! It&#x27;s difficult to find a decent soap for the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many brands from expensive French soaps to organic vegan brands and by far this gives me the best of everything - it has a lovely, spicy and powdery scent, cleanses my skin and leaves me soft and fresh. Great for shaving and exfoliating - my feet are silky smooth now! I remember my Grandmama using this and see why she liked it so much. I even use it to wash my hair and have had great results. Doesn&#x27;t leave me with burning or itching and I notice my skin has been looking more and more moisturized and healthy than ever, especially my legs. Amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells SO great and feels smooth and moisturizing on your skin while in the shower.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this.</li>
            <li> my favorite bath/shower gel.</li>
            <li> Very nice smell to it!</li>
            <li> My husband and I use this daily.  We love the fragrance and the ease of use.  We use this soap exclusively in our bathrooms.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena products are almost always high quality and effective as described.  Great fragrance!</li>
            <li> I bought the Rainbath for my very picky teenage daughter who dislikes Dove (smells yacky) and Olay (feels weird). She fell in love with Neutrogena Rainbath the very first time she used it. It leaves her skin clean and soft, and the light fragrance is not over-powering. Too bad I have to continue using the Olay body wash...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. The scent is perfect, nothing sweet. Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin. Just feels and smells good.</li>
            <li> Grew up with my mother using this. To me, this is just what warm, loving women should smell like. Bought it for myself and can&#x27;t believe how adult I suddenly feel.</li>
            <li> The aroma is heavenly and it leaves my skin feeling very soft. Hope they never discontinue this product, its wonderful.</li>
            <li> I like this product....</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It helps my skin more than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.  Great product!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used Neutrogena products for many years, and this is one of our favorites.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Nice smell, suds up well in a loofa. Doesn’t make me too dry.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products so I tried this shower gel based on the reviews and it certainly lives up to its reputation. Its very smooth and non-irritating and smells really nice. A little goes a long way ..</li>
            <li> Convenient package and enough to last a long time. Product is high quality and bottle size is good for handling and storage. Price is only fair.</li>
            <li> Im about to buy it for the first time on amazon although Ive been using it for years just buying it from drugstores like Walgreens.  But the price is always higher so for 16 oz I think here I got a better deal. The reason why I like it enough to stick to it is the smell. Outstanding! Its a bit sweet and perfumey and the consistency if just right not too watery but not too thick either. Its very gentle to the skin that I even blend it with my facial cleanser to make my face smell great.</li>
            <li> Was not sure what to expect with the fragrance, but I quite like it! Nice product, makes me feel clean.</li>
