    <ol>
            <li>(glycolic works best)    </li>
            <li>I have been really impressed with this lotion.</li>
            <li>This keeps me from peeling and my skin looks awesome!</li>
            <li>but this is the best.</li>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>Best price I believe.</li>
            <li>For an affordable price, it&#x27;s a very good product..</li>
            <li>Also, it isn&#x27;t a great &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to keep my 20-something skin protected and started on a good Vitamen A and anti-oxidant regimen.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a good alternative</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Fair price.</li>
            <li>good deal.</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>After my dermatologist recommended I use this lotion 14 years ago, I have loved it and used it since.</li>
            <li>good price for a two pack.</li>
            <li>I have been using this lotion for YEARS and love it!</li>
            <li>and my face looks 10 times better these days!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Alpha hydroxy acids are good for the skin, but they make it photosensitive-very easy to get sun spots!</li>
            <li>Nice protection from the sun.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice because I can use it for travel</li>
            <li>Good product in a convenient pump dispenser - easy for travel.</li>
            <li>great price quick delivery</li>
            <li>I love this lotion-makes my skin looking healthy, is easy to absorb, great under make up.</li>
            <li>The combination really works incredibly well.</li>
            <li>Overall great cream for great price, even as a evening moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I realize it says \\&quot;Healthy</li>
            <li>Top this off with the addition of moisturizers and SPF protection and</li>
            <li>Been using this for years love it</li>
            <li>Mostly does not cause any pimples to the face.</li>
            <li>- I just thought I was getting more when I bought it.</li>
            <li>I can use a foundation makeup over it without issue, although most days this is all I use.  </li>
            <li>I know I should use sunscreen more often</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena Healthy skin face lotion and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>The SPF works well and does not irritate my eyes (like most sunblock).</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s cheaper than most in-store purchases is a plus.</li>
            <li>My favorite face lotion, have been using for probably 15 years...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>i have used this lotion for years, i love it.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s day 12, and my skin feels so good and smooth and clean</li>
            <li>Having said that, it does smell very good and it makes me wish their oil-free version smelled half as good as this one does.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s woth a try though because the alpha hydroxy formulas typically are the best on the market</li>
            <li>This is fine for what it is, but not what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Smooth and even complexion was the result of me using this product &#x27;once&#x27; a day.      </li>
            <li>This lotion is my tried and true standby - it works great on my 30-something skin that is dry in places, oily in others.  </li>
            <li>It really helps your skin look healthier and it keeps it pimples free!</li>
            <li>The sting is mild for me, but I&#x27;m used to acids.  </li>
            <li>And while this product from Neutrogena will never replace the facial treatments such as chemical peels, microdermabrasions or the more involved cosmetic surgery approaches, NEUTROGENA HEALTHY SKIN FACE LOTION SPF 15 does play an important role in refreshing the skin (the alpha-hydroxy acid is a very mild chemical peel, and the anti-oxidant properties of both Vitamins C and E replenish the cells removed by the peel).  </li>
            <li>Non greasy it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>the EWG online sunscreen guide is a very helpful tool to anyone interested in safe skin care products)</li>
            <li>does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li>the ultimate result is a skin that gives the appearance of a healthy diet and adequate rest!  </li>
            <li>I am the kind of girl to splurge in Sephora for those over-priced facial moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what they put in it, but I&#x27;ll look for a more natural alternative.</li>
            <li>It also is the only one that I tried that has vitamin E and C in it which is a must to make the skin look nice.</li>
            <li>more early skin damage, etc.</li>
            <li>acid and other alpha hydroxy formulas are excellent to rid your skin of toxins, dry/dead skin cells and they force your skin to re-new itself (i.e. look younger because it&#x27;s newer skin</li>
            <li>and I tried some on my face right away.  </li>
            <li>and my boyfriend is 24, so I must be doing something right.  </li>
            <li>Since this product, I have switched to a couple other Neutragena products and love them all!</li>
            <li>Granted you do experience stinging at first, but I stopped feeling it in a week</li>
            <li>This product works if you use it correctly and are aware of side effects that may or may not occur.</li>
            <li>Your face looks and feels younger because your skin re-news itself more often.</li>
            <li>Since I use a traditional safety razor for shaving, I like the astringency of the Healthy Skin Face Lotion to use as an aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>It would sort of have the opposite effect than what you would want - more sun exposure,</li>
            <li>This did exactly that.  </li>
            <li>(note the size on the bottles before you purchase, I originally thought it was an even better deal but stupidly didnt look at how many Oz each bottle has so was a bit surprised when they arrived to have mini bottles, but still happy with purchase.)</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a year and half now and love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s, have fairly dry skin - it definitely makes my skin feel softer, smoother, more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Skin care, especially of the face, is an important part of every person&#x27;s regimen.  </li>
            <li>I use it after a salicylic acid face wash which really dries my skin.</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>I really hope they keep making this and not change the formula.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product and was thrilled for a few days..  </li>
            <li>-just make sure your getting about 8% glycolic acid or some other alpha hydroxy type acid</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I attribute this to three things: never wearing foundation makeup, daily exfoliation, and daily use of Neutrogena Healthy Skin lotion.</li>
            <li>So, I took the drug store lotion back and will be sure to only buy it on Amazon from now on.</li>
            <li>I experienced quite a bit of stinging (which I thought was normal at first) but it would actually irritate my zits and make them worse.   </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>As you get older than that, like me, I think a nice effect is that the alpha-hydroxy exfoliates and keeps your skin a tad younger and slows down the wrinkling process.</li>
            <li>let&#x27;s give it a few more days.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>The only downside is it makes my skin look oily if I put too much on, but I dab my face with a towel if I put too much on.</li>
            <li>I began itching the first day and didn&#x27;t make the connection to the lotion until after applying it the second day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap and less aggressive option</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been using this a little less than two weeks, and I must say, it&#x27;s worked better than many of the more expensive counterparts I&#x27;ve tried in a shorter amount of time.  </li>
            <li>This product is a little thicker than the other Neutrogena SPF 15 face lotion (I&#x27;m not sure what the other type is), and smells just a smidge more, but it is great for my skin.</li>
            <li>Skin\\&quot; and not \\&quot;clear skin\\&quot;,</li>
            <li>Keeps my face clear, always, and protects it from the sun...</li>
            <li>i used this product for 3 days and developed the irritation</li>
            <li>A redhead with pale, dry, delicate skin, I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Healthy Skin lotion for 20 years or more.</li>
            <li>Recently, I visited a new dermatologist who guessed my age at 10 years younger than I really am, based on the condition of the skin on my face.</li>
            <li>It is mainly because of 2 ingredients: Vitamin A (aka Retinyl Palmitate, which makes your skin appear younger but also happens to speed tumor growth when combined with sunlight) and oxybenzone (a hormone-disruptor).  </li>
            <li>I actually ordered this by mistake, thinking it was my normal version.</li>
            <li>yeah there is a little burn but that reduces - it does burn after shaving but not bad enough to not use it.</li>
            <li>do recommend this to others looking for a general use face lotion.</li>
            <li>If you get a reaction such as burning sensations, your skin may be sensitive AND/</li>
            <li>Now my face is burning and can barely stand to be washed.</li>
            <li>Itchy irritated skin quickly developed into watery eyes, red burning skin, welts, and a swollen face.</li>
            <li>The lotion also makes my skin burn a little when I first put it on.</li>
            <li>and though i have found a medication to soothe those symptions i have no idea how long it will take for it to clear up and go away.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin and cannot use scrubs as they make me break out.</li>
            <li>Would trade the welts in a heartbeat for my old dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>My mistake, nothing bad with the products or the seller, everything was delivered in good shape.</li>

            <li> I used a different Neutrogena Face Lotion before that had SPF 30, and felt that one was too thick for my face (probably because of the higher SPF), so I switched to this one that&#x27;s SPF 15</li>
            <li> Try using the product less often at first or water it down or turn to a product that contains a lower % of glycolic or an alpha hydroxy.</li>
            <li> And it only takes 1 pump for me to cover my face so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This one is STILL THICK just like the SPF30, BUT ALSO has a STINGING feeling when you first put it on...</li>
            <li> This lotion stings my face a little, so I personally prefer the oil-free kind that is less expensive, but my husband will ONLY use this lotion.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I usually purchase this product at my local drugstore or grocery store and purchasing on Amazon this time saved me over 50%!  I would recommend this to anyone who uses this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to keep my 20-something skin protected and started on a good Vitamen A and anti-oxidant regimen. This was one of two fits I found but this one was much less expensive. I have been using it for a couple months now and I can totally tell the effects. My skin is brighter and smoother and younger looking (even though I&#x27;m only 25 anyway!). I have skin allergies and this did not break me out or cause irritation. Since this product, I have switched to a couple other Neutragena products and love them all!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a dermatologist over 10 yrs ago and I&#x27;ve used it on &amp; off ever since.  I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s, have fairly dry skin - it definitely makes my skin feel softer, smoother, more comfortable.  It seemed to work fine, that&#x27;s why I kept using it (though I always disliked the smell, and as some other reviewers said, it does sting, especially when your skin is very dry)... until last week.  I was on the EWG (Environmental Working Group) website checking out sunscreens for my kids, and I decided to check out this face lotion and see how it was rated.  SHOCK.  The rating is amongst the WORST, with a big red warning.  It is mainly because of 2 ingredients: Vitamin A (aka Retinyl Palmitate, which makes your skin appear younger but also happens to speed tumor growth when combined with sunlight) and oxybenzone (a hormone-disruptor).  I am stunned that a dermatologist would recommend this product (though it&#x27;s possible Neutrogena changed their formula since then).  I threw away my bottle and am in the process of finding a SAFER replacement.  Do your homework before you buy.&lt;br /&gt;(p.s. the EWG online sunscreen guide is a very helpful tool to anyone interested in safe skin care products)</li>
            <li> I realize it says \\&quot;Healthy Skin\\&quot; and not \\&quot;clear skin\\&quot;, but this product clogged my pores and gave me blackheads all over my cheeks and chin. I suppose I should have looked into it further because if I had, I would have realized that nowhere on this product is there a claim that it is non-comedogenic. So, if you are at all prone to pimples or blackheads, I would advise against this lotion. Having said that, it does smell very good and it makes me wish their oil-free version smelled half as good as this one does.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this a little less than two weeks, and I must say, it&#x27;s worked better than many of the more expensive counterparts I&#x27;ve tried in a shorter amount of time.  This lotion basically works as a moisturizer with the exfoliant AHA [alpha hydroxy acids], and I never really gave the idea of putting aha&#x27;s on my skin because I thought my sensitive skin would go nuts but hey!  my skin feels smoother than a baby&#x27;s butt. [...]So I went and got it and I tried some on my face right away.  It STUNG!  And I was like, \\&quot;hmm... let&#x27;s give it a few more days.\\&quot;  Granted you do experience stinging at first, but I stopped feeling it in a week [I only use it once a day since I have the spf version]    So it&#x27;s day 12, and my skin feels so good and smooth and clean looking that I feel compelled to write this review!</li>
            <li> I have tried expensive facial lotions, and they seemed to work at first, but over time, they stopped working.  This lotion is my tried and true standby - it works great on my 30-something skin that is dry in places, oily in others.  My pre-teen daughter uses it and loves it as well.  I will never buy expensive face lotion again.</li>
            <li> This product works if you use it correctly and are aware of side effects that may or may not occur. I have used it for years and before that other similar alpha hydroxy formulas. Do your research  -glycolic acid and other alpha hydroxy formulas are excellent to rid your skin of toxins, dry/dead skin cells and they force your skin to re-new itself (i.e. look younger because it&#x27;s newer skin your seeing daily).    If you get a reaction such as burning sensations, your skin may be sensitive AND/OR you might be getting what&#x27;s known as a herxheimer reaction -your skin is actually getting rid of toxins and severe dead skin cell build-up. Try using the product less often at first or water it down or turn to a product that contains a lower % of glycolic or an alpha hydroxy. Be careful though because some people just can&#x27;t use it, it&#x27;s too harsh on their sensitive skin. It&#x27;s woth a try though because the alpha hydroxy formulas typically are the best on the market and you don&#x27;t have to pay a fortune -just make sure your getting about 8% glycolic acid or some other alpha hydroxy type acid (glycolic works best)    They key is to work up to a daily application. Your face looks and feels younger because your skin re-news itself more often. In other words you seeing newer skin. I also use the acne face wash by Neutrogena. The combination really works incredibly well.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion-makes my skin looking healthy, is easy to absorb, great under make up. But it says on the box to use it as a moisturizer and always follow with spf for at least a week after use (for me spf is a part of everyday routine anyway). Alpha hydroxy acids are good for the skin, but they make it photosensitive-very easy to get sun spots! The lotion has a sunscreen spf 15 but I \\&quot;don&#x27;t trust it\\&quot;.   The sting is mild for me, but I&#x27;m used to acids.  Overall great cream for great price, even as a evening moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of Neutrogena and have used their cleanser for almost my entire life. I figured the brand is trustworthy for my daily face lotion as well, and have been looking for something to replace my Dove Lotion SPF 15 that is no longer in production (so sad!). I used a different Neutrogena Face Lotion before that had SPF 30, and felt that one was too thick for my face (probably because of the higher SPF), so I switched to this one that&#x27;s SPF 15...I did not foresee the difference it would make. This one is STILL THICK just like the SPF30, BUT ALSO has a STINGING feeling when you first put it on...I thought it was just getting used to my face, so I&#x27;ve been putting up with it, but it&#x27;s not going away. Everyday I am afraid to slather this on my face, but have 2 bottles because of the Amazon Save Deal! I am very DISAPPOINTED by the lotion and the reaction it has to my face, I consider myself to have a combination/dry skin and have NEVER had a lotion sting like this before! :( so BUYER BEWARE!</li>
            <li> This lotion works - yeah there is a little burn but that reduces - it does burn after shaving but not bad enough to not use it. Good product in a convenient pump dispenser - easy for travel.</li>
            <li> Skin care, especially of the face, is an important part of every person&#x27;s regimen.  And while this product from Neutrogena will never replace the facial treatments such as chemical peels, microdermabrasions or the more involved cosmetic surgery approaches, NEUTROGENA HEALTHY SKIN FACE LOTION SPF 15 does play an important role in refreshing the skin (the alpha-hydroxy acid is a very mild chemical peel, and the anti-oxidant properties of both Vitamins C and E replenish the cells removed by the peel).  Top this off with the addition of moisturizers and SPF protection and the ultimate result is a skin that gives the appearance of a healthy diet and adequate rest!  If used even once daily the skin will definitely appear healthier.  Grady Harp, June 11</li>
            <li> A redhead with pale, dry, delicate skin, I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Healthy Skin lotion for 20 years or more. Recently, I visited a new dermatologist who guessed my age at 10 years younger than I really am, based on the condition of the skin on my face. I attribute this to three things: never wearing foundation makeup, daily exfoliation, and daily use of Neutrogena Healthy Skin lotion.</li>
            <li> I have been really impressed with this lotion. I use it after a salicylic acid face wash which really dries my skin. This keeps me from peeling and my skin looks awesome! I have some others that are cheaper but this is the best.</li>
            <li> great price quick delivery</li>
            <li> Discontinue use if irritation or rash appear.    i used this product for 3 days and developed the irritation/rash they spoke of.  what they don&#x27;t tell you is that the rash hurts, stings and itches and though i have found a medication to soothe those symptions i have no idea how long it will take for it to clear up and go away.  although this may not be the case for the majority of users it&#x27;s unfortunate for those of us who use this product unaware that we aren&#x27;t going to be part of the majority.  i don&#x27;t usually have reactions to face creams and cleansers so this came as a very unpleasant surprise.  will look for a different brand from now on - neutrogena is on my NO BUY list from now on.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years love it</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a year and half now and love it! It makes my skin tighter and softer and my complexion is creamy and not spotchy anymore. And it only takes 1 pump for me to cover my face so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Very soothing. Mostly does not cause any pimples to the face. I use it 3-4 times a day. Nice protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> This product, although priced well, comes in a smaller container than I thought. It&#x27;s nice because I can use it for travel - I just thought I was getting more when I bought it. The lotion also makes my skin burn a little when I first put it on. Be careful not to use near your eyes because it will burn your eyes ALL DAY long. It works well as a sunscreen - I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This lotion stings my face a little, so I personally prefer the oil-free kind that is less expensive, but my husband will ONLY use this lotion.  I thought I would pick some up at the drug store for him while I was out, but one bottle was almost $16!  That&#x27;s almost double the Amazon price.  So, I took the drug store lotion back and will be sure to only buy it on Amazon from now on.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of this Neutrogena product.  It is what I put on my face every morning. Non greasy it absorbs quickly.  I can use a foundation makeup over it without issue, although most days this is all I use.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product is a little thicker than the other Neutrogena SPF 15 face lotion (I&#x27;m not sure what the other type is), and smells just a smidge more, but it is great for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for YEARS and love it! Seems the only thing that keeps the acne away and lines. I pray they don&#x27;t quit making it! It is hard to find in my stores so I order on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and was thrilled for a few days..  then I broke out really bad! I used this product for 1 week and in the garbage it went.  I experienced quite a bit of stinging (which I thought was normal at first) but it would actually irritate my zits and make them worse.   I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s with severe environmental allergies. I have dry, sensitive skin and cannot use scrubs as they make me break out. I thought this was a good alternative but, it seems this product is waaaayyyy to irritating and drying for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about six years, once a day after shaving. I know I should use sunscreen more often and this is a way of ensuring that I do. Since I use a traditional safety razor for shaving, I like the astringency of the Healthy Skin Face Lotion to use as an aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this to others looking for a general use face lotion.</li>
            <li> I had an acne problem which started at a late age and after using this product I have to say it has cleared up the acne and my face looks 10 times better these days! I love Neutrogena Healthy skin face lotion and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion after I had been struggling with very bad dry, blotchy skin.  I&#x27;m a woman of color and I grabbed it off the shelf thinking that I just needed SOMETHING to put on my face. I am the kind of girl to splurge in Sephora for those over-priced facial moisturizers.  Like the others have stated. This product does work and in such a short space of time. I think it even says so on the back label. I seriously didn&#x27;t expect the results I got. Smooth and even complexion was the result of me using this product &#x27;once&#x27; a day.      For an affordable price, it&#x27;s a very good product.. does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li> This lotion is the worst. I used it for 3 days and then had the worst itchy, dry, bumpy, rash I&#x27;ve ever had in my entire life. It also caused tons of tiny pimples all along my jaw and chin. Now my face is burning and can barely stand to be washed. I&#x27;ve been having to keep lotion slathered on my face just to stand the pain. I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to any other face product like this in my life.  Take my warning and avoid this one at all cost.</li>
            <li> Would give this a lower rating if it were possible. I began itching the first day and didn&#x27;t make the connection to the lotion until after applying it the second day. Itchy irritated skin quickly developed into watery eyes, red burning skin, welts, and a swollen face. It&#x27;s the end of day 3 and the swelling is finally beginning to subside. I hope to improve over the weekend so I can return to work on Monday. Would trade the welts in a heartbeat for my old dry winter skin. I don&#x27;t know what they put in it, but I&#x27;ll look for a more natural alternative.</li>
            <li> Love this! Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> As advertised. Good product. Fair price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for almost 5 years and I wouldn&#x27;t change it for another cream.  It really helps your skin look healthier and it keeps it pimples free!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a morning ritual for 3 years. The SPF works well and does not irritate my eyes (like most sunblock). The fact that it&#x27;s cheaper than most in-store purchases is a plus. I treat this as a commodity...so long as it&#x27;s Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> This is the only acne lotion from Neutrogena that has worked for me. It also is the only one that I tried that has vitamin E and C in it which is a must to make the skin look nice. I ended up buying another. I really hope they keep making this and not change the formula. I finally found something that cleared up my skin. The only downside is it makes my skin look oily if I put too much on, but I dab my face with a towel if I put too much on.</li>
            <li> good deal. good product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It cured my sun allergy!</li>
            <li> My favorite face lotion, have been using for probably 15 years... I&#x27;m 43 now, people say I look in my early-to-mid 30s... and my boyfriend is 24, so I must be doing something right.  ;-)  Keeps my face clear, always, and protects it from the sun... which is a necessary thing for humans to have shining on their plants, not on their skin.</li>
            <li> After my dermatologist recommended I use this lotion 14 years ago, I have loved it and used it since. Any time I try a different face lotion, my face just feels way too dry and tight in comparison.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered this by mistake, thinking it was my normal version. This is fine for what it is, but not what I wanted. My mistake, nothing bad with the products or the seller, everything was delivered in good shape.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 25 years. I&#x27;m not a loyalist - I&#x27;ve tried lots of other skin care products, but this one is reliable and relatively inexpensive. I recommend it for teens and twenties for acne control. I mean I literally give it to teenagers (I work with a lot of them) along with Neutrogena On-the-Spot Acne treatment. It&#x27;s a cheap and less aggressive option that all those crazy acne medications they experiment with. As you get older than that, like me, I think a nice effect is that the alpha-hydroxy exfoliates and keeps your skin a tad younger and slows down the wrinkling process. Not a fountain of youth, but it&#x27;s like having your skin buffed a little bit each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can tingle a little each time you put it on (which I like), BUT people sensitive to acidic skin products should be cautious. Also, it isn&#x27;t a great &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34;. Sometimes I use a second moisturizer too. Also, with any alpha-hydroxy or similar product, you have to use sunscreen. I wouldn&#x27;t rely on the weak SPF 15 for protection (that is included in the product) especially if you are going to be out in the sun a lot. It would sort of have the opposite effect than what you would want - more sun exposure, more early skin damage, etc. etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price - a bottle of this fluctuates between 9.99 and 14.99 at places like Target and Rite Aid. If you get it on sale, one bottle can dip just below $10 (this is 2014). One option is to get it at Bed Bath and Beyond with a coupon. But I order this on Amazon for about $8 or less a bottle. Best price I believe.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.  From medicines or age I have developed dry flaky skin on my face, I have tried everything and the worst was that I could no longer wear make-up because the dryness was accentuated.  I picked this up because of the alpha hydroxy in it, hoping that it would get rid of the dryness but not make me too red.  This did exactly that.  No redness and no more flaky skin.  I use it everyday and have had no problems with any irritation from it.  A little goes a long way.  I love it.</li>
            <li> good price for a two pack. (note the size on the bottles before you purchase, I originally thought it was an even better deal but stupidly didnt look at how many Oz each bottle has so was a bit surprised when they arrived to have mini bottles, but still happy with purchase.)</li>
            <li> i have used this lotion for years, i love it.</li>
