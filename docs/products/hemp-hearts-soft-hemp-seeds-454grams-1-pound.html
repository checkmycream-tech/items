            <li>Fresh and great nutty taste!</li>
            <li>I said nothing of the sort, and had told him I was very pleased with the Hemp Hearts I had been purchasing from them in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be sure to refrigerate it!  </li>
            <li>LOVE him!  </li>
            <li>I would love to see you there!</li>
            <li>I love them!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>We love them and will continue ordering!</li>
            <li>Good taste, love the crunch, and they do help with constipation.  </li>
            <li>and I began buying the tub from the cafe and made my own tasty creations.  </li>
            <li>But each has to find their own comfort zone.</li>
            <li>Someone suggested this as a good healthy supplement; we ordered it and use a spoonful every morning on our cereal.</li>
            <li>I really researched about Hemp Hearts and then went to Amazon to get best price.</li>
            <li>These seeds are very nutritious and delicious!</li>
            <li>The hemp hearts add a nice texture and flavor to the ramen.</li>
            <li>They stick in your teeth, irritate your throat and very much take away from the delicious and healthy experience one should get from hemp</li>
            <li>When blended they are very smooth, but when sprinkled on yogurt, salad, etc they are lightly crunchy and have a very nice</li>
            <li>lower the price and place them in a bag and customers can transfer to their own containers as most do anyway.</li>
            <li>All the health benefits sound good, but I guess not for us.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go for most of the day, a light lunch is all I need.  </li>
            <li>I even created a great \\&quot;hot cereal\\&quot; for change: 2 Tbsp Flax meal, 5 Tbsp Hemp, 1 Tbsp Oat Bran (I didn&#x27;t have shredded coconut</li>
            <li>AND I feel more healthy.</li>
            <li>I love the taste and include them in my oatmeal in the morning and even on top of my fried or scrambled eggs.</li>
            <li>I love the hemp hearts - but the packaging could be improved a bit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve re-ordered Hemp Hearts - and love to add them to salads, steamed veggies and banana/coconut/sunflower seeds and cream in the morning with honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise - I love the nutty taste - and gives a texture to a veggie or fruit meal.  </li>
            <li>I love the convenience of shopping with them.</li>
            <li>Being a Vegetarian for over 25 years, breakfast was always the most challenging part of my meals.  </li>
            <li>Cheers to you and smooth drinking!</li>
            <li>Wanna know more about how much I love these?</li>
            <li>Many Blessings, Tamy</li>
            <li>Love it in the morning with Hemp milk.</li>
            <li>I will def be ordering more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not much more to say about these.</li>
            <li>I find myself in a much better mood and spend a lot more time laughing.  </li>
            <li>I would have bought more.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>I love hemp hearts on my oatmeal.</li>
            <li>Love putting this in my smoothies or just a cup of yogurt.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE Hemp hearts.</li>
            <li>I had been purchasing plastic containers of Hemp Hearts from Rocky Mtn.in Alberta for many years, and was totally satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I feel if I consume those things in addition to the hemp hearts, I&#x27;m doing a much better job of maintaining my nutrition.  </li>
            <li>I love this product &amp; put it in everything.</li>
            <li>Usage on cereals mostly and sometimes on smoothies.</li>
            <li>, I cannot wait to get more.</li>
            <li>The package strongly suggests that if I were to consume 4-5 heaping tablespoons of these every morning most of my life&#x27;s problems would be solved.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great source of natural energy!</li>
            <li>I feel satisfied and full for many hours</li>
            <li>I love being free from sugar cravings and the need for a pick me up</li>
            <li>They are a great source of natural fats and protein.</li>
            <li>Besides tasting good I believe they have health benefits, and seem very digestible and sustaining.</li>
            <li>A good friend of mine recommends that I take this product &amp; swears by it that it really improves your health.</li>
            <li>great price, fast shipping, fresh seeds.  </li>
            <li>I had them with my cereal in the morning and it helped me easily get through my day until lunch.</li>
            <li>I received my hemp hearts very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find Hemp Hearts at Amazon at such a good price.</li>
            <li>Hemp hearts are just in general a great food to keep around the house.</li>
            <li>Which is fine by me since I cannot eat nuts.</li>
            <li>Tasted just fine.</li>
            <li>My first reaction was that they were delicious as I sampled some in a Health Store in Kenora, Ontario, Canada while on a recent trip.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this based on the positive reviews, it is a nice topping for cereal or yogurt.</li>
            <li>The value is amazing for the large tub</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t rate the health claims as we only use it like wheat germ but it has a great flavor and texture.      </li>
            <li>Use lightly with lots of greens.</li>
            <li>I have been using hemp products for a few years and I just think its one of the best ways to get protein,fats,amino acids.</li>
            <li>This is the only brand I trust and they taste great in or by themselves.</li>
            <li>This a great way to get protein and extra energy.</li>
            <li>For me, starting out with a good source of protein jump starts a better eating pattern the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>After drinking the smooth and tasty shakes I felt full and energized.  </li>
            <li>I have seen significant improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love hemp hearts, I have more energy and just an overall better attitude.  </li>
            <li>put some of the hemp hearts on top of my Greek yogurt last night and it was really delicious.  </li>
            <li>We live in a rural area and am glad to be able to get this and the quality is good.</li>
            <li>The container that they come in is kind of wimpy though (especially the top).</li>
            <li>Annnd, I was right!</li>
            <li>Outside of that a good product.</li>
            <li>I love the product but it is very pricey.</li>
            <li>I later heard about the bars, so ordered a case of them, as I heard they would be good for losing weight.  </li>
            <li>I seldom eat meat, and since I am being truthful here, I really seldom eat.  </li>
            <li>hemp hearts good for the heart actually works well with all types of food and helps curb appetite, keeps you full longr, would recommend</li>
            <li>These are high quality hemp hearts, a great source of protein, and an easy way to assure nutrition and to fisatisfy hunger for several hours.</li>
            <li>Man o man these little guys are good!</li>
            <li>I agree with the a couple of other reviewers,: 1-The lid of the container does come off too easily, so I wish Rocky Mountain would provide a container with a more secure top.</li>
            <li>I have delt with this company and there is absolutely no one more sincere about their product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other hemp seeds and all of them contained more hulls than I liked.  </li>
            <li>It actually tastes pretty good tastes nutty.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
            <li>I have used these hemp hearts, now, for three containers worth and they are every bit as energizing and healthful as I could wish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always found the hemp hearts from this company to be fresh and the product dates to be well-marked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was introduced to them by a local smoothie place which charges about $2 for a scoop, so I decided to find and buy my own and did on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Doing my own personal science experiment and eating this way, in six days I lost six pounds and kept them off.</li>
            <li>It is, by far the best brand out there but BEWARE-as soon as you open it-PUT IT IN A CONTAINER THAT HAS A SECURE LID, especially if you have kids using your fridge/freezer.  </li>
            <li>After reading the hemp story online about the guy basically being able to clean out his system with the stuff, I thought \\&quot;At last!</li>
            <li>The price however, which once was pretty reasonable, has jumped 15% !!   </li>
            <li>These hemp hearts have a light, nutty flavor and are easily added to your current diet.</li>
            <li>Liked it fine, put in my green  smoothies.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good when mixed into a shake or smoothie, sprinkled onto a salad, added to oatmeal or other cereal, sprinkled on veggies, etc.</li>
            <li>They tasted fine as far as hemp seeds go.  </li>
            <li>My first order opened in the shipping box.  </li>
            <li>It simply sits on the top of the container.  </li>
            <li>My first container mildewed in about 10 days.  </li>
            <li>packaging has improved a bit in the last couple shipments - glad to see it -</li>
            <li>I was able to exercise for one hour to two hours each morning and just hydrate until my next meal at lunch.  </li>
            <li>I feel that the HH is so beneficial to my lifestyle that I will purchase it from Amazon despite the higher price.  </li>
            <li>I find the flavor to be most similar to sunflower seeds, but these are softer and about the size of sesame seeds.  </li>
            <li>The picture shows that it is in a bag, which I was glad to see since this is my second time ordering these.</li>
            <li>I discovered this fantastic natural nutrition through my daughter who is a Pilates instructor.</li>
            <li>I love this especially with my cereal...</li>
            <li>3/4- 1 cup hot water, mix, let sit for about a min, mix again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been over 2 months since I first contacted Mr.Snow, and I have had no reply, nor a refund, nor any replacement product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone interested in improving their nutrition.</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewers who pointed out the packaging needs improvement and it is a kind of pricy substitute for wheat germ.</li>
            <li>Also, very tasty with hot cereal.</li>
            <li>4-5 tablespoons of these powerful little seeds kept me free from craving sugary snacks mid afternoon and most days</li>
            <li>Did get to wondering since they have a lot of protein, how much is too much.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I even eat them straight from the spoon.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>They taste nutty and really are doing wonders for my health.  </li>
            <li>I think 4T would be too much for me.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend anyone who wants to up their protein intake, take this product.</li>
            <li>It is very filling.</li>
            <li>BUT PERSONALLY REALLY LIKE THEM</li>
            <li>The store owner was very helpful and gave my friend and I paperwork explaining the benefits of adding Hemp Hearts into our diet.</li>
            <li>Taste is more on  the nutty side not tart or bitter.</li>
            <li>I have ordered them a couple of times and used them a number of ways as have other reviewers, but favorite recipe is to add to a smoothie.  </li>
            <li>They remind me very much of sunflower seeds, as far as flavor goes.</li>
            <li>net net I give the hemp hearts a huge THUMBS UP!  </li>
            <li>but my joints seem to be operating better with less pain, I have had a decrease in appetite but have lost no weight.</li>
            <li>I did NOT lose weight, which was the main reason I bought it.</li>
            <li>I usually eat the hemp hearts for breakfast, which does leave me pretty satisfied till lunch.  </li>
            <li>You can add it to salads, on veggie sandwiches, fresh berries drizzles with honey for a fun snack, sprinkle on yogurts or just grab a handful straight up to chow down  my non vegetarian kids like eating it that way)..  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend HH.  </li>
            <li>3T causes to much bowel action.  </li>
            <li>Wow, they have given me so much energy.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff and getting it online is a few buck cheaper than at the one store in my area that carries it.</li>
            <li>I first came across this product last year at my local wellness cafe and instantly fell in love.  </li>
            <li>My metabolism is noticeably better, as long as I keep a regular schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First, I have to say I think the flavor is very strong and not pleasant.</li>
            <li>They came in handy little plastic buckets that were quite the pain to get open (kind of like prying open a plastic paint bucket, only smaller).  </li>
            <li>I found out very quickly searching the internet that there are many sources, including many Organic varieties, which are less expensive and don&#x27;t have any of these \\&quot;naturally occurring</li>
            <li>I suggested he either send me some new product as a replacement for the bars I still had, or send me the equivalent amount of Hemp Hearts in plastic containers, or send me a refund.</li>
            <li>Another bonus is that I feel a smooth regular move the next day.</li>
            <li>These are very very good tasting, but they are very expensive.  </li>
            <li>just purchased a small refrigerator and put it in my bedroom so that I had no excuses about not being able to go downstairs to make something to eat.  </li>
            <li>It is very similar to sunflower seeds and really yummy!  </li>
            <li>First time for both me and my wife and we&#x27;re both big fans.</li>
            <li>At first I was skeptical but after ten days of eating hemp hearts on my strawberries and sprinkling them on my salad daily my clothes fit better and my friends have noticed a change in my appearance.</li>
            <li>This is a considerably energizing product that&#x27;s a complete protein.</li>
            <li>When I called in to inquire about it, they basically told me that they were harmless and that they occurred naturally in the process of producing the shelled hemp seeds.  </li>
            <li>They also completely fill you up</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t encountered any hulls at all so far.  </li>
            <li>SO I purchased 1 container of soft hemp hearts.</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t lost much weight yet, I will continue to include them in my daily diet.</li>
            <li>It didnt really help curb my appetite as the reason I initially bought it</li>
            <li>While the seeds are delicious themselves, it came again in this weird little bucket container that is the absolute saddest excuse of a container I have ordered on here yet.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them to get your health and energy back on track.</li>
            <li>It blends really well and gives an otherwise ordinary shake full body without making a big impact on the flavor...</li>
            <li>I stocked it full of yogurt, cottage cheese, fruits, and green juice that I try to keep made up.  </li>
            <li>For those who are wondering, these have a flavor similar to slivered almonds, but milder, and a soft, squishy texture.  </li>
            <li>IS THE ONLY COMPANY I HAVE TRIED SO FAR</li>
            <li>I hold back a tablespoons worth and mix with a little honey for an afternoon treat.</li>
            <li>it can make you a little nauseous at first.</li>
            <li>One negative thing that I can say about the product is that the raw foods manifesto accusing the Canadian government of \\&quot;nutritional genocide\\&quot; is bizarre, it makes me wonder what sort of organization I am supporting by buying this product.</li>
            <li>They cost me less in both item and shipping costs and get here much faster since they don&#x27;t have to be shipped all the way from Canada.  </li>

            <li> They were delicious and pleasant to eat.  </li>
            <li> Rocky Mountain Hemp Hearts have a great taste.  </li>
            <li> They taste great and I have never found a hull.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare them but they have a great nutty flavor.</li>
            <li> They seem like they would be great for a gluten-free tabbouleh or anywhere you&#x27;d use shredded coconut for texture.</li>
            <li> The flavor is wonderful, a nice mix of nutty and seedy.</li>
            <li> My son told me about these, they are tasty and are great for your digestive health as well.</li>

            <li> You can&#x27;t get any better!!</li>
            <li> Healthy and delicious!</li>
            <li> 36% Fiber per 2 ounces is 12% and healthy Omega 6 &amp; Omega 3 are excellent.</li>
            <li> Delicious and healthy.</li>
            <li> , we didn&#x27;t even feel good giving them away.</li>
            <li> Really good product and value.</li>
            <li> No problem, just toss them into a tupperware type container and all is good.</li>
            <li> Tastes awesome, is great in salad, cooked with stir fries, on sandwiches, or just straight up with a spoon!</li>

            <li> These are the best for a great high protein snack.</li>
            <li> I have 1/4 cup every morning and they are totally satisfying and taste great.</li>
            <li> We are very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I have been very satisfied with the product I ordered and will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the taste and texture of these hemp seeds.  </li>
            <li> Everyone likes them and it&#x27;s a great way to get more good-for-you foods in your diet.</li>
            <li> Fresh and great nutty taste!</li>
            <li> I said nothing of the sort, and had told him I was very pleased with the Hemp Hearts I had been purchasing from them in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be sure to refrigerate it!  </li>
            <li> LOVE him!  </li>
            <li> I would love to see you there!</li>
            <li> I love them!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> We love them and will continue ordering!</li>
            <li> Good taste, love the crunch, and they do help with constipation.  </li>
            <li> and I began buying the tub from the cafe and made my own tasty creations.  </li>
            <li> But each has to find their own comfort zone.</li>
            <li> Someone suggested this as a good healthy supplement; we ordered it and use a spoonful every morning on our cereal.</li>
            <li> I really researched about Hemp Hearts and then went to Amazon to get best price.</li>
            <li> These seeds are very nutritious and delicious!</li>
            <li> The hemp hearts add a nice texture and flavor to the ramen.</li>
            <li> They stick in your teeth, irritate your throat and very much take away from the delicious and healthy experience one should get from hemp</li>
            <li> When blended they are very smooth, but when sprinkled on yogurt, salad, etc they are lightly crunchy and have a very nice</li>
            <li> lower the price and place them in a bag and customers can transfer to their own containers as most do anyway.</li>
            <li> All the health benefits sound good, but I guess not for us.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go for most of the day, a light lunch is all I need.  </li>
            <li> I even created a great \\&quot;hot cereal\\&quot; for change: 2 Tbsp Flax meal, 5 Tbsp Hemp, 1 Tbsp Oat Bran (I didn&#x27;t have shredded coconut</li>
            <li> AND I feel more healthy.</li>
            <li> I love the taste and include them in my oatmeal in the morning and even on top of my fried or scrambled eggs.</li>
            <li> I love the hemp hearts - but the packaging could be improved a bit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve re-ordered Hemp Hearts - and love to add them to salads, steamed veggies and banana/coconut/sunflower seeds and cream in the morning with honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise - I love the nutty taste - and gives a texture to a veggie or fruit meal.  </li>
            <li> I love the convenience of shopping with them.</li>
            <li> Being a Vegetarian for over 25 years, breakfast was always the most challenging part of my meals.  </li>
            <li> Cheers to you and smooth drinking!</li>
            <li> Wanna know more about how much I love these?</li>
            <li> Many Blessings, Tamy</li>
            <li> Love it in the morning with Hemp milk.</li>
            <li> I will def be ordering more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not much more to say about these.</li>
            <li> I find myself in a much better mood and spend a lot more time laughing.  </li>
            <li> I would have bought more.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> I love hemp hearts on my oatmeal.</li>
            <li> Love putting this in my smoothies or just a cup of yogurt.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE Hemp hearts.</li>
            <li> I had been purchasing plastic containers of Hemp Hearts from Rocky Mtn.in Alberta for many years, and was totally satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I feel if I consume those things in addition to the hemp hearts, I&#x27;m doing a much better job of maintaining my nutrition.  </li>
            <li> I love this product &amp; put it in everything.</li>
            <li> Usage on cereals mostly and sometimes on smoothies.</li>
            <li> , I cannot wait to get more.</li>
            <li> The package strongly suggests that if I were to consume 4-5 heaping tablespoons of these every morning most of my life&#x27;s problems would be solved.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great source of natural energy!</li>
            <li> I feel satisfied and full for many hours</li>
            <li> I love being free from sugar cravings and the need for a pick me up</li>
            <li> They are a great source of natural fats and protein.</li>
            <li> Besides tasting good I believe they have health benefits, and seem very digestible and sustaining.</li>
            <li> A good friend of mine recommends that I take this product &amp; swears by it that it really improves your health.</li>
            <li> great price, fast shipping, fresh seeds.  </li>
            <li> I had them with my cereal in the morning and it helped me easily get through my day until lunch.</li>
            <li> I received my hemp hearts very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find Hemp Hearts at Amazon at such a good price.</li>
            <li> Hemp hearts are just in general a great food to keep around the house.</li>
            <li> Which is fine by me since I cannot eat nuts.</li>
            <li> Tasted just fine.</li>
            <li> My first reaction was that they were delicious as I sampled some in a Health Store in Kenora, Ontario, Canada while on a recent trip.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this based on the positive reviews, it is a nice topping for cereal or yogurt.</li>
            <li> The value is amazing for the large tub</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rate the health claims as we only use it like wheat germ but it has a great flavor and texture.      </li>
            <li> Use lightly with lots of greens.</li>
            <li> I have been using hemp products for a few years and I just think its one of the best ways to get protein,fats,amino acids.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand I trust and they taste great in or by themselves.</li>
            <li> This a great way to get protein and extra energy.</li>
            <li> For me, starting out with a good source of protein jump starts a better eating pattern the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> After drinking the smooth and tasty shakes I felt full and energized.  </li>
            <li> I have seen significant improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love hemp hearts, I have more energy and just an overall better attitude.  </li>
            <li> put some of the hemp hearts on top of my Greek yogurt last night and it was really delicious.  </li>
            <li> We live in a rural area and am glad to be able to get this and the quality is good.</li>
            <li> The container that they come in is kind of wimpy though (especially the top).</li>
            <li> Annnd, I was right!</li>
            <li> Outside of that a good product.</li>
            <li> I love the product but it is very pricey.</li>
            <li> I later heard about the bars, so ordered a case of them, as I heard they would be good for losing weight.  </li>
            <li> I seldom eat meat, and since I am being truthful here, I really seldom eat.  </li>
            <li> hemp hearts good for the heart actually works well with all types of food and helps curb appetite, keeps you full longr, would recommend</li>
            <li> These are high quality hemp hearts, a great source of protein, and an easy way to assure nutrition and to fisatisfy hunger for several hours.</li>
            <li> Man o man these little guys are good!</li>
            <li> I agree with the a couple of other reviewers,: 1-The lid of the container does come off too easily, so I wish Rocky Mountain would provide a container with a more secure top.</li>
            <li> I have delt with this company and there is absolutely no one more sincere about their product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other hemp seeds and all of them contained more hulls than I liked.  </li>
            <li> It actually tastes pretty good tastes nutty.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> I have used these hemp hearts, now, for three containers worth and they are every bit as energizing and healthful as I could wish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always found the hemp hearts from this company to be fresh and the product dates to be well-marked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was introduced to them by a local smoothie place which charges about $2 for a scoop, so I decided to find and buy my own and did on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Doing my own personal science experiment and eating this way, in six days I lost six pounds and kept them off.</li>
            <li> It is, by far the best brand out there but BEWARE-as soon as you open it-PUT IT IN A CONTAINER THAT HAS A SECURE LID, especially if you have kids using your fridge/freezer.  </li>
            <li> After reading the hemp story online about the guy basically being able to clean out his system with the stuff, I thought \\&quot;At last!</li>
            <li> The price however, which once was pretty reasonable, has jumped 15% !!   </li>
            <li> These hemp hearts have a light, nutty flavor and are easily added to your current diet.</li>
            <li> Liked it fine, put in my green  smoothies.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good when mixed into a shake or smoothie, sprinkled onto a salad, added to oatmeal or other cereal, sprinkled on veggies, etc.</li>
            <li> They tasted fine as far as hemp seeds go.  </li>
            <li> My first order opened in the shipping box.  </li>
            <li> It simply sits on the top of the container.  </li>
            <li> My first container mildewed in about 10 days.  </li>
            <li> packaging has improved a bit in the last couple shipments - glad to see it -</li>
            <li> I was able to exercise for one hour to two hours each morning and just hydrate until my next meal at lunch.  </li>
            <li> I feel that the HH is so beneficial to my lifestyle that I will purchase it from Amazon despite the higher price.  </li>
            <li> I find the flavor to be most similar to sunflower seeds, but these are softer and about the size of sesame seeds.  </li>
            <li> The picture shows that it is in a bag, which I was glad to see since this is my second time ordering these.</li>
            <li> I discovered this fantastic natural nutrition through my daughter who is a Pilates instructor.</li>
            <li> I love this especially with my cereal...</li>
            <li> 3/4- 1 cup hot water, mix, let sit for about a min, mix again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over 2 months since I first contacted Mr.Snow, and I have had no reply, nor a refund, nor any replacement product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone interested in improving their nutrition.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers who pointed out the packaging needs improvement and it is a kind of pricy substitute for wheat germ.</li>
            <li> Also, very tasty with hot cereal.</li>
            <li> 4-5 tablespoons of these powerful little seeds kept me free from craving sugary snacks mid afternoon and most days</li>
            <li> Did get to wondering since they have a lot of protein, how much is too much.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I even eat them straight from the spoon.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> They taste nutty and really are doing wonders for my health.  </li>
            <li> I think 4T would be too much for me.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend anyone who wants to up their protein intake, take this product.</li>
            <li> It is very filling.</li>
            <li> BUT PERSONALLY REALLY LIKE THEM</li>
            <li> The store owner was very helpful and gave my friend and I paperwork explaining the benefits of adding Hemp Hearts into our diet.</li>
            <li> Taste is more on  the nutty side not tart or bitter.</li>
            <li> I have ordered them a couple of times and used them a number of ways as have other reviewers, but favorite recipe is to add to a smoothie.  </li>
            <li> They remind me very much of sunflower seeds, as far as flavor goes.</li>
            <li> net net I give the hemp hearts a huge THUMBS UP!  </li>
            <li> but my joints seem to be operating better with less pain, I have had a decrease in appetite but have lost no weight.</li>
            <li> I did NOT lose weight, which was the main reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> I usually eat the hemp hearts for breakfast, which does leave me pretty satisfied till lunch.  </li>
            <li> You can add it to salads, on veggie sandwiches, fresh berries drizzles with honey for a fun snack, sprinkle on yogurts or just grab a handful straight up to chow down  my non vegetarian kids like eating it that way)..  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend HH.  </li>
            <li> 3T causes to much bowel action.  </li>
            <li> Wow, they have given me so much energy.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff and getting it online is a few buck cheaper than at the one store in my area that carries it.</li>
            <li> I first came across this product last year at my local wellness cafe and instantly fell in love.  </li>
            <li> My metabolism is noticeably better, as long as I keep a regular schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First, I have to say I think the flavor is very strong and not pleasant.</li>
            <li> They came in handy little plastic buckets that were quite the pain to get open (kind of like prying open a plastic paint bucket, only smaller).  </li>
            <li> I found out very quickly searching the internet that there are many sources, including many Organic varieties, which are less expensive and don&#x27;t have any of these \\&quot;naturally occurring</li>
            <li> I suggested he either send me some new product as a replacement for the bars I still had, or send me the equivalent amount of Hemp Hearts in plastic containers, or send me a refund.</li>
            <li> Another bonus is that I feel a smooth regular move the next day.</li>
            <li> These are very very good tasting, but they are very expensive.  </li>
            <li> just purchased a small refrigerator and put it in my bedroom so that I had no excuses about not being able to go downstairs to make something to eat.  </li>
            <li> It is very similar to sunflower seeds and really yummy!  </li>
            <li> First time for both me and my wife and we&#x27;re both big fans.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical but after ten days of eating hemp hearts on my strawberries and sprinkling them on my salad daily my clothes fit better and my friends have noticed a change in my appearance.</li>
            <li> This is a considerably energizing product that&#x27;s a complete protein.</li>
            <li> When I called in to inquire about it, they basically told me that they were harmless and that they occurred naturally in the process of producing the shelled hemp seeds.  </li>
            <li> They also completely fill you up</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t encountered any hulls at all so far.  </li>
            <li> SO I purchased 1 container of soft hemp hearts.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t lost much weight yet, I will continue to include them in my daily diet.</li>
            <li> It didnt really help curb my appetite as the reason I initially bought it</li>
            <li> While the seeds are delicious themselves, it came again in this weird little bucket container that is the absolute saddest excuse of a container I have ordered on here yet.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them to get your health and energy back on track.</li>
            <li> It blends really well and gives an otherwise ordinary shake full body without making a big impact on the flavor...</li>
            <li> I stocked it full of yogurt, cottage cheese, fruits, and green juice that I try to keep made up.  </li>
            <li> For those who are wondering, these have a flavor similar to slivered almonds, but milder, and a soft, squishy texture.  </li>
            <li> IS THE ONLY COMPANY I HAVE TRIED SO FAR</li>
            <li> I hold back a tablespoons worth and mix with a little honey for an afternoon treat.</li>
            <li> it can make you a little nauseous at first.</li>
            <li> One negative thing that I can say about the product is that the raw foods manifesto accusing the Canadian government of \\&quot;nutritional genocide\\&quot; is bizarre, it makes me wonder what sort of organization I am supporting by buying this product.</li>
            <li> They cost me less in both item and shipping costs and get here much faster since they don&#x27;t have to be shipped all the way from Canada.  </li>
            <li> I love them plain &amp; raw!</li>
            <li> If you live in the states and care about Organic vs. conventional foods, there is no reason to buy the Hemp Hearts brand.</li>
            <li> I suggest starting with a small amount (1/8 cup) and gradually building because it&#x27;s such pure protein</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t eaten that amount consistently long enough to evaluate this claim, but I think they do me some good, and I would probably be buying and consuming them in even larger quantities were they a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the cafe closed and I was without my HH until I came across it on Amazon ($4.00 more).  </li>
            <li> They are soft enough to eat raw, so there is no preparation required.</li>
            <li> eat hemp hearts with hot and cold cereals, put it on my toast, add it directly to my hot or cold main dishes, and even eat a spoonful directly out of the tub.  </li>
            <li> I developed adult onset acne then suddenly a weird facial redness that appeared but wasn&#x27;t a raised rash.</li>
            <li> If not take with lots and lots of greens this will upset your digestion and cause loose movements.</li>
            <li> now - Amazon has gotten neglectful in their packaging and the tub is a bit on the fragile side when packed with other items (such as heavy books - hello?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put a few spoon fulls in my ramen all the time, along with shrimp, carrots, peas, radishes, chicken, corn, and anything else I can find that usually makes good soup.</li>
            <li> I ordered Hemp because I am making low carb shakes for a few weeks and needed the protein &amp; fiber.</li>
            <li> A few days later, I tried another one that had some fruit on it.  </li>
            <li> It should be packaged in a foil ZipLoc type bag instead of the bucket with the lid that doesn&#x27;t snap or latch closed.  </li>
            <li> Any other health benefits are icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> Getting the container opened is a bear as stated in other comments.</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight increase in energy after a couple of weeks, but not sure it was enough to continue buying  product.</li>
            <li> Another brand I purchased, which costs less, had a some sharp, crunchy hulls and this brand does not.</li>
            <li> If it has a lot of hulls, then it&#x27;s not worth the lower price</li>
            <li> It has a slightly nutty flavor but does not interfere with the taste of the food</li>
            <li> a slight nutty touch.  </li>
            <li> or I would have used 1-2 Tsp instead of the Oat bran for less carbs, but it was still yummy &amp; filling.)</li>
            <li> just wish it was a little cheaper</li>
            <li> If they knocked down the price, they would have a customer for life!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been complaining for a few months</li>
            <li> Few times in my haste I&#x60;ve forgotten to add scoops to my (non-vegetarian) husband&#x27;s shakes which he would notice and ask me to please add.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted to say after years of trying weight loss products and wasted dollars this has to be the safest and healthiest way of controlling hunger and weight.</li>
            <li> Add sweetener of choice (I used splenda or Truvia) &amp; 1-2 Tbsp heavy cream.</li>
            <li> I get the same sustained energy from Nutiva shelled hemp seeds, which are a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li> So it is hard to find something to put it in that you can get down.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product a few times in the past.</li>
            <li> I had left them sitting on a shelf for a few months, and decided I should use them up,as they were quite expensive.</li>
            <li> And because we wanted to like them so bad, my husband experimented 4 times to see if this time he would really get a headache again</li>
            <li> thinking that they were competitively priced and that Canada was the only place you could purchase hemp seeds from since they are illegal to grow in the U.S.  </li>
            <li> Held off the hungries WAY past lunchtime for me!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t eat much wheat or any dairy, and I get sick of eating legumes.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about them, and my husband didn&#x27;t care for them, but I did occasionally eat one.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to keep finding these black \\&quot;rocks\\&quot; in the mix that were definitely not hemp seeds or leftover seed shells.  </li>
            <li> I sprinkle them either on my cereal or in my yogurt for breakfast and the energy level I feel is unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical as I thought it was illegal down in the \\&quot;states\\&quot; but have now found out it is only illegal to grow them as they are for sale accross the U.S.</li>
            <li> 2: These are very expensive in comparison to other brands.  </li>
            <li> The fruit was so tough, I couldn&#x27;t chew it.</li>
            <li> Mr. Snow e-mailed me a very rude, and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why a tighter seal after opening would be difficult, but this does not have it.</li>
            <li> nasty letter on May 20th.</li>
            <li> denied that their product would go stale and said their product is quite edible for 2 years.  </li>
            <li> and my body suffers from the sporadic eating habits I have developed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I got bad gas</li>
            <li> I e-mailed the manager at Rocky Mtn.on May 14th and advised him that I could not find an expiry date anywhere, and couldn&#x27;t understand why these had gone bad.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if this is how badly he treats all his customers, but I know that I will never again purchase Rocky Mtn. products, even from a store.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Hulls are annoying.</li>
            <li> This one had Macadamia nuts on it which tasted so awful</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good taste, love the crunch, and they do help with constipation.  Did get to wondering since they have a lot of protein, how much is too much.</li>
            <li> Ordered this based on the positive reviews, it is a nice topping for cereal or yogurt. I can&#x27;t rate the health claims as we only use it like wheat germ but it has a great flavor and texture.      I agree with the other reviewers who pointed out the packaging needs improvement and it is a kind of pricy substitute for wheat germ. Outside of that a good product. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I make a breakfast drink every day that includes 1/4 cup Rocky Mountain Hemp Hearts.  I feel satisfied and full for many hours AND I feel more healthy.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find Hemp Hearts at Amazon at such a good price. I love the taste and include them in my oatmeal in the morning and even on top of my fried or scrambled eggs. Can also be added to a slice of bread with peanut butter. Sometimes I even eat them straight from the spoon. They remind me very much of sunflower seeds, as far as flavor goes. I will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> I love the hemp hearts - but the packaging could be improved a bit.  My first order opened in the shipping box.  I will still recommend this product, but the packaging needs to be modified.</li>
            <li> I have used these hemp hearts, now, for three containers worth and they are every bit as energizing and healthful as I could wish. The only problem I have is that they are in a container with a lid that does not clip on at all. It simply sits on the top of the container.  If it is bumped, it spills.  If it is, heaven forfend, knocked out of the refrigerator, it&#x27;s all over the floor.  I don&#x27;t know why a tighter seal after opening would be difficult, but this does not have it. Be sure to refrigerate it!  My first container mildewed in about 10 days.  Ick!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve re-ordered Hemp Hearts - and love to add them to salads, steamed veggies and banana/coconut/sunflower seeds and cream in the morning with honey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THAT said - and I&#x27;ve been complaining for a few months now - Amazon has gotten neglectful in their packaging and the tub is a bit on the fragile side when packed with other items (such as heavy books - hello?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise - I love the nutty taste - and gives a texture to a veggie or fruit meal.  I&#x27;ve always found the hemp hearts from this company to be fresh and the product dates to be well-marked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Amazon&#x27;s packaging has improved a bit in the last couple shipments - glad to see it - I love the convenience of shopping with them.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and getting it online is a few buck cheaper than at the one store in my area that carries it. LIFE IS GOOD!</li>
            <li> This is a considerably energizing product that&#x27;s a complete protein. It&#x27;s very good when mixed into a shake or smoothie, sprinkled onto a salad, added to oatmeal or other cereal, sprinkled on veggies, etc. It has a slightly nutty flavor but does not interfere with the taste of the food it&#x27;s being added to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with the Rocky Mountain hemp hearts is that they appear to be horrendously overpriced, thus I gave them four stars only. I get the same sustained energy from Nutiva shelled hemp seeds, which are a lot less expensive. Bottom line: hemp seeds (hearts) are an excellent addition to one&#x27;s diet. Just shop around to get the best price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other hemp seeds and all of them contained more hulls than I liked.  Hulls are annoying. They stick in your teeth, irritate your throat and very much take away from the delicious and healthy experience one should get from hemp seeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hemp hearts I ordered didn&#x27;t seem to contain any hulls. They were delicious and pleasant to eat.  Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Rocky Mountain Hemp Hearts have a great taste.  I have ordered them a couple of times and used them a number of ways as have other reviewers, but favorite recipe is to add to a smoothie.  They taste great and I have never found a hull. I was introduced to them by a local smoothie place which charges about $2 for a scoop, so I decided to find and buy my own and did on Amazon.  I agree with the a couple of other reviewers,: 1-The lid of the container does come off too easily, so I wish Rocky Mountain would provide a container with a more secure top. 2: These are very expensive in comparison to other brands.  After reading reviews, i have decided to try Nutiva. If it has a lot of hulls, then it&#x27;s not worth the lower price and I&#x27;ll  I&#x27;ll post an update.&lt;br /&gt;* Suggestion for Rocky Mountain: lower the price and place them in a bag and customers can transfer to their own containers as most do anyway.</li>
            <li> I especially enjoy these sprinkled on a salad--they add a very nice flavor and texture both. I also use them in fruit smoothies (makes them creamy) and as a topping on lots of things, sometimes as a replacement for grated cheese or bread crumbs when topping baked goods.  Besides tasting good I believe they have health benefits, and seem very digestible and sustaining. The package strongly suggests that if I were to consume 4-5 heaping tablespoons of these every morning most of my life&#x27;s problems would be solved. I haven&#x27;t eaten that amount consistently long enough to evaluate this claim, but I think they do me some good, and I would probably be buying and consuming them in even larger quantities were they a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and I&#x27;ve been using it for about six months.   I add it to my protein drink, it almost liquifies with a hand blender.   The price however, which once was pretty reasonable, has jumped 15% !!   Even with Prime/free shipping it is overpriced now. I shall be    buying it elsewhere from now on, but I won&#x27;t stop buying it.</li>
            <li> I used to buy Hemp Hearts from Rocky Mountain.  They came in handy little plastic buckets that were quite the pain to get open (kind of like prying open a plastic paint bucket, only smaller).  They tasted fine as far as hemp seeds go.  I was disappointed to keep finding these black \\&quot;rocks\\&quot; in the mix that were definitely not hemp seeds or leftover seed shells.  When I called in to inquire about it, they basically told me that they were harmless and that they occurred naturally in the process of producing the shelled hemp seeds.  (Essentially, \\&quot;deal with it\\&quot;.)  I continued to buy from them thinking that they were competitively priced and that Canada was the only place you could purchase hemp seeds from since they are illegal to grow in the U.S.  I found out very quickly searching the internet that there are many sources, including many Organic varieties, which are less expensive and don&#x27;t have any of these \\&quot;naturally occurring rocks\\&quot;.  I now prefer Nutiva Organic Shelled Hemp Seeds.  They cost me less in both item and shipping costs and get here much faster since they don&#x27;t have to be shipped all the way from Canada.  If you live in the states and care about Organic vs. conventional foods, there is no reason to buy the Hemp Hearts brand.</li>
            <li> I first came across this product last year at my local wellness cafe and instantly fell in love.  Being a Vegetarian for over 25 years, breakfast was always the most challenging part of my meals.  After finding the Hemp Hearts (HH), it became a part of my morning schedule.  I would go to the cafe to buy berries, reds or greens shakes with two table spoons of HH ...YUMMY!  After drinking the smooth and tasty shakes I felt full and energized.  I was able to exercise for one hour to two hours each morning and just hydrate until my next meal at lunch.  My morning shakes routine became a budget buster and I began buying the tub from the cafe and made my own tasty creations.  Sadly, the cafe closed and I was without my HH until I came across it on Amazon ($4.00 more).  I feel that the HH is so beneficial to my lifestyle that I will purchase it from Amazon despite the higher price.  I would highly recommend HH.  It blends really well and gives an otherwise ordinary shake full body without making a big impact on the flavor...a slight nutty touch.  Few times in my haste I&#x60;ve forgotten to add scoops to my (non-vegetarian) husband&#x27;s shakes which he would notice and ask me to please add.  Yes, I know that is criticizable; he is \\&quot;lost\\&quot; in the kitchen ... LOVE him!  You can add it to salads, on veggie sandwiches, fresh berries drizzles with honey for a fun snack, sprinkle on yogurts or just grab a handful straight up to chow down  my non vegetarian kids like eating it that way)..  HH is my fuel for my body.  Another bonus is that I feel a smooth regular move the next day. Cheers to you and smooth drinking!</li>
            <li> Rocky Mountain Hemp Hearts are THE BEST ever! You can&#x27;t get any better!! I have delt with this company and there is absolutely no one more sincere about their product! These are wonderful in smoothies, salads, baked goods...anything!! I love them plain &amp; raw! Wanna know more about how much I love these? Write me at ANAD MIDDLE GEORGIA on face book! I would love to see you there! Many Blessings, Tamy</li>
            <li> These hemp hearts have a light, nutty flavor and are easily added to your current diet. They are soft enough to eat raw, so there is no preparation required. Healthy and delicious!</li>
            <li> Hemp Hearts are a great source of protein ! I have 1/4 cup every morning and they are totally satisfying and taste great. They also curb my craving for sweets !! I suggest starting with a small amount (1/8 cup) and gradually building because it&#x27;s such pure protein it can make you a little nauseous at first.</li>
            <li> These are high quality hemp hearts, a great source of protein, and an easy way to assure nutrition and to fisatisfy hunger for several hours. I mix them in vegetable juice and drink them daily.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon Hemp Hearts at a health food store in Wisconsin (Basics in Janesville) and decided to try them out after reading the literature.  I love them!  I sprinkle them either on my cereal or in my yogurt for breakfast and the energy level I feel is unbelievable!  They also completely fill you up so I have lost 10+ lbs in 6 weeks...I should add I am counting calories and exercising daily as well, but net net I give the hemp hearts a huge THUMBS UP!  If you tried flaxseed and just couldn&#x27;t get into them, hemp hearts are for you.  They taste nutty and really are doing wonders for my health.  Rocky Mountain is the brand we like and Amazon fulfills the orders so what&#x27;s not to like?!?!  I highly recommend them to get your health and energy back on track.</li>
            <li> I have used Rocky Mountain Hemp Hearts for several months, starting with a sample. 4-5 tablespoons of these powerful little seeds kept me free from craving sugary snacks mid afternoon and most days I only ate a dinner salad because it was a habit, not from hunger. Doing my own personal science experiment and eating this way, in six days I lost six pounds and kept them off. I love being free from sugar cravings and the need for a pick me up so plan to continue consuming the hemp hearts. Any other health benefits are icing on the cake. Another brand I purchased, which costs less, had a some sharp, crunchy hulls and this brand does not. It&#x27;s Rocky Mountain Hemp Hearts for me!</li>
            <li> These are the best for a great high protein snack. Love it in the morning with Hemp milk.</li>
            <li> Great product! Tastes awesome, is great in salad, cooked with stir fries, on sandwiches, or just straight up with a spoon! It&#x27;s a great source of natural energy! Love it!</li>
            <li> First, I have to say I think the flavor is very strong and not pleasant. So it is hard to find something to put it in that you can get down. I found vanilla yogurt worked, but not for the amount that is recommended. That overpowers even the  yogurt. One, maybe two tablespoons are palatable.   I noticed a slight increase in energy after a couple of weeks, but not sure it was enough to continue buying  product. I did NOT lose weight, which was the main reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> I started eating these several months ago.  I have seen significant improvement in my skin.  I developed adult onset acne then suddenly a weird facial redness that appeared but wasn&#x27;t a raised rash. I am someone who historically not had skin problems.  My hair started thinning and that was scaring me.  Decided to try the Hemp Hearts and besides their delicious nutty flavor, they improved my skin and my hair STOPPED falling out!!  I think 4T would be too much for me.  I started with 2T then to 3T...went back to 2.  3T causes to much bowel action.  But each has to find their own comfort zone.</li>
            <li> I find the flavor to be most similar to sunflower seeds, but these are softer and about the size of sesame seeds.  I haven&#x27;t encountered any hulls at all so far.  I keep them in the fridge to keep the oils from oxidizing and acquiring a rancid flavor.  One negative thing that I can say about the product is that the raw foods manifesto accusing the Canadian government of \\&quot;nutritional genocide\\&quot; is bizarre, it makes me wonder what sort of organization I am supporting by buying this product.</li>
            <li> A good friend of mine recommends that I take this product &amp; swears by it that it really improves your health. SO I purchased 1 container of soft hemp hearts. I have to say that it does work if you stick to a regimen of taking it every day. It actually tastes pretty good tastes nutty. Which is fine by me since I cannot eat nuts. I would recommend anyone who wants to up their protein intake, take this product.</li>
            <li> Someone suggested this as a good healthy supplement; we ordered it and use a spoonful every morning on our cereal. We are very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> These are very very good tasting, but they are very expensive.  This is the only reason for the four star rating.</li>
            <li> I really researched about Hemp Hearts and then went to Amazon to get best price. I have been very satisfied with the product I ordered and will be ordering again soon. I also have recommended this to others</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this company&#x27;s hemp hearts and hemp bars, but after my husband got a headache after every time he ate them and I got bad gas, we didn&#x27;t even feel good giving them away. And because we wanted to like them so bad, my husband experimented 4 times to see if this time he would really get a headache again and he would. All the health benefits sound good, but I guess not for us.</li>
            <li> This are awesome.  I mix them with my oatmeal in the morning and I&#x27;m good to go for most of the day, a light lunch is all I need.  I hold back a tablespoons worth and mix with a little honey for an afternoon treat. They are so good I want to eat them just straight...and do!  I will def be ordering more.</li>
            <li> YUMMY! these are the only hemp seed I&#x27;ve tried so I can&#x27;t compare them but they have a great nutty flavor. Yummy in Nutella to eat with apples, yumy in cream cheese for bagels, yummy in yogurt. I&#x27;ve been eating these and taking hemp oil pills but my joints seem to be operating better with less pain, I have had a decrease in appetite but have lost no weight. I&#x27;ve been doing this for about a month now and will keep it up.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended HH so I got this one. Liked it fine, put in my green  smoothies. Tasted just fine.</li>
            <li> For those who are wondering, these have a flavor similar to slivered almonds, but milder, and a soft, squishy texture.  They seem like they would be great for a gluten-free tabbouleh or anywhere you&#x27;d use shredded coconut for texture.</li>
            <li> The picture shows that it is in a bag, which I was glad to see since this is my second time ordering these. While the seeds are delicious themselves, it came again in this weird little bucket container that is the absolute saddest excuse of a container I have ordered on here yet. Its like a mini bucket with a plastic lid that can&#x27;t even properly close. This second order arrived opened in the box, seeds spilled all over the inside.</li>
            <li> These seeds are very nutritious and delicious! We put them in our smoothies, salads and yogurt all the time. They are a great source of natural fats and protein. The flavor is wonderful, a nice mix of nutty and seedy. When blended they are very smooth, but when sprinkled on yogurt, salad, etc they are lightly crunchy and have a very nice texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much more to say about these. We love them and will continue ordering!</li>
            <li> I put a few spoon fulls in my ramen all the time, along with shrimp, carrots, peas, radishes, chicken, corn, and anything else I can find that usually makes good soup. The hemp hearts add a nice texture and flavor to the ramen.</li>
            <li> My son told me about these, they are tasty and are great for your digestive health as well.</li>
            <li> I discovered this fantastic natural nutrition through my daughter who is a Pilates instructor. At first I was skeptical but after ten days of eating hemp hearts on my strawberries and sprinkling them on my salad daily my clothes fit better and my friends have noticed a change in my appearance. I find that I am not craving sweets or snacks between meals. I just wanted to say after years of trying weight loss products and wasted dollars this has to be the safest and healthiest way of controlling hunger and weight.</li>
            <li> I love hemp hearts, I have more energy and just an overall better attitude.  I find myself in a much better mood and spend a lot more time laughing.  Although I haven&#x27;t lost much weight yet, I will continue to include them in my daily diet.</li>
            <li> I use the hemp hearts to supplement my protein.  I recently cut back on my meat intake about 70-80% per week, and the hemp hearts have helped with my transition.  I didn&#x27;t want to rely entirely on soy substitutes.  I don&#x27;t eat much wheat or any dairy, and I get sick of eating legumes.  Hemp hearts helped substitute my protein and give me some additional and much-needed nutrition.  I usually eat the hemp hearts for breakfast, which does leave me pretty satisfied till lunch.  For me, starting out with a good source of protein jump starts a better eating pattern the rest of the day.  My metabolism is noticeably better, as long as I keep a regular schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eat hemp hearts with hot and cold cereals, put it on my toast, add it directly to my hot or cold main dishes, and even eat a spoonful directly out of the tub.  I pack some with me when I travel.  They&#x27;re yummy.</li>
            <li> great price, fast shipping, fresh seeds.  I was very pleased with the taste and texture of these hemp seeds.  I had them with my cereal in the morning and it helped me easily get through my day until lunch.</li>
            <li> Hemp hearts are just in general a great food to keep around the house. Everyone likes them and it&#x27;s a great way to get more good-for-you foods in your diet.</li>
            <li> Really good product and value.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel any benefits from this.  When package arrived, seeds were scattered all over the inside of the box.</li>
            <li> I love this especially with my cereal...just wish it was a little cheaper I would have bought more. It didnt really help curb my appetite as the reason I initially bought it but I love it.</li>
            <li> gives you alot of get up go</li>
            <li> I love hemp hearts on my oatmeal. It is very filling. I love the product but it is very pricey.</li>
            <li> The hemp hearts were from a different company than pictured and the texture and taste are not the same.  I am sending back the unopened packages.  Very disappointing.  Rocky Mountain Hemp hearts were not sent but another brand.  Was refunded my money but it cost me $6 in shipping and $14.00 to return package.</li>
            <li> Love putting this in my smoothies or just a cup of yogurt.  Use it a lot in cooked meals</li>
            <li> I ordered Hemp because I am making low carb shakes for a few weeks and needed the protein &amp; fiber. After reading the hemp story online about the guy basically being able to clean out his system with the stuff, I thought \\&quot;At last! Something that will work with my sluggish metabolism!\\&quot; Annnd, I was right! Gave me the extra protein I needed and kept things moving like clockwork! I even created a great \\&quot;hot cereal\\&quot; for change: 2 Tbsp Flax meal, 5 Tbsp Hemp, 1 Tbsp Oat Bran (I didn&#x27;t have shredded coconut or I would have used 1-2 Tsp instead of the Oat bran for less carbs, but it was still yummy &amp; filling.) 3/4- 1 cup hot water, mix, let sit for about a min, mix again. Add sweetener of choice (I used splenda or Truvia) &amp; 1-2 Tbsp heavy cream. Held off the hungries WAY past lunchtime for me!&lt;br /&gt;I bought Chia seeds later to compare, and Chia couldn&#x27;t hold a candle to what Hemp hearts did for me! I LOVE Hemp hearts. I would use it every day if it weren&#x27;t so darn expensive!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I would give this product 5 stars, but the price is the only draw back! If they knocked down the price, they would have a customer for life!</li>
            <li> Not the same product as shown in picture. What I got was not what I was led to believe I ordered</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product a few times in the past. Recieved a different brand in a 1 pound bag.</li>
            <li> If not take with lots and lots of greens this will upset your digestion and cause loose movements. Use lightly with lots of greens.</li>
            <li> Deliciously! Fresh and great nutty taste!</li>
            <li> hemp hearts good for the heart actually works well with all types of food and helps curb appetite, keeps you full longr, would recommend</li>
            <li> Wow, they have given me so much energy.  Also, I believe that they have helped improve my health. Also, very tasty with hot cereal.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT - VERY GOOD FIBER AND SOMEWHAT FILLING,  I PUT 2-3 TBLS IN MY SMOOTHY IN THE MORNING.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE ONLY COMPANY I HAVE TRIED SO FAR BUT PERSONALLY REALLY LIKE THEM</li>
            <li> I had been purchasing plastic containers of Hemp Hearts from Rocky Mtn.in Alberta for many years, and was totally satisfied.  I later heard about the bars, so ordered a case of them, as I heard they would be good for losing weight.  I wasn&#x27;t crazy about them, and my husband didn&#x27;t care for them, but I did occasionally eat one. I had left them sitting on a shelf for a few months, and decided I should use them up,as they were quite expensive. I tried eating one.  This one had Macadamia nuts on it which tasted so awful,I thought I would throw up. A few days later, I tried another one that had some fruit on it.  The fruit was so tough, I couldn&#x27;t chew it. I e-mailed the manager at Rocky Mtn.on May 14th and advised him that I could not find an expiry date anywhere, and couldn&#x27;t understand why these had gone bad. I suggested he either send me some new product as a replacement for the bars I still had, or send me the equivalent amount of Hemp Hearts in plastic containers, or send me a refund. I had no reply after a week, so e-mailed him again May 19th. Mr. Snow e-mailed me a very rude, and nasty letter on May 20th. He accused me of saying that all his products were substandard. I said nothing of the sort, and had told him I was very pleased with the Hemp Hearts I had been purchasing from them in the past.&lt;br /&gt;He denied that their product would go stale and said their product is quite edible for 2 years.  He said a Best before date is not required. He said he would not ship to me again, so he would give me a refund, but not a credit. After a substantial amount of time went by, I still had not heard anything, or received a refund, so I sent him a letter. It&#x27;s been over 2 months since I first contacted Mr.Snow, and I have had no reply, nor a refund, nor any replacement product.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this is how badly he treats all his customers, but I know that I will never again purchase Rocky Mtn. products, even from a store.</li>
            <li> I received my hemp hearts very quickly.  I had been reading up on them and since I am trying to improve my nutrition to help combat an autoimmune illness, I felt these would be great for me.  I seldom eat meat, and since I am being truthful here, I really seldom eat.  I don&#x27;t always feel well enough to do so and my body suffers from the sporadic eating habits I have developed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased a small refrigerator and put it in my bedroom so that I had no excuses about not being able to go downstairs to make something to eat.  I stocked it full of yogurt, cottage cheese, fruits, and green juice that I try to keep made up.  I feel if I consume those things in addition to the hemp hearts, I&#x27;m doing a much better job of maintaining my nutrition.  Eventually, I hope to have enough energy to go downstairs every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put some of the hemp hearts on top of my Greek yogurt last night and it was really delicious.  I plan to buy a larger volume next time because I know these will be a staple in my diet from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting the taste to be what it is.  It is very similar to sunflower seeds and really yummy!  I would recommend these to anyone interested in improving their nutrition.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and great price!  Love it!!! I use these in baking and even on cereal ... great flavor and full of nutrients that are good for the body and soul!</li>
            <li> My first reaction was that they were delicious as I sampled some in a Health Store in Kenora, Ontario, Canada while on a recent trip.  The store owner was very helpful and gave my friend and I paperwork explaining the benefits of adding Hemp Hearts into our diet. I was skeptical as I thought it was illegal down in the \\&quot;states\\&quot; but have now found out it is only illegal to grow them as they are for sale accross the U.S. I was amazed by the amount of protein especially Iron per 2 ounces is 36% Fiber per 2 ounces is 12% and healthy Omega 6 &amp; Omega 3 are excellent. I am trying them as I have various health issues and I simply need to begin eating healthier.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT rates 10 stars.  Container rates ZERO.  I love this product &amp; put it in everything. It is, by far the best brand out there but BEWARE-as soon as you open it-PUT IT IN A CONTAINER THAT HAS A SECURE LID, especially if you have kids using your fridge/freezer.  If not, you&#x27;ll see your $20 spill all over the kitchen floor.  It should be packaged in a foil ZipLoc type bag instead of the bucket with the lid that doesn&#x27;t snap or latch closed.  That aside, I don&#x27;t buy my Hemp Hearts from anywhere else.  Excellent Product.</li>
            <li> Great I keep it in the fridge for maintaining the freshness. Usage on cereals mostly and sometimes on smoothies.Taste is more on  the nutty side not tart or bitter.</li>
            <li> A different brand of hemp hearts was sent, not the ones that are pictured. I wish I had read all the comments before ordering.</li>
            <li> I like the nutty flavor; ease of use, the increased energy, and regularity. I have not eliminated all starches as suggested, but feel it is an added plus to my diet and yes I would recommend this product.  Getting the container opened is a bear as stated in other comments.</li>
            <li> Found these hemp hearts at a health food store in Michigan. The value is amazing for the large tub and these are the best hemp hearts I have ever had. I also bought the powder and flakes, I cannot wait to get more. I use all 3 products in smoothies,salads,breakfast bowls etc. I have been using hemp products for a few years and I just think its one of the best ways to get protein,fats,amino acids. great for anyone who is into muscle building</li>
            <li> This is the only brand I trust and they taste great in or by themselves. This a great way to get protein and extra energy. I keep mine n the refrigerator to preserve freshness.</li>
            <li> Man o man these little guys are good! First time for both me and my wife and we&#x27;re both big fans. They&#x27;re great by themselves and especially good thrown into salads. The container that they come in is kind of wimpy though (especially the top). No problem, just toss them into a tupperware type container and all is good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these repeatedly. They taste great and are packed with nutrition. You can add them to yogurt, sprinkle on salad or eat alone. Delicious and healthy.</li>
            <li> We live in a rural area and am glad to be able to get this and the quality is good.</li>
