            <li>I say, don&#x27;t listen to the critics--this product will save you hundreds if not thousands for just yourself and if you have daughters like I do the savings are remarkable</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easier for me cut my own hair!</li>

            <li>and it looks good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;CreaClip&#x27;s material quality is also good.</li>
            <li>But thats actually a good thing if you have wavy hair, rather than straight(as shown in the instructional videos), otherwise you might have felt the pulling while sliding the clip when balancing the level.</li>
            <li>However I have watched all the videos on how to use it and have good expectations moving forward.</li>
            <li>great product for starters just learning to cut ur own hair.</li>
            <li>The cut is even and looks good.</li>
            <li>You just might discover that it can help save you money while letting you keep your hair style looking good without having to go to a salon and paying someone else to cut your hair..</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>

            <li>I was a bit hesitant about ordering the CreaClip and being able to cut my own hair....</li>
            <li>&#x3D;) Item was also received on time, packaged nicely, &amp; tracking provided.</li>
            <li>But the Creaclip made it fast and easy my bangs came out perfect and in no time at all .  </li>
            <li>Looks like it works great on the right hair.</li>
            <li>I must say, it really is as easy as they show you!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and will save a lot of money!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trimming my own hair for years, but never felt brave enough to give myself a good cut on my own.</li>
            <li>However the results are better than most salons, since I know my own hair.</li>
            <li>I am pretty proud of my layered&lt;br /&gt;haircut.</li>
            <li>, I thought it looked too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>A good tool to have and pays for itself quickly.</li>
            <li>Love it, super easy to use and great results.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to use on my own hair.</li>
            <li>This is a good product if you like to cut your own hear like we do, work very well to make things very easy to cut and style the way you would like.</li>
            <li>daughter&#x27;s hair is more Fine in texture and it cuts her bangs well and her length comes out nice and even.</li>
            <li>I especially love the smaller clip for the bangs.</li>
            <li>Love the CREACLIP.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased..</li>
            <li>I love the V cut</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was able to keep my length and give myself layers, at the salon I always say to keep my length</li>
            <li>The CreaClip is FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE the way it looks.  </li>
            <li>It might be better if you have longer hair that is more forgiving than mine.  </li>
            <li>You can use an electric hair trimmer or scissors  to cut the hair flush to the clip, resulting in more volume and blunt cut layers.</li>
            <li>You can always take off more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased I ended up getting this product.  </li>
            <li>i believe that it is an okay product</li>
            <li>Ordered it, tried it, LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done two cuts now with it, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE my hair now.</li>
            <li>would be better if someone else helped you</li>
            <li>Most hairstylists don&#x27;t seem to listen well and also suggest hairstyles that I don&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li>I decided to cut my hair when it was damp, I figured this will give me a more even cut as that&#x27;s what they do in beauty salons.  </li>
            <li>I knew that I had more split ends to get rid of, so once again I&#x27;ve dampen my hair, and this time cut off additional 2 inches.  </li>
            <li>I love the CreaClip!&lt;br</li>
            <li>And of course everytime I cut more than I should.  </li>
            <li>We followed this and were really pleased.  </li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>Love the CreaClip.</li>
            <li>I just cut it real quick</li>
            <li>My trick was to use hair spray to help grip the clip better.</li>
            <li>I Love my creaclip</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the Creaclip for about a year and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I like this haircut I gave myself better than any salon cut I have ever gotten.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>My work was 1000 times better than CreapyClip....</li>
            <li>Love it does the work.</li>
            <li>I did double check after bath and it was perfect.  </li>
            <li>More brush like inside the clip would be more help.</li>
            <li>I watched more videos/read more reviews</li>
            <li>Afterwards I manually trimmed a couple strands, and my hair looks fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Love it now</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>i get the look that I want for free (well, for a one time price of 29.99!).</li>
            <li>We love how it creates layers.  </li>
            <li>My two-decade-long search for the perfect hairdresser is finally over!</li>
            <li>Bought many hair enhancements, curlers etc.</li>
            <li>you may not be satisfied</li>
            <li>I just love my CreaClip</li>
            <li>absolutely LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>/&gt; After taking a bit off, I cut more.</li>
            <li>is so much more better than getting it cut at a salon because I can do it whenever I want.  </li>
            <li>So if that&#x27;s a problem,  you&#x27;ll love this.&lt;br /&gt;Heck</li>
            <li>There are so many ways I can trim my hair with this.</li>
            <li>I prefer the V in the back and this clip gives me the perfect cut every time.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m not terribly cautious when it comes to beauty products.</li>
            <li>Love this...works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>And the &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; shape look this gives to the back of my hair is perfect.</li>
            <li>I love my hair.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m looking forward to more practice with the CreaClip.  </li>
            <li>It took me over an hour to get it to where I was satisfied.  </li>
            <li>But I think it&#x27;s much better than the hit or miss haircuts I get at GreatClips and the likes.  </li>
            <li>And I like the idea of being able to cut my hair without the hassle of scheduling and arranging babysitting.  </li>
            <li>I love this for trims &amp; layering.</li>
            <li>My hair looks a lot healthier and i love the way the layers look.  </li>
            <li>This works ok, although you have to do additional trimming using your fingers after you use it, to even out the front part of the hair</li>
            <li>She and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>, i thought ur hand is better than using it...</li>
            <li>If you know what you are doing though, its probably ok.</li>
            <li>... now I get as many layers as I want, when I want.</li>
            <li>I bought this mostly to use on my bangs but found that I could also use it to keep split ends at bay.  </li>
            <li>I am going to watch YouTube tutorial videos to become more efficient.</li>
            <li>I love these, they are already saving me tons of $$$ and trips to the salon.  </li>
            <li>The V shape it makes in the back can be a bit pronounced but it works perfect for me curly hair.</li>
            <li>My wonderful husband is now my personal stylist</li>
            <li>I have used several methods, but none of them produced the results I wanted, until I found this awesome product.</li>
            <li>I bought this after my favorite hair stylist moved away.</li>
            <li>I love the creaclips that I have.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>The bangs still looked cute, but they were not what I was going for.</li>
            <li>It would be way better to go to a qualified hairstylist to cut your hair into the shape you want it to begin with.</li>
            <li>You just throw your hair over your head and attach the Clips, make sure it&#x27;s level</li>
            <li>Even, though I kinda botched the cut, it still looks ok.  </li>
            <li>Love this product is money saver</li>
            <li>I was hoping that it would be made with a more durable material.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like for more detail instruction to be provided.</li>
            <li>I know it has alot more uses</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>also love the cost savings</li>
            <li>and I thought ok maybe just maybe this clip makes sense, and who wouldnt want to save money on salon visits.  </li>
            <li>and they always charge more for it).  </li>
            <li>There are many ways to use the clip.  </li>
            <li>You can use it on the sides to makes them even or on top of your head to even out all your hair.  </li>
            <li>Is this product powered by magic?</li>
            <li>My grandma even bought one after me telling her about it. :)</li>
            <li>Since purchasing the CreaClip, my hair has become healthy and glossy.</li>
            <li>I thought I would use it just for trims, but have now found I like my cuts so much better</li>
            <li>and of course the healthy hair.</li>
            <li>This helps me get a neater, more even cut with more defined layers than the ponytail method did.  </li>
            <li>I get complimented on my haircut was able to do a stack with it.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I practice more I will be able to master it.</li>
            <li>I ended up just eyeballing it instead of using this tool and it seemed to work better for me.</li>
            <li>They serve their purpose, are easy to use and clean, and feel fairly sturdy.</li>
            <li>My wife has been able to take care of split ends and that stuff with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it saves me a trip to the salon</li>
            <li>Other than that it works great, it s a great idea...</li>
            <li>I was very excited to order it and try it.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>It certainly helped me style and cut my own hair and my children too!</li>
            <li>I am sure that the layers are not as good as they would be if done in a salon, but I like being able to trim and shape my hair whenever I want to, and the results look good enough to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only consolation is that I could cut the damaged hair more often-since I own the creaclip!!</li>
            <li>Creaclip is easy to use,and very accurate because of the spirit-level.</li>
            <li>I do not completely understand how this thing does what it does, but it has given me the best cut I have ever had.</li>
            <li>The haircuts have been great so far, but I would love to see more style options / cuting options for this product.</li>
            <li>Once again, a pretty good result.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes he did a pretty good job but also messed it up at times too.</li>
            <li>Yes I know - almost 3 years have passed - but there is a very good reason for the delayed review - more of which later.....</li>
            <li>soo worth the investment!!</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair and very long, and this product is perfect for giving me that V shape I like.</li>
            <li>I love it because it is easy to use it, and it help me alot when I cut my hair</li>
            <li>Its easy to use, and if you need more assistance, the company has helpful videos on YouTube.</li>
            <li>Good invention but wish it was priced more reasonably....</li>
            <li>All you need is a good pair of professional shears and you can be your own hairdresser.  </li>
            <li>You can always cut more once you get more comfortable with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can always cut more once you get more comfortable with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says; easy to use, keep clean, and a great result every time.</li>
            <li>People can&#x27;t believe I cut my own hair, and I love being able to get my hair exactly the way I want it, without worrying about what some stylist will interpret as what I want.  </li>
            <li>Mai Lieu very kindly sent me these amazing Creaclips way back in December 2010.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still a really great buy, there&#x27;s videos on YouTube as well for more styling tips and tricks from customers and professional hair stylists, although in my opinion, this clip could easily put stylists out of business.</li>
            <li>this is the best product I&#x27;ve found, better than any other trimmers or layering.</li>
            <li>just needs better quality (it&#x27;s not that cheap after all).</li>
            <li>I had a fantastic hairdresser for many years.  </li>
            <li>This haircut is considered more advanced with the CreaClip</li>
            <li>so I had to find something I could mostly do myself at home and cheap.</li>
            <li>really looks good.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s kind of fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was so easy, great cut, even, not choppy.  </li>
            <li>Their youtube account is filled with instructive, easy to follow how-to videos for your favorite cuts.</li>
            <li>OK I usually never fall for the seen on TV gadgets, but I read alot of good reviews here and even watched some youtube videos</li>
            <li>Her haircut looks perfectly professional and very nice.  </li>
            <li>Her haircut looks perfectly professional and very nice.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s super easy to use!</li>
            <li>This is the best $30 I ever spent!</li>
            <li>Perfect for helping me cut and style hair, wigs, weaves which is hard to do on your own head.</li>
            <li>and this makes it easy to get that layers that make my hair look thicker.</li>
            <li>Easy Breezy..</li>
            <li>Just as easy as the demonstration videos on the website.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried to layer with it, but I can see by the instructional videos and how easily it worked on my trim, that layering will be a breeze.</li>
            <li>After the confusion,Once I got the hang it was so easy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was SO EASY.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I will ever get another hair cut again, this was just so unbelievably easy.</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly (today, in fact), and I immediately put it to use.</li>
            <li>I have to say, this thing is really, really easy to use.</li>
            <li>My hair is even and I love that with the youtube videos I can try all kinds of styles if I feel brave enough...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to use, plus there are all sorts of CreaClip &#x27;how to&#x27; videos over on YouTube</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so easy to use</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and saves me time and money going to the salon.</li>
            <li>This was so easy to do.</li>
            <li>This product works as specified and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use it.</li>
            <li>The product is made of surdy plastic and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>, IT IS EASY TO USE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident that it would be great for short looks as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use on myself.  </li>
            <li>Not as easy as it looks</li>
            <li>Not quite as easy as they make it look in the videos.</li>
            <li>Definitely easy to use for anyone.</li>
            <li>The styles are really easy to do.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t easy.</li>
            <li>I was very conservative with my 1st cut, just to make sure I liked the results.  </li>
            <li>Good result with full bouncy ends but pretty layers too.(Her hair was one length to begin with.)   </li>
            <li>This is fine but the &amp;#34;easy&amp;#34; claim isn&#x27;t THAT easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also notable that both clips have the built in level which swivels for true angle cuts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is exactly what this &#x27;do-it-yourselfer&#x27; needed to keep my hair looking nice and stylish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Please be your own judge;)  </li>
            <li>was a bit worried using this at first because I&#x27;ve never cut my own</li>
            <li>The level is a joke also because you better be standing perfectly straight for it to be perfectly level on your hair, if you are standing/hanging your head crooked, there goes the level accuracy on your hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never taken the time to write a review on any product before - but this is pure GENIUS!!!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good as new.</li>
            <li>Her hair is  straight,strawberry blond and fine.</li>
            <li>but seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>CreaClip works well for my fine, \\&quot;bendy\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li>my full review, complete with photos of my use of CreaClip and the happy results at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will give you THE perfect layered cut in less time than it takes to make a cup of coffee.</li>
            <li>Also, it is made of cheap crappy plastic that will break easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut my own hair in a long layered style myself, and while I did a good job...</li>
            <li>(I have fine wavy hair).  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you explain EXACTLY what and where to cut. :)</li>
            <li>For those considering it, if your hair is at all fine this might not work for you.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, curly, and I like to keep it in a chin-length bob.  </li>
            <li>I eagerly awaited its arrival and it came REALLY quickly (3 days!).</li>
            <li>and it is really quick!</li>
            <li>So when I read about CreaClip, it seemed like the solution to my problems: a fast, easy way to trim my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t as easy to use as I&#x27;d imagined, but I think with practice I&#x27;ll be able to find it useful</li>
            <li>Love love love my new creaclip!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this on my daughter&#x27;s hair next, and it was soooo easy, fast, and her hair came out even and perfect.</li>
            <li>Be sure to be conservative the first time you use the Creaclip!</li>
            <li>just make sure you straighten your hair first!</li>
            <li>had very high hopes for the creaclip, but honestly, my hair is just meh.  </li>
            <li>And of course, saving money is a huge benefit.  </li>
            <li>They were helpful for me to use the CreaClip accurately.</li>
            <li>&#x27;CreaClip&#x27;&#x27; is a cheaply produced copy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But thank God for Ms.Mai Lieu, she invented such great product.</li>
            <li>It really looked liked</li>
            <li>Light layers with some face framing bangs.  </li>
            <li>Get it, it&#x27;s worth it :)</li>
            <li>She is always available at time when I am not.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always tried to trim my own hair (just trimming the ends), but I needed a real haircut.  </li>
            <li>Using an elastic to gather my hair forward worked great for me, I may go back yo</li>
            <li>but she sent them to me free of charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are great especially when you are trimming the kids&#x27; bangs.  </li>
            <li>so cheap?</li>
            <li>and it also feels very empowering to know that I can cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The construction of the clip is very solid and mine is still in great shape.</li>
            <li>and pays for itself the first time you use it!! .....</li>
            <li>If you really want to save money and are willing to take a lot of time and perhaps already cut your own hair, you might be glad to have this tool.  </li>
            <li>It was super easy.</li>
            <li>It worked really well and was very easy to do.  </li>
            <li>It worked really well and was very easy to do.  </li>
            <li>but it really was still very easy after watching the YouTube video.  </li>
            <li>The level kept me from making any major mistakes and she loved the results.</li>
            <li>and easy to make sure its straight with the leveling bubbles.</li>
            <li>My original review was from January 2012.  </li>
            <li>i originally got it to help me cut my hair extentions</li>
            <li>Not only is this product effective, but it will also save you a bundle from spending $15 a haircut or trim and a salon!  </li>
            <li>but well worth it!</li>
            <li>I was scared to cut it because it was so long, but it turned out great.  </li>
            <li>I looked at many videos before trying this on my hair first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to experiment!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t particularly love the clip for layering, but it&#x27;s great for maintaining bangs and definitely for keeping everything straight and even.</li>
            <li>After a little more attention on the one side, I was happy with my cut.  </li>
            <li>This product is a good idea, mostly for long hair layers, bangs and trimmings, beyond that execution is only as good as you or the person helping you to cut your hair are with scissors.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you are going to be super accurate.  </li>
            <li>Overall I was pleasantly surprised and impressed.</li>
            <li>love this product, amazing how a simple idea made of plastic can work so great, use the videos online at youtube as the directions are limited.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t come out anywhere near as nice as it does when using this great little ingenious device known as the Crea Clip.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended,was very easy to use,recommend to watch video before start for beginners.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so nice to be able to quickly cut it because it starts curling up at different rates as it dries.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super happy with this product I used it right away only cut about an inch</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not discounting hair-dressers or their work, but I&#x27;m a very low-maintenance, do-it-yourself kind of gal, and this product is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used more of an eyeball approach to see if it&#x27;s exactly straight or not...</li>
            <li>Useful for basic trims, good videos to watch available on Creaclip website.</li>
            <li>The level on the clip is ok, but if you don&#x27;t hold your head perfectly straight</li>
            <li>Trim hair, provide good layers and simple styling with ease.</li>
            <li>sure what others were talking about in terms of it being flimsy, mine feels much sturdier than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>I think you can visually hold the clip up evenly and still get good results.  </li>
            <li>Cant say enough about how much I loved it before I cut all my hair off and went with the pixie look.</li>
            <li>I will try it on my kid later and see if the results are as good.</li>
            <li>I guess the thing is okay, but I didn&#x27;t really get it and decided to return it...</li>
            <li>If it came in multiple sizes for thinner or thicker hair this would be a good product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good about this.  </li>
            <li>The end result left me with frizzy hair that never looked good again.  </li>
            <li>We studied the online videos from pros and real people postings, more than once.</li>
            <li>my full review at: myreallifereviews dot com</li>
            <li>I cut some every week to keep it neat on top and on the very ends.  </li>
            <li>I have saved so much money since I don&#x27;t have to go to a salon any more.</li>
            <li>Did my bangs this weekend - not bad.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad result.  </li>
            <li>IT gave her beautiful layers down the sides.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is really wonderful for people who are comfortable cutting their own hair, parents with children who need quick trims, or even just trims between salon visits.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is really wonderful for people who are comfortable cutting their own hair, parents with children who need quick trims, or even just trims between salon visits.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve saved so much money on haircuts thanks to this !!!!</li>
            <li>It did give me nice layers on my hair which is why I gave it 3 stars and not less.</li>
            <li>It is seriously the best cut I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Sliding it more up towards the top of your head at the crown will give you a shorter cut in the back.</li>
            <li>Just make sure it&#x27;s a brand name, like Tweezerman, such as these top rated ones here on Amazon [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I love how my hair looks better than when I left the salon before.  </li>
            <li>and I had salon worthy layers.  </li>
            <li>The product came quickly, and as described by seller.</li>
            <li>Quick too.  </li>
            <li>First time I tried CreaClip, I was pretty amazed causes when I go get my hair cut by salon, seems like they cut a lot more off.  </li>
            <li>At any price, in any salon, you can be lucky to excape with your pride intact.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been particularly loyal to a stylist, and always put off going to get a haircut for months and months at a time, but now with a baby at home</li>
            <li>does require patience but is quick if you know what you plan to do.</li>
            <li>It looked so quick</li>
            <li>Before purchasing we did days worth of research on the internet,paying special attention to the finished results.</li>
            <li>broke the very first time that i used ti.</li>
            <li>I was always curious about people who are brave enough to cut their own hair and was wondering if there is a tool that could assist a novice like myself in this department.  </li>
            <li>Feel free to use it on your enemy&#x27;s hair;).</li>
            <li>Additionally I would suggest purchasing some nice sharp scissors since it will make your haircuts work better.</li>
            <li>I have Irish naturally curly hair that I wear both curly and straight, and at shoulder length or longer, layers just look the best on me.</li>
            <li>I have always been really good with my own hair, but thought I would give these a try to see if they made cutting my own hair any easier.</li>
            <li>and we all love our new haircuts.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s happy, it costs significantly less</li>
            <li>Easy to use, fast...</li>
            <li>I especially love using the small clip for keeping my bangs trimmed since those grow so much faster than everything</li>
            <li>I especially love using the small clip for keeping my bangs trimmed since those grow so much faster than everything else.</li>
            <li>If you have wavy or curly hair STRAIGHTEN it first!</li>
            <li>but hubby screwed it up the first time I let him do it!</li>
            <li>I was so bummed the first time I used this - when I bent over to cut my hair and COULDN&#x27;T SEE THE LEVEL!</li>
            <li>considering it was my first time!</li>
            <li>I cut my hair last night and LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Next wash, amazing results.</li>
            <li>No, I am not an old lady, :-) )</li>
            <li>it may be useful.</li>
            <li>When you have it where you want it lengthwise, bubble in the middle of the level, either stand up or remain bent over, whatever is more comfortable for you.</li>
            <li>That results in more professional looking textured layers.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>the keep my cut looking fresh.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love CreaClip and the professional results I get with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Also worth noting:</li>
            <li>I keep my hair in a nice one length bob in the back, and layer the sides, with some wispy bangs.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think its worth $29.99 plus S&amp;H in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to anyone who would like to cut their own hair.</li>
            <li>or not I was adept enough to attempt this.</li>
            <li>I have gotten complements that it is better than the cut that I got from a professional stylist.</li>
            <li>I can get more professional looking haircuts with crea clip.</li>
            <li>IT IS WORTH BUYING FOR 3 REASONS</li>
            <li>got my monies worth when i have to cut hair for 4 people in the family often.</li>
            <li>This is such a lifer saver when you want to trim your own bangs.</li>
            <li>Have to say it&#x27;s been worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>When you tell people you did it yourself with a Creaclip, they will laugh at you and ask you if it&#x27;s a Flowbie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are many tutorials for different styles available by CreaClip or on YouTube which is where I go.</li>
            <li>It gave me a fresh textured look</li>
            <li>but it looked like fun and worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I love about this system, is that it costs the same thing that one cut/wash/blowdry/style/tip does at a cheap salon.</li>
            <li>It makes me smile when I get compliments on my hair.  </li>
            <li>totally worth the price, always getting complements on my hair cut....</li>
            <li>Happy to have bought these tools, if only to cut other people&#x27;s hair.e glad to have this tool.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend viewing all the CreaClip videos on YouTube before you cut your hair - they are very helpful, much more than the instructions that came with the product.  </li>
            <li>Still, I caught on quickly; the clips are extremely user-friendly and foolproof; and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I have always wanted to have a V-shaped hair line, but my hairstylist never did it right, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m picky when it comes to my hair; i can never seem to find a stylist who cuts it just right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m right handed.</li>
            <li>Once you get it level it just slips right off.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>It is insanely simple and takes literally less than five minutes to achieve awesome results!</li>
            <li>The leveler makes it easy to see if your cut will be straight and the tools seem durable and hold up very well.  </li>
            <li>So far I have tried it on the straight hair of my two daughters and a friends as well as my own very curly hair.</li>
            <li>I cut my own long hair and give myself the layers and style I have always wanted but could never get from the salon.</li>
            <li>just hope it doesn&#x27;t take me too long to figure out how to master my own haircuts with a crea clip.  </li>
            <li>Great for trims but for a major long hair to bob cut</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend this amazing product to anyone who wants to save money on their haircuts &amp; trims.</li>
            <li>The process was easy enough and the product was very manageable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Perhaps a way around this would be to cut smaller sections at a time, rather than your whole head of hair; however, I feel that kind of takes away from the point of the product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great tool and it takes the fear out of cutting your own hair.</li>
            <li>Amusingly, there was not even a glass of water for me if I just wanted a dry trim  </li>
            <li>you are sensible enough to buy this product, I must stress that it is really worth watching as many OFFICIAL Creaclip demonstration videos as you can.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy this is back on Amazon after a brief disappearance.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this for anybody, it&#x27;s so easy to use and very durable.</li>
            <li>I have cut my hair many different ways and was stopped several times in stores by total strangers commenting on my haircut and how much they loved it!  </li>
            <li>My hair grows very fast</li>
            <li>The key to making any home angled bob haircut look great is the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>But if you take care of it, I feel like I can certainly get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>But if you take care of it, I feel like I can certainly get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>The ads make it look so easy, but it really is not that easy to use.</li>
            <li>awesome for cutting my daughters bangs with a professional look, quick and easy....</li>
            <li>Every once in a while a product comes along that is so unique, innovative and useful, it makes us wonder how we got along without it previously.</li>
            <li>I first trimmed up my bangs..</li>
            <li>It was a bit of a challenge at first with shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>I would like to see more women with short hair using this</li>
            <li>I always keep in mind that I can always come back and cut more.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anybody who might be interested.</li>
            <li>It took awhile to get used to using it, making sure the bubble is in the middle.</li>
            <li>I was able to put 3 different level layers into my hair.</li>
            <li>Now my split ends are gone, I have face-framing layers, my waves have turned into the curls I was hoping for and my hair feels so much lighter without losing the length!</li>
            <li>I was able to use it on each side individually to improve the sameness of the length.  </li>
            <li>I then had to use scissors to improve the choppiness of the edges, which I was able to do well except for the very back.  </li>
            <li>If you slide it more so toward the front of your face, towards your forehead, you will have leave your hair longer in the back.</li>
            <li>Make sure the bubble is in the middle when you stop sliding</li>
            <li>As the video emphasizes....you can always go back and cut more.</li>
            <li>I will go back and take a bit more off to get exactly the style I want.</li>
            <li>This product has saved me so much money!  </li>
            <li>I love that there are tutorials for different types of haircuts too.  </li>
            <li>Although my layers were still evident, they were quite shaggy and shapeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t make my results any better, just the same</li>
            <li>and I already covered the cost of purchase of my creaclip from my first use.</li>
            <li>I now have exactly the style I&#x27;ve been wanting.  </li>
            <li>I cut the hair using the point process ... not cutting straight across the hair ... but using the point of the scissors.</li>
            <li>so you can see exactly what you need to do to get the style cut you</li>
            <li>I was able to fix ir by going back and fixing it by hand.</li>
            <li>hair feels soooooo much softer and healthier!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Just be aware, that if you wear bifocal glasses and want to cut your hair in layers where you have to bend over to cut it, you CANNOT SEE the bubble level.</li>
            <li>first time I used the Creaclip, I used it for layers and cut it myself - bent over, but I had to put in my contact lenses in order to see what I was doing and to see the level bubble because I wear</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had people stop me and tell how pretty my cut is.  </li>
            <li>What I like about these clips is that I can do it myself at home and get my hair exactly the way I want.</li>
            <li>I just used the clip for the first time today...</li>
            <li>Used it the first day it arrived - hubby helped me with trimming the backk</li>
            <li>first trimmed my hair, with my husband standing by just in case...</li>
            <li>she got the hang of it after the first 2 uses.  </li>
            <li>Plastic is not flimsy, you receive desired effect trimming and layering your hair, not difficult understanding directions or using.</li>
            <li>was exactly like it was on YouTube.</li>
            <li>The only problem I had was the leveler to make sure its even.</li>
            <li>so I was willing to risk $30 on this product.</li>
            <li>and I cut their hair exactly to my liking.  </li>
            <li>But the first haircuts were rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s still lacking something...seems choppier than my professional cuts and isn&#x27;t as blended and precise as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>I do suggest anyone who uses this product first look up a tutorial video on how to use it.  </li>
            <li>IT NOT EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;(whole head) for the first time.</li>
            <li>CreaClips are expensive, so I bought this since I was getting a great deal!!</li>
            <li>Talk about fast service!  </li>
            <li>but there aren&#x27;t any WRITTEN instructions anywhere except for the most basic haircut that you could almost do without using CreaClip.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to save a substantial amount of money on hair trims!</li>
            <li>I balked at the price at first, but in the end, CreaClip pays for itself.</li>
            <li>In time, I may eventually get confident enough to use a review mirror for that.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>You can hold it &amp;quot;low&amp;quot; along your back or higher up or in front of you for the most layers.  </li>
            <li>This is much safer!  </li>
            <li>First Impression:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smaller clip seems a bit more practical for people with shorter hair.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>The clips are pretty firm and are good at holding your hair while you trim.</li>
            <li>I also brought all my hair forward (the longer bottom section) and cut it with the large Crea clip to get it angled right.  </li>
            <li>I was so nervous at first.</li>
            <li>I can make it the way I like it;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely a new favorite product for me, and while the $30 seems excessive for some plastic clips, it&#x27;s still way cheaper than going to a nice salon, so it&#x27;ll pay for itself after a couple uses.</li>
            <li>As the photos show, it is most useful if you have very long hair.</li>
            <li>Also you have to have just the right amount of hair in the clip...too much</li>
            <li>First time ever in my life I gave myself a complete haircut(&amp; I can totally say I am loving how it turned out).</li>
            <li>I did my own hair and two other girls</li>
            <li>And find it extremely helpful way to cut your own hair.</li>
            <li>The moral of the story is that this product is great if you follow directions but be careful with experimentation.</li>
            <li>I have thin, long hair, and I was successfully able to put layers in my hair on my own using the small CreaClip - awesome!  </li>
            <li>and I  brushed really well and cut 3 times to make sure even.  </li>
            <li>For the longest time I went to a professional hairdresser at various salons, some I liked, some I didn&#x27;t, but all charging between $50-70.</li>
            <li>The reviews were overwhelmingly positive, so I ordered one.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair first, using the large white clip for the overall length, and then the small blue clip for my bangs, and it turned out great!</li>
            <li>Happy to have bought these tools, if only to cut other people&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>My first trip was really about 1/2 inch as I was nervous of how it would look.  </li>
            <li>Long hair requires more than one person to participate.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to practice using it, but I am pretty much sold.</li>
            <li>Because my hair isn&#x27;t that long, I just reversed the clip and looked in the mirror to make sure the bubble was positioned correctly and snipped.  </li>
            <li>My only criticism  is that the info paper that comes in the container has many typos and/or spelling mistakes which made me think this particular</li>
            <li>I need to practice more with how to blend layers, but I can see that it is possible to get a decent cut with this item.</li>
            <li>I actually cut 20 oz of my hair as I went along, I couldnt believe how easy it was.</li>
            <li>This product easily gave me results similar to those I&#x27;ve gotten in the pricey salons.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and can save you money from going to the salon if you are only needing a trim.</li>
            <li>After I washed and blew my hair dry, I saw that the Creaclip did an outstanding job...</li>
            <li>I have long layered thick hair and it turned out perfect after letting it grow out for over a year</li>
            <li>I give 3 star because the clip doesn&#x27;t hold hair strong enough to cut it.</li>
            <li>Using the large clip, a trim took 5 minutes tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>when as a little child - I went to an amazing Vidal Sassoon-trained stylist) have my front bangs looked so marvellous and accurately-cut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So many have a tough time with this much hair, don&#x27;t get the layers even or cut off way more than I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would cut my whole hair with it for that reason.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really work the way I thought it would.</li>
            <li>I used it to cut my hair myself but it is so much easier when my husband helps me.</li>
            <li>I like the product, I really like the concept</li>
            <li>I am going to see how it grows out, I am really considering skipping the salon.</li>
            <li>I have not been to the salon since ive been using this, i have saved so much money and time.</li>
            <li>B000WI0640 Tweezerman  Stainless 2000 Styling Shears]]</li>
            <li>Dont cut too much.</li>
            <li>I ordered it almost immediately and tried it the very day it came.  </li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t rely so much on the bubble...</li>
            <li>I had been frequenting a fairly pricey salon for the last few years, because it was the only place I&#x27;d found that would leave me feeling satisfied after each appointment.</li>
            <li>The woman who invented this thing probably has the whole hair industry furious with her...</li>
            <li>I have SO much movement in my hair now.</li>
            <li>We were worried it may leave the bottom layer very wispy, as some images show.</li>
            <li>I started by using scissors but felt like I was chewing the hair as there was so much.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>but they cut too much off or not way I had asked.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to read the level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a straight across, blunt cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is an awesome tool to assist in cutting your hair.</li>
            <li>I tend to think that this will make it so much easier.</li>
            <li>It took me a whole 10 minutes</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t see it very well</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t lose a lot of length unless you hold it really close to your head.</li>
            <li>Ordered for my gf and she won&#x27;t shut up about how much she loves it</li>
            <li>I have always free-handed my hair cuts and sometimes get stuck with obnoxiously blunt straight ends that i do not want.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t straight at all in the layers but whatever.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t care</li>
            <li>Shipped fast</li>
            <li>In order to cut it by yourself, I think your hair needs to be much longer than the shoulder</li>
            <li>hair is very stubborn.</li>
            <li>My hair stays put better when it&#x27;s wet.  </li>
            <li>Although I might not like them as much if I had straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Than you so much for your shipment.</li>
            <li>It turned out better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I have a real issue with fringes/bangs and not since 1967 (</li>
            <li>- she really, really deserves it.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>This product has saved me so much money.  </li>
            <li>That was very impressive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to all!</li>
            <li>product makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li>Instant hair cut, for free.</li>
            <li>I declare myself finally and definitely free from the clutches of semi-skilled so-called hairdressers.</li>
            <li>It is a real money saver.</li>
            <li>You will save so much money on trims/haircuts.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think having this gizmo would make much difference</li>
            <li>With the creaclip, I can cut evenly and take off as much hair as I want.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight and mid-back length.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely AMAZED at.</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t really need it as you tube has about 15 videos on it.</li>
            <li>After trimming hair, remove clip and shake out hair or brush it out for a really professionally layered cut with a stylish U shape in the back.     </li>
            <li>Uneven ends, inability to do my own layers</li>
            <li>I am utterly, utterly thrilled with the result.&lt;br /&gt;Using the smaller blue bang clip, hubby then took a quarter inch off my fringe and it has never looked so great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have thick hair this could be a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I always cut my own very curly hair and keep it pretty short on top and than have some layers going down as I&#x27;m trying to keep growing it longer in back.  </li>
            <li>These make it easy, I really don&#x27;t know why no one thought of these a long time ago.</li>
            <li>So I sprayed it down with water to make it just wet enough to comb it somewhat straight, and it worked great!</li>
            <li>No more going to hairdressers who cut off more of my hair than I agreed to!</li>
            <li>Now I trim the back myself with the clip and can cut my bangs more easily with the little clip.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The small blue Creaclip for bangs is also GREAT.</li>
            <li>It really does make perfect cuts everytime, and it seems like it&#x27;s hard to mess it up.</li>
            <li>He found the correct level using the bubble guide and pulled the clip down to the appropriate length so as not to take too much off.  </li>
            <li>My hair is long (middle of my back), I watched some youtube videos the company released on how to cut long layers, and voila, my perfect cut.</li>
            <li>You can easily  bend the plastic, the teeth are a joke because it wont hold your hair at all, its too loose</li>
            <li>I used professional quality scissors and yet, even though I made sure to the the method outlined in the directions for soft textured cuts, I still ended up with very distinct and choppy</li>
            <li>These are easy to use, common sense, and very user friendly.  </li>
            <li>I have very long fine (read stringy) hair.  </li>
            <li>For most of my life I have cut my own hair because I cannot stand how much hair hairdressers end up cutting off.</li>
            <li>I had my adult daughter use it on my hair the first time.</li>
            <li>I avoid chemicals, dye my hair dark brown with henna and cut it myself, and my hair has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li>I am not going to lie, at first, I was a nervous wreck before I dared to bring a pair of scissors near my hair.  </li>
            <li>I used to use a Flowbee, but getting the back straight was difficult at best.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to fight the urge to cut my own hair and my kids because I usually screw it up and wind up at a salon anyway</li>
            <li>Sadly, my hair doesn&#x27;t look as good as when I do it myself without any aid because I can get my hair more rounded and shorter in the back without the crea clip.</li>
            <li>and I am hard to impress when it comes to haircuts; the CreaClip is so great (and I am so cheap and lazy haha)</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve gotten this little miracle tool, I have not gone back to a beauty salon (it&#x27;s been almost a year), and saved some $$$ as a result (always a good thing).  </li>
            <li>The videos on their website are okay, but I found much better ones on You Tube and have gotten quite a few ideas from there by watching other peoples&#x27; techniques.</li>
            <li>I used it twice, seems easy, seems to do nice job, but it&#x27;s thin plastic, and I had hard time focusing on bubble, even with eye glasses, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s just my problem with age.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s IS easy to use; however, you do need to be careful.  </li>
            <li>but I finally felt confident enough to cut her hair.</li>
            <li>Product makes it quick and simple .She loves her hair now.</li>
            <li>I recently cut my hair short, into a bob, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>The clip didn&#x27;t work for my particular hair.</li>
            <li>If you are cutting your own hair you will love these.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The clips are really decently made.</li>
            <li>Fortunately for me, my sister went to beauty school and was willing to come over and fix the back for me the next day.  </li>
            <li>I could pretty much do the top and sides, but needed my husband&#x27;s help for the back as it is not long enough to flip over my head and still see what I was doing.</li>
            <li>I had trouble getting the clip to hold the hair just right and be level without help, and then to also have a free hand to cut the hair without the clip moving.  </li>
            <li>Cut it a few inches longer than you want it to be first), it still went fairly easily.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend this product to eliminate salon bills and take the ease out of home cutters (like myself) work.  </li>
            <li>my wife likes it, high quality product</li>
            <li>(I HIGHLY recommend you do this to learn techniques and ideas).</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it is of high quality material or workmanship.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it is of high quality material or workmanship.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this little tool.</li>
            <li>WoW!!</li>
            <li>, it looks amazing (at least to me).</li>
            <li>it turned like a sad face, and then I pull my hair in front over my shoulders and use it like a happy face.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s to be expected in light of how it is designed.</li>
            <li>I messed up my bangs, but fortunately not bad enough to have them professionally repaired.  </li>
            <li>I think is overpriced for what really material is, but I guess you are paying for the idea, long run what you save trimming your ends or bangs on a salon is worth it.</li>
            <li>I usually went for trims to my favorite salon, but they always cut off too much, even when I say not to.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>First of all if you have thick hair, you might have to repeat the process more than once.  </li>
            <li>I have super fine but really thick hair.</li>
            <li>The layers came out too choppy because the CreaClip doesn&#x27;t allow for angle cut layers which work better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I figured at $30, it was worth a shot, and if I butchered my hair, I could go back to the salon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>used to just cut the hair on the back of my head, pretty much at the hairline, by feeling.  </li>
            <li>After reading many reviews and watching the Youtube videos, I finally broke down and ordered it, and used it for the first time</li>
            <li>We were both amazed on how easy and great this work on cutting long layers.  </li>
            <li>When this happens, it&#x27;s not hard to fix, but it&#x27;s user error, not the clip.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its easy to use after you get over the fear factor of your cutting your own hair.</li>
            <li>this clip makes cutting your own hair so easy.</li>
            <li>On my bangs, it worked better with wet hair, not dry.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and my hair looks better than with an expensive cut and color.  </li>
            <li>I was considering going to get a professional haircut, but I am super picky about the way my hair is cut, and the last time it was cut, the hairdresser ruined my hair by trying to use her scissors to razor cut my hair.  </li>
            <li>Will be getting a new one for me soon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She said you have to have very sharp scissors to have it work easily or just use a clipper......</li>
            <li>A seriously amazing product for people who only want their hair trimmed and seem to have trouble with stylists&#x27; understanding this request.</li>
            <li>The  lock on the big white clip has snapped, but hey its cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>I hated a fun one now and perfect every time!  </li>
            <li>The plastic looks sturdy, the clamp looks tight, it looks like it would serve it&#x27;s purpose and hold hair so you can easily cut.</li>
            <li>Most importantly of all -  take no alcohol before  attempting to cut your hair - since what looks great after a few snifters might look pretty horrific once you&#x27;ve sobered up!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>a personal choice).I did fumble for couple of minutes at the start when I used CreaClip for the first time, but its not a rocket science to figure it out.</li>
            <li>Whenever I go to the salon, I usually get ok or so-so results.  </li>
            <li>Worth the purchase in the long run.</li>
            <li>The resultant cut on my first try actually turned out well...</li>
            <li>It actually works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>First of all, Big Kudos goes to Amazon Delivery.  </li>
            <li>He has severe back problems and just couldn&#x27;t do the job consistently.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful tool for cutting hair!</li>
            <li>and I love the way they look, especially when they&#x27;re quite short in the back.</li>
            <li>My husband, who is definitely NOT a trained hairstylist, was able to do a nicer job than the stylist who recently cut the right side of my long hair an inch shorter than the left!  </li>
            <li>I have about 2 feet of super thick, super wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>actually better than professional haircuts I have paid $80+ for in the past.  </li>
            <li>Since my hair is a little fine</li>
            <li>There are full instructional videos for this and other styles given on the crea website.</li>
            <li>I decided that the investment in this product was small compared to the price of a good haircut (my hair is to the middle of my back</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier -- it is so simple, quick, and quiet</li>
            <li>Not only is the Creaclip well designed and easy to use, it gives users the potential to save not hundreds but thousands of dollars, with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>just use the large white clip on mine.</li>
            <li>Makes cutting hair at home not only easy and literally stress free, it&#x27;s fun to use too.</li>
            <li>Though my hair is not very long, I am at least able to cut it straight.</li>
            <li>Each time I get a little better, however I only trim a bit off at a time.</li>
            <li>i actually CAN cut my own hair without worrying about the results---although i did get my bangs a little too short!</li>
            <li>He made it clear that he didn&#x27;t want any part of this and thought I was going to ruin my hair and didn&#x27;t want to be at fault.  </li>
            <li>The directions that come with it are not as clear as the videos are.</li>
            <li>Really, the only reason I ordered from Amazon instead of directly from them was because I wanted to maintain my privacy</li>
            <li>The product is a bit pricey, but as far as I am concered it just paid for itself.</li>
            <li>I found this as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>I got it directly from their website because it&#x27;s a bit cheaper than on here</li>
            <li>I think the instructions on youtube and in the package for using the clip with bubble aligned are confusing, it should be better explained and shown on the instruction videos for each cut and style...</li>
            <li>The set also includes a smaller straight edge clip fortrimming bangs.</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t paste it back on if you cut off too much.</li>
            <li>I remember being very fussy about haircuts when I was younger.  </li>
            <li>my review is based on a basic cut, I haven&#x27;t ventured into any of the really layered styles suggested on the packaging.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t give you a cut like a salon obviously, but you really can&#x27;t tell unless you look closely and try to see if everything is even.  </li>
            <li>I have very wavy and very coarse hair, and I have A LOT of it.  </li>
            <li>Still even the big clip couldn&#x27;t snap on because I have so much hair.  </li>
            <li>- I waited two weeks for a home visit from a  professional hairdresser.  </li>
            <li>until your hair is in need of a wash, make it as straight as possible and brush it thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>I have this product and so far I have used it twice.</li>
            <li>Looks professionally done... lots of layers...</li>
            <li>Gave myself a rather professional looking trim.</li>
            <li>We even used our professional scissors for the cut.</li>
            <li>My daughter who is 30 years old, asked me to cut her hair</li>
            <li>that I don&#x27;t have to worry about the costs of getting frequent trims.</li>
            <li>Kudos to the woman who developed this product.  </li>
            <li>This surprised me because i&#x27;ve never been stopped like that before for any salon haircuts.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never been much longer than my shoulders, so I don&#x27;t see myself using the bigger clip often, if ever.  </li>
            <li>But was just like, wow.</li>
            <li>If you try to get it level while it is in your hair when the air bubble is way off on a far side, you will be sitting there waiting for it</li>
            <li>Now I do not even have to leave my home, and it only takes a few minutes, and it&#x27;s free from now on!</li>
            <li>I did a two layer cut and the top ended up being too short and uneven.  </li>
            <li>Such a simple invention, but totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair, so this clip is a better option for me than the ponytail method.</li>
            <li>Okay, for those of you who seem to have devalued this product for thick or curly hair, please read all your information before submitting your review.</li>
            <li>Holy crap, it was awesome.</li>
            <li>It is a good idea on paper, but on the practice it is difficult.</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t use it any other way, as I can&#x27;t really see very well without my glasses &amp;</li>
            <li>Even with a flat iron, it doesn&#x27;t get perfectly straight.  </li>
            <li>I considered this item for a long time and had my doubts as it seemed it would only really work on straight one layer hair.</li>
            <li>A little pricey for what you get, but does the job and pretty much eliminates the need for trips to the salon for just a trim.</li>
            <li>I decided to chop my hair off recently after having some fun with hairdye and wanting to start fresh, I used the small clip and gave myself an A-line bob.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t pretend that I wasn&#x27;t hurt - and several months down the line I was able to hobble on my crutches and go back to his salon.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>one salon I&#x27;ve been too being older than 30 and only one,</li>
            <li>My hair had not been cut in more than a year and was really long, raggedy and shapeless.  </li>
            <li>My hair is about .5 inches past my shoulders now, total wash and wear but stylishly layered.</li>
            <li>When you first flip back, the layers might look a little funny; you have to flat iron them under because they are hanging so straight from ironing before the cut.</li>
            <li>I also get tired of straight across blunt bangs, and the clip made it easy to cut my grown out bangs into a side swept style.  </li>
            <li>the level on the crea-clip is not firm, it is rather flimsy so it is hard to get an accurate reading (that plus my wiggly 3 year old).</li>
            <li>I have long naturally straight hair</li>
            <li>Simply bend from the waste, brush hair out making sure you have no tangles, open your crea clip with the level facing you, curved side towards the end of your hair.</li>
            <li>At first, I was skeptical, but after lots of research and finally trying it for myself, I love this product (so much so that I made a point to come back and leave a review)!</li>
            <li>I prefer to use professional stylist shears (get a good quality set of shears for hair cutting at your local CVS or find a decent pair on here.</li>
            <li>straight dry hair, hubby cut half an inch off the back by  smoothly combing the length to rest on my back and put it all into the large white clip in the &#x27;smiley face&#x27;</li>
            <li>My curls look springier and aren&#x27;t weighed down by the damaged ends, I have some fun layers, and I don&#x27;t think anybody could tell I didn&#x27;t go to a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair must be quite long for this clip to be useful; my hair was not long enough for it.  </li>
            <li>This would be a great deployment gift for a female soldier serving overseas or for someone who is chronically unhappy with salon haircuts.  </li>
            <li>This has been great at cutting the dead ends off my hair so that my hair can grow long and healthy and not just long and stringy.</li>
            <li>This product does really work!.I save lots of money by cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li>They ere okay, but I was unable to do it very well by myself.</li>
            <li>finally stopped being a &#x27;Creaclip Virgin&#x27; this afternoon - and seriously, if I thought they were rubbish - I&#x27;d be honest enough to tell you all.  </li>
            <li>Since long hair tends to cost more to cut, this will save me around $200 a year if not more on trims, etc.</li>
            <li>I was pretty shocked at how easy it was to give myself the exact cut I set out to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have thick hair it would work fine</li>
            <li>My hair is just barely long enough to use the big white clip, but I like the blue one more because I can do my bangs and a short A-line bob or straight-across short haircut with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a past middle age lady who has never cut her own hair other than trimming bangs.</li>
            <li>For the quality of product, I thought the money was high, but for the function...it should pay off in the long run (I hope).</li>
            <li>It created great side layers, but I had a little bit of hard a time getting the bubble in the middle when I was cutting my own hair gathered to the front for a V-shape.  </li>
            <li>and I wonder if I could have used my old \\&quot;banana clip\\&quot; for the same job?</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to go to a standard salon where they straighten it to cut it, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay the cost of going to a stylist who works with naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Then I did three big clip/cuts to chop off a bunch of bleach damaged hair, then I fixed up my bangs after washing/styling/drying my hair.  </li>
            <li>He retired to only doing men&#x27;s cuts at an old fashioned barber shop.</li>
            <li>Overall I was pleasantly surprised and impressed.d it once</li>
            <li>I have used it twice so far, only taking off a couple of inches.</li>
            <li>Normally it can take me 30 minutes to an hour depending on how much hair I&#x27;m taking off or if I&#x27;m going with a different hair style or adding bangs or whatever; 40 minutes is average for me.</li>
            <li>This does the job, but it&#x27;s kind of difficult.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that my thick hair might not all fit in the clip</li>
            <li>I thought I would use the side clip to angle it more, but I was afraid to with my hair being thin, and I really loved it as it was, so I just leave it like that.</li>
            <li>I will continue to trim my bangs and ends with a good pair of cutting shears and save the haircut for the salon.</li>
            <li>Use a good pair of scissors or for blunt cutting and ease you can use clippers.</li>
            <li>I kind of feel silly buying this product.</li>
            <li>I usually cut my own hair wet, and the crea clip says to use it dry.  </li>
            <li>but the clip was not tight enough to hold my hair.  </li>
            <li>The level can be perfectly straight but your hair is completely lopsided because half of it slid out of the clip.  </li>
            <li>(section ink off the top and cutting a shorter length the same way), gave myself bangs, trimmed an A-line bob (I do get a free trim/cut when I get a keratin treatment, so initial bob was cut professionally, couldn&#x27;t trim till long enough to see level in mirror).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used the small, straight clip on 3 yr old daughter&#x27;s long, straight hair, which is finer than mine, pretty average thickness for a straight-haired child of her age, I&#x27;d say.  </li>
            <li>Used the small, straight clip on 3 yr old daughter&#x27;s long, straight hair, which is finer than mine, pretty average thickness for a straight-haired child of her age, I&#x27;d say.  </li>
            <li>However, the results were less than thrilling..</li>
            <li>Even though you may cut half an inch at a time, it can still look pretty drastic.  </li>
            <li>Have my neck cranked back in a sink and burned with too hot water, just to listen to stylists gossip with each other, or have them convince me they were &amp;#34;experts&amp;#34</li>
            <li>, maybe it&#x27;s a little flexible to accommodate thick hair and that kind of thing.  </li>
            <li>am suppose to write at least 20 words describing my experience although I don&#x27;t really have much else to say.</li>
            <li>I love this product though, it makes cutting my hair so much quicker and with the level</li>
            <li>If you want the long layered look, have long straight hair this is for you.</li>
            <li>So far I have only used the short one for bangs.</li>
            <li>It gives me the freedom to cut as much as I want, but one must be careful no to cut too short.</li>
            <li>Only 4 stars for grownup hair because it&#x27;s not as easy to use on yourself as it appears on the video, especially if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li>the little level really helped me!</li>
            <li>It was a little intimidating with my first self haircut</li>
            <li>My first experience had me fumbling with the level because it was hard to see the bubble between the white lines (black lines to help center the bubble would stand out more), also the fluid in the level was &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; so the bubble moved sluggishly and seemed to get stuck.</li>
            <li>I usually spend 30 or 35 on this haircut, so I think it&#x27;s absolutely worth it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been cutting hubby&#x27;s hair for 25+ years and my mother&#x27;s hair to their complete satisfaction and simply wouldn&#x27;t try my own for fear of messing it up.  </li>
            <li>When we used it the first time we ended up with a choppy looking cut.</li>
            <li>First did a pass with clippers to get all the dead ends, then flipped again leaving an inch and trimmed into the edge for a softer result</li>
            <li>One of the main reasons I had waist length hair for so long is the maintenance of layered hair and the cost of forking out $50 monthly for a maintenance cut !!!!</li>
            <li>They want you to bend way over and comb your hair straight down.</li>
            <li>&gt; Gather all your equipment close by before you even attempt to cut then only cut a little at first - until you get used to using the Creaclip.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I have super thick super full hair, enough hair on my head for 4 people... and it still held on while cutting.</li>
            <li>I have curly 3a hair that I have been wearing straight half the time.</li>
            <li>I have long hair that I&#x27;m finally growing out to my natural gray.  </li>
            <li>I could definitely see the small clip being useful for bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>I could definitely see the small clip being useful for bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>While a little more difficult (though probably my fault since I didn&#x27;t trim my hair short first and basically chopped off 15inches all at once.. don&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li>Definitely watch the videos on YouTube and be conservative with your first few trims, but this product fills a definite niche.</li>
            <li>if you have kids you can cut their hair quickly since they don&#x27;t like to sit still for long usually  </li>
            <li>conclusion is that CreaClip is most compatible for less thick heads of hair.</li>
            <li>not layer your fine hair to the point of looking thin and stringy at the ends.</li>
            <li>I also tried the mutli-layer method, just like in this Youtube video (which isn&#x27;t posted at their website), and it gave me lots of layers, but a little too much for my taste.  </li>
            <li>I also easily trimmed my straight-across bangs, and I even tried a little face framing (to even up my still-growing out crooked long layers that had been previously cut by the OWNER of another salon).  </li>
            <li>and I can cut off just the very ends to even them out, or just a little tiny bit of the split ends.</li>
            <li>I admit I did cut very little at a time until I got exactly the look</li>

            <li> I have always cut my own hair</li>
            <li> Until I came across someone using it, reviewing it, and loving it.  </li>
            <li> I already had a good understanding of hair, which I&#x27;m sure helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> This takes all guesswork out of doing your own hair.  </li>

            <li> I was wanting learn how to cut my own hair at home.</li>
            <li> I watched videos on youtube &amp;#34;How to cut your own hair&amp;#34; and CreaClip popped up.  </li>

            <li> Never knew I would have it in me to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> I no longer go to a salon and cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> love crea clip- wasn&#x27;t sure it would work, but I use it to cut my daughter&#x27;s hair and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> In fact I did my own...</li>
            <li> I found CreaClip after doing an internet search on how to cut layers into your own hair.</li>
            <li> With the CreaClip, I gave myself a really nice trim with layers in about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> , I considered trimming my own hair.</li>

            <li> I especially love the smaller clip for the bangs.</li>
            <li> Love the CREACLIP.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased..</li>
            <li> I love the V cut</li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was able to keep my length and give myself layers, at the salon I always say to keep my length</li>
            <li> The CreaClip is FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE the way it looks.  </li>
            <li> It might be better if you have longer hair that is more forgiving than mine.  </li>
            <li> You can use an electric hair trimmer or scissors  to cut the hair flush to the clip, resulting in more volume and blunt cut layers.</li>
            <li> You can always take off more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased I ended up getting this product.  </li>
            <li> i believe that it is an okay product</li>
            <li> Ordered it, tried it, LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done two cuts now with it, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my hair now.</li>
            <li> would be better if someone else helped you</li>
            <li> Most hairstylists don&#x27;t seem to listen well and also suggest hairstyles that I don&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li> I decided to cut my hair when it was damp, I figured this will give me a more even cut as that&#x27;s what they do in beauty salons.  </li>
            <li> I knew that I had more split ends to get rid of, so once again I&#x27;ve dampen my hair, and this time cut off additional 2 inches.  </li>
            <li> I love the CreaClip!&lt;br</li>
            <li> And of course everytime I cut more than I should.  </li>
            <li> We followed this and were really pleased.  </li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> Love the CreaClip.</li>
            <li> I just cut it real quick</li>
            <li> My trick was to use hair spray to help grip the clip better.</li>
            <li> I Love my creaclip</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Creaclip for about a year and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I like this haircut I gave myself better than any salon cut I have ever gotten.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> My work was 1000 times better than CreapyClip....</li>
            <li> Love it does the work.</li>
            <li> I did double check after bath and it was perfect.  </li>
            <li> More brush like inside the clip would be more help.</li>
            <li> I watched more videos/read more reviews</li>
            <li> Afterwards I manually trimmed a couple strands, and my hair looks fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Love it now</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> i get the look that I want for free (well, for a one time price of 29.99!).</li>
            <li> We love how it creates layers.  </li>
            <li> My two-decade-long search for the perfect hairdresser is finally over!</li>
            <li> Bought many hair enhancements, curlers etc.</li>
            <li> you may not be satisfied</li>
            <li> I just love my CreaClip</li>
            <li> absolutely LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> /&gt; After taking a bit off, I cut more.</li>
            <li> is so much more better than getting it cut at a salon because I can do it whenever I want.  </li>
            <li> So if that&#x27;s a problem,  you&#x27;ll love this.&lt;br /&gt;Heck</li>
            <li> There are so many ways I can trim my hair with this.</li>
            <li> I prefer the V in the back and this clip gives me the perfect cut every time.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m not terribly cautious when it comes to beauty products.</li>
            <li> Love this...works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> And the &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; shape look this gives to the back of my hair is perfect.</li>
            <li> I love my hair.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m looking forward to more practice with the CreaClip.  </li>
            <li> It took me over an hour to get it to where I was satisfied.  </li>
            <li> But I think it&#x27;s much better than the hit or miss haircuts I get at GreatClips and the likes.  </li>
            <li> And I like the idea of being able to cut my hair without the hassle of scheduling and arranging babysitting.  </li>
            <li> I love this for trims &amp; layering.</li>
            <li> My hair looks a lot healthier and i love the way the layers look.  </li>
            <li> This works ok, although you have to do additional trimming using your fingers after you use it, to even out the front part of the hair</li>
            <li> She and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> , i thought ur hand is better than using it...</li>
            <li> If you know what you are doing though, its probably ok.</li>
            <li> ... now I get as many layers as I want, when I want.</li>
            <li> I bought this mostly to use on my bangs but found that I could also use it to keep split ends at bay.  </li>
            <li> I am going to watch YouTube tutorial videos to become more efficient.</li>
            <li> I love these, they are already saving me tons of $$$ and trips to the salon.  </li>
            <li> The V shape it makes in the back can be a bit pronounced but it works perfect for me curly hair.</li>
            <li> My wonderful husband is now my personal stylist</li>
            <li> I have used several methods, but none of them produced the results I wanted, until I found this awesome product.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my favorite hair stylist moved away.</li>
            <li> I love the creaclips that I have.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> The bangs still looked cute, but they were not what I was going for.</li>
            <li> It would be way better to go to a qualified hairstylist to cut your hair into the shape you want it to begin with.</li>
            <li> You just throw your hair over your head and attach the Clips, make sure it&#x27;s level</li>
            <li> Even, though I kinda botched the cut, it still looks ok.  </li>
            <li> Love this product is money saver</li>
            <li> I was hoping that it would be made with a more durable material.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like for more detail instruction to be provided.</li>
            <li> I know it has alot more uses</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> also love the cost savings</li>
            <li> and I thought ok maybe just maybe this clip makes sense, and who wouldnt want to save money on salon visits.  </li>
            <li> and they always charge more for it).  </li>
            <li> There are many ways to use the clip.  </li>
            <li> You can use it on the sides to makes them even or on top of your head to even out all your hair.  </li>
            <li> Is this product powered by magic?</li>
            <li> My grandma even bought one after me telling her about it. :)</li>
            <li> Since purchasing the CreaClip, my hair has become healthy and glossy.</li>
            <li> I thought I would use it just for trims, but have now found I like my cuts so much better</li>
            <li> and of course the healthy hair.</li>
            <li> This helps me get a neater, more even cut with more defined layers than the ponytail method did.  </li>
            <li> I get complimented on my haircut was able to do a stack with it.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I practice more I will be able to master it.</li>
            <li> I ended up just eyeballing it instead of using this tool and it seemed to work better for me.</li>
            <li> They serve their purpose, are easy to use and clean, and feel fairly sturdy.</li>
            <li> My wife has been able to take care of split ends and that stuff with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it saves me a trip to the salon</li>
            <li> Other than that it works great, it s a great idea...</li>
            <li> I was very excited to order it and try it.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> It certainly helped me style and cut my own hair and my children too!</li>
            <li> I am sure that the layers are not as good as they would be if done in a salon, but I like being able to trim and shape my hair whenever I want to, and the results look good enough to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only consolation is that I could cut the damaged hair more often-since I own the creaclip!!</li>
            <li> Creaclip is easy to use,and very accurate because of the spirit-level.</li>
            <li> I do not completely understand how this thing does what it does, but it has given me the best cut I have ever had.</li>
            <li> The haircuts have been great so far, but I would love to see more style options / cuting options for this product.</li>
            <li> Once again, a pretty good result.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes he did a pretty good job but also messed it up at times too.</li>
            <li> Yes I know - almost 3 years have passed - but there is a very good reason for the delayed review - more of which later.....</li>
            <li> soo worth the investment!!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and very long, and this product is perfect for giving me that V shape I like.</li>
            <li> I love it because it is easy to use it, and it help me alot when I cut my hair</li>
            <li> Its easy to use, and if you need more assistance, the company has helpful videos on YouTube.</li>
            <li> Good invention but wish it was priced more reasonably....</li>
            <li> All you need is a good pair of professional shears and you can be your own hairdresser.  </li>
            <li> You can always cut more once you get more comfortable with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can always cut more once you get more comfortable with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says; easy to use, keep clean, and a great result every time.</li>
            <li> People can&#x27;t believe I cut my own hair, and I love being able to get my hair exactly the way I want it, without worrying about what some stylist will interpret as what I want.  </li>
            <li> Mai Lieu very kindly sent me these amazing Creaclips way back in December 2010.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still a really great buy, there&#x27;s videos on YouTube as well for more styling tips and tricks from customers and professional hair stylists, although in my opinion, this clip could easily put stylists out of business.</li>
            <li> this is the best product I&#x27;ve found, better than any other trimmers or layering.</li>
            <li> just needs better quality (it&#x27;s not that cheap after all).</li>
            <li> I had a fantastic hairdresser for many years.  </li>
            <li> This haircut is considered more advanced with the CreaClip</li>
            <li> so I had to find something I could mostly do myself at home and cheap.</li>
            <li> really looks good.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s kind of fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was so easy, great cut, even, not choppy.  </li>
            <li> Their youtube account is filled with instructive, easy to follow how-to videos for your favorite cuts.</li>
            <li> OK I usually never fall for the seen on TV gadgets, but I read alot of good reviews here and even watched some youtube videos</li>
            <li> Her haircut looks perfectly professional and very nice.  </li>

            <li> It arrived very quickly (today, in fact), and I immediately put it to use.</li>
            <li> I have to say, this thing is really, really easy to use.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to use, plus there are all sorts of CreaClip &#x27;how to&#x27; videos over on YouTube</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so easy to use</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and saves me time and money going to the salon.</li>
            <li> This was so easy to do.</li>
            <li> This product works as specified and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use it.</li>
            <li> The product is made of surdy plastic and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> , IT IS EASY TO USE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident that it would be great for short looks as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use on myself.  </li>
            <li> Not as easy as it looks</li>
            <li> Not quite as easy as they make it look in the videos.</li>
            <li> Definitely easy to use for anyone.</li>
            <li> The styles are really easy to do.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t easy.</li>
            <li> I was very conservative with my 1st cut, just to make sure I liked the results.  </li>
            <li> Good result with full bouncy ends but pretty layers too.(Her hair was one length to begin with.)   </li>
            <li> This is fine but the &amp;#34;easy&amp;#34; claim isn&#x27;t THAT easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also notable that both clips have the built in level which swivels for true angle cuts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is exactly what this &#x27;do-it-yourselfer&#x27; needed to keep my hair looking nice and stylish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Please be your own judge;)  </li>
            <li> was a bit worried using this at first because I&#x27;ve never cut my own</li>
            <li> The level is a joke also because you better be standing perfectly straight for it to be perfectly level on your hair, if you are standing/hanging your head crooked, there goes the level accuracy on your hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never taken the time to write a review on any product before - but this is pure GENIUS!!!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good as new.</li>
            <li> Her hair is  straight,strawberry blond and fine.</li>
            <li> but seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> CreaClip works well for my fine, \\&quot;bendy\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li> my full review, complete with photos of my use of CreaClip and the happy results at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will give you THE perfect layered cut in less time than it takes to make a cup of coffee.</li>
            <li> Also, it is made of cheap crappy plastic that will break easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my own hair in a long layered style myself, and while I did a good job...</li>
            <li> (I have fine wavy hair).  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you explain EXACTLY what and where to cut. :)</li>
            <li> For those considering it, if your hair is at all fine this might not work for you.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, curly, and I like to keep it in a chin-length bob.  </li>
            <li> I eagerly awaited its arrival and it came REALLY quickly (3 days!).</li>
            <li> and it is really quick!</li>
            <li> So when I read about CreaClip, it seemed like the solution to my problems: a fast, easy way to trim my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t as easy to use as I&#x27;d imagined, but I think with practice I&#x27;ll be able to find it useful</li>
            <li> Love love love my new creaclip!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this on my daughter&#x27;s hair next, and it was soooo easy, fast, and her hair came out even and perfect.</li>
            <li> Be sure to be conservative the first time you use the Creaclip!</li>
            <li> just make sure you straighten your hair first!</li>
            <li> had very high hopes for the creaclip, but honestly, my hair is just meh.  </li>
            <li> And of course, saving money is a huge benefit.  </li>
            <li> They were helpful for me to use the CreaClip accurately.</li>
            <li> &#x27;CreaClip&#x27;&#x27; is a cheaply produced copy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But thank God for Ms.Mai Lieu, she invented such great product.</li>
            <li> It really looked liked</li>
            <li> Light layers with some face framing bangs.  </li>
            <li> Get it, it&#x27;s worth it :)</li>
            <li> She is always available at time when I am not.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always tried to trim my own hair (just trimming the ends), but I needed a real haircut.  </li>
            <li> Using an elastic to gather my hair forward worked great for me, I may go back yo</li>
            <li> but she sent them to me free of charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are great especially when you are trimming the kids&#x27; bangs.  </li>
            <li> so cheap?</li>
            <li> and it also feels very empowering to know that I can cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The construction of the clip is very solid and mine is still in great shape.</li>
            <li> and pays for itself the first time you use it!! .....</li>
            <li> If you really want to save money and are willing to take a lot of time and perhaps already cut your own hair, you might be glad to have this tool.  </li>
            <li> It was super easy.</li>
            <li> It worked really well and was very easy to do.  </li>
            <li> It worked really well and was very easy to do.  </li>
            <li> but it really was still very easy after watching the YouTube video.  </li>
            <li> The level kept me from making any major mistakes and she loved the results.</li>
            <li> and easy to make sure its straight with the leveling bubbles.</li>
            <li> My original review was from January 2012.  </li>
            <li> i originally got it to help me cut my hair extentions</li>
            <li> Not only is this product effective, but it will also save you a bundle from spending $15 a haircut or trim and a salon!  </li>
            <li> but well worth it!</li>
            <li> I was scared to cut it because it was so long, but it turned out great.  </li>
            <li> I looked at many videos before trying this on my hair first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to experiment!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t particularly love the clip for layering, but it&#x27;s great for maintaining bangs and definitely for keeping everything straight and even.</li>
            <li> After a little more attention on the one side, I was happy with my cut.  </li>
            <li> This product is a good idea, mostly for long hair layers, bangs and trimmings, beyond that execution is only as good as you or the person helping you to cut your hair are with scissors.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you are going to be super accurate.  </li>
            <li> Overall I was pleasantly surprised and impressed.</li>
            <li> love this product, amazing how a simple idea made of plastic can work so great, use the videos online at youtube as the directions are limited.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t come out anywhere near as nice as it does when using this great little ingenious device known as the Crea Clip.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended,was very easy to use,recommend to watch video before start for beginners.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so nice to be able to quickly cut it because it starts curling up at different rates as it dries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super happy with this product I used it right away only cut about an inch</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not discounting hair-dressers or their work, but I&#x27;m a very low-maintenance, do-it-yourself kind of gal, and this product is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used more of an eyeball approach to see if it&#x27;s exactly straight or not...</li>
            <li> Useful for basic trims, good videos to watch available on Creaclip website.</li>
            <li> The level on the clip is ok, but if you don&#x27;t hold your head perfectly straight</li>
            <li> Trim hair, provide good layers and simple styling with ease.</li>
            <li> sure what others were talking about in terms of it being flimsy, mine feels much sturdier than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> I think you can visually hold the clip up evenly and still get good results.  </li>
            <li> Cant say enough about how much I loved it before I cut all my hair off and went with the pixie look.</li>
            <li> I will try it on my kid later and see if the results are as good.</li>
            <li> I guess the thing is okay, but I didn&#x27;t really get it and decided to return it...</li>
            <li> If it came in multiple sizes for thinner or thicker hair this would be a good product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good about this.  </li>
            <li> The end result left me with frizzy hair that never looked good again.  </li>
            <li> We studied the online videos from pros and real people postings, more than once.</li>
            <li> my full review at: myreallifereviews dot com</li>
            <li> I cut some every week to keep it neat on top and on the very ends.  </li>
            <li> I have saved so much money since I don&#x27;t have to go to a salon any more.</li>
            <li> Did my bangs this weekend - not bad.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad result.  </li>
            <li> IT gave her beautiful layers down the sides.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is really wonderful for people who are comfortable cutting their own hair, parents with children who need quick trims, or even just trims between salon visits.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is really wonderful for people who are comfortable cutting their own hair, parents with children who need quick trims, or even just trims between salon visits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve saved so much money on haircuts thanks to this !!!!</li>
            <li> It did give me nice layers on my hair which is why I gave it 3 stars and not less.</li>
            <li> It is seriously the best cut I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Sliding it more up towards the top of your head at the crown will give you a shorter cut in the back.</li>
            <li> Just make sure it&#x27;s a brand name, like Tweezerman, such as these top rated ones here on Amazon [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I love how my hair looks better than when I left the salon before.  </li>
            <li> and I had salon worthy layers.  </li>
            <li> The product came quickly, and as described by seller.</li>
            <li> Quick too.  </li>
            <li> First time I tried CreaClip, I was pretty amazed causes when I go get my hair cut by salon, seems like they cut a lot more off.  </li>
            <li> At any price, in any salon, you can be lucky to excape with your pride intact.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been particularly loyal to a stylist, and always put off going to get a haircut for months and months at a time, but now with a baby at home</li>
            <li> does require patience but is quick if you know what you plan to do.</li>
            <li> It looked so quick</li>
            <li> Before purchasing we did days worth of research on the internet,paying special attention to the finished results.</li>
            <li> broke the very first time that i used ti.</li>
            <li> I was always curious about people who are brave enough to cut their own hair and was wondering if there is a tool that could assist a novice like myself in this department.  </li>
            <li> Feel free to use it on your enemy&#x27;s hair;).</li>
            <li> Additionally I would suggest purchasing some nice sharp scissors since it will make your haircuts work better.</li>
            <li> I have Irish naturally curly hair that I wear both curly and straight, and at shoulder length or longer, layers just look the best on me.</li>
            <li> I have always been really good with my own hair, but thought I would give these a try to see if they made cutting my own hair any easier.</li>
            <li> and we all love our new haircuts.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s happy, it costs significantly less</li>
            <li> Easy to use, fast...</li>
            <li> I especially love using the small clip for keeping my bangs trimmed since those grow so much faster than everything</li>
            <li> I especially love using the small clip for keeping my bangs trimmed since those grow so much faster than everything else.</li>
            <li> If you have wavy or curly hair STRAIGHTEN it first!</li>
            <li> but hubby screwed it up the first time I let him do it!</li>
            <li> I was so bummed the first time I used this - when I bent over to cut my hair and COULDN&#x27;T SEE THE LEVEL!</li>
            <li> considering it was my first time!</li>
            <li> I cut my hair last night and LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Next wash, amazing results.</li>
            <li> No, I am not an old lady, :-) )</li>
            <li> it may be useful.</li>
            <li> When you have it where you want it lengthwise, bubble in the middle of the level, either stand up or remain bent over, whatever is more comfortable for you.</li>
            <li> That results in more professional looking textured layers.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> the keep my cut looking fresh.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love CreaClip and the professional results I get with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Also worth noting:</li>
            <li> I keep my hair in a nice one length bob in the back, and layer the sides, with some wispy bangs.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think its worth $29.99 plus S&amp;H in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to anyone who would like to cut their own hair.</li>
            <li> or not I was adept enough to attempt this.</li>
            <li> I have gotten complements that it is better than the cut that I got from a professional stylist.</li>
            <li> I can get more professional looking haircuts with crea clip.</li>
            <li> IT IS WORTH BUYING FOR 3 REASONS</li>
            <li> got my monies worth when i have to cut hair for 4 people in the family often.</li>
            <li> This is such a lifer saver when you want to trim your own bangs.</li>
            <li> Have to say it&#x27;s been worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> When you tell people you did it yourself with a Creaclip, they will laugh at you and ask you if it&#x27;s a Flowbie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are many tutorials for different styles available by CreaClip or on YouTube which is where I go.</li>
            <li> It gave me a fresh textured look</li>
            <li> but it looked like fun and worth a try.  </li>
            <li> I love about this system, is that it costs the same thing that one cut/wash/blowdry/style/tip does at a cheap salon.</li>
            <li> It makes me smile when I get compliments on my hair.  </li>
            <li> totally worth the price, always getting complements on my hair cut....</li>
            <li> Happy to have bought these tools, if only to cut other people&#x27;s hair.e glad to have this tool.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend viewing all the CreaClip videos on YouTube before you cut your hair - they are very helpful, much more than the instructions that came with the product.  </li>
            <li> Still, I caught on quickly; the clips are extremely user-friendly and foolproof; and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to have a V-shaped hair line, but my hairstylist never did it right, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky when it comes to my hair; i can never seem to find a stylist who cuts it just right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m right handed.</li>
            <li> Once you get it level it just slips right off.</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> It is insanely simple and takes literally less than five minutes to achieve awesome results!</li>
            <li> The leveler makes it easy to see if your cut will be straight and the tools seem durable and hold up very well.  </li>
            <li> So far I have tried it on the straight hair of my two daughters and a friends as well as my own very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I cut my own long hair and give myself the layers and style I have always wanted but could never get from the salon.</li>
            <li> just hope it doesn&#x27;t take me too long to figure out how to master my own haircuts with a crea clip.  </li>
            <li> Great for trims but for a major long hair to bob cut</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend this amazing product to anyone who wants to save money on their haircuts &amp; trims.</li>
            <li> The process was easy enough and the product was very manageable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Perhaps a way around this would be to cut smaller sections at a time, rather than your whole head of hair; however, I feel that kind of takes away from the point of the product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great tool and it takes the fear out of cutting your own hair.</li>
            <li> Amusingly, there was not even a glass of water for me if I just wanted a dry trim  </li>
            <li> you are sensible enough to buy this product, I must stress that it is really worth watching as many OFFICIAL Creaclip demonstration videos as you can.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy this is back on Amazon after a brief disappearance.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this for anybody, it&#x27;s so easy to use and very durable.</li>
            <li> I have cut my hair many different ways and was stopped several times in stores by total strangers commenting on my haircut and how much they loved it!  </li>
            <li> My hair grows very fast</li>
            <li> The key to making any home angled bob haircut look great is the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> But if you take care of it, I feel like I can certainly get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> But if you take care of it, I feel like I can certainly get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> The ads make it look so easy, but it really is not that easy to use.</li>
            <li> awesome for cutting my daughters bangs with a professional look, quick and easy....</li>
            <li> Every once in a while a product comes along that is so unique, innovative and useful, it makes us wonder how we got along without it previously.</li>
            <li> I first trimmed up my bangs..</li>
            <li> It was a bit of a challenge at first with shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I would like to see more women with short hair using this</li>
            <li> I always keep in mind that I can always come back and cut more.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anybody who might be interested.</li>
            <li> It took awhile to get used to using it, making sure the bubble is in the middle.</li>
            <li> I was able to put 3 different level layers into my hair.</li>
            <li> Now my split ends are gone, I have face-framing layers, my waves have turned into the curls I was hoping for and my hair feels so much lighter without losing the length!</li>
            <li> I was able to use it on each side individually to improve the sameness of the length.  </li>
            <li> I then had to use scissors to improve the choppiness of the edges, which I was able to do well except for the very back.  </li>
            <li> If you slide it more so toward the front of your face, towards your forehead, you will have leave your hair longer in the back.</li>
            <li> Make sure the bubble is in the middle when you stop sliding</li>
            <li> As the video emphasizes....you can always go back and cut more.</li>
            <li> I will go back and take a bit more off to get exactly the style I want.</li>
            <li> This product has saved me so much money!  </li>
            <li> I love that there are tutorials for different types of haircuts too.  </li>
            <li> Although my layers were still evident, they were quite shaggy and shapeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t make my results any better, just the same</li>
            <li> and I already covered the cost of purchase of my creaclip from my first use.</li>
            <li> I now have exactly the style I&#x27;ve been wanting.  </li>
            <li> I cut the hair using the point process ... not cutting straight across the hair ... but using the point of the scissors.</li>
            <li> so you can see exactly what you need to do to get the style cut you</li>
            <li> I was able to fix ir by going back and fixing it by hand.</li>
            <li> hair feels soooooo much softer and healthier!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just be aware, that if you wear bifocal glasses and want to cut your hair in layers where you have to bend over to cut it, you CANNOT SEE the bubble level.</li>
            <li> first time I used the Creaclip, I used it for layers and cut it myself - bent over, but I had to put in my contact lenses in order to see what I was doing and to see the level bubble because I wear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had people stop me and tell how pretty my cut is.  </li>
            <li> What I like about these clips is that I can do it myself at home and get my hair exactly the way I want.</li>
            <li> I just used the clip for the first time today...</li>
            <li> Used it the first day it arrived - hubby helped me with trimming the backk</li>
            <li> first trimmed my hair, with my husband standing by just in case...</li>
            <li> she got the hang of it after the first 2 uses.  </li>
            <li> Plastic is not flimsy, you receive desired effect trimming and layering your hair, not difficult understanding directions or using.</li>
            <li> was exactly like it was on YouTube.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was the leveler to make sure its even.</li>
            <li> so I was willing to risk $30 on this product.</li>
            <li> and I cut their hair exactly to my liking.  </li>
            <li> But the first haircuts were rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s still lacking something...seems choppier than my professional cuts and isn&#x27;t as blended and precise as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> I do suggest anyone who uses this product first look up a tutorial video on how to use it.  </li>
            <li> IT NOT EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;(whole head) for the first time.</li>
            <li> CreaClips are expensive, so I bought this since I was getting a great deal!!</li>
            <li> Talk about fast service!  </li>
            <li> but there aren&#x27;t any WRITTEN instructions anywhere except for the most basic haircut that you could almost do without using CreaClip.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to save a substantial amount of money on hair trims!</li>
            <li> I balked at the price at first, but in the end, CreaClip pays for itself.</li>
            <li> In time, I may eventually get confident enough to use a review mirror for that.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> You can hold it &amp;quot;low&amp;quot; along your back or higher up or in front of you for the most layers.  </li>
            <li> This is much safer!  </li>
            <li> First Impression:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smaller clip seems a bit more practical for people with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> The clips are pretty firm and are good at holding your hair while you trim.</li>
            <li> I also brought all my hair forward (the longer bottom section) and cut it with the large Crea clip to get it angled right.  </li>
            <li> I was so nervous at first.</li>
            <li> I can make it the way I like it;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely a new favorite product for me, and while the $30 seems excessive for some plastic clips, it&#x27;s still way cheaper than going to a nice salon, so it&#x27;ll pay for itself after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> As the photos show, it is most useful if you have very long hair.</li>
            <li> Also you have to have just the right amount of hair in the clip...too much</li>
            <li> First time ever in my life I gave myself a complete haircut(&amp; I can totally say I am loving how it turned out).</li>
            <li> I did my own hair and two other girls</li>
            <li> And find it extremely helpful way to cut your own hair.</li>
            <li> The moral of the story is that this product is great if you follow directions but be careful with experimentation.</li>
            <li> I have thin, long hair, and I was successfully able to put layers in my hair on my own using the small CreaClip - awesome!  </li>
            <li> and I  brushed really well and cut 3 times to make sure even.  </li>
            <li> For the longest time I went to a professional hairdresser at various salons, some I liked, some I didn&#x27;t, but all charging between $50-70.</li>
            <li> The reviews were overwhelmingly positive, so I ordered one.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair first, using the large white clip for the overall length, and then the small blue clip for my bangs, and it turned out great!</li>
            <li> Happy to have bought these tools, if only to cut other people&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> My first trip was really about 1/2 inch as I was nervous of how it would look.  </li>
            <li> Long hair requires more than one person to participate.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to practice using it, but I am pretty much sold.</li>
            <li> Because my hair isn&#x27;t that long, I just reversed the clip and looked in the mirror to make sure the bubble was positioned correctly and snipped.  </li>
            <li> My only criticism  is that the info paper that comes in the container has many typos and/or spelling mistakes which made me think this particular</li>
            <li> I need to practice more with how to blend layers, but I can see that it is possible to get a decent cut with this item.</li>
            <li> I actually cut 20 oz of my hair as I went along, I couldnt believe how easy it was.</li>
            <li> This product easily gave me results similar to those I&#x27;ve gotten in the pricey salons.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and can save you money from going to the salon if you are only needing a trim.</li>
            <li> After I washed and blew my hair dry, I saw that the Creaclip did an outstanding job...</li>
            <li> I have long layered thick hair and it turned out perfect after letting it grow out for over a year</li>
            <li> I give 3 star because the clip doesn&#x27;t hold hair strong enough to cut it.</li>
            <li> Using the large clip, a trim took 5 minutes tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when as a little child - I went to an amazing Vidal Sassoon-trained stylist) have my front bangs looked so marvellous and accurately-cut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So many have a tough time with this much hair, don&#x27;t get the layers even or cut off way more than I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would cut my whole hair with it for that reason.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really work the way I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I used it to cut my hair myself but it is so much easier when my husband helps me.</li>
            <li> I like the product, I really like the concept</li>
            <li> I am going to see how it grows out, I am really considering skipping the salon.</li>
            <li> I have not been to the salon since ive been using this, i have saved so much money and time.</li>
            <li> B000WI0640 Tweezerman  Stainless 2000 Styling Shears]]</li>
            <li> Dont cut too much.</li>
            <li> I ordered it almost immediately and tried it the very day it came.  </li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t rely so much on the bubble...</li>
            <li> I had been frequenting a fairly pricey salon for the last few years, because it was the only place I&#x27;d found that would leave me feeling satisfied after each appointment.</li>
            <li> The woman who invented this thing probably has the whole hair industry furious with her...</li>
            <li> I have SO much movement in my hair now.</li>
            <li> We were worried it may leave the bottom layer very wispy, as some images show.</li>
            <li> I started by using scissors but felt like I was chewing the hair as there was so much.</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> but they cut too much off or not way I had asked.  </li>
            <li> Much easier to read the level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a straight across, blunt cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is an awesome tool to assist in cutting your hair.</li>
            <li> I tend to think that this will make it so much easier.</li>
            <li> It took me a whole 10 minutes</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see it very well</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t lose a lot of length unless you hold it really close to your head.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my gf and she won&#x27;t shut up about how much she loves it</li>
            <li> I have always free-handed my hair cuts and sometimes get stuck with obnoxiously blunt straight ends that i do not want.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t straight at all in the layers but whatever.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t care</li>
            <li> Shipped fast</li>
            <li> In order to cut it by yourself, I think your hair needs to be much longer than the shoulder</li>
            <li> hair is very stubborn.</li>
            <li> My hair stays put better when it&#x27;s wet.  </li>
            <li> Although I might not like them as much if I had straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Than you so much for your shipment.</li>
            <li> It turned out better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have a real issue with fringes/bangs and not since 1967 (</li>
            <li> - she really, really deserves it.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> This product has saved me so much money.  </li>
            <li> That was very impressive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to all!</li>
            <li> product makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li> Instant hair cut, for free.</li>
            <li> I declare myself finally and definitely free from the clutches of semi-skilled so-called hairdressers.</li>
            <li> It is a real money saver.</li>
            <li> You will save so much money on trims/haircuts.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think having this gizmo would make much difference</li>
            <li> With the creaclip, I can cut evenly and take off as much hair as I want.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight and mid-back length.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely AMAZED at.</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t really need it as you tube has about 15 videos on it.</li>
            <li> After trimming hair, remove clip and shake out hair or brush it out for a really professionally layered cut with a stylish U shape in the back.     </li>
            <li> Uneven ends, inability to do my own layers</li>
            <li> I am utterly, utterly thrilled with the result.&lt;br /&gt;Using the smaller blue bang clip, hubby then took a quarter inch off my fringe and it has never looked so great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair this could be a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I always cut my own very curly hair and keep it pretty short on top and than have some layers going down as I&#x27;m trying to keep growing it longer in back.  </li>
            <li> These make it easy, I really don&#x27;t know why no one thought of these a long time ago.</li>
            <li> So I sprayed it down with water to make it just wet enough to comb it somewhat straight, and it worked great!</li>
            <li> No more going to hairdressers who cut off more of my hair than I agreed to!</li>
            <li> Now I trim the back myself with the clip and can cut my bangs more easily with the little clip.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The small blue Creaclip for bangs is also GREAT.</li>
            <li> It really does make perfect cuts everytime, and it seems like it&#x27;s hard to mess it up.</li>
            <li> He found the correct level using the bubble guide and pulled the clip down to the appropriate length so as not to take too much off.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long (middle of my back), I watched some youtube videos the company released on how to cut long layers, and voila, my perfect cut.</li>
            <li> You can easily  bend the plastic, the teeth are a joke because it wont hold your hair at all, its too loose</li>
            <li> I used professional quality scissors and yet, even though I made sure to the the method outlined in the directions for soft textured cuts, I still ended up with very distinct and choppy</li>
            <li> These are easy to use, common sense, and very user friendly.  </li>
            <li> I have very long fine (read stringy) hair.  </li>
            <li> For most of my life I have cut my own hair because I cannot stand how much hair hairdressers end up cutting off.</li>
            <li> I had my adult daughter use it on my hair the first time.</li>
            <li> I avoid chemicals, dye my hair dark brown with henna and cut it myself, and my hair has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li> I am not going to lie, at first, I was a nervous wreck before I dared to bring a pair of scissors near my hair.  </li>
            <li> I used to use a Flowbee, but getting the back straight was difficult at best.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to fight the urge to cut my own hair and my kids because I usually screw it up and wind up at a salon anyway</li>
            <li> Sadly, my hair doesn&#x27;t look as good as when I do it myself without any aid because I can get my hair more rounded and shorter in the back without the crea clip.</li>
            <li> and I am hard to impress when it comes to haircuts; the CreaClip is so great (and I am so cheap and lazy haha)</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve gotten this little miracle tool, I have not gone back to a beauty salon (it&#x27;s been almost a year), and saved some $$$ as a result (always a good thing).  </li>
            <li> The videos on their website are okay, but I found much better ones on You Tube and have gotten quite a few ideas from there by watching other peoples&#x27; techniques.</li>
            <li> I used it twice, seems easy, seems to do nice job, but it&#x27;s thin plastic, and I had hard time focusing on bubble, even with eye glasses, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s just my problem with age.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s IS easy to use; however, you do need to be careful.  </li>
            <li> but I finally felt confident enough to cut her hair.</li>
            <li> Product makes it quick and simple .She loves her hair now.</li>
            <li> I recently cut my hair short, into a bob, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> The clip didn&#x27;t work for my particular hair.</li>
            <li> If you are cutting your own hair you will love these.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The clips are really decently made.</li>
            <li> Fortunately for me, my sister went to beauty school and was willing to come over and fix the back for me the next day.  </li>
            <li> I could pretty much do the top and sides, but needed my husband&#x27;s help for the back as it is not long enough to flip over my head and still see what I was doing.</li>
            <li> I had trouble getting the clip to hold the hair just right and be level without help, and then to also have a free hand to cut the hair without the clip moving.  </li>
            <li> Cut it a few inches longer than you want it to be first), it still went fairly easily.</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend this product to eliminate salon bills and take the ease out of home cutters (like myself) work.  </li>
            <li> my wife likes it, high quality product</li>
            <li> (I HIGHLY recommend you do this to learn techniques and ideas).</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it is of high quality material or workmanship.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it is of high quality material or workmanship.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this little tool.</li>
            <li> WoW!!</li>
            <li> , it looks amazing (at least to me).</li>
            <li> it turned like a sad face, and then I pull my hair in front over my shoulders and use it like a happy face.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected in light of how it is designed.</li>
            <li> I messed up my bangs, but fortunately not bad enough to have them professionally repaired.  </li>
            <li> I think is overpriced for what really material is, but I guess you are paying for the idea, long run what you save trimming your ends or bangs on a salon is worth it.</li>
            <li> I usually went for trims to my favorite salon, but they always cut off too much, even when I say not to.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> First of all if you have thick hair, you might have to repeat the process more than once.  </li>
            <li> I have super fine but really thick hair.</li>
            <li> The layers came out too choppy because the CreaClip doesn&#x27;t allow for angle cut layers which work better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I figured at $30, it was worth a shot, and if I butchered my hair, I could go back to the salon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> used to just cut the hair on the back of my head, pretty much at the hairline, by feeling.  </li>
            <li> After reading many reviews and watching the Youtube videos, I finally broke down and ordered it, and used it for the first time</li>
            <li> We were both amazed on how easy and great this work on cutting long layers.  </li>
            <li> When this happens, it&#x27;s not hard to fix, but it&#x27;s user error, not the clip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its easy to use after you get over the fear factor of your cutting your own hair.</li>
            <li> this clip makes cutting your own hair so easy.</li>
            <li> On my bangs, it worked better with wet hair, not dry.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and my hair looks better than with an expensive cut and color.  </li>
            <li> I was considering going to get a professional haircut, but I am super picky about the way my hair is cut, and the last time it was cut, the hairdresser ruined my hair by trying to use her scissors to razor cut my hair.  </li>
            <li> Will be getting a new one for me soon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She said you have to have very sharp scissors to have it work easily or just use a clipper......</li>
            <li> A seriously amazing product for people who only want their hair trimmed and seem to have trouble with stylists&#x27; understanding this request.</li>
            <li> The  lock on the big white clip has snapped, but hey its cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> I hated a fun one now and perfect every time!  </li>
            <li> The plastic looks sturdy, the clamp looks tight, it looks like it would serve it&#x27;s purpose and hold hair so you can easily cut.</li>
            <li> Most importantly of all -  take no alcohol before  attempting to cut your hair - since what looks great after a few snifters might look pretty horrific once you&#x27;ve sobered up!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> a personal choice).I did fumble for couple of minutes at the start when I used CreaClip for the first time, but its not a rocket science to figure it out.</li>
            <li> Whenever I go to the salon, I usually get ok or so-so results.  </li>
            <li> Worth the purchase in the long run.</li>
            <li> The resultant cut on my first try actually turned out well...</li>
            <li> It actually works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> First of all, Big Kudos goes to Amazon Delivery.  </li>
            <li> He has severe back problems and just couldn&#x27;t do the job consistently.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful tool for cutting hair!</li>
            <li> and I love the way they look, especially when they&#x27;re quite short in the back.</li>
            <li> My husband, who is definitely NOT a trained hairstylist, was able to do a nicer job than the stylist who recently cut the right side of my long hair an inch shorter than the left!  </li>
            <li> I have about 2 feet of super thick, super wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> actually better than professional haircuts I have paid $80+ for in the past.  </li>
            <li> Since my hair is a little fine</li>
            <li> There are full instructional videos for this and other styles given on the crea website.</li>
            <li> I decided that the investment in this product was small compared to the price of a good haircut (my hair is to the middle of my back</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier -- it is so simple, quick, and quiet</li>
            <li> Not only is the Creaclip well designed and easy to use, it gives users the potential to save not hundreds but thousands of dollars, with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> just use the large white clip on mine.</li>
            <li> Makes cutting hair at home not only easy and literally stress free, it&#x27;s fun to use too.</li>
            <li> Though my hair is not very long, I am at least able to cut it straight.</li>
            <li> Each time I get a little better, however I only trim a bit off at a time.</li>
            <li> i actually CAN cut my own hair without worrying about the results---although i did get my bangs a little too short!</li>
            <li> He made it clear that he didn&#x27;t want any part of this and thought I was going to ruin my hair and didn&#x27;t want to be at fault.  </li>
            <li> The directions that come with it are not as clear as the videos are.</li>
            <li> Really, the only reason I ordered from Amazon instead of directly from them was because I wanted to maintain my privacy</li>
            <li> The product is a bit pricey, but as far as I am concered it just paid for itself.</li>
            <li> I found this as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> I got it directly from their website because it&#x27;s a bit cheaper than on here</li>
            <li> I think the instructions on youtube and in the package for using the clip with bubble aligned are confusing, it should be better explained and shown on the instruction videos for each cut and style...</li>
            <li> The set also includes a smaller straight edge clip fortrimming bangs.</li>
            <li> but you can&#x27;t paste it back on if you cut off too much.</li>
            <li> I remember being very fussy about haircuts when I was younger.  </li>
            <li> my review is based on a basic cut, I haven&#x27;t ventured into any of the really layered styles suggested on the packaging.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t give you a cut like a salon obviously, but you really can&#x27;t tell unless you look closely and try to see if everything is even.  </li>
            <li> I have very wavy and very coarse hair, and I have A LOT of it.  </li>
            <li> Still even the big clip couldn&#x27;t snap on because I have so much hair.  </li>
            <li> - I waited two weeks for a home visit from a  professional hairdresser.  </li>
            <li> until your hair is in need of a wash, make it as straight as possible and brush it thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> I have this product and so far I have used it twice.</li>
            <li> Looks professionally done... lots of layers...</li>
            <li> Gave myself a rather professional looking trim.</li>
            <li> We even used our professional scissors for the cut.</li>
            <li> My daughter who is 30 years old, asked me to cut her hair</li>
            <li> that I don&#x27;t have to worry about the costs of getting frequent trims.</li>
            <li> Kudos to the woman who developed this product.  </li>
            <li> This surprised me because i&#x27;ve never been stopped like that before for any salon haircuts.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never been much longer than my shoulders, so I don&#x27;t see myself using the bigger clip often, if ever.  </li>
            <li> But was just like, wow.</li>
            <li> If you try to get it level while it is in your hair when the air bubble is way off on a far side, you will be sitting there waiting for it</li>
            <li> Now I do not even have to leave my home, and it only takes a few minutes, and it&#x27;s free from now on!</li>
            <li> I did a two layer cut and the top ended up being too short and uneven.  </li>
            <li> Such a simple invention, but totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, so this clip is a better option for me than the ponytail method.</li>
            <li> Okay, for those of you who seem to have devalued this product for thick or curly hair, please read all your information before submitting your review.</li>
            <li> Holy crap, it was awesome.</li>
            <li> It is a good idea on paper, but on the practice it is difficult.</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t use it any other way, as I can&#x27;t really see very well without my glasses &amp;</li>
            <li> Even with a flat iron, it doesn&#x27;t get perfectly straight.  </li>
            <li> I considered this item for a long time and had my doubts as it seemed it would only really work on straight one layer hair.</li>
            <li> A little pricey for what you get, but does the job and pretty much eliminates the need for trips to the salon for just a trim.</li>
            <li> I decided to chop my hair off recently after having some fun with hairdye and wanting to start fresh, I used the small clip and gave myself an A-line bob.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t pretend that I wasn&#x27;t hurt - and several months down the line I was able to hobble on my crutches and go back to his salon.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> one salon I&#x27;ve been too being older than 30 and only one,</li>
            <li> My hair had not been cut in more than a year and was really long, raggedy and shapeless.  </li>
            <li> My hair is about .5 inches past my shoulders now, total wash and wear but stylishly layered.</li>
            <li> When you first flip back, the layers might look a little funny; you have to flat iron them under because they are hanging so straight from ironing before the cut.</li>
            <li> I also get tired of straight across blunt bangs, and the clip made it easy to cut my grown out bangs into a side swept style.  </li>
            <li> the level on the crea-clip is not firm, it is rather flimsy so it is hard to get an accurate reading (that plus my wiggly 3 year old).</li>
            <li> I have long naturally straight hair</li>
            <li> Simply bend from the waste, brush hair out making sure you have no tangles, open your crea clip with the level facing you, curved side towards the end of your hair.</li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical, but after lots of research and finally trying it for myself, I love this product (so much so that I made a point to come back and leave a review)!</li>
            <li> I prefer to use professional stylist shears (get a good quality set of shears for hair cutting at your local CVS or find a decent pair on here.</li>
            <li> straight dry hair, hubby cut half an inch off the back by  smoothly combing the length to rest on my back and put it all into the large white clip in the &#x27;smiley face&#x27;</li>
            <li> My curls look springier and aren&#x27;t weighed down by the damaged ends, I have some fun layers, and I don&#x27;t think anybody could tell I didn&#x27;t go to a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair must be quite long for this clip to be useful; my hair was not long enough for it.  </li>
            <li> This would be a great deployment gift for a female soldier serving overseas or for someone who is chronically unhappy with salon haircuts.  </li>
            <li> This has been great at cutting the dead ends off my hair so that my hair can grow long and healthy and not just long and stringy.</li>
            <li> This product does really work!.I save lots of money by cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li> They ere okay, but I was unable to do it very well by myself.</li>
            <li> finally stopped being a &#x27;Creaclip Virgin&#x27; this afternoon - and seriously, if I thought they were rubbish - I&#x27;d be honest enough to tell you all.  </li>
            <li> Since long hair tends to cost more to cut, this will save me around $200 a year if not more on trims, etc.</li>
            <li> I was pretty shocked at how easy it was to give myself the exact cut I set out to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair it would work fine</li>
            <li> My hair is just barely long enough to use the big white clip, but I like the blue one more because I can do my bangs and a short A-line bob or straight-across short haircut with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a past middle age lady who has never cut her own hair other than trimming bangs.</li>
            <li> For the quality of product, I thought the money was high, but for the function...it should pay off in the long run (I hope).</li>
            <li> It created great side layers, but I had a little bit of hard a time getting the bubble in the middle when I was cutting my own hair gathered to the front for a V-shape.  </li>
            <li> and I wonder if I could have used my old \\&quot;banana clip\\&quot; for the same job?</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to go to a standard salon where they straighten it to cut it, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay the cost of going to a stylist who works with naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Then I did three big clip/cuts to chop off a bunch of bleach damaged hair, then I fixed up my bangs after washing/styling/drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> He retired to only doing men&#x27;s cuts at an old fashioned barber shop.</li>
            <li> Overall I was pleasantly surprised and impressed.d it once</li>
            <li> I have used it twice so far, only taking off a couple of inches.</li>
            <li> Normally it can take me 30 minutes to an hour depending on how much hair I&#x27;m taking off or if I&#x27;m going with a different hair style or adding bangs or whatever; 40 minutes is average for me.</li>
            <li> This does the job, but it&#x27;s kind of difficult.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that my thick hair might not all fit in the clip</li>
            <li> I thought I would use the side clip to angle it more, but I was afraid to with my hair being thin, and I really loved it as it was, so I just leave it like that.</li>
            <li> I will continue to trim my bangs and ends with a good pair of cutting shears and save the haircut for the salon.</li>
            <li> Use a good pair of scissors or for blunt cutting and ease you can use clippers.</li>
            <li> I kind of feel silly buying this product.</li>
            <li> I usually cut my own hair wet, and the crea clip says to use it dry.  </li>
            <li> but the clip was not tight enough to hold my hair.  </li>
            <li> The level can be perfectly straight but your hair is completely lopsided because half of it slid out of the clip.  </li>
            <li> (section ink off the top and cutting a shorter length the same way), gave myself bangs, trimmed an A-line bob (I do get a free trim/cut when I get a keratin treatment, so initial bob was cut professionally, couldn&#x27;t trim till long enough to see level in mirror).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used the small, straight clip on 3 yr old daughter&#x27;s long, straight hair, which is finer than mine, pretty average thickness for a straight-haired child of her age, I&#x27;d say.  </li>
            <li> Used the small, straight clip on 3 yr old daughter&#x27;s long, straight hair, which is finer than mine, pretty average thickness for a straight-haired child of her age, I&#x27;d say.  </li>
            <li> However, the results were less than thrilling..</li>
            <li> Even though you may cut half an inch at a time, it can still look pretty drastic.  </li>
            <li> Have my neck cranked back in a sink and burned with too hot water, just to listen to stylists gossip with each other, or have them convince me they were &amp;#34;experts&amp;#34</li>
            <li> , maybe it&#x27;s a little flexible to accommodate thick hair and that kind of thing.  </li>
            <li> am suppose to write at least 20 words describing my experience although I don&#x27;t really have much else to say.</li>
            <li> I love this product though, it makes cutting my hair so much quicker and with the level</li>
            <li> If you want the long layered look, have long straight hair this is for you.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used the short one for bangs.</li>
            <li> It gives me the freedom to cut as much as I want, but one must be careful no to cut too short.</li>
            <li> Only 4 stars for grownup hair because it&#x27;s not as easy to use on yourself as it appears on the video, especially if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> the little level really helped me!</li>
            <li> It was a little intimidating with my first self haircut</li>
            <li> My first experience had me fumbling with the level because it was hard to see the bubble between the white lines (black lines to help center the bubble would stand out more), also the fluid in the level was &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; so the bubble moved sluggishly and seemed to get stuck.</li>
            <li> I usually spend 30 or 35 on this haircut, so I think it&#x27;s absolutely worth it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting hubby&#x27;s hair for 25+ years and my mother&#x27;s hair to their complete satisfaction and simply wouldn&#x27;t try my own for fear of messing it up.  </li>
            <li> When we used it the first time we ended up with a choppy looking cut.</li>
            <li> First did a pass with clippers to get all the dead ends, then flipped again leaving an inch and trimmed into the edge for a softer result</li>
            <li> One of the main reasons I had waist length hair for so long is the maintenance of layered hair and the cost of forking out $50 monthly for a maintenance cut !!!!</li>
            <li> They want you to bend way over and comb your hair straight down.</li>
            <li> &gt; Gather all your equipment close by before you even attempt to cut then only cut a little at first - until you get used to using the Creaclip.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I have super thick super full hair, enough hair on my head for 4 people... and it still held on while cutting.</li>
            <li> I have curly 3a hair that I have been wearing straight half the time.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that I&#x27;m finally growing out to my natural gray.  </li>
            <li> I could definitely see the small clip being useful for bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> I could definitely see the small clip being useful for bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> While a little more difficult (though probably my fault since I didn&#x27;t trim my hair short first and basically chopped off 15inches all at once.. don&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> Definitely watch the videos on YouTube and be conservative with your first few trims, but this product fills a definite niche.</li>
            <li> if you have kids you can cut their hair quickly since they don&#x27;t like to sit still for long usually  </li>
            <li> conclusion is that CreaClip is most compatible for less thick heads of hair.</li>
            <li> not layer your fine hair to the point of looking thin and stringy at the ends.</li>
            <li> I also tried the mutli-layer method, just like in this Youtube video (which isn&#x27;t posted at their website), and it gave me lots of layers, but a little too much for my taste.  </li>
            <li> I also easily trimmed my straight-across bangs, and I even tried a little face framing (to even up my still-growing out crooked long layers that had been previously cut by the OWNER of another salon).  </li>
            <li> and I can cut off just the very ends to even them out, or just a little tiny bit of the split ends.</li>
            <li> I admit I did cut very little at a time until I got exactly the look</li>
            <li> I always hated visiting my hairdresser for trims or complete haircut, even the latest one(who was actually doing something right for my hair).</li>
            <li> It is so easy to trim my hair myself and know that it is straight which is impossible to do for the back of your hair without it.</li>
            <li> I decided the shortest layer was short enough, but the long layer wasn&#x27;t, so after I did the layering I went back, flipped the thing into smiley face (rather than frowny face) and went back over it.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair to the middle of my back and usually my husband trims it for me</li>
            <li> arriving at his building, I have struggled up the steps; been given a weak coffee and a cardboard biscuit (cookie) if I paid for the &#x27;full works&#x27; (around $70 in US currency).  </li>
            <li> Great idea for cutting hair, but I&#x27;m not sure why its curved.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing no more salons for me at least for haircuts</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new to hair cutting; I&#x27;ve cut my own hair without a CreaClip and several of my friends and family&#x27;s hair as well.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s still very easy to eyeball and get your hair even before you start cutting.  </li>
            <li> the leveling bubble was hard for me to see because i wear reading glasses, but i really like this product!</li>
            <li> I usually lift my hair up in sections and either cut straight across or angle my fingers to cut it short-to-long.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s going to last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> Especially for long hair.</li>
            <li> below the shoulders, and it was barely long enough to do that.  </li>
            <li> Next I combed the front and applied the clip to  create long bangs and face framing layers.  </li>
            <li> (it was long enough that I could see the level) and combed it just like the video.</li>
            <li> I have given my hair both a long, layered look and a bob short cut with these tools.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Its not bad, but its not great.  </li>
            <li> certainly nothing complex enough for me to justify a $60-$80 salon visit monthly.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, make sure the hair is spread out along the clip with cutting.</li>
            <li> I do a better job than when I went to the salon and came back unhappy with the trims that ended up in cuts.</li>
            <li> After having my third child, it&#x27;s even more inconvenient to go to the salon to have my haircut.  </li>
            <li> Last hairdresser kept cutting my hair just straight across bottom with no layers (though I asked several times) and straight, too short bangs.  </li>
            <li> I have super thin hair, and my hairdresser was always telling me I could never do the cuts I like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had stylists comment on how thick my hair is and it was especially evident to me while using CreaClip; with all my hair gathered together in the clip, my scissors did not snip effortlessly at the strands like I saw in the promotional videos, but rather my cuts felt chunky and forced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but this really works way better than me lifting and cutting.  </li>
            <li> I sectioned my hair off (I bought 4 to 5 inch long hair clips, called &amp;#34;crocodile clips and sold cheap through Amazon -- that really helps to control your hair and work in sections keeping track of where you are for layers) and took a cautious approach only planning on cutting a little in each section.</li>
            <li> you go little by little at first just to get a feel for it, it&#x27;ll help a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that, I really have trouble finding anything to complain about with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No need to say anything about Blue one,as it deals mainly with bangs so there is really no pulling of the hair due to less hair strands in the clip at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why these clips are priced so high.</li>
            <li> The bubble was hard to keep centered, but i don&#x27;t know if it really matters.</li>
            <li> I wish I could change: $30 is a little steep, especially given that I don&#x27;t need the bigger white clip.  </li>
            <li> I bought Creaclip because I have long hair and it is hard to cut it straight.</li>
            <li> My only concern is that when using the creaclip, you are cutting through a very thick section of hair,and although I&#x27;m happy using clippers on the boys hair as its cut so often, I wonder if the clippers damage the hair at all?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this works better than putting your hair up in a pony tail and cutting across but maybe for layers and bangs</li>
            <li> The videos on YouTube were of women with already long hair.</li>
            <li> AND I always ask for long textured layers</li>
            <li> ...especially if you have long hair.</li>
            <li> I used the clip to cut my long hair to a shorter bob.</li>
            <li> My hair was long, and this helped me go longer periods without going to the salon.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that I like with long layers and side swept bangs.</li>
            <li> If you want one length hair, someone else will have to cut your hair for you - unless you have REALLY, REALLY long hair and can bring it in front of you to cut it.</li>
            <li> I have long hair so this will save us a lot of money from haircut.  </li>
            <li> Gave my self a long bob..</li>
            <li> But next time I&#x27;m going to try a wet cut.  </li>
            <li> I had medium long hair and gave myself a trim and layers.  </li>
            <li> Why did I cut off all of my long hair--myself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &amp; I can imagine it being harder to trim layers above my head if my hair were any longer</li>
            <li> I have long hair and did a 3 layer cut.</li>
            <li> After letting my hair go too long wirh out trimming (yet again)</li>
            <li> I have LONG hair</li>
            <li> I style it in long layers.</li>
            <li> to even out for a really long time.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about the Creaclip and especially because there isn&#x27;t many reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have very wavy and THICK hair</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, and I have really had a hard time going to salons because they want to chop it all off.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s crazy easy to use, and it&#x27;s sturdy enough</li>
            <li> So the dry cutting was rather challenging.  </li>
            <li> I have a very basic style just an even cut in the back and slight layering in the front, so</li>
            <li> The level thing is basically obsolete because the fact that it&#x27;s straight doesn&#x27;t mean your hair is.  </li>
            <li> I used sharp professional scissors and did not have any problem holding the device firm enough to cut my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and use this to cut long layers.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works better with thinner hair, but it was hard to use while trying to cut my daughters hair...which is very thick.</li>
            <li> very patient while cutting because the product can slip out of place at certain inopportune times</li>
            <li> and I was not wanting a long angled bob!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had an A-line bob one other time</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;ve had too many bad haircuts from unprofessional stylists over the years.</li>
            <li> The whole concept is ridiculous and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I ordered next day service late Monday morning and received it by early evening.  </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t hold the hair in the clip tightly enough that I could lift it up and cut it myself which surprised me since I have thick hair that I would&#x27;ve thought would fill up the clip.  </li>
            <li> The little bubble in the level barely moves.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t rely on the new layered haircut to be exactly blended, you need to check your hair by slide cutting off the points, where hair is angled.</li>
            <li> I opted for the layered cut rather than single layer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I feel like the product has potential, but it is not right for me.</li>
            <li> We are on a limited income</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product most especially too people with hair that is not super thick or thin.</li>
            <li> I had very long down my back hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair that I am not particularly attached to</li>
            <li> I can put my hair in it while wet, pull it straight and cut (really, whoever is helping me does the cutting), with curly hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft, no more split ends, and it&#x27;s how I want</li>
            <li> Sad but true</li>
            <li> Theoretically, it makes sense that if you flip your hair, the hair will have a layered look when you cut it facing down.  </li>
            <li> just keep it in mind if you don&#x27;t always part your hair down the middle!</li>
            <li> And placing the clip close to the roots before sliding it down prevented the bangs from being in the proper position to cut evenly.</li>
            <li> My hair cascaded down my back for years, so I would just bring it forward and cut it that way.</li>
            <li> After the back was done, I&#x27;d angle down the sides of my head from there, using a three way mirror.  </li>
            <li> I lost my confidence in a big way - and today  happened to be the day; after almost 3 years of paying a lot for very little - that  I  finally plucked up the courage</li>
            <li> This product allows me to cut it just how I want it in dry hair!</li>
            <li> Makes cutting easy, but not any easier than without it.</li>
            <li> Take off less hair especially when you 1st learn how to use.</li>
            <li> Someone recently complimented my haircut after I changed up my layers slightly, and she couldn&#x27;t believe I did it myself.</li>
            <li> so I used a black Sharpie to mark over the white level lines.</li>
            <li> Also, the CreaClip could not handle the simple task of a slight trim.</li>
            <li> so I did go back with the small blue clip and cut one side.  </li>
            <li> this is very flimsy and not good quality for the amount spent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not flimsy but as the white one is quite bigger in size out of both the clips &amp; slightly curved,it might feel like slightly bendable.</li>
            <li> She always asks the salon to add just a few layers around the face and in the back to give her a little volume and not too short or  too long side swept bangs.  </li>
            <li> : It does make cutting quick and simple.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but after another crooked haircut from an expensive salon, I decided it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> blew out and flat ironed my hair, flipped it upside down</li>
            <li> They were just the plain old ordinary clippers that I use for his very short haircuts!  </li>
            <li> (Mine is thick and straight and the ends are easily made to look bad.)  </li>
            <li> But it could be made a little sturdier though, especially for its price.  </li>
            <li> But I decided to give it a go, taking off only a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very thick hair, so it stays in the clip very well.  </li>
            <li> It is clear on a white background making it hard to see from behind if you&#x27;re cutting your own hair.</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy cutting my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Also not sure if the plastic will hold up long as it is not of a very solid construction.</li>
            <li> but i found it difficult to hold it straight (even with the leveler) and cut at the same time.</li>
            <li> It would have made cutting my young daughters&#x27; hair so much easier.</li>
            <li> waste of money, it works for thick hair, not thin</li>
            <li> Gotta be careful with bangs.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and every time the stylists manage to cut it even when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> Anyway, I positioned the clip, had him check to verify that it was level, then held and pinched it closed while he clipped along the edge with electric hair clippers.  </li>
            <li> It is low quality and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s never really done how I want them...</li>
            <li> I bought mine a few months ago from the actual site.</li>
            <li> A few days later I decided to do it again alone</li>
            <li> It kept slipping out</li>
            <li> He then closed the clip and flipped it up (towards himself</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder than I thought to cut close to the edge</li>
            <li> that I have absolutely no intentions to ever pay a salon to cut my hair again.</li>
            <li> Oh the regrets...</li>
            <li> your hair is not straight and pulled taught, and combed so it falls from your scalp correctly, you can get a funky result.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s even harder to get to a salon.  </li>
            <li> Also, the leveller works really slow when trying to cut a 4 year old&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> and when you&#x27;re poor cutting corners is s good thing.</li>
            <li> this is extremely long, down below her waist....</li>
            <li> but it feels sort of odd when I don&#x27;t have it parted down the middle.</li>
            <li> I held it as tightly as I could and gave myself a long point cut in each layer.  </li>
            <li> You can cut your hair dirty or clean just brush</li>
            <li> I went a little long for fear of it not working.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it does the job</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but decided to purchase this.</li>
            <li> That works especially well when using the small crea for angled side bangs.</li>
            <li> discovered the Creaclip on youtube, watched a bunch of videos, and read what other people had to say.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical of this at first when I saw it in a Youtube video.  </li>
            <li> I have a side part so one side of my hair has shorter liars than the other.</li>
            <li> He actually lives nearby - and walks past my house every day,  but I respected that he wanted to keep his business and his neighbourhood life strictly separate -</li>
            <li> I seemed to cut one side longer than the other and had to &amp;</li>
            <li> I will have to go with the other reviews that say it&#x27;s junk.</li>
            <li> Or else I cut small, individual sections nipping at the curl (per the technique described in the book &amp;#34;Curly Girl&amp;#34; by Lorraine Massey.)  </li>
            <li> and I am scared to order anything from anyone after Spacebags requiring my phone number and selling it off to other companies.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I found the WHITE level markings on the white Creaclip very hard to see</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length  average to thin hair with several layers that need to be blended and have a little natural wave in spots.</li>
            <li> got the garbage bag out, brushed my dirty hair (before bath couldn&#x27;t wait), used the large clip for layers my hair is shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s time consuming to cut it yourself because you have to use two mirrors and constantly switch between a few little snips and double-checking how it looks.</li>
            <li> a few years ago after being subjected to too many bad hair cuts at salons (curly hair can be tricky to cut, either a stylist gets it or they don&#x27;t).  </li>
            <li> While still bending close the clip, snap it shut on the open end and slowly and carefully slide the clip towards the end of your hair.</li>
            <li> The instructions recommend that curly hair be straightened prior to cutting, but it seemed like too much work for me.</li>
            <li> and you slide the clip down, it will start leaning from one end to the other, even when the clip is not being moved (i tested it by placing it on a level table as well).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also hard to get the bubble in the middle of the level.  </li>
            <li> Guess what it is almost impossible to hold your hand steady watch for the little bubble in the level to be completely centered and</li>
            <li> My only complaint with the big curved clip is that it&#x27;s hard to clip shut as my hair is thicker than average.</li>
            <li> My average cost for a haircut at the salon is $27.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve saved a ton of money since it cost on average between 30-60 dollars per cut for woman&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair past my should</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but the latch does not stay closed on my hair while I am in process of cutting, I needed to keep repositioning the clip.</li>
            <li> The price is really not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, medium-length hair in layers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I will never have to go to the salon again and pay for a haircut that I hate.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it, but I don&#x27;t hate it either.  </li>
            <li> Your head is upside down while you&#x27;re brushing ir forward</li>
            <li> I used the clip with curve down</li>
            <li> You flip down your hair, clip on a CreaClip, and just cut.  </li>
            <li> With the Creaclip, that was shaved down to nothing.</li>
            <li> If I can do the same cut at home for a small investment of a fraction of the cost of one salon visit, it&#x27;s a win-win situation for me!</li>
            <li> I have had the Crea Clip for a few weeks now and so far I have used it a few times to make subtle changes to my layers and length.  </li>
            <li> Really easy to use for making layers or cutting hair into a Bob!</li>
            <li> Thicker hair will end up choppy even if you use the correct method, simply due to the amount of hair being cut at once.</li>
            <li> I started by taking off half an inch or so.</li>
            <li> I pay about $60 + tip for one visit, and this costs half the price of one visit.</li>
            <li> Less or no trips to a salon where I found hair stylists don&#x27;t know what they are doing regardless of their knowledge.</li>
            <li> Less color choice</li>
            <li> When I received the Creaclip, I immediately opened it and asked my 18 year old son to help with cutting the back after I applied the clip.  </li>
            <li> I got fed up with going to a salon just to have to come home and fix half of the cut anyway.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own bangs for a long time, and it seemed that I just get worse and worse at it.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair medium-short length, usually the length is just a little bit above my shoulders but not touching them.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and was starting to have trouble cutting it in the back.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even really mess with the level</li>
            <li> I have long thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> have long (just below bra length), wavy, thick hair with layers and</li>
            <li> Going to the salon was never fun for me, it&#x27;s expensive and always the same: the hairdresser tells me my hair is damaged from waiting too long to get a trim</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, and it was hard getting an even trim.</li>
            <li> It does not hold the hair tight while you cut.</li>
            <li> Overall not worth the 29.00 price tag, works poorly.</li>
            <li> too little</li>
            <li> Cut a little at a time as you go.&lt;br /&gt;Update: 2/2012--</li>
            <li> I ended up with an inverted bob (longer in front) type shape ( just a little longer).  </li>
            <li> so I went ahead and cut my hair, little at the time when I was done</li>
            <li> Had to look at alot of videos and trimmed a little at a time.</li>
            <li> Gave myself a little trim when the package arrived, and I have to say,</li>
            <li> came with a little piece of paper describing how to cut it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I think it is a little bit overpriced</li>
            <li> I can use by myself with little effort.  </li>
            <li> #34;wing it&amp;#34; a little, but</li>
            <li> Yes - this little unit is all that it proclaims to be.</li>
            <li> No.. it did not work for me, I fully followed the informercial and youtube videos, and the little paper insert.  </li>
            <li> The level is a little tempermental.</li>
            <li> Cut a little at a time if you are scared.</li>
            <li> Cut a little at a time if you are scared.</li>
            <li> Somehow, stylists would have trouble cutting her wet and her hair would be over layered , too blunt or the bangs would be cut  too short or long.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes have to trim it just a hair if I missed a piece, which happens, even my hairdresser did that, or sometimes, using the same cutting technique, I will slightly angle it if it needs it when I part my hair, and it falls a little differently.</li>
            <li> I wanted a few layers and wanted it to not be so blunt...just a little edginess to it.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t believe that my hair was a little uneven</li>
            <li> The combs inside the clip hold the hair in place very well, so you can level and then swing the hair around for easier cutting without messing up what you just measured out.  </li>
            <li> You will end up cutting to much hair, I returned this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few times to cut and trim my bangs.  </li>
            <li> It can also be used to achieve layers if you have thin hair like mine that won&#x27;t eaily stay in the larger clip...</li>
            <li> I had to watch a few of the videos over and over</li>
            <li> It takes a few times but nothing that can&#x27;t be worked out.</li>
            <li> Tried out on a practice wig and it came out uneven.</li>
            <li> but when it dries is completely uneven.  </li>
            <li> I like the length but need alot of layers to keep it from being too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I always try to get my hair trimmed once a month to get rid of the dead ends and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself a vain woman by any means, but I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of money and time over the years on botched haircuts and dye jobs.</li>
            <li> I ordered it off of the Creaclip site, which sells for a few dollars cheaper than Amazon.</li>
            <li> I saw some videos on youtube a few times using this product and I rolled my eyes.</li>
            <li> ; who then went on to destroy my hair.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first because the clip is just a semi-curved clip that clamps the hair together.  </li>
            <li> read all the instructions and even watched a few videos on YouTube before giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> what I did one side was uneven.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my daughter&#x27;s thinner and straighter hair and it looked choppy.</li>
            <li> These are not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Just remember to watch how to do it a few times</li>
            <li> If you are a stay at home mom and your hair ends up in a messy bun on your head 30 minutes into the morning til the kids are in bed like myself it will work for you.  </li>
            <li> I would rather spend a few dollars to get my hair cut at the salon.</li>
            <li> I wish I didnt waste my time on this junk.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair, I recommend having your hair wet.</li>
            <li> I can now cut it whenever it needs even the teeniest trim, and all for less than the price I used to pay at the salon!</li>
            <li> Maybe it works on thicker hair my hair kept sliding out which made impossible to cut it straight!</li>
            <li> On the other hand, this isn&#x27;t a hard product to use, but if you want results like the ones on the CreaClip website, you somewhat have to know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t particularly nervous to start cutting it off.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair and starting cutting my hair at home (with assistance)</li>
            <li> Cutting her hair dry was the key!</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t have to discuss vacation plans in a bored, mechanical fashion - and I don&#x27;t have to quietly cry about an expensive job that is far from earth-shattering in its appeal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re &amp;#34;between salons,&amp;#34; have long hair, or for whatever reason, have to maintain the shape of your hair yourself, you could do a lot worse.  </li>
            <li> I am so elated with this product for taking the ease out of cutting my own hair which by the way would take up to an hour, (as is I foil my hair and highlight also, which takes an hour) and this product has now taken one step out of my life that I hated doing and took too long.  </li>
            <li> The lock was a little clumsy, but it did work and hold the hair in place.</li>
            <li> It takes a little time to adjust to using the bubble since it moves slowly</li>
            <li> No more stressful trips to the salon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> usual Amazon sent my order on time,without any problems.</li>
            <li> I used the small clip at an angle in the front to do what would be called face-framing layers if they were shorter.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what you&#x27;d call it when it&#x27;s just close to the bottom</li>
            <li> I used the small clip at an angle in the front to do what would be called face-framing layers if they were shorter.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what you&#x27;d call it when it&#x27;s just close to the bottom</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never cut hair in my life, but, within a few minutes, I was creating layers all over the place!</li>
            <li> If you are merely looking to give yourself a basic cut, this will do the trick.  </li>
            <li> I did like the small one for the bangs/ toplayers.</li>
            <li> No more so so haircuts or stylists who never listen.</li>
            <li> , did the job, love the fact that I won&#x27;t have to have another bad cut EVER!!</li>
            <li> no matter which way you use the larger clip (smiley face or sad face), you still get a v-back shape to your cut.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not totally satisfied with.  </li>
            <li> , next time just come in sooner, then they ask what shampoo I use and try to get me to buy their expensive salon shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have mastered my skills cutting my husband&#x27;s and boys&#x27; hair for the last 7 years and have it down to a science...</li>
            <li> If you have very thin hair, like I do, you can also use the small blue clip to cut the rest of your hair, but that would be</li>
            <li> I hate going to the salons because they never seem to get it right.  </li>
            <li> Well, unfortunately, I have been very ill following a fractured femur in early 2011.</li>
            <li> Also, I watched a few videos prior to the cutting, but I still ended up butchering my hair.</li>
            <li> Some of the amateur reviews on Youtube are quite scary, not very helpful - and some of the ladies are hacking away at their hair without even looking at what they are doing.  </li>
            <li> i have very thick hair and the little snap on the end</li>
            <li> The reason I gave a 4 and not a 5 is because the level is alittle hard to move.</li>
            <li> But I would suggest them to pack this product in some hard casing</li>
            <li> and I wanted some layers in, hard to explain to another stylist</li>
            <li> I thought it was hard to do with my type of hair</li>
            <li> Was hard to keep my hair from moving in the clip.</li>
            <li> If I pressed the 2 pieces together really hard the clip would stay in but thats something I paid to not have to do.  </li>
            <li> I also had a hard time communicating the type of layering I wanted.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, they may slide a little, but still work as they should.  </li>
            <li> On the negative side.....the tools are plastic and probably cost a couple of dollars (if that) to produce.</li>
            <li> Before, I spent 3 hours just to trim off any split ends between expensive salon visits.  </li>
            <li> Have not used for cutting the back of my hai yet.</li>
            <li> I am always used to cutting my hair my self for years, but after seeing the CreaClip on YouTube, I thought to myself finally!</li>
            <li> months ago, I showed him my Creaclips - and asked him if he&#x27;d ever used them - which caused him to sneer and be quite rude and dismissive of their ability to cut hair efficiently.  </li>
            <li> I decided not to go to a hair salon after a lady cut at least 5 inches of my hair</li>
            <li> and I just wanted to cut a least an inch of my hair</li>
            <li> Just follow instructions and start off slow to begin with til your confidence is built.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, hair.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair like mine, you might have to trim across twice in order to cut all of the hair.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t appear too thick.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t mention that you need to have really thick hair to 1.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know because I don&#x27;t have thick hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for a few years now because I&#x27;ve had several bad experiences with hair dressers giving me ugly haircuts, uneven haircuts, and a very expensive salon ruined my purple hair colour twice in a row.</li>
            <li> The bubbles in the clips are very small and hard to see.</li>
            <li> I am an amateur with a little bit of experience cutting my kids&#x27; hair and the hair of a few friends over the years.  </li>
            <li> not only was it a horrible mess, but there was absolutely no pattern, within the cut.</li>
            <li> i had a long hair when i tried cutting with this item..</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but after a week of seeing different people use it on youtube, I ordered it.</li>
            <li> For the rest of the hair, (past shoulder length, blunt cut,) I&#x27;m not really sure if it was cut evenly, but it was difficult to see what you&#x27;re doing in the recommended position.</li>
            <li> After using CreaClip, I found it shorten the cutting time in half (usually takes an hour).</li>
            <li> It got way too expensive, and I just couldn&#x27;t continue to afford going every few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair myself already, using the ponytail method, but I saw the Creaclip mentioned on a blog and got curious.  </li>
            <li> I ended up cutting it shorter than I wanted due to mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel so anxious going to someone and getting my hair cut, since the last time it was so uneven and terrible looking.</li>
            <li> With my work schedule its very hard to make an appointment to get my hair cut.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thin, wavy hair</li>
            <li> while sending itfar away distance(India for me),the way it was packed, it could have been broken in shipping(slight</li>
            <li> Poor guy.  </li>
            <li> She always said my hair was too thin, and I just didn&#x27;t care for what I was ending up with after every visit.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my cousin since i was tired of her asking for it.</li>
            <li> NOW IM ADDICTED TO IT.</li>
            <li> Tired of spending hundreds on cut and color</li>
            <li> Would not recommend if your hair is thin.  </li>
            <li> My last haircut was the worst.</li>
            <li> I admit It was scary to cut my hair using it, uncertain if maybe I may turn out with a nightmare cut..</li>
            <li> Nothing too complicated and</li>
            <li> Then they would try to sell me expensive stuff I didn&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> Oh, and a product that also helps with the movement if you have weird hair like mine is a hair serum called HerStyler that I got on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use, level does not work well.</li>
            <li> My hair is shorter and it is useless.</li>
            <li> I think it is way too expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> I have been to a stylist two times in the past 25 years and both times I was disappointed to tears.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I think I threw out the fringe contraption with the packaging, but the layering tool I still have</li>
            <li> -which was still jolly expensive at fifteen quid ($25).&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> , I never get the cut I like, and it&#x27;s way too expensive.</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical, but I can say after using this for a year, I haven&#x27;t been to a salon</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about this product.  </li>
            <li> Plus, maintaining split ends in layers is difficult the way salons do it.</li>
            <li> (when my hair is curly, blunt cuts look silly).</li>
            <li> : in the wrong hands, scissors can be a murder weapon where your hairstyle is concerned.</li>
            <li> then any where I&#x27;ve paid, which is always expensive because of the length.</li>
            <li> Basically it useless.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is very poor.  </li>
            <li> I think I would stick to cutting kids hair with this tool.  </li>
            <li> For cutting kids hair I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Makes for at home hair cutting simple.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I may save it for use when cutting others&#x27; hair, however.</li>
            <li> I watched few videos Online and decided to give it a try (worst case scenario I will return this item and go to a beauty salon).  </li>
            <li> We found a youtube demonstration by &#x27;stealingbeauty&#x27;on cutting in bangs and layering around the face using the creaclip.</li>
            <li> My husband helped with positioning and cutting.  </li>
            <li> I feel scared for those using it without any experience cutting hair.  </li>
            <li> AND YOU SAVE ALOT OF MONEY WHEN CUTTING IT</li>
            <li> so he could see where he was cutting.  </li>
            <li> then start cutting your hair without moving the clip.</li>
            <li> My husband studied online videos of cutting women&#x27;s styles with scissors.</li>
            <li> My hubs is too afraid he&#x27;ll screw up, so I&#x27;ve mastered doing this on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But wrong!</li>
            <li> I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> After my daughter had a really bad experience at a hair salon i started cutting and dying her hair .This</li>
            <li> What a stupid expensive rule</li>
            <li> For two pieces of hair clips at $30. is a very expensive purchase.</li>
            <li> It is easier to cut hair on mannequins because you can position the tripod in an infinite amount angles and degrees that is impossible to place humans.</li>
            <li> It does not spread the hair out and the bubble level is almost impossible to see.</li>
            <li> Too bad my hair stylist will not see me again now that I have this.  </li>
            <li> Not even bad results.</li>
            <li> I did it without making it look bad.  </li>
            <li> Not too bad.</li>
            <li> Or worse, I get terrible results.  </li>
            <li> Grrr....</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> After a terrible and incredibly expensive experience at the hair salon, I decided I was no longer going to let someone cut my hair or dye it.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> Will it work for a clip I don&#x27;t give a crap hair cut?</li>
            <li> I hate getting my hair cut and have been looking for ways to DIY.</li>

            <li> hate spending money to get my hair cut.</li>
            <li> I move a lot and finding people to cut your hair as you want or without mistakes is brutal.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Crea Clip works like a charm for my A-line cut, layers, and bangs</li>
            <li> I watched tons of videos before I decided to purchase this, I thought it looked too good to be true.  It really does make perfect cuts everytime, and it seems like it&#x27;s hard to mess it up. I usually spend 30 or 35 on this haircut, so I think it&#x27;s absolutely worth it.  I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be back to the salon EVER!!!!!</li>
            <li> I messed up my bangs, but fortunately not bad enough to have them professionally repaired.  I do not recommend this for amateurs.</li>
            <li> I think I would stick to cutting kids hair with this tool.  I don&#x27;t think you are going to be super accurate.  The little bubble in the level barely moves.  I think it might be in oil instead of water.  I&#x27;ve used a few times to cut and trim my bangs.  I&#x27;ve used more of an eyeball approach to see if it&#x27;s exactly straight or not...and that&#x27;s exactly where I think you might get into trouble!  I don&#x27;t think I would cut my whole hair with it for that reason.  Also you have to have just the right amount of hair in the clip...too much and it will unclip..too little and it slides off.  Bangs seem to be the easiest thing.  Which I think can help between visits to the beauty shop...and that&#x27;s a good thing!</li>
            <li> Perfect for me! Now I never have to see the stylist again. I have thin, wavy hair and this makes it easy to get that layers that make my hair look thicker. I especially love the smaller clip for the bangs. It can also be used to achieve layers if you have thin hair like mine that won&#x27;t eaily stay in the larger clip...</li>
            <li> Bought the creaclip to cut my teenage daughter&#x27;s hair.  Her hair is  straight,strawberry blond and fine. She always asks the salon to add just a few layers around the face and in the back to give her a little volume and not too short or  too long side swept bangs.  Somehow, stylists would have trouble cutting her wet and her hair would be over layered , too blunt or the bangs would be cut  too short or long.  I had to watch a few of the videos over and over but I finally felt confident enough to cut her hair. Cutting her hair dry was the key! The level kept me from making any major mistakes and she loved the results.</li>
            <li> The creaclip is  awsome.t This product does really work!.I save lots of money by cutting my own hair. Love the CREACLIP.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something like this. I just want to add layers and trim my hair when it fits in my schedule. My last haircut was the worst. My bangs were cut so short, I actually cried. I have been gun-shy ever since. I first trimmed up my bangs.. Easy Breezy.. Then layers in my hair. I went a little long for fear of it not working. It looked great. I then took another two inches off and added a ton of layers. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.. The product is a bit pricey, but as far as I am concered it just paid for itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tryin to grow my hair out for awhile. This has been great at cutting the dead ends off my hair so that my hair can grow long and healthy and not just long and stringy. It was a bit of a challenge at first with shoulder length hair. The videos on YouTube were of women with already long hair. I would like to see more women with short hair using this and how it works for them. Its easy to use after you get over the fear factor of your cutting your own hair. I always keep in mind that I can always come back and cut more. Gotta be careful with bangs. lol. The reason I gave a 4 and not a 5 is because the level is alittle hard to move. I try to get it in the middle but it doesn&#x27;t move until I take it off my head and start movin it around. It takes a few times but nothing that can&#x27;t be worked out. I also use this to cut my 2 year olds hair and bangs which saves me double.</li>
            <li> great product, it does a great job!</li>
            <li> I accidentally found about CreaClip on YouTube and had to have it...and when it arrived in the mail today, I tried it.  I have thin, long hair, and I was successfully able to put layers in my hair on my own using the small CreaClip - awesome!  I highly recommend viewing all the CreaClip videos on YouTube before you cut your hair - they are very helpful, much more than the instructions that came with the product.  I am going to save a lot of time and money cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li> Great idea for cutting hair, but I&#x27;m not sure why its curved.  Also, the leveller works really slow when trying to cut a 4 year old&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really work the way I thought it would. Bummer!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The one thing I wish was different, is the color of the liquid in the level. It is clear on a white background making it hard to see from behind if you&#x27;re cutting your own hair. I hope the manufacturer sees this and adds a color to the level. Other than that, it does the job and I am happy with the purchase. I&#x27;ve used the product twice since purchase. I recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SOO happy I found this as far as I&#x27;m concerned. I&#x27;m not ever going back to the hair Solon!!  I went in aug and they cut 12inches off and I was not wanting a long angled bob!  Anyways. I love the V cut and now I can do it myself!</li>
            <li> I tried it for the 1st time after receiving it thru USPS.  I got it directly from their website because it&#x27;s a bit cheaper than on here, it was $29.95 plus shipping.  It created great side layers, but I had a little bit of hard a time getting the bubble in the middle when I was cutting my own hair gathered to the front for a V-shape.  Then I asked my friend to cut it from the back cause it didn&#x27;t want the V-shape, so she cut if from the back and I got a U-cut and it looks good.  I also tried the mutli-layer method, just like in this Youtube video (which isn&#x27;t posted at their website), and it gave me lots of layers, but a little too much for my taste.  Here is the link to the videos I followed.     [...]  [...]    I think next time I cut my hair, I&#x27;ll just go with the video \\&quot;layers framing the face\\&quot; cut.</li>
            <li> Works great. I used it to cut my hair myself but it is so much easier when my husband helps me. I would recommend it. Will probably be purchasing one for my mom.  Saves my husband a lot of money. lol</li>
            <li> Crea Clip is my hair&#x27;s new best friend! It works great! Just as easy as the demonstration videos on the website.</li>
            <li> I like the product, I really like the concept and it does what it says it will do.  But it could be made a little sturdier though, especially for its price.  I&#x27;d like to see it in maybe a tougher plastic with a stronger lock and maybe larger comb teeth.  It seems like it is going to eventually give out one day.  These kinds of things need to be made to withstand abuse and I don&#x27;t think this one is going to.  I don&#x27;t know, maybe it&#x27;s a little flexible to accommodate thick hair and that kind of thing.  I still like it though.</li>
            <li> Useful for basic trims, good videos to watch available on Creaclip website. A good tool to have and pays for itself quickly. Sturdy, seems like it will last awhile.  More difficult to use for shorter hair or by yourself.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like them at all, kept getting caught in hair, did not want to stay level with the bubble, would not buy, not recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this creaclip! It certainly helped me style and cut my own hair and my children too! I am very satisfied with product, thank u</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it. IT gave her beautiful layers down the sides. Very easy to use. :)&lt;br /&gt;I am suppose to write at least 20 words describing my experience although I don&#x27;t really have much else to say. It is a great tool to have to keep your hair neat and trim. My daughter uses it the most and her hair came out great. I was very impressed.</li>
            <li> Great - love it. No more stressful trips to the salon.&lt;br /&gt; My only criticism  is that the info paper that comes in the container has many typos and/or spelling mistakes which made me think this particular &#x27;CreaClip&#x27;&#x27; is a cheaply produced copy. Made me doubt the quality of the item...  but seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> I always hated visiting my hairdresser for trims or complete haircut, even the latest one(who was actually doing something right for my hair). Sometimes because they used to chop-up my hair length or sometimes because they used to charge me with such nightmarish bill amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But thank God for Ms.Mai Lieu, she invented such great product. First time ever in my life I gave myself a complete haircut(&amp; I can totally say I am loving how it turned out). I never before gave myself even a simple trim(I was terrified of messing my hair). This haircut I gave myself with CreaClip really looks good.Layers &amp; fringes came out good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the instructional video showed that you can use,both scissors or hair trimmer with CreaClip. I used hair trimmer, cause I like that blunt look it gave(Its a personal choice).I did fumble for couple of minutes at the start when I used CreaClip for the first time, but its not a rocket science to figure it out. Anyone can use it. I even used it with my glasses on(well, I couldn&#x27;t use it any other way, as I can&#x27;t really see very well without my glasses &amp; No, I am not an old lady, :-) ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CreaClip&#x27;s material quality is also good. It&#x27;s really not flimsy but as the white one is quite bigger in size out of both the clips &amp; slightly curved,it might feel like slightly bendable. But thats actually a good thing if you have wavy hair, rather than straight(as shown in the instructional videos), otherwise you might have felt the pulling while sliding the clip when balancing the level. No need to say anything about Blue one,as it deals mainly with bangs so there is really no pulling of the hair due to less hair strands in the clip at a time. I don&#x27;t know about the curly hair type, mine is wavy. So you might have to straighten your hair before using CreaClip if you have curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual Amazon sent my order on time,without any problems. But I would suggest them to pack this product in some hard casing while sending itfar away distance(India for me),the way it was packed, it could have been broken in shipping(slight chances were there).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely recommend this amazing product to anyone who wants to save money on their haircuts &amp; trims.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says; easy to use, keep clean, and a great result every time.Would recommend to anybody who might be interested.</li>
            <li> The creaclip works exceptionally well on my 9-year-old daughter&#x27;s hair. I cut her hair in about 8 minutes with no fuss. For cutting kids hair I give it 5 stars. For grownup hair, I give it 4 stars. I have thick, coarse, medium-length hair in layers. This does the job, but it&#x27;s kind of difficult. Also I have to use thinning shears to get some bulk out of the layers. I can&#x27;t complain though, I&#x27;ve stopped getting my hair cut at the salon so that I can save money for highlights. I&#x27;ve saved a lot of money since I purchased this and I really enjoy cutting my daughter&#x27;s hair. I get compliments on my hair as well. Only 4 stars for grownup hair because it&#x27;s not as easy to use on yourself as it appears on the video, especially if you have thick hair. I would not recommend for curly hair.</li>
            <li> CreaClip works well for my fine, \\&quot;bendy\\&quot; hair. It&#x27;s easy to use. I had my adult daughter use it on my hair the first time. It took her almost no time at all to trim the length of my hair. I haven&#x27;t tried to layer with it, but I can see by the instructional videos and how easily it worked on my trim, that layering will be a breeze. My average cost for a haircut at the salon is $27. The CreaClip was $33 (including the tax). Basically, it paid for itself in one haircut.&lt;br /&gt;  I purchased it on Sunday evening, and received it on Tuesday.</li>
            <li> This product is a good idea, mostly for long hair layers, bangs and trimmings, beyond that execution is only as good as you or the person helping you to cut your hair are with scissors. I think is overpriced for what really material is, but I guess you are paying for the idea, long run what you save trimming your ends or bangs on a salon is worth it.</li>
            <li> Tried out on a practice wig and it came out uneven. However I have watched all the videos on how to use it and have good expectations moving forward. Hoping to save $ on haircuts going forward.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this works better than putting your hair up in a pony tail and cutting across but maybe for layers and bangs it may be useful.</li>
            <li> I bought this Crea Clip awhile back and have used it about 4 or 5 times. Each time I get a little better, however I only trim a bit off at a time. I have thick hair, so this clip is a better option for me than the ponytail method. It does take a bit of practice, so I wouldn&#x27;t suggest anything drastic to begin with. The level on the clip is ok, but if you don&#x27;t hold your head perfectly straight it doesn&#x27;t matter anyhow, so that&#x27;s why I suggest trimming a bit at a time. The videos on their website are okay, but I found much better ones on You Tube and have gotten quite a few ideas from there by watching other peoples&#x27; techniques. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> the level on the crea-clip is not firm, it is rather flimsy so it is hard to get an accurate reading (that plus my wiggly 3 year old). Other than that it works great, it s a great idea... just needs better quality (it&#x27;s not that cheap after all).</li>
            <li> Never going to a hair salon again for a haircut!  I have wavy hair and every time the stylists manage to cut it even when it&#x27;s wet but when it dries is completely uneven.  This product allows me to cut it just how I want it in dry hair!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read my full review, complete with photos of my use of CreaClip and the happy results at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]  dot com</li>
            <li> great product for starters just learning to cut ur own hair. The leveler is handy and it seems sturdy.</li>
            <li> I have been trimming my own hair, I found this product on youtube. I was skeptical at first but decided to purchase this. I&#x27;m very happy with it. I have long naturally straight hair thats layered, my layers were almost grown out. I watched the instruction videos on youtube for layered cuts and gave it a go.. It took awhile to get used to using it, making sure the bubble is in the middle. I think the instructions on youtube and in the package for using the clip with bubble aligned are confusing, it should be better explained and shown on the instruction videos for each cut and style... I also think this should have came with a dvd of how to use it with different styles, this is why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5..After the confusion,Once I got the hang it was so easy. I admit It was scary to cut my hair using it, uncertain if maybe I may turn out with a nightmare cut..It came out so nice!! I was able to put 3 different level layers into my hair. I actually cut 20 oz of my hair as I went along, I couldnt believe how easy it was. It really looked liked I went to the salon.. I was able to keep my length and give myself layers, at the salon I always say to keep my length but it gets chopped off.... If you cut your hair at home, this is a great product you will want to use. I am going to see how it grows out, I am really considering skipping the salon. If you want the long layered look, have long straight hair this is for you. TIP:: Cut a little at a time as you go.&lt;br /&gt;Update: 2/2012-- I have not been to the salon since ive been using this, i have saved so much money and time. It takes a couple of tried to master using it on your own hair, i simply love it..</li>
            <li> Makes for at home hair cutting simple.&lt;br /&gt;So easy to use. I keep my stacked bob trimmed up myself now.</li>
            <li> The CreaClip is FANTASTIC!  I have about 2 feet of super thick, super wavy hair.  I like the length but need alot of layers to keep it from being too heavy.  Whenever I go to the salon, I usually get ok or so-so results.  Or worse, I get terrible results.  So many have a tough time with this much hair, don&#x27;t get the layers even or cut off way more than I requested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the CreaClip...never again!  I was concerned that my thick hair might not all fit in the clip but it was not an issue at all.  I&#x27;d watched a lot of YouTube videos on the CreaClip before attempting it myself.  I must say, it really is as easy as they show you!  I was very conservative with my 1st cut, just to make sure I liked the results.  Creating layers was very easy and I LOVE the way it looks.  The level isn&#x27;t really very good but it doesn&#x27;t even matter - it&#x27;s still very easy to eyeball and get your hair even before you start cutting.  Now my split ends are gone, I have face-framing layers, my waves have turned into the curls I was hoping for and my hair feels so much lighter without losing the length!</li>
            <li> I am an amateur with a little bit of experience cutting my kids&#x27; hair and the hair of a few friends over the years.  I watched YouTube videos on this, ordered it and prepared to cut my hair to about collar bone length, taking off a couple of inches.  I had trouble getting the clip to hold the hair just right and be level without help, and then to also have a free hand to cut the hair without the clip moving.  I had to call my husband over to help.  He made it clear that he didn&#x27;t want any part of this and thought I was going to ruin my hair and didn&#x27;t want to be at fault.  Poor guy.  Anyway, I positioned the clip, had him check to verify that it was level, then held and pinched it closed while he clipped along the edge with electric hair clippers.  I ended up with an inverted bob (longer in front) type shape ( just a little longer).  The curve of the big clip is not enough to make the hair the same length all the way around.  I was able to use it on each side individually to improve the sameness of the length.  I then had to use scissors to improve the choppiness of the edges, which I was able to do well except for the very back.  Fortunately for me, my sister went to beauty school and was willing to come over and fix the back for me the next day.  The next time I needed a hair cut I went back to my stylist.  The process using the creaclip on my own hair was just more than I wanted to deal with again.  It might be better if you have longer hair that is more forgiving than mine.  (Mine is thick and straight and the ends are easily made to look bad.)  I will try using this on my daughter&#x27;s hair and think it might be easier.  It just doesn&#x27;t hold the hair in the clip tightly enough that I could lift it up and cut it myself which surprised me since I have thick hair that I would&#x27;ve thought would fill up the clip.  I guess it&#x27;s not one size fits all.  If you really want to save money and are willing to take a lot of time and perhaps already cut your own hair, you might be glad to have this tool.  I could definitely see the small clip being useful for bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Used the small, straight clip on 3 yr old daughter&#x27;s long, straight hair, which is finer than mine, pretty average thickness for a straight-haired child of her age, I&#x27;d say.  It worked really well and was very easy to do.  I used the small clip at an angle in the front to do what would be called face-framing layers if they were shorter.  Not sure what you&#x27;d call it when it&#x27;s just close to the bottom but hopefully you get the idea.  Her haircut looks perfectly professional and very nice.  I ordered a popular pair of affordable hair cutting scissors on Amazon and used those along with this product.  Happy to have bought these tools, if only to cut other people&#x27;s hair.e glad to have this tool.

            <li> I LOVE this little tool. This will give you THE perfect layered cut in less time than it takes to make a cup of coffee. Simply bend from the waste, brush hair out making sure you have no tangles, open your crea clip with the level facing you, curved side towards the end of your hair. While still bending close the clip, snap it shut on the open end and slowly and carefully slide the clip towards the end of your hair. If you slide it more so toward the front of your face, towards your forehead, you will have leave your hair longer in the back. Sliding it more up towards the top of your head at the crown will give you a shorter cut in the back. While you are sliding it&#x27;s imperative to watch the level. Make sure the bubble is in the middle when you stop sliding or you will leave your hair shorter on one side. When you have it where you want it lengthwise, bubble in the middle of the level, either stand up or remain bent over, whatever is more comfortable for you. At this point it doesn&#x27;t matter if you move the clip with your hair still in it. Just cut the hair that is above the clip. You can use an electric hair trimmer or scissors  to cut the hair flush to the clip, resulting in more volume and blunt cut layers. I prefer to use professional stylist shears (get a good quality set of shears for hair cutting at your local CVS or find a decent pair on here. No need to spend a fortune on shears though.  Just make sure it&#x27;s a brand name, like Tweezerman, such as these top rated ones here on Amazon [[ASIN:B000WI0640 Tweezerman  Stainless 2000 Styling Shears]], I use my shears to cut the hair above the clip vertically, at an angle. That results in more professional looking textured layers. After trimming hair, remove clip and shake out hair or brush it out for a really professionally layered cut with a stylish U shape in the back.     There are full instructional videos for this and other styles given on the crea website. The set also includes a smaller straight edge clip fortrimming bangs. It&#x27;s also notable that both clips have the built in level which swivels for true angle cuts. That works especially well when using the small crea for angled side bangs. My only complaint with the big curved clip is that it&#x27;s hard to clip shut as my hair is thicker than average. But it&#x27;s still a really great buy, there&#x27;s videos on YouTube as well for more styling tips and tricks from customers and professional hair stylists, although in my opinion, this clip could easily put stylists out of business. Paid for itself after one use and I&#x27;ve used it every 6 weeks since I got it, so I&#x27;ve saved a ton of money since it cost on average between 30-60 dollars per cut for woman&#x27;s hair. Just  two caveats. Take off less hair especially when you 1st learn how to use. You can always take off more but you can&#x27;t paste it back on if you cut off too much. Secondly, make sure the hair is spread out along the clip with cutting. You don&#x27;t want to use it as a ponytail holder and then cut your hair that way, although there is a way to cut hair by using the ponytail method. It just doesn&#x27;t come out anywhere near as nice as it does when using this great little ingenious device known as the Crea Clip. Google Crea Clip and watch the videos on YouTube. You will be hooked.</li>
            <li> On the plus side. The product does what it is advertised to do. Trim hair, provide good layers and simple styling with ease. It will definitely drop the need for multiple salon visits and help keep some money in your pocket. Worth the purchase in the long run. Be sure to be conservative the first time you use the Creaclip! Dont cut too much. Follow the directions. As the video emphasizes....you can always go back and cut more. My first experience had me fumbling with the level because it was hard to see the bubble between the white lines (black lines to help center the bubble would stand out more), also the fluid in the level was &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; so the bubble moved sluggishly and seemed to get stuck. The lock was a little clumsy, but it did work and hold the hair in place. The resultant cut on my first try actually turned out well...now that I have the hang of it I will go back and take a bit more off to get exactly the style I want. On the negative side.....the tools are plastic and probably cost a couple of dollars (if that) to produce. Good invention but wish it was priced more reasonably....I think $19.99 would have been more fair of a price, but hey...when you have the market cornered...capitalism reigns. Also not sure if the plastic will hold up long as it is not of a very solid construction. ---Update Sept 2016. ---I still am using this product years later. Has saved me hundreds of dollars on salon cuts. The  lock on the big white clip has snapped, but hey its cheap plastic. Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I used it twice, seems easy, seems to do nice job, but it&#x27;s thin plastic, and I had hard time focusing on bubble, even with eye glasses, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s just my problem with age. I have super thick super full hair, enough hair on my head for 4 people... and it still held on while cutting. Now that I have it, I&#x27;m thinking almost $40 and I wonder if I could have used my old \\&quot;banana clip\\&quot; for the same job? For the quality of product, I thought the money was high, but for the function...it should pay off in the long run (I hope).</li>
            <li> This product has saved me so much money!  I always try to get my hair trimmed once a month to get rid of the dead ends and the keep my cut looking fresh.  I just happened upon a youtube video of someone using this and couldn&#x27;t wait to give it a shot!  I ordered it almost immediately and tried it the very day it came.  It works just like it says.  I love that there are tutorials for different types of haircuts too.  I&#x27;m like my hair simple.  Light layers with some face framing bangs.  Nothing too complicated and certainly nothing complex enough for me to justify a $60-$80 salon visit monthly.  I haven&#x27;t gone to the salon since I got this and since I don&#x27;t color my hair, I see no reason to go back!  It keeps my hair the way I like, it&#x27;s crazy easy to use, and it&#x27;s sturdy enough I feel like it&#x27;s going to last me a long time.  I&#x27;m so pleased I ended up getting this product.  I don&#x27;t have any, but I imagine this is great for parents.  I remember being very fussy about haircuts when I was younger.  So something this quick and easy would be great for those types of kids! :D</li>
            <li> Love it, super easy to use and great results. I did my own hair and two other girls and we all love our new haircuts. I don&#x27;t think I will ever pay for a haircut. soo worth the investment!!</li>
            <li> I am living on a broke student salary AND I always ask for long textured layers AND I never like the way it comes out. I was an ideal candidate for this product. I eagerly awaited its arrival and it came REALLY quickly (3 days!). I have very long hair that I am not particularly attached to so I wasn&#x27;t particularly nervous to start cutting it off. I ordered the cheapest possible Sally Hansen hair scissors to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To deal with the hair I sat in my bathtub. I opted for the layered cut rather than single layer. I have curly 3a hair that I have been wearing straight half the time. I straightened my hair for this process. I decided to cut the smallest possible amount to start with. It was SO EASY. I cannot believe I didn&#x27;t know about this before! I cut at a 45 degree angle for texture, followed the guide, watched the hair fall, and then when I sat up again my hair was in perfect layers, like I had just come from the salon. I decided the shortest layer was short enough, but the long layer wasn&#x27;t, so after I did the layering I went back, flipped the thing into smiley face (rather than frowny face) and went back over it. I don&#x27;t know if I will ever get another hair cut again, this was just so unbelievably easy. I am in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what others were talking about in terms of it being flimsy, mine feels much sturdier than I anticipated. I can&#x27;t even get the blue one to bend. Feels solid to me.</li>
            <li> I have had the Crea Clip for a few weeks now and so far I have used it a few times to make subtle changes to my layers and length.  I think this product works great.  I have wavy hair and the CreaClip allows me to customize my layers without having to explain what I want to a hairdresser who ignores what I ask for anyway!  I have trimmed the length and my hair looks totally even across the bottom.  The combs inside the clip hold the hair in place very well, so you can level and then swing the hair around for easier cutting without messing up what you just measured out.  Also, I don&#x27;t rely so much on the bubble...I think you can visually hold the clip up evenly and still get good results.  The bubble is also a great, helpful tool though.  I am very happy with this product.  I don&#x27;t anticipate going back to a salon any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** My original review was from January 2012.  It&#x27;s now 1/14/13, and I haven&#x27;t been to a salon in about a year.  Someone recently complimented my haircut after I changed up my layers slightly, and she couldn&#x27;t believe I did it myself.</li>
            <li> ...especially if you have long hair. I usually went for trims to my favorite salon, but they always cut off too much, even when I say not to.&lt;br /&gt;How can you grow your hair longer, when they cut off whatever grew back?&lt;br /&gt;This is great and I can cut off just the very ends to even them out, or just a little tiny bit of the split ends. Get it, it&#x27;s worth it :)</li>
            <li> I had been frequenting a fairly pricey salon for the last few years, because it was the only place I&#x27;d found that would leave me feeling satisfied after each appointment. The problem? It got way too expensive, and I just couldn&#x27;t continue to afford going every few months. A year ago, I stopped going and told myself I&#x27;d find a cheaper place. Well, that never happened. I don&#x27;t consider myself a vain woman by any means, but I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of money and time over the years on botched haircuts and dye jobs. I didn&#x27;t have the heart to go through that again. This resulted in my going a year - yes, an entire year - without a haircut. Although my layers were still evident, they were quite shaggy and shapeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered the Creaclip on youtube, watched a bunch of videos, and read what other people had to say. The reviews were overwhelmingly positive, so I ordered one. It arrived very quickly (today, in fact), and I immediately put it to use. I started by taking off half an inch or so. I have to say, this thing is really, really easy to use. I&#x27;ve never cut hair in my life, but, within a few minutes, I was creating layers all over the place! This product easily gave me results similar to those I&#x27;ve gotten in the pricey salons. I&#x27;m not discounting hair-dressers or their work, but I&#x27;m a very low-maintenance, do-it-yourself kind of gal, and this product is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for. Not only do I save loads of money, I also save my time. Plus, it&#x27;s kind of fun to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does a great job, but the material itself seems cheap. I&#x27;m not sure why these clips are priced so high. I ordered it off of the Creaclip site, which sells for a few dollars cheaper than Amazon. Still, I caught on quickly; the clips are extremely user-friendly and foolproof; and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> i believe that it is an okay product and it does it&#x27;s job alright but it isn&#x27;t for me. I have always cut my own hair and i do a great job! This didn&#x27;t make my results any better, just the same and i find it easier to cut my hair the way i did it before. Also, it is made of cheap crappy plastic that will break easily. i have very thick hair and the little snap on the end broke the very first time that i used ti. It is low quality and a waste of money. I will be sharing my view of this crappy product with my friends.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about the Creaclip and especially because there isn&#x27;t many reviews on Amazon. When one of my favorite bloggers reviewed it I knew it had to be good... and it exceeded my expectations! A seriously amazing product for people who only want their hair trimmed and seem to have trouble with stylists&#x27; understanding this request. I will never again pay for a hair cut! I didn&#x27;t even really mess with the level and it was still foolproof.</li>
            <li> I am someone who hates going to salons. In fact, the last time I went was over 3 years ago!  I&#x27;ve cut my own hair in a long layered style myself, and while I did a good job...it wasn&#x27;t as even as it could be...and I couldn&#x27;t EVER get the side bangs right...ever.  I saw some videos on youtube a few times using this product and I rolled my eyes. \\&quot;Oh, another gadget!\\&quot;, I thought with contempt. Until I came across someone using it, reviewing it, and loving it.  I had to try.  Ordered it, tried it, LOVE it. My side bangs look amazing.  My hair is even and I love that with the youtube videos I can try all kinds of styles if I feel brave enough...the little level really helped me! So if your hesitating...don&#x27;t. Check out some of the youtube reviews on it and trust me when I say it works just like they say!</li>
            <li> if you just want to trim your hair bangs, it helps you to save a lot money from salon.</li>
            <li> So I just bought the creaclip and gave myself a haircut.I have long hair past my should and I wanted some layers in, hard to explain to another stylist it&#x27;s never really done how I want them... so I went ahead and cut my hair, little at the time when I was done I had given  myself the best haircut ever the layers are perfect and I already covered the cost of purchase of my creaclip from my first use.I love this thing no more salons for me at least for haircuts and I get compliments on my hair all the time...Buy it you wont regret it there is a lot of tutorial videos on youtube it&#x27;s easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;Also if you have kids you can cut their hair quickly since they don&#x27;t like to sit still for long usually  ,you&#x27;ll get it done in noooo time! No regret great product</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one I buy.Saving money on trims. Had to look at alot of videos and trimmed a little at a time. Happy with results. I do a better job than when I went to the salon and came back unhappy with the trims that ended up in cuts.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome! I&#x27;ve been trimming my own hair for years, but never felt brave enough to give myself a good cut on my own. This is foolproof. I cut two inches off the bottom and gave myself layers  framing my face in the front. It looks perfect and professional. The woman who invented this thing probably has the whole hair industry furious with her...this product makes going to salon obsolete. Personally, I&#x27;ve had too many bad haircuts from unprofessional stylists over the years. I tried the most expensive salons t o the cheapest, and it was all the same: Have my neck cranked back in a sink and burned with too hot water, just to listen to stylists gossip with each other, or have them convince me they were &amp;#34;experts&amp;#34; who then went on to destroy my hair. Then they would try to sell me expensive stuff I didn&#x27;t need. No more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Creaclip can do anything they can do. Layers, bangs, bobs, trims. Learning how to use it took about 15 minutes of watching You Tube videos. I already had a good understanding of hair, which I&#x27;m sure helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your$$ and buy this. I avoid chemicals, dye my hair dark brown with henna and cut it myself, and my hair has never looked or felt better. I pay $10 for the henna, which I use once a month. I have friends who pay hundreds for their cut and dyes every 6 weeks! I&#x27;m happy with this.</li>
            <li> I bought mine a few months ago from the actual site. I didn&#x27;t see them on Amazon at the time. I&#x27;ve done two cuts now with it, and I LOVE it. I do not completely understand how this thing does what it does, but it has given me the best cut I have ever had. I have super thin hair, and my hairdresser was always telling me I could never do the cuts I like. I wanted a few layers and wanted it to not be so blunt...just a little edginess to it. She always said my hair was too thin, and I just didn&#x27;t care for what I was ending up with after every visit. Now I do not even have to leave my home, and it only takes a few minutes, and it&#x27;s free from now on! It pays for itself in no time. My hair is always neatly trimmed and looks amazing. I have SO much movement in my hair now. It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just use the large white clip on mine. I flip it forward with it turned like a sad face, and then I pull my hair in front over my shoulders and use it like a happy face. I thought I would use the side clip to angle it more, but I was afraid to with my hair being thin, and I really loved it as it was, so I just leave it like that. I sometimes have to trim it just a hair if I missed a piece, which happens, even my hairdresser did that, or sometimes, using the same cutting technique, I will slightly angle it if it needs it when I part my hair, and it falls a little differently. It takes about 15 seconds.  It is seriously the best cut I&#x27;ve ever had. I LOVE my hair now. I still cannot get over the movement and layers I have now. Oh, and a product that also helps with the movement if you have weird hair like mine is a hair serum called HerStyler that I got on Amazon. Only use a TINY bit of it, and it will make your hair silky. Add the great cut with layers, and that equals a lot of great movement in the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with matching my schedule with my hair stylist&#x27;s schedule.  She is always available at time when I am not.  After having my third child, it&#x27;s even more inconvenient to go to the salon to have my haircut.  I&#x27;ve always tried to trim my own hair (just trimming the ends), but I needed a real haircut.  I was desperate to know how to cut my own hair until I went to youtube and found a video of this product.  I was very skeptical at first because the clip is just a semi-curved clip that clamps the hair together.  Theoretically, it makes sense that if you flip your hair, the hair will have a layered look when you cut it facing down.  I have always wanted to have a V-shaped hair line, but my hairstylist never did it right, so I thought it was hard to do with my type of hair (I have fine wavy hair).  When I saw the videos of this and saw the V-shape at the back, I was like, &amp;#34;that&#x27;s how I want my hair shape to be!&amp;#34;.  I bought it with no hesitation and used it as soon as it came in.  Too bad my hair stylist will not see me again now that I have this.  I love how my hair looks better than when I left the salon before.  I give my two daughters their haircut using this as well.  This will pay for itself.  I pay about $60 + tip for one visit, and this costs half the price of one visit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting hubby&#x27;s hair for 25+ years and my mother&#x27;s hair to their complete satisfaction and simply wouldn&#x27;t try my own for fear of messing it up.  This takes all guesswork out of doing your own hair.  I watched several youtube demos and ordered it immediately.  Just follow instructions and start off slow to begin with til your confidence is built.  I won&#x27;t be paying anyone to cut my hair again!!  I have long layered thick hair and it turned out perfect after letting it grow out for over a year I now have exactly the style I&#x27;ve been wanting.  Try this for yourself.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> i saw tons of videos on youtube demonstrating this product and i was amazed and HAD to get it. i originally got it to help me cut my hair extentions but i found it difficult to hold it straight (even with the leveler) and cut at the same time. it slipped out and tilted alot. would be better if someone else helped you</li>
            <li> this clip makes cutting your own hair so easy. I used the clip to cut my long hair to a shorter bob. The cut is even and looks good. What a great idea.  I not only save money on simple cuts but I get the cut I want. Most hairstylists don&#x27;t seem to listen well and also suggest hairstyles that I don&#x27;t want. Now I can get what I want and save money too.</li>
            <li> Does just what it says ... allows you to cut hair at home easy, peasy!!!! I cut the hair using the point process ... not cutting straight across the hair ... but using the point of the scissors. This reduces the blunt, block effect. I use it on everyone in the family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky when it comes to my hair; i can never seem to find a stylist who cuts it just right. So when I read about CreaClip, it seemed like the solution to my problems: a fast, easy way to trim my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;I read all the instructions and even watched a few videos on YouTube before giving it a shot. The process was easy enough and the product was very manageable and easy to use. However, the results were less than thrilling..&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had stylists comment on how thick my hair is and it was especially evident to me while using CreaClip; with all my hair gathered together in the clip, my scissors did not snip effortlessly at the strands like I saw in the promotional videos, but rather my cuts felt chunky and forced. I&#x27;m not new to hair cutting; I&#x27;ve cut my own hair without a CreaClip and several of my friends and family&#x27;s hair as well. I used professional quality scissors and yet, even though I made sure to the the method outlined in the directions for soft textured cuts, I still ended up with very distinct and choppy layers.&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion is that CreaClip is most compatible for less thick heads of hair. Thicker hair will end up choppy even if you use the correct method, simply due to the amount of hair being cut at once. Perhaps a way around this would be to cut smaller sections at a time, rather than your whole head of hair; however, I feel that kind of takes away from the point of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I feel like the product has potential, but it is not right for me. I may save it for use when cutting others&#x27; hair, however.</li>
            <li> I was always curious about people who are brave enough to cut their own hair and was wondering if there is a tool that could assist a novice like myself in this department.  That&#x27;s when I came across CreaClip.  I watched few videos Online and decided to give it a try (worst case scenario I will return this item and go to a beauty salon).  I am not going to lie, at first, I was a nervous wreck before I dared to bring a pair of scissors near my hair.  I decided to cut my hair when it was damp, I figured this will give me a more even cut as that&#x27;s what they do in beauty salons.  Once I started to cut, I could not stop.  My first trip was really about 1/2 inch as I was nervous of how it would look.  As I&#x27;ve checked the results in the mirror and all my nerves went away, this tool is AMAZING!  The cut was nice and even and I had salon worthy layers.  I knew that I had more split ends to get rid of, so once again I&#x27;ve dampen my hair, and this time cut off additional 2 inches.  Once again the result was flawless!  Since I&#x27;ve gotten this little miracle tool, I have not gone back to a beauty salon (it&#x27;s been almost a year), and saved some $$$ as a result (always a good thing).  I absolutely love CreaClip and the professional results I get with it.</li>
            <li> I love the CreaClip!&lt;br /&gt;It is exactly what this &#x27;do-it-yourselfer&#x27; needed to keep my hair looking nice and stylish.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use, plus there are all sorts of CreaClip &#x27;how to&#x27; videos over on YouTube so you can see exactly what you need to do to get the style cut you want.&lt;br /&gt;I have already told my family and friends about this product as well as shown them how I am able to keep my hair looking nice...affordably!&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that you check out CreaClip. You just might discover that it can help save you money while letting you keep your hair style looking good without having to go to a salon and paying someone else to cut your hair..</li>
            <li> Okay, for those of you who seem to have devalued this product for thick or curly hair, please read all your information before submitting your review. First of all if you have thick hair, you might have to repeat the process more than once.  Also, for those of you with curly hair, don&#x27;t listen--find out for yourself. Curly hair must be straightened to receive the desired effect.  I say, don&#x27;t listen to the critics--this product will save you hundreds if not thousands for just yourself and if you have daughters like I do the savings are remarkable--What would you do with $110 dollars every four weeks&#x3D;Over 1260 dollars of savings a year. Anyone up for a shopping trip! I tried the method without the creaClip and found the results amazing.  Try it yourself!!!!  Afterwards, when I received my clips; the results were more than amazing. Before, I spent 3 hours just to trim off any split ends between expensive salon visits.  And of course everytime I cut more than I should.  Don&#x27;t listen to critics--Try out for yourself and then decide,because I have found that an array of debatable circumstances surronds the opinion.  For instance, I will only mention one--what if the person as mentioned did not read or follow all instructions that person would not achieve the results.  Please be your own judge;)  Save yourself and your daughters&#x27; hard earn money--Pass on!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Creaclip is easy to use,and very accurate because of the spirit-level.Before purchasing we did days worth of research on the internet,paying special attention to the finished results.We were worried it may leave the bottom layer very wispy, as some images show.To counteract this possibility we did not stop sliding the creaclip when the first layers slid out past it, we kept sliding until only about 4 inches of hair remained in the creaclip,then we cut. Good result with full bouncy ends but pretty layers too.(Her hair was one length to begin with.)   We found a youtube demonstration by &#x27;stealingbeauty&#x27;on cutting in bangs and layering around the face using the creaclip.We followed this and were really pleased.  My only concern is that when using the creaclip, you are cutting through a very thick section of hair,and although I&#x27;m happy using clippers on the boys hair as its cut so often, I wonder if the clippers damage the hair at all? I started by using scissors but felt like I was chewing the hair as there was so much. The only consolation is that I could cut the damaged hair more often-since I own the creaclip!!</li>
            <li> It works. I&#x27;ve tried it twice no matter what I did one side was uneven. I was able to fix ir by going back and fixing it by hand. This is fine but the &amp;#34;easy&amp;#34; claim isn&#x27;t THAT easy. Your head is upside down while you&#x27;re brushing ir forward and I&#x27;ve found no matter what a majority of my hair goes to one side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it is it works ok and when you&#x27;re poor cutting corners is s good thing. I&#x27;ll use ir again, but I&#x27;ll just try to perfect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also If you have wavy or curly hair STRAIGHTEN it first!</li>
            <li> Works, just take your time,</li>
            <li> Love the CreaClip. I just cut it real quick and bam i&#x27;m done! I gave it to my cousin since i was tired of her asking for it. Will be getting a new one for me soon.</li>
            <li> After my daughter had a really bad experience at a hair salon i started cutting and dying her hair .This Product makes it quick and simple .She loves her hair now. I was also able to cut my own ,witch i have been doing for years now. But the Creaclip made it fast and easy my bangs came out perfect and in no time at all .  This is an amazing product and i would recommend it to all my friends</li>
            <li> excellent product! Cant say enough about how much I loved it before I cut all my hair off and went with the pixie look. My hair was long, and this helped me go longer periods without going to the salon. My only issue was a personal one rather than an issue with the product. I have super fine but really thick hair. Was hard to keep my hair from moving in the clip. My trick was to use hair spray to help grip the clip better.</li>
            <li> Love love love my new creaclip!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels soooooo much softer and healthier! And it&#x27;s super easy to use! I can&#x27;t wait till my hair grows so I can trim my ends again!!!! Haha</li>
            <li> What an ingenious invention!  If you have an all-one-length hairstyle, this is the perfect way to avoid costly salon haircuts!</li>
            <li> I Love my creaclip I am so glade I found it.&lt;br /&gt;It is so easy to use I cut all my friends hair.</li>
            <li> Well I can&#x27;t say i don&#x27;t like it just need to get the hang of it on how to work it.&lt;br /&gt;So I think it will work I will let you know when I can do this.</li>
            <li> This item is excellent and works as described.  Background-  I had a fantastic hairdresser for many years.  She left to go to NYC.  Tried several hairdressers since then but they cut too much off or not way I had asked.  I have long hair that I like with long layers and side swept bangs. Last hairdresser kept cutting my hair just straight across bottom with no layers (though I asked several times) and straight, too short bangs.  I was at a loss on a hairdresser and what to do with my hair.  I stumbled upon video of Creaclip then checked it out for reviews which I saw here on Amazon.  Ordered it and watched the video before proceeding to try it.  My husband helped with positioning and cutting.  We were both amazed on how easy and great this work on cutting long layers.  I have yet to try side swept bangs because still waiting for my too short/straight across bangs to grow out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Creaclip for about a year and absolutely love it. I can now color AND cut my own hair. That saves over $130 a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be aware, that if you wear bifocal glasses and want to cut your hair in layers where you have to bend over to cut it, you CANNOT SEE the bubble level. If you want one length hair, someone else will have to cut your hair for you - unless you have REALLY, REALLY long hair and can bring it in front of you to cut it. I prefer one length, so I have my son or husband cut for me - but hubby screwed it up the first time I let him do it! He cut ABOVE the Creaclip (I know!) instead of the ends under the Creaclip! Grrr....talk about short hair! Just make sure you explain EXACTLY what and where to cut. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the Creaclip, I used it for layers and cut it myself - bent over, but I had to put in my contact lenses in order to see what I was doing and to see the level bubble because I wear bifocals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I found the WHITE level markings on the white Creaclip very hard to see so I used a black Sharpie to mark over the white level lines. That made a world of difference. Much easier to read the level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small blue Creaclip for bangs is also GREAT. It&#x27;s very easy to use. If you have very thin hair, like I do, you can also use the small blue clip to cut the rest of your hair, but that would be a straight across, blunt cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps bifocal wearers! I was so bummed the first time I used this - when I bent over to cut my hair and COULDN&#x27;T SEE THE LEVEL! IF you have a helper, it won&#x27;t be an issue OR if you have the option of contact lenses, you&#x27;ll need to wear those if you&#x27;re going for layered hair.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome tool to assist in cutting your hair. It is easy to use and saves me time and money going to the salon. Dont hesitate to buy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.  I cut my own long hair and give myself the layers and style I have always wanted but could never get from the salon. I&#x27;ve had people stop me and tell how pretty my cut is.  I cut my two daughters hair as well and comes out amazing. All done in the privacy of my own home!!  This is an awesome product!!!  Especially for long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this awhile and haven&#x27;t visited the salon since! I would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, hair. This product does well to trim the ends at home. I tried it on my daughter&#x27;s thinner and straighter hair and it looked choppy. The bang trimmer clip worked well for both hair types, no complaints there. The product came quickly, and as described by seller.</li>
            <li> This is a really handy tool for home haircuts. I cut my own hair first, using the large white clip for the overall length, and then the small blue clip for my bangs, and it turned out great! (There are lots of tutorials on youtube from the Creaclip company that will demonstrate how to use their product). I like this haircut I gave myself better than any salon cut I have ever gotten. Salon cuts never totally satisfy me, and I end up &amp;#34;fixing&amp;#34; them at home myself. What I like about these clips is that I can do it myself at home and get my hair exactly the way I want. I used this on my daughter&#x27;s hair next, and it was soooo easy, fast, and her hair came out even and perfect. Very happy with this purchase. Wish I would have had this years ago .... It would have made cutting my young daughters&#x27; hair so much easier. These are easy to use, common sense, and very user friendly.  5 stars!  :)</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair and starting cutting my hair at home (with assistance) a few years ago after being subjected to too many bad hair cuts at salons (curly hair can be tricky to cut, either a stylist gets it or they don&#x27;t).  I have a very basic style just an even cut in the back and slight layering in the front, so my review is based on a basic cut, I haven&#x27;t ventured into any of the really layered styles suggested on the packaging. The crea clip is great for getting an even cut on the part of my hair that I like to keep all one length.  I can put my hair in it while wet, pull it straight and cut (really, whoever is helping me does the cutting), with curly hair it&#x27;s so nice to be able to quickly cut it because it starts curling up at different rates as it dries.</li>
            <li> Does what it claims!  Perfect for helping me cut and style hair, wigs, weaves which is hard to do on your own head. Haven&#x27;t made any mistakes since purchasing it. Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I have always been really good with my own hair, but thought I would give these a try to see if they made cutting my own hair any easier. So far I have only used the short one for bangs. Makes cutting easy, but not any easier than without it. Have not used for cutting the back of my hai yet. When I do, I&#x27;ll update. I tend to think that this will make it so much easier.</li>
            <li> I like it.  I use this for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It works and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> OMG....DO NOT USE THIS ON YOUR OWN HAIR!!! Feel free to use it on your enemy&#x27;s hair;). I used this on mannequin heads with different hair thicknesses. It is easier to cut hair on mannequins because you can position the tripod in an infinite amount angles and degrees that is impossible to place humans. IT DID NOT PRODUCE GOOD RESULTS!!!! Not even bad results. It was terrible.  Each time, when the head was lifted back to the upright position.....not only was it a horrible mess, but there was absolutely no pattern, within the cut. So, there is no way of learning the reason of why the product is not working. Also, the CreaClip could not handle the simple task of a slight trim. I&#x27;m right handed. I actually went through with my left hand and cut &amp; cleaned up what the CreapyClip hacked. My work was 1000 times better than CreapyClip....and I didn&#x27;t need a patent to prove it.</li>
            <li> Hair must be quite long for this clip to be useful; my hair was not long enough for it.  Looks like it works great on the right hair.</li>
            <li> So happy with this purchase so far my hair turned out great!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent!! Love it does the work.</li>
            <li> This product is best for trims, not a precision instrument.  It&#x27;s best to leave style cuts to a salon or barber, but can be a steady hand aid.  Long hair requires more than one person to participate.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> I just received my creaclips 6-10-2014 and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.  I set up shop in my kitchen got the garbage bag out, brushed my dirty hair (before bath couldn&#x27;t wait), used the large clip for layers my hair is shoulder length.  I used the clip with curve down and I  brushed really well and cut 3 times to make sure even.  I am so elated with this product for taking the ease out of cutting my own hair which by the way would take up to an hour, (as is I foil my hair and highlight also, which takes an hour) and this product has now taken one step out of my life that I hated doing and took too long.  It took me a whole 10 minutes 3 times mind you to get perfect.  I did double check after bath and it was perfect.  You can cut your hair dirty or clean just brush well and get the perfect cut every time.  Thank you Creaclip for making a task I hated a fun one now and perfect every time!  Highly, highly recommend this product to eliminate salon bills and take the ease out of home cutters (like myself) work.  Looooovvvvvvveeeeeee it!</li>
            <li> It &#x27;s very good ideas, I still use it between salon. I give 3 star because the clip doesn&#x27;t hold hair strong enough to cut it. More brush like inside the clip would be more help.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical of this at first when I saw it in a Youtube video.  I watched more videos/read more reviews and figured I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m absolutely in love with the CreaClip!  I have curly hair... I didn&#x27;t want to go to a standard salon where they straighten it to cut it, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay the cost of going to a stylist who works with naturally curly hair.  I just used the clip for the first time today... I steamed my hair to loosen and detangle my curls.  Then I did three big clip/cuts to chop off a bunch of bleach damaged hair, then I fixed up my bangs after washing/styling/drying my hair.  Afterwards I manually trimmed a couple strands, and my hair looks fantastic!  My curls look springier and aren&#x27;t weighed down by the damaged ends, I have some fun layers, and I don&#x27;t think anybody could tell I didn&#x27;t go to a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a new favorite product for me, and while the $30 seems excessive for some plastic clips, it&#x27;s still way cheaper than going to a nice salon, so it&#x27;ll pay for itself after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> This was so easy to do. I looked on you tube for an a line bob how to do with the creaclip. I pulled hair in blue clip  Clipped with trimmers and wala gorgeous haircut. I&#x27;m so glad I will never have to go to the salon again and pay for a haircut that I hate.</li>
            <li> Love it now it&#x27;s easier for me cut my own hair!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. Finally I can get my hair to look the way I want. After years of hair cuts between $35-$135 i get the look that I want for free (well, for a one time price of 29.99!). Stylists never could get the look I want, and if they did I paid $$$$ money for it. Now I can do it myself. I am so happy with this product! Used it the first day it arrived - hubby helped me with trimming the backk and, voila - we did it! Thank you, thank you thank you to the creator!</li>
            <li> I bought Creaclip because I have long hair and it is hard to cut it straight.With Creaclip I got the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> I was wanting learn how to cut my own hair at home. With my work schedule its very hard to make an appointment to get my hair cut.  I watched videos on youtube &amp;#34;How to cut your own hair&amp;#34; and CreaClip popped up.  I started watching a video, then 2,3,4, LOL  Anyways, I was sold!&lt;br /&gt;I first trimmed my hair, with my husband standing by just in case... It was so easy, great cut, even, not choppy.  A few days later I decided to do it again alone, I cut off about 3 inches, plus I divided my hair into sections and cut layers.  WOW, It looks great!  Salon quality.  My coworkers are amazed and sold on this product.  I cant wait until its time to cut it again!</li>
            <li> Have used this several times to cut hair. Really easy to use for making layers or cutting hair into a Bob!</li>
            <li> My 2 girls and I have long hair so this will save us a lot of money from haircut.  We love how it creates layers.  Works great.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it.  Says it beats going to all but the best hairstylists.  Easy to use, fast...she got the hang of it after the first 2 uses.  She has used it on my mother and her sister and all were happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said you have to have very sharp scissors to have it work easily or just use a clipper......</li>
            <li> makes cutting your own hair easier</li>
            <li> This product works as specified and is easy to use.  If you have thin hair, they may slide a little, but still work as they should.  You can get very creative with hair cuts.  The Crea Clips are a helpful guide.</li>
            <li> Gave myself a little trim when the package arrived, and I have to say, it looks pretty good!  Quick too.  I have very long fine (read stringy) hair.  If you are merely looking to give yourself a basic cut, this will do the trick.  I will try it on my kid later and see if the results are as good.</li>
            <li> I watched tons of youtube reviews and demos before deciding to buy this. And boy was I nervous, even then! But I decided to give it a go, taking off only a little bit at a time. I love it! No more going to hairdressers who cut off more of my hair than I agreed to! I can keep my length while trimming in some layers. My hair feels healthier and looks like I just got back from the salon. A genius invention. I used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair too, with great success. It&#x27;s already earned back it&#x27;s investment in saved salon costs! My two-decade-long search for the perfect hairdresser is finally over! Also worth noting: the quality is excellent. These are not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Bought many hair enhancements, curlers etc. and these are marvelous! Plastic is not flimsy, you receive desired effect trimming and layering your hair, not difficult understanding directions or using. Less or no trips to a salon where I found hair stylists don&#x27;t know what they are doing regardless of their knowledge. Done with salon&#x27;s. These CreaClips are about the best I&#x27;ve bought and used with desired results. Would recommend to anyone for they are what is said about them. Maybe a bit pricey but well worth the money for they are excellent and you do save lots of dollars not going to a salon you may not be satisfied with.&lt;br /&gt;Only one salon I&#x27;ve been too being older than 30 and only one, just one hair stylist provided satisfaction what ever was done with my hair especially trimming and layering. She no longer is in the area or working at same salon but she was the best ever stylist. So to save a lot of dollars to have hair trimmed and layered this is the best product I&#x27;ve found, better than any other trimmers or layering.</li>
            <li> I can now clip my own hair</li>
            <li> It works great and allows me to cut my hair to the length that I desired. I just love my CreaClip</li>
            <li> Great product! I move a lot and finding people to cut your hair as you want or without mistakes is brutal.  Therefore, I do it myself and there&#x27;s no need for mistakes.</li>
            <li> I like the shape it gave my hair but it feels sort of odd when I don&#x27;t have it parted down the middle. I have a side part so one side of my hair has shorter liars than the other. I&#x27;m used to this because I&#x27;ve always had it cut this way but it&#x27;s differently something I wasn&#x27;t expecting with this, just keep it in mind if you don&#x27;t always part your hair down the middle!</li>
            <li> I am always used to cutting my hair my self for years, but after seeing the CreaClip on YouTube, I thought to myself finally! I was very excited to order it and try it. When I finally received it, I had already trimmed my hair but I tried it anyway and I couldn&#x27;t believe that my hair was a little uneven but end result  was exactly like it was on YouTube. The only problem I had was the leveler to make sure its even. I couldn&#x27;t see it very well and that&#x27;s the only reason I gave it four stars. You must try this. It&#x27;s amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this Tuesday, and received it today.&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit worried using this at first because I&#x27;ve never cut my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;It came with a little piece of paper describing how to cut it.&lt;br /&gt;There are also tutorials on Youtube.&lt;br /&gt;So I watched the tutorials a couple times to get the nerves out.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE this product.  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;After a year with no hair cut, and all the damaged split ends, my hair feels wonderful.  It&#x27;s so soft, no more split ends, and it&#x27;s how I want it.&lt;br /&gt;If you go little by little at first just to get a feel for it, it&#x27;ll help a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After taking a bit off, I cut more. You don&#x27;t lose a lot of length unless you hold it really close to your head. So don&#x27;t be scared if you&#x27;re holding if to the bottom and it looks like 4 inches, it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;This is so much more better than getting it cut at a salon because I can do it whenever I want.  So if that&#x27;s a problem,  you&#x27;ll love this.&lt;br /&gt;Heck, even if it&#x27;s not, and you want it,  get it! You&#x27;ll love it! Just remember to watch how to do it a few times so you know what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> There are so many ways I can trim my hair with this. I prefer the V in the back and this clip gives me the perfect cut every time. No more $30 trips to the salon just to have them cut too much!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s easy to use and works great! Now I can trim my own hair whenever I want to, don&#x27;t have to wait for an appointment with my hair stylist.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my gf and she won&#x27;t shut up about how much she loves it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never taken the time to write a review on any product before - but this is pure GENIUS!!!  I just gave myself an A-line Bob haircut and it&#x27;s perfect.  This haircut is considered more advanced with the CreaClip but it really was still very easy after watching the YouTube video.  Love, love, love the cut and am so excited I can do this myself and don&#x27;t have to overpay to have my hair cut anymore!!!!</li>
            <li> Great way to cut you children&#x27;s hair yourself. I&#x27;ve saved so much money on haircuts thanks to this !!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. So far I have tried it on the straight hair of my two daughters and a friends as well as my own very curly hair. It worked great in all cases. The instructions recommend that curly hair be straightened prior to cutting, but it seemed like too much work for me. So I sprayed it down with water to make it just wet enough to comb it somewhat straight, and it worked great!</li>
            <li> I think this clip is best used for trimming hair and maintaining layers. When I cut my hair, I straightened it then followed the instructions to the letter. Also, I watched a few videos prior to the cutting, but I still ended up butchering my hair. Not that it&#x27;s a horrible product, I just think that most of the reviewers on youtube.com have more haircare experience. I have zero...In fact, I&#x27;m not terribly cautious when it comes to beauty products. On the other hand, this isn&#x27;t a hard product to use, but if you want results like the ones on the CreaClip website, you somewhat have to know what you&#x27;re doing. Otherwise, stick to using this device as a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but the latch does not stay closed on my hair while I am in process of cutting, I needed to keep repositioning the clip. Using an elastic to gather my hair forward worked great for me, I may go back yo that method. I did like the small one for the bangs/ toplayers.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister for her bday because she asked for it (found it on youtube).  Anyway, she loves it.  it doesn&#x27;t give you a cut like a salon obviously, but you really can&#x27;t tell unless you look closely and try to see if everything is even.  She&#x27;s happy, it costs significantly less that what I pay for a haircut, and she&#x27;ll never be paying for a haircut again (maybe once a year).</li>
            <li> my wife likes it, high quality product but I think it is a little bit overpriced</li>
            <li> Good product as described.</li>
            <li> Love this...works as advertised.  Gave my self a long bob..i set it up and my husband went across with the electric shaver.  Use it to cut my and my daughters bangs</li>
            <li> This is a life saver! For most of my life I have cut my own hair because I cannot stand how much hair hairdressers end up cutting off. I have always free-handed my hair cuts and sometimes get stuck with obnoxiously blunt straight ends that i do not want. This clip allows me to get that rigid staggered cut I&#x27;ve always loved. And the &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; shape look this gives to the back of my hair is perfect.</li>
            <li> Still using these, years later. Awesome!!</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own bangs for a long time, and it seemed that I just get worse and worse at it. This is a big help. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I don&#x27;t agree with the instructions. On my bangs, it worked better with wet hair, not dry. And placing the clip close to the roots before sliding it down prevented the bangs from being in the proper position to cut evenly. For the rest of the hair, (past shoulder length, blunt cut,) I&#x27;m not really sure if it was cut evenly, but it was difficult to see what you&#x27;re doing in the recommended position. They want you to bend way over and comb your hair straight down. Next time I will either comb it all back and have someone else help, or do one side at a time.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I keep my hair in a nice one length bob in the back, and layer the sides, with some wispy bangs.  I used to use a Flowbee, but getting the back straight was difficult at best.  With the Creaclip I can get a perfect bob and layers and bangs!  People can&#x27;t believe I cut my own hair, and I love being able to get my hair exactly the way I want it, without worrying about what some stylist will interpret as what I want.  Not to mention the $$ I&#x27;ve saved over the years by not going to a salon.  In addition, my hair is a gorgeous silver that I love, and I just do not want to hear stylists trying to convince me I should cover my \\&quot;gray,\\&quot; and pay them more $$ to do it!  There are lots of videos online explaining how to use the Creaclip to achieve the style you want.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier -- it is so simple, quick, and quiet and I love my style!!</li>
            <li> GREAT !!!!  this will save me both time and money on getting hair trims..i don&#x27;t have to go out in the rain or snow fighting traffic just for a trim...I can now do this at home..at my own time...</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair but the clip was not tight enough to hold my hair.  It kept slipping out so it could never be cut properly.  The level thing is basically obsolete because the fact that it&#x27;s straight doesn&#x27;t mean your hair is.  Actually it&#x27;s the opposite.  The level can be perfectly straight but your hair is completely lopsided because half of it slid out of the clip.  The whole concept is ridiculous and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> 2 Stars for a good idea. The plastic looks sturdy, the clamp looks tight, it looks like it would serve it&#x27;s purpose and hold hair so you can easily cut. But wrong! I have been told by every person who cuts my hair that I have a lot of hair, and this thing clamps and just slips off. You can easily  bend the plastic, the teeth are a joke because it wont hold your hair at all, its too loose, the teeth wont hold your hair at all. Once you get it level it just slips right off. The level is a joke also because you better be standing perfectly straight for it to be perfectly level on your hair, if you are standing/hanging your head crooked, there goes the level accuracy on your hair.  Will it work for a clip I don&#x27;t give a crap hair cut? Yeah. I just did it. My hair isn&#x27;t straight at all in the layers but whatever. I really didn&#x27;t care so I was willing to risk $30 on this product. If I pressed the 2 pieces together really hard the clip would stay in but thats something I paid to not have to do.  If you want a good haircut forgo this and go to the salon. If you are a stay at home mom and your hair ends up in a messy bun on your head 30 minutes into the morning til the kids are in bed like myself it will work for you.  I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> +Points: 1. Nice grip on hair 2.light weight 3. Alone can use.  _ points: 1. Product cost 2. Less color choice</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t try them until now but four stars for the delivery and the quality</li>
            <li> Though my hair is not very long, I am at least able to cut it straight. Not all stragely. I don&#x27;t think its worth $29.99 plus S&amp;H in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love the CreaClip! I watched the online videos of how to use it to cut an aline bob haircut. No more so so haircuts or stylists who never listen. I bought a good quality pair of trimming shears too and my ends have never felt so good! I recommend this.</li>
            <li> After a terrible and incredibly expensive experience at the hair salon, I decided I was no longer going to let someone cut my hair or dye it. I have a lot of hair and very long, and this product is perfect for giving me that V shape I like.</li>
            <li> Easy to use it. Shipped fast and it is going to help a lot to keep my hair trimmed and without split ends.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use, level does not work well. Overall not worth the 29.00 price tag, works poorly.</li>
            <li> Works great cut my own hair now</li>
            <li> The product is made of surdy plastic and is easy to use.  I hate going to the salons because they never seem to get it right.  I trimmed my bangs, and the length of my hair with no problem and was very happy with the result.  I was able to cut my own hair and couldn&#x27;t be happier! I would definitely recommend to anyone who would like to cut their own hair.</li>
            <li> Love it! Saw it on Pinterest so went to Youtube and educated myself as to whether or not I was adept enough to attempt this. I love my hair. I admit I did cut very little at a time until I got exactly the look I wanted but now I will save tons and cut my own hair! Creaclip, now come up with coloring your hair yourself with foil! Excellant product1</li>
            <li> Did my bangs this weekend - not bad.  Definitely has potential!</li>
            <li> I have very wavy and very coarse hair, and I have A LOT of it.  You&#x27;ve seen the videos.  You flip down your hair, clip on a CreaClip, and just cut.  My hair falls about 3 in. below the shoulders, and it was barely long enough to do that.  In order to cut it by yourself, I think your hair needs to be much longer than the shoulder length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very stubborn. Even with a flat iron, it doesn&#x27;t get perfectly straight.  So the dry cutting was rather challenging.  Still even the big clip couldn&#x27;t snap on because I have so much hair.  I divided my hair into 4 layers. I held it as tightly as I could and gave myself a long point cut in each layer.  I also gave myself an angled cut on both sides for the face framing layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turned out great.  I have gotten complements that it is better than the cut that I got from a professional stylist. My hair grows very fast so I&#x27;m looking forward to more practice with the CreaClip.  But next time I&#x27;m going to try a wet cut.  My hair stays put better when it&#x27;s wet.  I will remember to cut about 1/2 in. longer than the intended length because it shrinks when it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have medium to short hair, ask someone else to help you. The bubbles in the clips are very small and hard to see. I wish they were bigger and clearer as the ones in the construction rulers.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it should.</li>
            <li> This clip is just amazing. I cut my hair, my teenage daughters and my niece&#x27;s hair&lt;br /&gt;and it turned out perfect.</li>
            <li> The best tools and easy to use I love it</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t as easy to use as I&#x27;d imagined, but I think with practice I&#x27;ll be able to find it useful and maybe even a valuable tool.  I have mastered my skills cutting my husband&#x27;s and boys&#x27; hair for the last 7 years and have it down to a science...saves us a lot of money and I cut their hair exactly to my liking.  But the first haircuts were rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just hope it doesn&#x27;t take me too long to figure out how to master my own haircuts with a crea clip.  I feel scared for those using it without any experience cutting hair.  It took me over an hour to get it to where I was satisfied.  I ended up cutting it shorter than I wanted due to mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still lacking something...seems choppier than my professional cuts and isn&#x27;t as blended and precise as I&#x27;d like.  But I think it&#x27;s much better than the hit or miss haircuts I get at GreatClips and the likes.  And I like the idea of being able to cut my hair without the hassle of scheduling and arranging babysitting.  And of course, saving money is a huge benefit.  So I&#x27;ll press on hoping I can make this work for me.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it nice! !</li>
            <li> I love this for trims &amp; layering. I use their YouTube videos to learn how to do different cuts. It&#x27;s a great way to save money.</li>
            <li> As the photos show, it is most useful if you have very long hair. My hair is shorter and it is useless.</li>
            <li> I love this product I can cut and trim my own hair and save tons on salon visits</li>
            <li> The level doesn&#x27;t work .  I would not suggest this item.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product after discovering it on youtube through a tutorial video.  i cut my hair and the verdict is..... GREAT!  My hair looks a lot healthier and i love the way the layers look.  I do suggest anyone who uses this product first look up a tutorial video on how to use it.  Not only is this product effective, but it will also save you a bundle from spending $15 a haircut or trim and a salon!  It made my hair look amazing and im sure it will make yours look great as well.... just make sure you straighten your hair first!</li>
            <li> This works ok, although you have to do additional trimming using your fingers after you use it, to even out the front part of the hair (my hair is even.  I think it is way too expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> What a stupid expensive rule</li>
            <li> I can get more professional looking haircuts with crea clip. And find it extremely helpful way to cut your own hair. I am very happy with crea clip.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister after she saw mine.  She and I absolutely love it.  It is so easy to use and can save you money from going to the salon if you are only needing a trim.</li>
            <li> i ordered this for my friend who stays in India, i opened it since i cannot carry the packing in ma bag..i used it again to know how it works, i thought ur hand is better than using it...i had a long hair when i tried cutting with this item..May be i should have hair till ma A** to use this ...lol..</li>
            <li> Been using it for a couple months.  Neighbor is borrowing it to cut her girls hair.  Holding up to lots of use.</li>
            <li> I guess the thing is okay, but I didn&#x27;t really get it and decided to return it...I&#x27;m trying to fight the urge to cut my own hair and my kids because I usually screw it up and wind up at a salon anyway so why spend the money on stuff like this...If you know what you are doing though, its probably ok.</li>
            <li> awesome for cutting my daughters bangs with a professional look, quick and easy....love it!</li>
            <li> waste of money, it works for thick hair, not thin</li>
            <li> I have been to a stylist two times in the past 25 years and both times I was disappointed to tears. Unfortunately I think I threw out the fringe contraption with the packaging, but the layering tool I still have and it is the easiest thing to use. I used to put my hair into a ponytail and cut! Uneven ends, inability to do my own layers... now I get as many layers as I want, when I want. Buy it! Your won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Cut front layers too short and did not cut back at all on myself. Easier to cut my daughter&#x27;s hair without it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and will save a lot of money!</li>
            <li> I bought this mostly to use on my bangs but found that I could also use it to keep split ends at bay.  I am going to watch YouTube tutorial videos to become more efficient.</li>
            <li> got this for my niece and don&#x27;t know if she likes it or not.  I didn&#x27;t hear anything from her since.</li>
            <li> I love these, they are already saving me tons of $$$ and trips to the salon.  I layer my hair &amp; they work perfectly.  Although I might not like them as much if I had straight hair.  The V shape it makes in the back can be a bit pronounced but it works perfect for me curly hair.</li>
            <li> Than you so much for your shipment. This product is helping me with my current project. I will keep you in my file.</li>
            <li> For me this is a great tool.  I watched videos on youtube.com and did it on my own.  I figured if I messed up I would go to a stylist.  Turns out I didn&#x27;t need one.  I had medium long hair and gave myself a trim and layers.  It turned out better than I expected.  The leveler makes it easy to see if your cut will be straight and the tools seem durable and hold up very well.  I recently cut my hair short, into a bob, and I love it.  This is a great tool and it takes the fear out of cutting your own hair.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Never knew I would have it in me to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> Great way to trim your own hair. I&#x27;ve done it 3 times and my daughters twice, the item paid for itself after 1 use.</li>
            <li> They ere okay, but I was unable to do it very well by myself.</li>
            <li> It makes it easier to trim my hair. I have very long hair, and it was hard getting an even trim. I wouldn&#x27;t use it to give myself a different haircut.</li>
            <li> WHEN I GOT MY CREACLIP  I WAS A BIT SCARED THAT IT WOULDNT WORK BUT LET ME TELL YOU IT IS WORTH BUYING FOR 3 REASONS IT NOT EXPENSIVE , IT IS EASY TO USE AND YOU SAVE ALOT OF MONEY WHEN CUTTING IT YOURSELF. I HAD TO PRACTICE BUT GOT THE HANG OF IT. NOW IM ADDICTED TO IT. ALSO PEOPLE NOTICE HOW HEATHY MY HAIR LOOKS. VERY GOOD PRODUCT I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYBODY.</li>
            <li> I have very wavy and THICK hair so this doesn&#x27;t work well for my hair. The layers came out too choppy because the CreaClip doesn&#x27;t allow for angle cut layers which work better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter&#x27;s hair is more Fine in texture and it cuts her bangs well and her length comes out nice and even.</li>
            <li> This is a good product if you like to cut your own hear like we do, work very well to make things very easy to cut and style the way you would like. and easy to make sure its straight with the leveling bubbles.</li>
            <li> Mai Lieu very kindly sent me these amazing Creaclips way back in December 2010.&lt;br /&gt; I was only asking her if she shipped the product to the UK - but she sent them to me free of charge.&lt;br /&gt; So grateful was I to Mai Lieu, that I promised faithfully to review the Creaclip.  Yes I know - almost 3 years have passed - but there is a very good reason for the delayed review - more of which later.....&lt;br /&gt;I finally stopped being a &#x27;Creaclip Virgin&#x27; this afternoon - and seriously, if I thought they were rubbish - I&#x27;d be honest enough to tell you all.  Happily - and very luckily for you good people, I have to report that they are fabulous and truly terrific!&lt;br /&gt;THE HAIRCUT&lt;br /&gt;On straight dry hair, hubby cut half an inch off the back by  smoothly combing the length to rest on my back and put it all into the large white clip in the &#x27;smiley face&#x27; position.&lt;br /&gt; He found the correct level using the bubble guide and pulled the clip down to the appropriate length so as not to take too much off.  He then closed the clip and flipped it up (towards himself so he could see where he was cutting.  Hubby then simply ran the electric clippers across the ends.  They were just the plain old ordinary clippers that I use for his very short haircuts!  I am utterly, utterly thrilled with the result.&lt;br /&gt;Using the smaller blue bang clip, hubby then took a quarter inch off my fringe and it has never looked so great.&lt;br /&gt; I have a real issue with fringes/bangs and not since 1967 (when as a little child - I went to an amazing Vidal Sassoon-trained stylist) have my front bangs looked so marvellous and accurately-cut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then - why the delay between Mai Lieu sending me the Creaclips and my euphoric  review - I hear you ask?&lt;br /&gt; Well, unfortunately, I have been very ill following a fractured femur in early 2011. I lost my confidence in a big way - and today  happened to be the day; after almost 3 years of paying a lot for very little - that  I  finally plucked up the courage toask my wonderful hubby to do my  &#x27;Crea- cut&#x27;!&lt;br /&gt;After my accident - I waited two weeks for a home visit from a  professional hairdresser.  He actually lives nearby - and walks past my house every day,  but I respected that he wanted to keep his business and his neighbourhood life strictly separate - so I waited until it was convenient (for him).&lt;br /&gt; Hmmm -  I can&#x27;t pretend that I wasn&#x27;t hurt - and several months down the line I was able to hobble on my crutches and go back to his salon.&lt;br /&gt;On arriving at his building, I have struggled up the steps; been given a weak coffee and a cardboard biscuit (cookie) if I paid for the &#x27;full works&#x27; (around $70 in US currency).  Amusingly, there was not even a glass of water for me if I just wanted a dry trim  -which was still jolly expensive at fifteen quid ($25).&lt;br /&gt;Some months ago, I showed him my Creaclips - and asked him if he&#x27;d ever used them - which caused him to sneer and be quite rude and dismissive of their ability to cut hair efficiently.  He then went rather quiet!&lt;br /&gt; Well, my now EX-hairdresser need no longer worry.  As we say in the UK - he&#x27;s been sacked, given the bullet, given his cards and been shown the door.&lt;br /&gt; My wonderful husband is now my personal stylist and I can have a lovely pot of tea and some home-made scones whilst he does my hair!  We don&#x27;t have to discuss vacation plans in a bored, mechanical fashion - and I don&#x27;t have to quietly cry about an expensive job that is far from earth-shattering in its appeal.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased that Mai lieu has been so successful - she really, really deserves it.&lt;br /&gt;If you are sensible enough to buy this product, I must stress that it is really worth watching as many OFFICIAL Creaclip demonstration videos as you can.  Some of the amateur reviews on Youtube are quite scary, not very helpful - and some of the ladies are hacking away at their hair without even looking at what they are doing.  Please do not pay attention to them!&lt;br /&gt;  What I will sayis - wait until your hair is in need of a wash, make it as straight as possible and brush it thoroughly.  Use only hairdressing scissors or clippers.&lt;br /&gt; Gather all your equipment close by before you even attempt to cut then only cut a little at first - until you get used to using the Creaclip.&lt;br /&gt;  Most importantly of all -  take no alcohol before  attempting to cut your hair - since what looks great after a few snifters might look pretty horrific once you&#x27;ve sobered up!&lt;br /&gt;Love from Mary in Colchester, Essex (United Kingdom)</li>
            <li> First time I tried CreaClip, I was pretty amazed causes when I go get my hair cut by salon, seems like they cut a lot more off.  This is simple to use, no schooling fees to pay to learn.  Lot my friends say, Donna, your hair looks very nice where did you have it done they don&#x27;t believe when I say I used CreaClip so I show them cause they never heard of it .  Couple times I had friends ask me to show how it&#x27;s Used.  Also I cut my Daughter n law hair,she was happy with it too.</li>
            <li> I hate getting my hair cut and have been looking for ways to DIY. I have used several methods, but none of them produced the results I wanted, until I found this awesome product. I am totally impressed and will be telling others about it!  Great product, I didn&#x27;t think that it was too flimsy, did the job, love the fact that I won&#x27;t have to have another bad cut EVER!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I no longer go to a salon and cut my own hair. Everybody always asks who cut my hair and I tell them I use a creaclip and cut it myself. They can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my favorite hair stylist moved away. I felt I had nothing to lose on one haircut. I have long thick wavy hair and it worked beautifully. It was a little intimidating with my first self haircut but well worth it!</li>
            <li> works amazing!!!! got my monies worth when i have to cut hair for 4 people in the family often. definitely saves a trip to the salon</li>
            <li> This is such a lifer saver when you want to trim your own bangs. I&#x27;ve never used it for anything else, but as a bang trimmer it will be a life saver.</li>
            <li> love crea clip- wasn&#x27;t sure it would work, but I use it to cut my daughter&#x27;s hair and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> The clip didn&#x27;t work for my particular hair. Since my hair is a little fine it just slipped out, so I couldn&#x27;t use it. If it came in multiple sizes for thinner or thicker hair this would be a good product. For those considering it, if your hair is at all fine this might not work for you. If you have thick hair this could be a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I really liked the creaclip and it was so easy to use, I would recommend it to anybody and you save lots of money not going to the salon :) !!</li>
            <li> These are great especially when you are trimming the kids&#x27; bangs.  In fact I did my own...</li>
            <li> I love the creaclips that I have. I was able to cut my own hair&lt;br /&gt;(whole head) for the first time. I am pretty proud of my layered&lt;br /&gt;haircut.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair to the middle of my back and usually my husband trims it for me and I would do my bangs.  Now I trim the back myself with the clip and can cut my bangs more easily with the little clip.  I don&#x27;t have very thick hair, so it stays in the clip very well.  If my hair were thicker I think it might be tougher to close the clip.  I also get tired of straight across blunt bangs, and the clip made it easy to cut my grown out bangs into a side swept style.  Since long hair tends to cost more to cut, this will save me around $200 a year if not more on trims, etc.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I can use by myself with little effort.  I have mid-length hair so I do still have my daughter trim up the ends in the back.  The layers are great and it is really easy to use.  I suggest you watch the YouTube videos on it.  They were helpful for me to use the CreaClip accurately.</li>
            <li> This is the best $30 I ever spent! I hate the salon, I never get the cut I like, and it&#x27;s way too expensive. I saw this on Youtube and I was skeptical, but I can say after using this for a year, I haven&#x27;t been to a salon and I won&#x27;t go back. My hair is long (middle of my back), I watched some youtube videos the company released on how to cut long layers, and voila, my perfect cut. I just re-do the same cut every 2 months or so to trim off the split ends and it&#x27;s good as new. I get compliments all the time on my hair, and they can&#x27;t believe I did it myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for anybody, it&#x27;s so easy to use and very durable. I have very thick hair so I straighten it before use, and it fits in the clip perfectly. I&#x27;m confident that it would be great for short looks as well. I&#x27;m very happy with the product and I tell everybody I know about it!</li>
            <li> I hate people to cut my hair because I am a picker so I bought a creaclip to adjust my hair as I like.</li>
            <li> I have this product and so far I have used it twice. The first time I followed the youtube videos and ended up with a perfect cut. The second time I thought that I would modify the cut. What I did was change the angle at which I cut the topmost layer in the layered cut. I ended up getting bangs instead of a top layer! The bangs still looked cute, but they were not what I was going for. The moral of the story is that this product is great if you follow directions but be careful with experimentation. Additionally I would suggest purchasing some nice sharp scissors since it will make your haircuts work better.</li>
            <li> This product has saved me so much money.  All you need is a good pair of professional shears and you can be your own hairdresser.  A great product.</li>
            <li> It actually works pretty well.  I cut a couple different layers in my hair and did an overall trim.  I seemed to cut one side longer than the other and had to &amp;#34;wing it&amp;#34; a little, but the Creaclip did what I though it would.  I will use it again if I&#x27;m not going for a fairly simple cut.</li>
            <li> For two pieces of hair clips at $30. is a very expensive purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m neutral about it.  I don&#x27;t love it, but I don&#x27;t hate it either.  It&#x27;s IS easy to use; however, you do need to be careful.  Even though you may cut half an inch at a time, it can still look pretty drastic.  I also don&#x27;t like that no matter which way you use the larger clip (smiley face or sad face), you still get a v-back shape to your cut.  I will say that it&#x27;s a good tool for trim.  But to cut your hair?  It would be way better to go to a qualified hairstylist to cut your hair into the shape you want it to begin with.</li>
            <li> As described and delivered on time!</li>
            <li> Looks professionally done... lots of layers...</li>
            <li> If you are cutting your own hair you will love these.  I can&#x27;t do it alone though because I couldn&#x27;t see the level, had hubby help and it came out great.  Watch youtube for different advise.</li>
            <li> CreaClips are expensive, so I bought this since I was getting a great deal!! Of course, I contacted the seller before hand and asked if the Clips were damaged because I wanted to know why this seller is selling it so cheap? It wasn&#x27;t and I used it to cut my mom&#x27;s hair in 3 layers (I watched &#x27;[...] on youtube) and people are complimenting her on her hair style. You just throw your hair over your head and attach the Clips, make sure it&#x27;s level and you trim away. I love these Clips and it works as great as the original ones!</li>
            <li> First of all, Big Kudos goes to Amazon Delivery.  I ordered next day service late Monday morning and received it by early evening.  Talk about fast service!  That was very impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Cre-clip that night.  It&#x27;s harder than I thought to cut close to the edge and it the leveler wasn&#x27;t working there.  Partly because of that and user error, I kinda botched the haircut.  I did a two layer cut and the top ended up being too short and uneven.  I&#x27;ll have to wait till it grows out a bit to do it again.  Even, though I kinda botched the cut, it still looks ok.  I like the layered look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to trying it again when I can.</li>
            <li> Love this product is money saver👍👍👍👍</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 2 years cutting my own hair and I am always compliment on how my hair looks.&lt;br /&gt;It is so great to be able to trim your bangs every 4-6 weeks at your convenience and without having to go (and pay) a hair dresser</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but after another crooked haircut from an expensive salon, I decided it was worth a try.  My husband, who is definitely NOT a trained hairstylist, was able to do a nicer job than the stylist who recently cut the right side of my long hair an inch shorter than the left!  The level on the CreaClip makes trimming hair foolproof, and the shape at the bottom was perfect.  I also easily trimmed my straight-across bangs, and I even tried a little face framing (to even up my still-growing out crooked long layers that had been previously cut by the OWNER of another salon).  I didn&#x27;t try overall layers, though, so I can&#x27;t give a rating for that technique.  But for my purposes, the CreaClip is is perfect!  I can see what it is an &amp;#34;award-winning&amp;#34; product! (And why salons would hate it!)</li>
            <li> I like the product, but I agree witht to cut  others that it takes some time to mater the use of it. It gives me the freedom to cut as much as I want, but one must be careful no to cut too short.</li>
            <li> The price is really not worth it. The quality of the product is very poor.  It is just a piece of plastic.  I was hoping that it would be made with a more durable material.  The ads make it look so easy, but it really is not that easy to use. I would rather spend a few dollars to get my hair cut at the salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like for more detail instruction to be provided. I know it has alot more uses but there aren&#x27;t any WRITTEN instructions anywhere except for the most basic haircut that you could almost do without using CreaClip.</li>
            <li> The CreaClip is an ingenious tool to cut your own hair. It is insanely simple and takes literally less than five minutes to achieve awesome results! My hair is almost to my butt and I am hard to impress when it comes to haircuts; the CreaClip is so great (and I am so cheap and lazy haha) that I have absolutely no intentions to ever pay a salon to cut my hair again. At first, I was skeptical, but after lots of research and finally trying it for myself, I love this product (so much so that I made a point to come back and leave a review)!</li>
            <li> Yes - this little unit is all that it proclaims to be. VERY easy to use. Gave myself a rather professional looking trim. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to save a substantial amount of money on hair trims!</li>
            <li> This did not work well for us. When we used it the first time we ended up with a choppy looking cut. We even used our professional scissors for the cut.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant about ordering the CreaClip and being able to cut my own hair....but, after ordering, receiving and using it, I can say without a doubt..I LOVE IT!  It&#x27;s so easy to use on myself.  I gave myself an awesome haircut without any issues. My daughter who is 30 years old, asked me to cut her hair this is extremely long, down below her waist....I did it without making it look bad.  I was scared to cut it because it was so long, but it turned out great.  I highly recommend this product to all!</li>
            <li> Oh the regrets...Why didn&#x27;t I go to a salon?  Why did I cut off all of my long hair--myself?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not bad, but its not great.  I watched all the tutorials first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Great for trims but for a major long hair to bob cut--be smarter than me and go to a salon.</li>
            <li> Thought about buying this product for a while.  Tired of spending hundreds on cut and color I&#x27;m not totally satisfied with.  Have to say it&#x27;s been worth every penny.  I do not plan to ever pay for a haircut again!  This is easy to use and my hair looks better than with an expensive cut and color.  I can&#x27;t say enough good about this.  I&#x27;m looking forward to the savings adding up!</li>
            <li> I love it because it is easy to use it, and it help me alot when I cut my hair</li>
            <li> i just received it and cut my hair a couple of days ago. it worked as advertised and my hair looked as good as a salon cut according to my husband---plus i saved $45!!!!! the leveling bubble was hard for me to see because i wear reading glasses, but i really like this product! i actually CAN cut my own hair without worrying about the results---although i did get my bangs a little too short!</li>
            <li> I found CreaClip after doing an internet search on how to cut layers into your own hair. I use the white clip to trim my ends and to add layers. Its easy to use, and if you need more assistance, the company has helpful videos on YouTube. If you have thick hair like mine, you might have to trim across twice in order to cut all of the hair. I balked at the price at first, but in the end, CreaClip pays for itself.</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars because I purchased this item after looking for a tool to help me trim my hair myself. I used it as soon as I received it &amp; I&#x27;m satisfied. It takes a little time to adjust to using the bubble since it moves slowly &amp; I can imagine it being harder to trim layers above my head if my hair were any longer but in my case, the results were too shabby considering it was my first time! I would recommend this product most especially too people with hair that is not super thick or thin. I have a lot of hair but it&#x27;s fine so it doesn&#x27;t appear too thick. I can already tell my hair&#x27;s going to be a lot healthier now that I don&#x27;t have to worry about the costs of getting frequent trims. &#x3D;) Item was also received on time, packaged nicely, &amp; tracking provided.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Have used this to trim my hair, daughters and friends hair!</li>
            <li> The haircuts have been great so far, but I would love to see more style options / cuting options for this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this on myself and my daughter. The leveler does not work properly, once you find the middle point and you slide the clip down, it will start leaning from one end to the other, even when the clip is not being moved (i tested it by placing it on a level table as well). I could have probably cut my daughter&#x27;s hair without this clip. It did give me nice layers on my hair which is why I gave it 3 stars and not less.</li>
            <li> I had very long down my back hair. And it is thick.&lt;br /&gt;I hate spending money to get my hair cut. So I do it myself.&lt;br /&gt;This product makes it so much easier. I even gave myself layers.&lt;br /&gt;Turned out so great!</li>
            <li> LUV IT!!! CreaClip WORKS!!! A++++++++</li>
            <li> I found this product after watching hair-cutting videos on youtube. I was very skeptical, but after a week of seeing different people use it on youtube, I ordered it. That was 7 months ago, and I haven&#x27;t been to a salon for a haircut since!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long (just below bra length), wavy, thick hair with layers and bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Creaclip to cut the length, add layers in the back, trim the layers around my face, and keep my bangs the correct length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments on my hair all the time and no one can believe I cut it myself when I tell them. I am sure that the layers are not as good as they would be if done in a salon, but I like being able to trim and shape my hair whenever I want to, and the results look good enough to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the cost savings and it also feels very empowering to know that I can cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> OK I usually never fall for the seen on TV gadgets, but I read alot of good reviews here and even watched some youtube videos and I thought ok maybe just maybe this clip makes sense, and who wouldnt want to save money on salon visits.  I wish I didnt waste my time on this junk.  No.. it did not work for me, I fully followed the informercial and youtube videos, and the little paper insert.  Guess what it is almost impossible to hold your hand steady watch for the little bubble in the level to be completely centered and then start cutting your hair without moving the clip. I will have to go with the other reviews that say it&#x27;s junk. But for the people out there that are happy with this gadget,  that&#x27;s great and glad it works for some of us. I will continue to trim my bangs and ends with a good pair of cutting shears and save the haircut for the salon. Thank goodness for Amazon&#x27;s great return policy and customer service!</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about this product.  I ordered it because I was in great need of a haircut.  My hair had not been cut in more than a year and was really long, raggedy and shapeless.  I was considering going to get a professional haircut, but I am super picky about the way my hair is cut, and the last time it was cut, the hairdresser ruined my hair by trying to use her scissors to razor cut my hair.  The end result left me with frizzy hair that never looked good again.  I decided that the investment in this product was small compared to the price of a good haircut (my hair is to the middle of my back and they always charge more for it).  When I received the Creaclip, I immediately opened it and asked my 18 year old son to help with cutting the back after I applied the clip.  So far so good! Not a bad result.  Next I combed the front and applied the clip to  create long bangs and face framing layers.  Once again, a pretty good result.  After I washed and blew my hair dry, I saw that the Creaclip did an outstanding job...actually better than professional haircuts I have paid $80+ for in the past.  Kudos to the woman who developed this product.  I have since trimmed my hair twice, and I no longer have to cringe at the thought of going to get a haircut.  I love this product!!!</li>
            <li> Does not line up correctly. Cheaply made. Feel and look like $1 of plastic.</li>
            <li> Not as easy as it looks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a past middle age lady who has never cut her own hair other than trimming bangs. Even then, my stylist would tell me not to do that because he would have to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; it. I lost my pro hair guy after 30 years. He always did an excellent job for a fair price and was very fast too.  He retired to only doing men&#x27;s cuts at an old fashioned barber shop. My friends have not been able to replace him at any price and have gotten some lousy cuts along the way. My husband studied online videos of cutting women&#x27;s styles with scissors. So, I gave him a shot at it. Sometimes he did a pretty good job but also messed it up at times too. He has severe back problems and just couldn&#x27;t do the job consistently. We are on a limited income so I had to find something I could mostly do myself at home and cheap. I considered this item for a long time and had my doubts as it seemed it would only really work on straight one layer hair.I have shoulder length  average to thin hair with several layers that need to be blended and have a little natural wave in spots. We studied the online videos from pros and real people postings, more than once. (I HIGHLY recommend you do this to learn techniques and ideas). I sectioned my hair off (I bought 4 to 5 inch long hair clips, called &amp;#34;crocodile clips and sold cheap through Amazon -- that really helps to control your hair and work in sections keeping track of where you are for layers) and took a cautious approach only planning on cutting a little in each section. I could pretty much do the top and sides, but needed my husband&#x27;s help for the back as it is not long enough to flip over my head and still see what I was doing. In time, I may eventually get confident enough to use a review mirror for that. I need to practice more with how to blend layers, but I can see that it is possible to get a decent cut with this item. I used sharp professional scissors and did not have any problem holding the device firm enough to cut my hair. Having only used it once, I can&#x27;t comment on the durability of this item. I wouldn&#x27;t say it is of high quality material or workmanship. But if you take care of it, I feel like I can certainly get my money&#x27;s worth. Overall I was pleasantly surprised and impressed.d it once, I can&#x27;t comment on the durability of this item. I wouldn&#x27;t say it is of high quality material or workmanship. But if you take care of it, I feel like I can certainly get my money&#x27;s worth. Overall I was pleasantly surprised and impressed.</li>
            <li> I have Irish naturally curly hair that I wear both curly and straight, and at shoulder length or longer, layers just look the best on me. For the longest time I went to a professional hairdresser at various salons, some I liked, some I didn&#x27;t, but all charging between $50-70. Technically you should trim your hair every 4 weeks, so over a year that adds up! Plus, maintaining split ends in layers is difficult the way salons do it. I also had a hard time communicating the type of layering I wanted. So I googled how to cut layered hair at home, and the ponytail method and Creaclip videos came up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched all of the Creaclip videos and was impressed. I figured at $30, it was worth a shot, and if I butchered my hair, I could go back to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I blew out and flat ironed my hair, flipped it upside down (it was long enough that I could see the level) and combed it just like the video. First did a pass with clippers to get all the dead ends, then flipped again leaving an inch and trimmed into the edge for a softer result (when my hair is curly, blunt cuts look silly). Holy crap, it was awesome. Instant hair cut, for free. When you first flip back, the layers might look a little funny; you have to flat iron them under because they are hanging so straight from ironing before the cut. Next wash, amazing results. Since then, I&#x27;ve trimmed my hair regularly, experimented with layers of layers (section ink off the top and cutting a shorter length the same way), gave myself bangs, trimmed an A-line bob (I do get a free trim/cut when I get a keratin treatment, so initial bob was cut professionally, couldn&#x27;t trim till long enough to see level in mirror).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there are any negatives, they would be:&lt;br /&gt;You will get compliments on your hair. When you tell people you did it yourself with a Creaclip, they will laugh at you and ask you if it&#x27;s a Flowbie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is not straight and pulled taught, and combed so it falls from your scalp correctly, you can get a funky result. When this happens, it&#x27;s not hard to fix, but it&#x27;s user error, not the clip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely easier to gave someone help you. My hubs is too afraid he&#x27;ll screw up, so I&#x27;ve mastered doing this on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very glad I purchased this!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, and I have really had a hard time going to salons because they want to chop it all off. I go in for a 1 inch trim and they take off 6 inches. With the CreaClip, I gave myself a really nice trim with layers in about 5 minutes. I also cut my daughter&#x27;s hair. It is a wonderful tool for cutting hair!</li>
            <li> Crea Clip is a brilliant product! Sad but true: in the wrong hands, scissors can be a murder weapon where your hairstyle is concerned. If your goal is hair that is cut evenly, this is the tool for you. I declare myself finally and definitely free from the clutches of semi-skilled so-called hairdressers. At any price, in any salon, you can be lucky to excape with your pride intact. Enough said. Buy this product.</li>
            <li> Every once in a while a product comes along that is so unique, innovative and useful, it makes us wonder how we got along without it previously. Creaclip is such a product. Not only is the Creaclip well designed and easy to use, it gives users the potential to save not hundreds but thousands of dollars, with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I test and review a lot of products at my review blog, My Real Life Reviews and I can&#x27;t think of any that I&#x27;ve been more impressed with than the Creaclip. It really works! Makes cutting hair at home not only easy and literally stress free, it&#x27;s fun to use too. And getting compliments about my hair afterwards is great too. :&amp;lt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;read my full review at: myreallifereviews dot com</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use on my own hair. Truly a great way to keep your hair healthy and keep split ends at bay. I looked at many videos before trying this on my hair first. I recommend that they be watched before trying it. The directions that come with it are not as clear as the videos are.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t mention that you need to have really thick hair to 1. keep it in the clip and 2. not layer your fine hair to the point of looking thin and stringy at the ends. If you have thick hair it would work fine I think. Don&#x27;t know because I don&#x27;t have thick hair. Not quite as easy as they make it look in the videos.</li>
            <li> This product works good.  I do think that it is a lot of money for a couple of clips with levels attached.  It worked good except if you part your hair on the side.  It seemed like all of the shorter layers were on one side so I did go back with the small blue clip and cut one side.  After a little more attention on the one side, I was happy with my cut.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am used to cutting and highlighting my own hair.  No training, just years of practice.  So i didn&#x27;t hesitate buying and using this.  There are many ways to use the clip.  You can hold it &amp;quot;low&amp;quot; along your back or higher up or in front of you for the most layers.  You can use it on the sides to makes them even or on top of your head to even out all your hair.  It&#x27;s fun to experiment!  I have cut my hair many different ways and was stopped several times in stores by total strangers commenting on my haircut and how much they loved it!  This surprised me because i&#x27;ve never been stopped like that before for any salon haircuts.  If you feel unsure about how to use it just go to YouTube and find some videos to watch.  It is so simple.  I&#x27;m happy this is back on Amazon after a brief disappearance.  I&#x27;m sure hairstylists aren&#x27;t happy about this product either.  It is a real money saver.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the Creaclip! I cut my hair last night and LOVE it! I have long hair and did a 3 layer cut. Amazing!  Is this product powered by magic? ha ha Creaclip has a Youtube channel and demos how to videos galore. You will save so much money on trims/haircuts. There are 2 clips, one for layering and trimming ends,etc.. and one for bangs and shorter styles. I purchased the Utopia shears along with this and am so happy! Use a good pair of scissors or for blunt cutting and ease you can use clippers. My grandma even bought one after me telling her about it. :)</li>
            <li> Since purchasing the CreaClip, my hair has become healthy and glossy. I can now cut it whenever it needs even the teeniest trim, and all for less than the price I used to pay at the salon!</li>
            <li> After letting my hair go too long wirh out trimming (yet again), I considered trimming my own hair. This clip came up in the list of recommended products on Amazon. I watched some videos online and decided to buy it. I have used it twice so far, only taking off a couple of inches. I will continue to practice using it, but I am pretty much sold. Going to the salon was never fun for me, it&#x27;s expensive and always the same: the hairdresser tells me my hair is damaged from waiting too long to get a trim, next time just come in sooner, then they ask what shampoo I use and try to get me to buy their expensive salon shampoo.  If I can do the same cut at home for a small investment of a fraction of the cost of one salon visit, it&#x27;s a win-win situation for me!</li>
            <li> Turns out well. Not too bad. (:</li>
            <li> I have LONG hair and I cut it myself. These make it easy, I really don&#x27;t know why no one thought of these a long time ago.</li>
            <li> If you are one to cut your own hair, then this is a must have! I have very long hair and was starting to have trouble cutting it in the back. I came across this on a YouTube video and had to try it. There are many tutorials for different styles available by CreaClip or on YouTube which is where I go. It&#x27;s also great if you just want to do maintenance on your saloon cut. I have done trims, drastic cuts and maintenance on myself and 3 daughters, all with different lengths and styles. I thought I would use it just for trims, but have now found I like my cuts so much better then any where I&#x27;ve paid, which is always expensive because of the length. The savings alone made this a must have and of course the healthy hair. Very easy to use and Great Results!</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, curly, and I like to keep it in a chin-length bob.  I&#x27;ve never been particularly loyal to a stylist, and always put off going to get a haircut for months and months at a time, but now with a baby at home it&#x27;s even harder to get to a salon.  (Plus, I&#x27;d like to save the money!)  I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair myself already, using the ponytail method, but I saw the Creaclip mentioned on a blog and got curious.  After reading many reviews and watching the Youtube videos, I finally broke down and ordered it, and used it for the first time just last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:  This helps me get a neater, more even cut with more defined layers than the ponytail method did.  I also like how the clip holds the hair instead of your fingers. Once, I gave myself a nasty gash in my finger with my haircutting shears.  This is much safer!  I like how you can tilt the level to help cut at an angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wish I could change: $30 is a little steep, especially given that I don&#x27;t need the bigger white clip.  My hair has never been much longer than my shoulders, so I don&#x27;t see myself using the bigger clip often, if ever.  I wish I could buy the smaller blue clip separately.  It&#x27;s also hard to get the bubble in the middle of the level.  You have to tilt the clip back and forth a bit to get it to move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> First Impression:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for a few years now because I&#x27;ve had several bad experiences with hair dressers giving me ugly haircuts, uneven haircuts, and a very expensive salon ruined my purple hair colour twice in a row. I keep my hair medium-short length, usually the length is just a little bit above my shoulders but not touching them. For shorter hair it&#x27;s time consuming to cut it yourself because you have to use two mirrors and constantly switch between a few little snips and double-checking how it looks. Normally it can take me 30 minutes to an hour depending on how much hair I&#x27;m taking off or if I&#x27;m going with a different hair style or adding bangs or whatever; 40 minutes is average for me. I watched the CreaClip youtube video on how to cut an A-line bob yourself. I&#x27;ve only had an A-line bob one other time and I love the way they look, especially when they&#x27;re quite short in the back. It was great. From start to finish, including the time it took me to take out my shears, hand-mirror, creaclip, brush, smock/apron thing to keep hair off my body, and sweep the hair off of my bathroom floor, it was about 15 minutes total. Since I was doing a short haircut I used the smaller blue clip. It was super easy. Clip it in, see if it&#x27;s level, pinch the sides a bit for the A-line bob style, and I did 45 degree cuts with shears. I do however wish that they would sell the blue clip just by itself. My hair is just barely long enough to use the big white clip, but I like the blue one more because I can do my bangs and a short A-line bob or straight-across short haircut with it. The smaller clip seems a bit more practical for people with shorter hair. I love this product though, it makes cutting my hair so much quicker and with the level it&#x27;s very easy to get an even haircut. I wish I had found this sooner!</li>
            <li> this is very flimsy and not good quality for the amount spent.</li>
            <li> I get complimented on my haircut was able to do a stack with it. does require patience but is quick if you know what you plan to do. I did not like when I did the flipping the head over and trimming!</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair, I recommend having your hair wet. It gave me a fresh textured look, it looks amazing (at least to me). The bubble was hard to keep centered, but i don&#x27;t know if it really matters. Invest in one if you plan on not going to the salon anymore or just maintaining your layered hair already. Comes in handy for split ends</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims to do. The clips are pretty firm and are good at holding your hair while you trim. However, I still prefer a stylist for a good haircut.</li>
            <li> I always cut my own very curly hair and keep it pretty short on top and than have some layers going down as I&#x27;m trying to keep growing it longer in back.  I usually lift my hair up in sections and either cut straight across or angle my fingers to cut it short-to-long.  Or else I cut small, individual sections nipping at the curl (per the technique described in the book &amp;#34;Curly Girl&amp;#34; by Lorraine Massey.)  I cut some every week to keep it neat on top and on the very ends.  I didn&#x27;t think having this gizmo would make much difference but it looked like fun and worth a try.  I was wrong!  I&#x27;m not sure why, but this really works way better than me lifting and cutting.  I also brought all my hair forward (the longer bottom section) and cut it with the large Crea clip to get it angled right.  Because my hair isn&#x27;t that long, I just reversed the clip and looked in the mirror to make sure the bubble was positioned correctly and snipped.  It worked perfectly and looked really good when I flipped my hair back in place.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.  If it ever breaks, I&#x27;ll buy another.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year now, and my hair looks great! I have very long hair and use this to cut long layers. I have saved so much money since I don&#x27;t have to go to a salon any more. Like another person said, now I can keep my length, but get the layers...seems like the salon always takes inches off no matter what I say.  The construction of the clip is very solid and mine is still in great shape.</li>
            <li> I had the misfortune of being ask to help my wife use this item to cut her hair. Basically it useless. It does not hold the hair tight while you cut. It does not spread the hair out and the bubble level is almost impossible to see. Having said all this it did give me several ideas of how to make a version that would work.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to trim my hair myself and know that it is straight which is impossible to do for the back of your hair without it.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend if your hair is thin.  Maybe it works on thicker hair my hair kept sliding out which made impossible to cut it straight!</li>
            <li> It is a good idea on paper, but on the practice it is difficult. Maybe if I practice more I will be able to master it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t particularly love the clip for layering, but it&#x27;s great for maintaining bangs and definitely for keeping everything straight and even. Such a simple invention, but totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> So awesome. I feel so anxious going to someone and getting my hair cut, since the last time it was so uneven and terrible looking. With the creaclip, I can cut evenly and take off as much hair as I want. I was so nervous at first. But was just like, wow. Definitely easy to use for anyone. Just follow the directionsl, and it&#x27;s a snip. The website has different techniques that you should check out. 💁✂✂</li>
            <li> I decided not to go to a hair salon after a lady cut at least 5 inches of my hair and I told her I just needed a trim :( , that was almost 2 years ago and I just wanted to cut a least an inch of my hair so I googled this product also I watched some youtube videos and I decided to get it. I&#x27;m super happy with this product I used it right away only cut about an inch and it looks great.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re &amp;#34;between salons,&amp;#34; have long hair, or for whatever reason, have to maintain the shape of your hair yourself, you could do a lot worse.  This would be a great deployment gift for a female soldier serving overseas or for someone who is chronically unhappy with salon haircuts.  Definitely watch the videos on YouTube and be conservative with your first few trims, but this product fills a definite niche.</li>
            <li> CreaClip works great.  I have long hair that I&#x27;m finally growing out to my natural gray.  Sure saves on expensive trips to the hairdresser.  It&#x27;s paid for itself already.  Very easy to use to use too.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended,was very easy to use,recommend to watch video before start for beginners.</li>
            <li> I kind of feel silly buying this product. Maybe it works better with thinner hair, but it was hard to use while trying to cut my daughters hair...which is very thick. I ended up just eyeballing it instead of using this tool and it seemed to work better for me.</li>
            <li> I found CreaClip on youtube. My hair is straight and mid-back length. I have cut my hair for years. I style it in long layers. After using CreaClip, I found it shorten the cutting time in half (usually takes an hour). Don&#x27;t rely on the new layered haircut to be exactly blended, you need to check your hair by slide cutting off the points, where hair is angled. Results are a nice haircut. I recommend this handy tool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for years. I got fed up with going to a salon just to have to come home and fix half of the cut anyway. My hair cascaded down my back for years, so I would just bring it forward and cut it that way. It would take me about 20-30minutes per trim. With the Creaclip, that was shaved down to nothing. Using the large clip, a trim took 5 minutes tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I decided to chop my hair off recently after having some fun with hairdye and wanting to start fresh, I used the small clip and gave myself an A-line bob. While a little more difficult (though probably my fault since I didn&#x27;t trim my hair short first and basically chopped off 15inches all at once.. don&#x27;t do that. Cut it a few inches longer than you want it to be first), it still went fairly easily. I was pretty shocked at how easy it was to give myself the exact cut I set out to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this system, is that it costs the same thing that one cut/wash/blowdry/style/tip does at a cheap salon. The styles are really easy to do. Their youtube account is filled with instructive, easy to follow how-to videos for your favorite cuts. If you have a style you want that a video doesn&#x27;t exist for, you can email them requesting it and they are more than happy to work on getting one filmed for their channel. The customer service is amazing. Really, the only reason I ordered from Amazon instead of directly from them was because I wanted to maintain my privacy and I am scared to order anything from anyone after Spacebags requiring my phone number and selling it off to other companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clips are really decently made. They serve their purpose, are easy to use and clean, and feel fairly sturdy. The level is a little tempermental. Before you clip it into your hair, line it up even. If you try to get it level while it is in your hair when the air bubble is way off on a far side, you will be sitting there waiting for it to even out for a really long time. Other than that, I really have trouble finding anything to complain about with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to cut your hair with this, is to straighten it first. If you have curly hair, cut it two inches longer than you need it. Wavy hair, an inch longer. Cut a little at a time if you are scared. You can always cut more once you get more comfortable with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really wonderful for people who are comfortable cutting their own hair, parents with children who need quick trims, or even just trims between salon visits. I especially love using the small clip for keeping my bangs trimmed since those grow so much faster than everything else.that, I really have trouble finding anything to complain about with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to cut your hair with this, is to straighten it first.

            <li> This tool saves time and money for us. My wife has been able to take care of split ends and that stuff with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be very patient while cutting because the product can slip out of place at certain inopportune times but that&#x27;s to be expected in light of how it is designed.</li>
            <li> A little pricey for what you get, but does the job and pretty much eliminates the need for trips to the salon for just a trim.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely AMAZED at. One of the main reasons I had waist length hair for so long is the maintenance of layered hair and the cost of forking out $50 monthly for a maintenance cut !!!! Plus the only time I even LET anyone TOUCH my hair in the 1st place was because she cut Daryl Hanna&#x27;s hair. Now this thing floored me when I was just planning to trim it and the inches turned into feet, and only took 20 min!!!!!  My hair is about .5 inches past my shoulders now, total wash and wear but stylishly layered. I can wear different hairstyles,  put it up in summer and when I swim, I could buy a salon with the $ I save on product and recuts. I just wish I would have thought of it. Comes with a DVD but you don&#x27;t really need it as you tube has about 15 videos on it. WoW!! and pays for itself the first time you use it!! .....</li>
            <li> Love it saves me a trip to the salon</li>
            <li> Pros: It does make cutting quick and simple. If you like to cut your own hair and are in a time crunch, this is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The angle of the angled bob, is not as steep as I would like.  The width of the devices, prevents me from getting the back of my hair as short as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to just cut the hair on the back of my head, pretty much at the hairline, by feeling.  I would use clips and portion off different parts of my hair. After the back was done, I&#x27;d angle down the sides of my head from there, using a three way mirror.  It wasn&#x27;t easy. However the results are better than most salons, since I know my own hair. The key to making any home angled bob haircut look great is the flat iron.  I bought the creaclip after watching some of the videos.  It looked so quick and it is really quick! Sadly, my hair doesn&#x27;t look as good as when I do it myself without any aid because I can get my hair more rounded and shorter in the back without the crea clip. You&#x27;d think I could just use the creaclip and then shorten it from there, and perhaps I can.  I usually cut my own hair wet, and the crea clip says to use it dry.  I will try at some point, next winter and re-update then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had very high hopes for the creaclip, but honestly, my hair is just meh.  It looks like my hair is growing out nicely from the hair salon, but like it&#x27;s time for a trim.</li>
            <li> I have given my hair both a long, layered look and a bob short cut with these tools.  It makes me smile when I get compliments on my hair.  I have also cut both my daughter&#x27;s hair with it.  Great for bang trims, and it has saved us a lot of money.  Youtube is a great resource for ideas of how to use them.</li>
            <li> You will end up cutting to much hair, I returned this product.</li>
            <li> Never have to go to the salon to get my hair cut just right. I can make it the way I like it;)</li>
            <li> love this product, amazing how a simple idea made of plastic can work so great, use the videos online at youtube as the directions are limited. totally worth the price, always getting complements on my hair cut....but I&#x27;ll never tell. LOL</li>
