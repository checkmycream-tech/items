            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Definitely love this product!</li>
            <li>This works amazingly well, and even more so when used with Nicole by OPi nail color (says me!).</li>
            <li>Together, they look amazing, and I have these drying drops to thank.</li>
            <li>this product is amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>I heard a lot of great things about this product, but I personally wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve invest in some of Sephora&#x27;s gorgeous polishes; however, one that I have (Nova) has a habit of causing the top coat to come out</li>
            <li>I tried this treatment in a nail salon and ordered my own after that.  </li>
            <li>I have been doing my own nails for over twenty years</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, I would recommend this item to anyone that paints their own nails.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for best quick drying top coat stick or try tried &amp; true &amp;#34;Seche Vite&amp;#34; its flawless &amp; worth the price.</li>
            <li>and i did 4 coats of polish with it inbetween each coat and on top of all the coats and it works super good!.</li>
            <li>I just did my nails with 2 coats of Sally Hansen Complete Manicure (which by the way is awesome)</li>
            <li>Huge fan!</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I also love using at home.  </li>
            <li>coat, 2 coats of polish, top coat, then 2 drops of this on each nail</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>and then do another coat (as opposed to doing 2 coats and a top coat and then putting this on).</li>
            <li>The top dries</li>
            <li>Even the top coat.</li>
            <li>This is on my blogger and more beauty exclusives and reviews.</li>
            <li>I love it -</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>So glad I purchased it and would def recommend</li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>This product works ok</li>
            <li>But I like them :)</li>
            <li>I like to use many coats of polish when I paint my nails</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s great and very affordable.</li>
            <li>I do two or three drops on each nail after using a top coat and let it set in.  </li>
            <li>so I could get the top coat on a bit faster then use my hands soon after.</li>
            <li>This just ruined my nail polish by making my nails oily then repelled my top coat.</li>
            <li>It works OK</li>
            <li>dryer\\&quot; and more akin to mink oil.</li>
            <li>I held my hand up and applied two drops at the top of each nail.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how well</li>
            <li>After polishing my nails, I wait a minute and put a drop or two on the top of the nail</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like magic.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>but said okay let me try this one.</li>
            <li>I really do love these drops.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s so many make up products that say they work \\&quot;faster\\&quot; or \\&quot;quicker\\&quot; or \\&quot;like</li>
            <li>magic,\\&quot; so I wasn&#x27;t sure.</li>
            <li>After applying your top coat, wait 60 seconds and put on a drop or two.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I found this product.  </li>
            <li>Very good product, just as described, I really recomend it, is my first time using drying drops</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has been great so far.  </li>
            <li>I tested this product for the first time and love it!</li>
            <li>definitely worth it!:]</li>
            <li>not bad at all!</li>
            <li>I tried this product and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li>no more telling yourself you&#x27;ll sleep with your hands perfectly still on top of your blanket.  </li>
            <li>so we didn&#x27;t have to worry about ruining them quickly!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to stick my hands under the UV drying light</li>
            <li>This is a great product that helps manis and pedis last longer and creates a shinier and stronger feel on the surface.  </li>
            <li>Great purchase especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Works fabulously.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a great product for the price.</li>
            <li>i can now enjoy smooth nails without polish being smudged here and there, or my clothes texture to be visible on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;i polish, wait a minute or so, then drop couple of drops on my nails, then wait for another 5-6 minutes</li>
            <li>It is quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I tried it yesterday and it worked I pretty sure.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I have only used a couple of times but it has been successful both times.  </li>
            <li>This is great for being able to touch the nail after a few minutes but it doesn&#x27;t set it fully.  </li>
            <li>This works great to dry my nails!  </li>
            <li>My daughters also love the product as it just saves so much hassle.  </li>
            <li>Its true.</li>
            <li>When I put the drops on my top coat, I thought they seemed very oily.</li>
            <li>The oils are good for your cuticles but are not to be mixed with drying agents.</li>
            <li>I have tried both the normal OPI drying drops and these Nicole by OPI drops and love them both.</li>
            <li>I (for once) followed the directions precisely, since this was my first time using any sort of drying drops.</li>
            <li>I personally do not have the patience to sit and wait for my nails to dry, so this product is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>much prefer smooth finishes, however, and so the drying drops allow me to more quickly dry the top coat before it has a chance to fully settle into the crevices of the underlying polish.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use a clear top coat with this because it helps that nails stay</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, the \\&quot;drying drops\\&quot; accomplish the task of saving your manicure when you brush your freshly painted nails against something like clothing by lessening surface friction while they cure/dry/harden.</li>
            <li>Alive 6-second drops better.</li>
            <li>Wait a minute after you&#x27;ve applied the drops and the top layer should be completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my most favorite beauty find in a very long time, I cannot express enough how amazing these drops are &amp; how much easier they make painting your nails!</li>
            <li>This drying drops product has certainly come in handy on more than one occasion, but there has been a specific situation in which this product has particularly shown through.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you have your manicure chemistry right and use the drops sparingly so your nail polish can completely harden.</li>
            <li>I have much better results with a fast dry top coat and never have marks in the morning.</li>
            <li>i will try it right after i put polish on next time to see if the result are the safe</li>
            <li>Great for moms who are trying to squeeze in a little bit of me time in before bed but doesn&#x27;t want to stay up all night waiting on your nails to dry :)</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>I was excited to try something new.</li>
            <li>Nicole by OPI Nail Treatment, Drying Drops for Nail Lacquer does exactly what the product is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>I was spectacle at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m AMAZED that after my last coat (top coat)</li>
            <li>They work exactly as advertised and as a mom who paints 2 daughters nails too</li>
            <li>This saves the frustration of them being upset from ruining their pretty nails and a lot of touch up work.</li>
            <li>The drying drops really help with this!</li>
            <li>but I was pretty pissed that it didn&#x27;t get with a dropper like in the picture.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s enough time for a basecoat, two layers of color, top coat, and drying drops.  </li>
            <li>At first it didn&#x27;t appear 2 drops were going to cover the entire nail, and I was worried that applying more would keep them from drying.</li>
            <li>I should have just been patient instead of wasting an hour or more to only have to remove all the damn polish.</li>
            <li>I was pretty stoked to try it, because I like to paint my nails at night</li>
            <li>The instructions tell you to apply this only at the end of manicure once you&#x27;re done with both the laquer and the top coat.</li>
            <li>pretty cool but very oily and drips too much.</li>
            <li>it woud work at first.  </li>
            <li>I have been using these drops for the last year or so and absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>First time I used this, it was two hours before bed</li>
            <li>These drops consistently speed up my manicure drying time.</li>
            <li>as the bottle says , this stuff really works !</li>
            <li>Every time I do my nails at home they smudge and it can be nerve racking because i spent so much time getting them to look nice.</li>
            <li>It dries nails pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I figured out quickly that if you point your finger tips down and put the drop on top of your nail by your cuticle one drop will probably spread out and cover the whole nail, you may need 2 on your thumb.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to Seche Vite&#x27;s Dry Fast top Coat.</li>
            <li>I use these when I don&#x27;t want to use a fast dry top coat.</li>
            <li>I paint my nails probably every other evening because I like coordinating my polish to my outfit, and these drying drops work great to dry them fast.</li>
            <li>The dropper helps so you don&#x27;t put too much on, but even if you did put too much, it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>I kid you not, I only bought this to make the 25 for free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I was introduced to drying drops when I had my nails done in a fancy day spa &amp; was amazed at how they really sped up the drying process.  </li>
            <li>I have to be extremely careful for more than 30 mins after using to avoid messing up my polish.</li>
            <li>I really was cautious about this product.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li>I dries extremely fast to the touch.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>the nail polish on my toenails, used to just melt in the shoes, but not anymore, thanks to the Drying Drops by OPI</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>This way the liquid slid over the whole nail.</li>
            <li>these are pretty cool, I wouldn&#x27;t say they work instantly</li>
            <li>Just a drop or two really makes them dry to the touch immediately; I&#x27;d estimate it takes a/b 30 mins for them to be 100% dry, although I try to not do much for a full hour, just to be safe</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I accidentally hit my nail on the corner of a table kind of hard</li>
            <li>Plus my nails did not dry well or quickly.</li>
            <li>I have nail polish that does not dry quickly.</li>
            <li>I literally can&#x27;t live without this!  </li>
            <li>This is an even quicker dry than usually available in nail salons.</li>
            <li>I found that the Nicole by opi drying drops worked better than the more expensive opi ones.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Really gets the nails dry quickly</li>
            <li>My nails were dry super fast.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old wants to play as soon as nails are painted.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t paint my nails b/c</li>
            <li>It worked on some nails, but today I woke up after finishing my nails yesterday afternoon and polish on one hand was still not hard.</li>
            <li>My nails felt dry to touch like 5 mins after the drops (I also used seche vite top coat) and about 10 mins later playing with my dog and my nails were intact.</li>
            <li>Takes about 20 full minutes to dry the polish.</li>
            <li>But as long as you&#x27;re not rough with it, you should be fine.</li>
            <li>smudging my new mani/pedi).</li>
            <li>I will just add these drops to the new bottle I ordered</li>
            <li>and it was super oily and didn&#x27;t really dry my nails.  </li>
            <li>They do help polish to dry quickly</li>
            <li>dry quick.</li>
            <li>It does work well to dry nails quickly.  </li>
            <li>Dries my nails rock hard in 5-7 min easy!</li>
            <li>Definitely dries your nails fast!</li>
            <li>It really does do the job in 60 seconds.nit is dry to the core; very bottom of each layer.</li>
            <li>I think they work better than the spray or the other drip dry drops.  </li>
            <li>I get a mani every week and have my salon lady use this on my nails after the clear topcoat.  </li>
            <li>It saves me money in between professional manicures.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tested the mani/pedi before bed with these drops and do the check every morning and WOW.  </li>
            <li>It also leaves your cuticles feeling soft as well</li>
            <li>it used to take a couple days to harden completely.</li>
            <li>So I tried it on my 2 year old daughter and my toes...</li>
            <li>I have a one year old</li>
            <li>Oh I&#x27;d also try the Sally Hansen Complete Manicure.</li>
            <li>My 8 year old daughter loves it too.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve purchased two of these</li>
            <li>this very moment I have on a base coat, three coats of Sinful nail polish in Flower Power, and a top coat of Sally Hansen&#x27;s Miracle Gel Top Coat.</li>
            <li>It works EXACTLY as described, nails are dry to the touch (and ready for a second coat) in 1 minute.</li>
            <li>I literally just poured it from the bottle onto my wet nails right now.</li>
            <li>I tried them out and while they did dry my nails enough to be touched lightly with in 5-10 minutes, they did not completely dry even after 30 min.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the drops seem to leave a water mark in the surface of the polish that won&#x27;t wash off, and the surface seems less glossy than if I just let the top coat dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>I waited about 45 minutes before I went to bed, and my nails seemed pretty dry.</li>
            <li>This is a great nail drying product-simply drop a little on each nail and in a few minutes the polish is dry to the touch.</li>
            <li>This product works fast and she is not grumpy from not having to sit still a long time.</li>
            <li>The box says it makes your nails dry to the touch in a min (which is 100% true) and completely dry in 5 min (depending upon # coats this probably differs).</li>
            <li>It really helps dry the nails.</li>
            <li>I wanted to find something to help keep my polish on and help my nails dry fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to decide whether or not to invest my money into the gel products, since they dry so fast.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>After you coat your nails it really helps to dry them then!</li>
            <li>I am always messing up my polish and this makes it so much easier to get them dry!</li>
            <li>I was spending a fortune on gel Mani-pedi&#x27;s because they dry quickly and last 3x as long</li>
            <li>I used a cheap polish this last time that usually chips within a day</li>
            <li>I was surprised that is actually worked.</li>
            <li>Again (OPI Euro Collection), and a thin fast-dry top coat.</li>
            <li>I love the product but it has poor packaging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other quick dry products but none compare to this one.  </li>
            <li>It does leave your nails a bit greasy, as other reviews have mentioned, but it really isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it with a different brand of polish and it took twice as long to dry.</li>
            <li>my nails were not dry even after 2 hours.</li>
            <li>The layers underneath are not dry</li>
            <li>It feels a little but oily at first.</li>
            <li>A few drops go a long way - well worth the money.</li>
            <li>These drops actually feel like the coats underneath never dry...</li>
            <li>only complaint is the oily feeling when you first drop it, but hey, just wash my hands and the oil is gone!</li>

            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this!</li>
            <li> This results in a beautiful, glittery polish with a smooth, glossy over coat.  </li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Definitely love this product!</li>
            <li> This works amazingly well, and even more so when used with Nicole by OPi nail color (says me!).</li>
            <li> Together, they look amazing, and I have these drying drops to thank.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of great things about this product, but I personally wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve invest in some of Sephora&#x27;s gorgeous polishes; however, one that I have (Nova) has a habit of causing the top coat to come out</li>
            <li> I tried this treatment in a nail salon and ordered my own after that.  </li>
            <li> I have been doing my own nails for over twenty years</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, I would recommend this item to anyone that paints their own nails.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for best quick drying top coat stick or try tried &amp; true &amp;#34;Seche Vite&amp;#34; its flawless &amp; worth the price.</li>
            <li> and i did 4 coats of polish with it inbetween each coat and on top of all the coats and it works super good!.</li>
            <li> I just did my nails with 2 coats of Sally Hansen Complete Manicure (which by the way is awesome)</li>
            <li> Huge fan!</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I also love using at home.  </li>
            <li> coat, 2 coats of polish, top coat, then 2 drops of this on each nail</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> and then do another coat (as opposed to doing 2 coats and a top coat and then putting this on).</li>
            <li> The top dries</li>
            <li> Even the top coat.</li>
            <li> This is on my blogger and more beauty exclusives and reviews.</li>
            <li> I love it -</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> So glad I purchased it and would def recommend</li>
            <li> Fabulous!</li>
            <li> This product works ok</li>
            <li> But I like them :)</li>
            <li> I like to use many coats of polish when I paint my nails</li>
            <li> Itâ€™s great and very affordable.</li>
            <li> I do two or three drops on each nail after using a top coat and let it set in.  </li>
            <li> so I could get the top coat on a bit faster then use my hands soon after.</li>
            <li> This just ruined my nail polish by making my nails oily then repelled my top coat.</li>
            <li> It works OK</li>
            <li> dryer\\&quot; and more akin to mink oil.</li>
            <li> I held my hand up and applied two drops at the top of each nail.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how well</li>
            <li> After polishing my nails, I wait a minute and put a drop or two on the top of the nail</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like magic.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> but said okay let me try this one.</li>
            <li> I really do love these drops.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so many make up products that say they work \\&quot;faster\\&quot; or \\&quot;quicker\\&quot; or \\&quot;like</li>
            <li> magic,\\&quot; so I wasn&#x27;t sure.</li>
            <li> After applying your top coat, wait 60 seconds and put on a drop or two.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I found this product.  </li>
            <li> Very good product, just as described, I really recomend it, is my first time using drying drops</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has been great so far.  </li>
            <li> I tested this product for the first time and love it!</li>
            <li> definitely worth it!:]</li>
            <li> not bad at all!</li>
            <li> I tried this product and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> no more telling yourself you&#x27;ll sleep with your hands perfectly still on top of your blanket.  </li>
            <li> so we didn&#x27;t have to worry about ruining them quickly!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to stick my hands under the UV drying light</li>
            <li> This is a great product that helps manis and pedis last longer and creates a shinier and stronger feel on the surface.  </li>
            <li> Great purchase especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Works fabulously.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this is a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> i can now enjoy smooth nails without polish being smudged here and there, or my clothes texture to be visible on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;i polish, wait a minute or so, then drop couple of drops on my nails, then wait for another 5-6 minutes</li>
            <li> It is quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I tried it yesterday and it worked I pretty sure.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have only used a couple of times but it has been successful both times.  </li>
            <li> This is great for being able to touch the nail after a few minutes but it doesn&#x27;t set it fully.  </li>
            <li> This works great to dry my nails!  </li>
            <li> My daughters also love the product as it just saves so much hassle.  </li>
            <li> Its true.</li>
            <li> When I put the drops on my top coat, I thought they seemed very oily.</li>
            <li> The oils are good for your cuticles but are not to be mixed with drying agents.</li>
            <li> I have tried both the normal OPI drying drops and these Nicole by OPI drops and love them both.</li>
            <li> I (for once) followed the directions precisely, since this was my first time using any sort of drying drops.</li>
            <li> I personally do not have the patience to sit and wait for my nails to dry, so this product is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> much prefer smooth finishes, however, and so the drying drops allow me to more quickly dry the top coat before it has a chance to fully settle into the crevices of the underlying polish.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a clear top coat with this because it helps that nails stay</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, the \\&quot;drying drops\\&quot; accomplish the task of saving your manicure when you brush your freshly painted nails against something like clothing by lessening surface friction while they cure/dry/harden.</li>
            <li> Alive 6-second drops better.</li>
            <li> Wait a minute after you&#x27;ve applied the drops and the top layer should be completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite beauty find in a very long time, I cannot express enough how amazing these drops are &amp; how much easier they make painting your nails!</li>
            <li> This drying drops product has certainly come in handy on more than one occasion, but there has been a specific situation in which this product has particularly shown through.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you have your manicure chemistry right and use the drops sparingly so your nail polish can completely harden.</li>
            <li> I have much better results with a fast dry top coat and never have marks in the morning.</li>
            <li> i will try it right after i put polish on next time to see if the result are the safe</li>
            <li> Great for moms who are trying to squeeze in a little bit of me time in before bed but doesn&#x27;t want to stay up all night waiting on your nails to dry :)</li>
            <li> Thank you very much</li>
            <li> I was excited to try something new.</li>
            <li> Nicole by OPI Nail Treatment, Drying Drops for Nail Lacquer does exactly what the product is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> I was spectacle at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m AMAZED that after my last coat (top coat)</li>
            <li> They work exactly as advertised and as a mom who paints 2 daughters nails too</li>
            <li> This saves the frustration of them being upset from ruining their pretty nails and a lot of touch up work.</li>
            <li> The drying drops really help with this!</li>
            <li> but I was pretty pissed that it didn&#x27;t get with a dropper like in the picture.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s enough time for a basecoat, two layers of color, top coat, and drying drops.  </li>
            <li> At first it didn&#x27;t appear 2 drops were going to cover the entire nail, and I was worried that applying more would keep them from drying.</li>
            <li> I should have just been patient instead of wasting an hour or more to only have to remove all the damn polish.</li>
            <li> I was pretty stoked to try it, because I like to paint my nails at night</li>
            <li> The instructions tell you to apply this only at the end of manicure once you&#x27;re done with both the laquer and the top coat.</li>
            <li> pretty cool but very oily and drips too much.</li>
            <li> it woud work at first.  </li>
            <li> I have been using these drops for the last year or so and absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> First time I used this, it was two hours before bed</li>
            <li> These drops consistently speed up my manicure drying time.</li>
            <li> as the bottle says , this stuff really works !</li>
            <li> Every time I do my nails at home they smudge and it can be nerve racking because i spent so much time getting them to look nice.</li>
            <li> It dries nails pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I figured out quickly that if you point your finger tips down and put the drop on top of your nail by your cuticle one drop will probably spread out and cover the whole nail, you may need 2 on your thumb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to Seche Vite&#x27;s Dry Fast top Coat.</li>
            <li> I use these when I don&#x27;t want to use a fast dry top coat.</li>
            <li> I paint my nails probably every other evening because I like coordinating my polish to my outfit, and these drying drops work great to dry them fast.</li>
            <li> The dropper helps so you don&#x27;t put too much on, but even if you did put too much, it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> I kid you not, I only bought this to make the 25 for free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I was introduced to drying drops when I had my nails done in a fancy day spa &amp; was amazed at how they really sped up the drying process.  </li>
            <li> I have to be extremely careful for more than 30 mins after using to avoid messing up my polish.</li>
            <li> I really was cautious about this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li> I dries extremely fast to the touch.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> the nail polish on my toenails, used to just melt in the shoes, but not anymore, thanks to the Drying Drops by OPI</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> This way the liquid slid over the whole nail.</li>
            <li> these are pretty cool, I wouldn&#x27;t say they work instantly</li>
            <li> Just a drop or two really makes them dry to the touch immediately; I&#x27;d estimate it takes a/b 30 mins for them to be 100% dry, although I try to not do much for a full hour, just to be safe</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I accidentally hit my nail on the corner of a table kind of hard</li>
            <li> Plus my nails did not dry well or quickly.</li>
            <li> I have nail polish that does not dry quickly.</li>
            <li> I literally can&#x27;t live without this!  </li>
            <li> This is an even quicker dry than usually available in nail salons.</li>
            <li> I found that the Nicole by opi drying drops worked better than the more expensive opi ones.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Really gets the nails dry quickly</li>
            <li> My nails were dry super fast.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old wants to play as soon as nails are painted.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t paint my nails b/c</li>
            <li> It worked on some nails, but today I woke up after finishing my nails yesterday afternoon and polish on one hand was still not hard.</li>
            <li> My nails felt dry to touch like 5 mins after the drops (I also used seche vite top coat) and about 10 mins later playing with my dog and my nails were intact.</li>
            <li> Takes about 20 full minutes to dry the polish.</li>
            <li> But as long as you&#x27;re not rough with it, you should be fine.</li>
            <li> smudging my new mani/pedi).</li>
            <li> I will just add these drops to the new bottle I ordered</li>
            <li> and it was super oily and didn&#x27;t really dry my nails.  </li>
            <li> They do help polish to dry quickly</li>
            <li> dry quick.</li>
            <li> It does work well to dry nails quickly.  </li>
            <li> Dries my nails rock hard in 5-7 min easy!</li>
            <li> Definitely dries your nails fast!</li>
            <li> It really does do the job in 60 seconds.nit is dry to the core; very bottom of each layer.</li>
            <li> I think they work better than the spray or the other drip dry drops.  </li>
            <li> I get a mani every week and have my salon lady use this on my nails after the clear topcoat.  </li>
            <li> It saves me money in between professional manicures.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested the mani/pedi before bed with these drops and do the check every morning and WOW.  </li>
            <li> It also leaves your cuticles feeling soft as well</li>
            <li> it used to take a couple days to harden completely.</li>
            <li> So I tried it on my 2 year old daughter and my toes...</li>
            <li> I have a one year old</li>
            <li> Oh I&#x27;d also try the Sally Hansen Complete Manicure.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old daughter loves it too.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve purchased two of these</li>
            <li> this very moment I have on a base coat, three coats of Sinful nail polish in Flower Power, and a top coat of Sally Hansen&#x27;s Miracle Gel Top Coat.</li>
            <li> It works EXACTLY as described, nails are dry to the touch (and ready for a second coat) in 1 minute.</li>
            <li> I literally just poured it from the bottle onto my wet nails right now.</li>
            <li> I tried them out and while they did dry my nails enough to be touched lightly with in 5-10 minutes, they did not completely dry even after 30 min.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the drops seem to leave a water mark in the surface of the polish that won&#x27;t wash off, and the surface seems less glossy than if I just let the top coat dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> I waited about 45 minutes before I went to bed, and my nails seemed pretty dry.</li>
            <li> This is a great nail drying product-simply drop a little on each nail and in a few minutes the polish is dry to the touch.</li>
            <li> This product works fast and she is not grumpy from not having to sit still a long time.</li>
            <li> The box says it makes your nails dry to the touch in a min (which is 100% true) and completely dry in 5 min (depending upon # coats this probably differs).</li>
            <li> It really helps dry the nails.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find something to help keep my polish on and help my nails dry fast.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to decide whether or not to invest my money into the gel products, since they dry so fast.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> After you coat your nails it really helps to dry them then!</li>
            <li> I am always messing up my polish and this makes it so much easier to get them dry!</li>
            <li> I was spending a fortune on gel Mani-pedi&#x27;s because they dry quickly and last 3x as long</li>
            <li> I used a cheap polish this last time that usually chips within a day</li>
            <li> I was surprised that is actually worked.</li>
            <li> Again (OPI Euro Collection), and a thin fast-dry top coat.</li>
            <li> I love the product but it has poor packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other quick dry products but none compare to this one.  </li>
            <li> It does leave your nails a bit greasy, as other reviews have mentioned, but it really isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it with a different brand of polish and it took twice as long to dry.</li>
            <li> my nails were not dry even after 2 hours.</li>
            <li> The layers underneath are not dry</li>
            <li> It feels a little but oily at first.</li>
            <li> A few drops go a long way - well worth the money.</li>
            <li> These drops actually feel like the coats underneath never dry...</li>
            <li> only complaint is the oily feeling when you first drop it, but hey, just wash my hands and the oil is gone!</li>
            <li> Normally I would need to wait for 30-60 minutes between coats for proper drying, but this cut down my time to about 10 minutes between layers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so unmotivated to do my nails over the last few years because of how much time it takes to paint then dry and make sure you don&#x27;t mess them up in the mean time.  </li>
            <li> but they do dry much faster, and are much less likely to be damaged.</li>
            <li> but but the other layers were soft.</li>
            <li> I paint my nails frequently and this item is extremely helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When painting little girls nails (3&amp;5), they need to dry as fast as possible.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really works or if it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> : I haven&#x27;t done my nails in years, and I used to use an OPI product that I brushed on and it dried my nails to the touch in less than a minute, but couldn&#x27;t remember exactly what it was</li>
            <li> Bought these drying drops because of all the hype around them and because my manicure always gets ruined due to my impatience while waiting for my nails to dry completely.</li>
            <li> and then 1 minute later my nails were completely dry.</li>
            <li> I timed it, gave it a minute, and I could touch the nail and it was dry enough to continue working on the nail design.  </li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t like that oily feeling it has, you can just wash your hands after your nails dry, simple as that.</li>
            <li> Twenty minutes later my nails seemed to be fully dry (4x longer than the advertised five minutes).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve painted my nails at 6pm and gone to bed at 11pm and woken up with sheet marks on my nails because they still weren&#x27;t dry enough.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry to the touch, but if you bump it or hit it, you will definitely ruin your nails.</li>
            <li> Nails dry instantly.</li>
            <li> I use this every time I paint my nails now, it makes them dry faster, but the paint will still take an impression and move when brushed up against things.</li>
            <li> I would say it takes about 15 minutes until it is dry enough to wash your hands and change your clothes.</li>
            <li> I used multiple times, and every time I didn&#x27;t feel like my nails dried out completely.</li>
            <li> This should have given them TEN HOURS to dry!</li>
            <li> Finally my nails were shiny and DRY in 5 minutes!</li>
            <li> Plus it lasts a long time</li>
            <li> (I used two drops per nail, my nails are long.)</li>
            <li> gets the job done but not fast enough.</li>
            <li> You can wash your hands to get if off, so long as you don&#x27;t dry your hands afterward.</li>
            <li> I recently discovered quick dry drops and I am obsessed.</li>
            <li> One drop goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> I recommend using this on nails with 2 coats of polish anything more and it tends to smear the underplaying coats leaving bad indentations on your nails causing you only to repeat the process again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These drying drops are a dream come true...who has time to sit and wait for nail polish to dry these days?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I add 2 drops per nail after 1 minute and they are dry to the touch immediately.  </li>
            <li> Completely dry minutes there</li>
            <li> Dries the surface, but polish underneath seems to take longer to dry.</li>
            <li> - I wouldn&#x27;t call them completely dry, but I have gone to bed and woke up without anything looking a fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My nails were dry to the touch in five minutes (5x longer than the advertised one minute).</li>
            <li> cause i never have time or patience to sit and wait for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the patience to wait for them to dry.</li>
            <li> it was already dry but wanted to test it and couldnt wait until i had to get a mani again.</li>
            <li> I always do my nails at home and never have the patience to wait for them to dry.</li>
            <li> within 1 minute of putting it on its completely dry</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it doesnt help with the chipping of nail polish but any nail polish it dries is completely dry in 5 to 10 minutes</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have time to wait for my nails to dry...</li>
            <li> My nails are dry to the touch within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> but I always seem to have marks in my nails when I wake up in the morning even after 4 plus hours of dry time before bed.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts but needed to find something to help dry my nails.</li>
            <li> After using 2 drops per nail they were dry to the touch in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> but I dont like staying up till all hours waiting for my nails to dry.</li>
            <li> and I can even see the color dry as it spreads.  </li>
            <li> My nails are immediately dry to the touch afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Its not often we get to do our nails here with our working conditions, but in a pinch this helped to dry our nails</li>
            <li> Turns a 30 minute dry into a 10 minute dry.  </li>
            <li> I usually put a drop on after every coat of polish, let it dry completely</li>
            <li> I used one drop on each nail between each coat and my nails were dry to the touch within seconds, and fully dry within 5-10 minutes!</li>
            <li> Within minutes your nails are totally dry to the touch, and not that tacky, almost dry!</li>
            <li> and then all my nails were completely dry!.</li>
            <li> I expected this to hasten the dry time</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, and since there were so many positive ones, I decided to purchase even though I was insanely wary.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s does help a little, but not enough that I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little intimidating when you see the tiny bottle and see the dropper.</li>
            <li> and yes nails dry in like 30 sec, would re order!</li>
            <li> yes, you can still damage your nails if you aren&#x27;t careful...</li>
            <li> my son always likes to touch my nails after I paint them because he is 2 and is curious</li>
            <li> THEY DRIED INSTANTLY!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t wet, or \\&quot;tacky\\&quot;, but there were sheet impressions on my nails from overnight</li>
            <li> They always end up smudging because they&#x27;re still wet.</li>
            <li> What a waste of multiple time consuming manicures.</li>
            <li> but overall, I feel it was a waste for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> does help on the go, but you still have to be careful.</li>
            <li> I even subjected them to the stick one nail on the other test and dry as a bone!</li>
            <li> did think this was a little expensive, but I think that it was worth it in the long run.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been one to sit down like a statue for a while waiting for my nails to dry, and didn&#x27;t paint them as often as I&#x27;d like due to the wait time every time.</li>
            <li> This helps speed up dry time and reduce mess ups.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that a product could really dry nail polish as fast as this one claims to do.</li>
            <li> all grainy due to the texture of the polish itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these were nothing like seche vite which does exactly what it says it does...</li>
            <li> This does help it dry a little quicker</li>
            <li> before this thing came up, I was never able to completly dry my nails, even after hours, my polish would still not be completly dry..</li>
            <li> My nails are dry in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes the surface of the nail is dry</li>
            <li> But, I tried it and it literally dries to the touch in a few seconds and your nails are dry within a minute.</li>
            <li> , I just place 1 or 2 drops on each nail and within a few seconds, my nails are instantly dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it can dry polish 100% in 5 minutes if you layer it on heavy like me, but it will still cut your drying time quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> So when he sees colors on my nails he tries to mess it up..</li>
            <li> It still takes 3+ hours for my nails to get hard enough to go to bed and not wake up with sheet marks in the polish.</li>
            <li> And when used in addition to a base coat and top coat, polish lasts up to a week.</li>
            <li> I use base coat 3 coats then top coat, so drying is a n issue for me.</li>
            <li> A few drops of these babies and my nails are completely dry!!</li>
            <li> Other than that, no complaints!</li>
            <li> Will never use any other drying product again!  </li>
            <li> It also seemed to take even longer to dry than usual after I used this.</li>
            <li> These drops speed up the surface drying SLIGHTLY.  </li>
            <li> This product is less \\&quot;nail polish</li>
            <li> As someone who constantly ruins their nails because they&#x27;re too impatient to sit still for 20 minutes, this product is a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> and I have a hard time keeping still until they dry.  </li>
            <li> While drying my nails at the drying station, I take out my little bottle of OPI and do it myself.  </li>
            <li> The drops do contain jojoba &amp; Vitamin E which can make your skin feel a little oily/greasy, but I consider it as moisture for my cuticles</li>
            <li> I went to grab a cup once and hit the side of my nail a little bit</li>
            <li> It dried my nail polish (two coats) within the quoted time frame (five minutes I believe).</li>
            <li> i rubbed them and it was all dried.</li>
            <li> of my nails dried, some never hardened- for over 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I put a few coats of color over it</li>
            <li> when I first bought this item from Harmon discount cosmetics store, I thought this could almost be impossible.</li>
            <li> Now I can always have painted nails and no smudges and mess!</li>
            <li> and I can still make marks in the polish, not smudges, if I press down on them with something hard.</li>
            <li> Not in the amount of time stated but it does help the nails drying time cut at least in half</li>
            <li> No more ruining our nails before we even get out the door.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I would always end up with small imprints or dings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I dont usually write a review</li>
            <li> No more waiting for my nails to try..</li>
            <li> Actually I thin this product was slowing down drying.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone who has had a hard time keeping their polish on.  </li>
            <li> And I swear they help protect my mani as I am in the service industry and am hard on my nails.  </li>
            <li> I could touch the nails but they weren&#x27;t hard -</li>
            <li> I bought these drops with the purpose of setting my nails to be hard so that it wouldn&#x27;t get lines from sheets or smudges if my nail hit something.  </li>
            <li> yet so if you hit your nail on something, depending on how hard, you may still have smudge it or chip it.</li>
            <li> i put drops on all 10 fingers and a minute late</li>
            <li> I can use it approximately 1/2 through the bottle but then the dropper is too small to reach the rest of the liquid.  </li>
            <li> Just try not to do anything crazy until your nails are completely dry.</li>
            <li> When I purchased these drying drops I was a little skeptical of how well they&#x27;d work.  </li>
            <li> which is not good for health anyways.</li>
            <li> I have 3 children so waiting for my nails to dry was impossible.  </li>
            <li> I use polish over a thin coat of acrylic to prevent chipping.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I hate painting my nails and having to be stationary for the next 2 hours</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product but bought it anyways to see if it would work.  </li>
            <li> Since buying nail dryers are really expensive, I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when my husband got this for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What went wrong?</li>
            <li> I picked it up at the store one day, but was obviously skeptical.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product, having never used drying drops before.  </li>
            <li> I had done a thin base coat, 2 thin coats of Suzi&#x27;s Hungary</li>
            <li> Bonus, this is one of the few nail products that does not smell like horrible chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stupid, we all know it, yet we still do it and wake up with blanket ridges.  </li>
            <li> i hate to support kardashian anything, but this is an exception.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
            <li> I have the worst time getting my nail polish to stay on longer than a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice product. I use it every time I paint my nails. It works but sometimes I have to use two drops.</li>
            <li> Love this.  It really helps dry the nails.</li>
            <li> Nicole by OPI Nail Treatment, Drying Drops for Nail Lacquer does exactly what the product is supposed to do.  I was spectacle at first but now I wish that I have bought two!</li>
            <li> My nail technician uses this, but she charges an extra $1 to apply, so I decided to search and buy it myself so I can take it every time I go do my nails.  It&#x27;s perfect.  Works wonders!!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I was paying an extra two dollars every time I went for a manicure, until I bought this product and began taking it with me to the salon. Not to be a total cheapie--I do not ask the technicians to put the drops on for me.  While drying my nails at the drying station, I take out my little bottle of OPI and do it myself.  I also love using at home.  It saves me money in between professional manicures.  My daughters also love the product as it just saves so much hassle.  No more ruining our nails before we even get out the door.</li>
            <li> This is a great nail drying product-simply drop a little on each nail and in a few minutes the polish is dry to the touch.</li>
            <li> I tried it yesterday and it worked I pretty sure. But I didn&#x27;t check the time cuz I fell in sleep &#x3D;-&#x3D;</li>
            <li> These drying drops are a dream come true...who has time to sit and wait for nail polish to dry these days?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Base coat, 2 coats of polish, top coat, then 2 drops of this on each nail and I am good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drastically reduces drying time (and the risk of me bumping/smudging my new mani/pedi). I have tried both the normal OPI drying drops and these Nicole by OPI drops and love them both.</li>
            <li> I have not tried this yet but look forward to using it.  It arrived on time, well shipped and in excellent condition.  Thank you very much</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I was introduced to it at a spa and couldn&#x27;t believe how fast it dried my nails and how chip resistant it made my nailpolish.  Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I personally do not have the patience to sit and wait for my nails to dry, so this product is perfect for me.  The box says it makes your nails dry to the touch in a min (which is 100% true) and completely dry in 5 min (depending upon # coats this probably differs). The drying drops work as they advertise which is all I look for. They leave sort of an oily residue on your fingers though so wash your hands a couple minutes after you apply them before you touch anything else. Other than that, no complaints!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that a product could really dry nail polish as fast as this one claims to do. Its true. Unbelievable. Where was this all my life?</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product but bought it anyways to see if it would work.  I applied 2 coats of sally hansen and then 1 minute later my nails were completely dry. I even subjected them to the stick one nail on the other test and dry as a bone! Next time I go to the nail salon I&#x27;m taking this with me so I don&#x27;t have to stick my hands under the UV drying light which is not good for health anyways.</li>
            <li> So ladies, we do our nails and then go to sleep.  Stupid, we all know it, yet we still do it and wake up with blanket ridges.  I kid you not, I only bought this to make the 25 for free shipping.  I used Sally Hansen qwik dri and it was super oily and didn&#x27;t really dry my nails.  I&#x27;m AMAZED that after my last coat (top coat) I add 2 drops per nail after 1 minute and they are dry to the touch immediately.  Completely dry minutes there after.  I&#x27;ve tested the mani/pedi before bed with these drops and do the check every morning and WOW.  no more telling yourself you&#x27;ll sleep with your hands perfectly still on top of your blanket.  Yea....ok. Buy this now.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to drying drops when I had my nails done in a fancy day spa &amp; was amazed at how they really sped up the drying process.  Just a drop or two really makes them dry to the touch immediately; I&#x27;d estimate it takes a/b 30 mins for them to be 100% dry, although I try to not do much for a full hour, just to be safe &amp; I haven&#x27;t had any issues, yet.  The drops do contain jojoba &amp; Vitamin E which can make your skin feel a little oily/greasy, but I consider it as moisture for my cuticles so I don&#x27;t mind, but just wanted to mention it.  This is my most favorite beauty find in a very long time, I cannot express enough how amazing these drops are &amp; how much easier they make painting your nails!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this when Amazon recommeded it. I absolutely love this! One drop goes a long way!  I timed it, gave it a minute, and I could touch the nail and it was dry enough to continue working on the nail design.  I will have this on hand at all times!</li>
            <li> these are pretty cool, I wouldn&#x27;t say they work instantly but they definitely help. I usually put a drop on after every coat of polish, let it dry completely and then do another coat (as opposed to doing 2 coats and a top coat and then putting this on).</li>
            <li> I tested this product for the first time and love it! It dried my nail polish (two coats) within the quoted time frame (five minutes I believe). It also leaves your cuticles feeling soft as well but if you don&#x27;t like that oily feeling it has, you can just wash your hands after your nails dry, simple as that. Unfortunately couldn&#x27;t buy it on Amazon.com but was able to find it in the nail care section at Shopper&#x27;s Drug Mart (Canada).</li>
            <li> As someone who constantly ruins their nails because they&#x27;re too impatient to sit still for 20 minutes, this product is a lifesaver. It works EXACTLY as described, nails are dry to the touch (and ready for a second coat) in 1 minute. It does leave your nails a bit greasy, as other reviews have mentioned, but it really isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> Dries the surface, but polish underneath seems to take longer to dry. I have to be extremely careful for more than 30 mins after using to avoid messing up my polish.</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of great things about this product, but I personally wasn&#x27;t impressed. It only dries the surface, so I still can&#x27;t do anything for about 20 minutes or so after painting my nails. It&#x27;s does help a little, but not enough that I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have the worst time getting my nail polish to stay on longer than a couple of days.  I wanted to find something to help keep my polish on and help my nails dry fast.  I would say that my nails are manageable after 30 minutes - I wouldn&#x27;t call them completely dry, but I have gone to bed and woke up without anything looking a fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been great so far.  I have only used a couple of times but it has been successful both times.  I used a cheap polish this last time that usually chips within a day and it has been staying on for 3-4 days.  I don&#x27;t use a clear top coat with this because it helps that nails stay shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did think this was a little expensive, but I think that it was worth it in the long run.  I would recommend this for anyone who has had a hard time keeping their polish on.  Great for moms who are trying to squeeze in a little bit of me time in before bed but doesn&#x27;t want to stay up all night waiting on your nails to dry :)</li>
            <li> I just loved it!Just one drop and in couple minutes no stress that i&#x27;m gonna stick to smth :) I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I tried this product and it was easy to use. The directions said to put one to two drops per nail on the final coat of your nail polish. I followed the directions and did just that. When I put the drops on my top coat, I thought they seemed very oily. My nails were dry to the touch in five minutes (5x longer than the advertised one minute). Twenty minutes later my nails seemed to be fully dry (4x longer than the advertised five minutes). I washed the oil off of my hands. The next day I had sheet marks in my nails. I painted my nails at one in the afternoon the day before. This should have given them TEN HOURS to dry! The top dries but but the other layers were soft. I had done a thin base coat, 2 thin coats of Suzi&#x27;s Hungary Again (OPI Euro Collection), and a thin fast-dry top coat. I will not repurchase them, but in the meantime I will try to make them work.&lt;br /&gt;-C</li>
            <li> These drops are amazing! They work exactly as advertised and as a mom who paints 2 daughters nails too it is a lifesaver.....</li>
            <li> i got this stuff today and i actually didnt think it would work verry well but i thought i&#x27;d try it. cause i never have time or patience to sit and wait for my nails to dry. and i did 4 coats of polish with it inbetween each coat and on top of all the coats and it works super good!. it only took like 4 mins to doo all that and then all my nails were completely dry!. i am amazed!. definitely worth it!:]</li>
            <li> Very good product, just as described, I really recomend it, is my first time using drying drops and I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li> when I first bought this item from Harmon discount cosmetics store, I thought this could almost be impossible. Since buying nail dryers are really expensive, I gave it a shot. And I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. It really does do the job in 60 seconds.nit is dry to the core; very bottom of each layer. Even the top coat. This is on my blogger and more beauty exclusives and reviews. Please become a follower at [...] Thank you</li>
            <li> This stuff works awesome. Nothing is a silver bullet - yes, you can still damage your nails if you aren&#x27;t careful... but they do dry much faster, and are much less likely to be damaged. I love it - it used to take a couple days to harden completely.</li>
            <li> I love this product. After you coat your nails it really helps to dry them then!</li>
            <li> Bought these drying drops because of all the hype around them and because my manicure always gets ruined due to my impatience while waiting for my nails to dry completely. I tried them out and while they did dry my nails enough to be touched lightly with in 5-10 minutes, they did not completely dry even after 30 min. I used multiple times, and every time I didn&#x27;t feel like my nails dried out completely. I would always end up with small imprints or dings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, does it get the job done? Yeah. It gets it done, but I won&#x27;t be buying this again. I&#x27;ll stick to Seche Vite&#x27;s Dry Fast top Coat. Dries my nails rock hard in 5-7 min easy!</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t paint my nails b/c I don&#x27;t have the patience to wait for them to dry. This product works 100% as advertised.  Finally my nails were shiny and DRY in 5 minutes! Now I can always have painted nails and no smudges and mess!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have 3 children so waiting for my nails to dry was impossible.  I&#x27;ve used other quick dry products but none compare to this one.  My nails are dry in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I use polish over a thin coat of acrylic to prevent chipping. This helps speed up dry time and reduce mess ups.</li>
            <li> This drying drops product has certainly come in handy on more than one occasion, but there has been a specific situation in which this product has particularly shown through.  I&#x27;ve invest in some of Sephora&#x27;s gorgeous polishes; however, one that I have (Nova) has a habit of causing the top coat to come out all grainy due to the texture of the polish itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer smooth finishes, however, and so the drying drops allow me to more quickly dry the top coat before it has a chance to fully settle into the crevices of the underlying polish.  This results in a beautiful, glittery polish with a smooth, glossy over coat.  Together, they look amazing, and I have these drying drops to thank.</li>
            <li> My wife managed a Spa &amp; Salon and these are the drops they used.  We bought some for our daughter because she kept borrowing my wife&#x27;s.  The price was good too.</li>
            <li> When painting little girls nails (3&amp;5), they need to dry as fast as possible. These drying drops do the trick!  Within a couple of minutes they can be running around. This saves the frustration of them being upset from ruining their pretty nails and a lot of touch up work.</li>
            <li> This works great to dry my nails!  I am always messing up my polish and this makes it so much easier to get them dry!</li>
            <li> These drops speed up the surface drying SLIGHTLY.  It still takes 3+ hours for my nails to get hard enough to go to bed and not wake up with sheet marks in the polish. Sometimes the drops seem to leave a water mark in the surface of the polish that won&#x27;t wash off, and the surface seems less glossy than if I just let the top coat dry naturally.  Plus they make your hands all oily, which is gross.</li>
            <li> tried it on my manicure. it was already dry but wanted to test it and couldnt wait until i had to get a mani again. i put drops on all 10 fingers and a minute late i rubbed them and it was all dried. no sticky let overs. i will try it right after i put polish on next time to see if the result are the safe</li>
            <li> I always do my nails at home and never have the patience to wait for them to dry. I always end up smudging or nicking them. The drying drops really help with this! Within a few minutes the surface of the nail is dry and I can continue to go about my day without ruining them. I recommend them if you do your nails at home a lot.</li>
            <li> I love the product but it has poor packaging. I can use it approximately 1/2 through the bottle but then the dropper is too small to reach the rest of the liquid.  Ok. I know. You will say to tilt the bottle to get the product. Tilting the bottle does not help, the dropper is still too short to reach the product. I literally just poured it from the bottle onto my wet nails right now. I will, however, buy the drops again. I will just add these drops to the new bottle I ordered</li>
            <li> omg! i was so amazed by this, it works so well! and yes nails dry in like 30 sec, would re order!</li>
            <li> So I dont usually write a review but I had to!.. I loveee this product.. ! No more waiting for my nails to try.. my son always likes to touch my nails after I paint them because he is 2 and is curious bout everything! So when he sees colors on my nails he tries to mess it up.. within 1 minute of putting it on its completely dry and I can go about my housework without worrying about messing it up</li>
            <li> this product is amazing&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt help with the chipping of nail polish but any nail polish it dries is completely dry in 5 to 10 minutes&lt;br /&gt;amazing!&lt;br /&gt;i recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is an even quicker dry than usually available in nail salons. So glad I purchased it and would def recommend</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when my husband got this for me. So I tried it on my 2 year old daughter and my toes...after 4 coats of paint I waited 60 seconds, then put a drop or two on...THEY DRIED INSTANTLY! I&#x27;m not kidding...then we were off. I recommend to anyone and everyone who listens!</li>
            <li> The drops work great but I was pretty pissed that it didn&#x27;t get with a dropper like in the picture.</li>
            <li> I used to only give myself a manicure/pedicure at home if I knew I had several hours to do it.  I&#x27;ve painted my nails at 6pm and gone to bed at 11pm and woken up with sheet marks on my nails because they still weren&#x27;t dry enough.  Not anymore.  Got 30 minutes?  That&#x27;s enough time for a basecoat, two layers of color, top coat, and drying drops.  Fabulous!</li>
            <li> Amazing. My best friend t</li>
            <li> I really was cautious about this product. I&#x27;m a bartender and need to look well taken care of, so I always paint my nails. Sometimes though, I wait until the last minute to paint my nails. I&#x27;ve been trying to decide whether or not to invest my money into the gel products, since they dry so fast. Then, I saw this product. I read the reviews, and since there were so many positive ones, I decided to purchase even though I was insanely wary.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I am so impressed with this product! Yes, it is a little intimidating when you see the tiny bottle and see the dropper. But, I tried it and it literally dries to the touch in a few seconds and your nails are dry within a minute. I pushed 2 minutes just to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the oily feeling when you first drop it, but hey, just wash my hands and the oil is gone! But, don&#x27;t pet your animals after applying it like I did. Otherwise, you might get the line of an animal hair in the polish. Other than that, I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Background: I haven&#x27;t done my nails in years, and I used to use an OPI product that I brushed on and it dried my nails to the touch in less than a minute, but couldn&#x27;t remember exactly what it was so I tried this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technique: I got a dropper with mine. At first it didn&#x27;t appear 2 drops were going to cover the entire nail, and I was worried that applying more would keep them from drying. I figured out quickly that if you point your finger tips down and put the drop on top of your nail by your cuticle one drop will probably spread out and cover the whole nail, you may need 2 on your thumb. You just have to get the hang of it. Bonus, this is one of the few nail products that does not smell like horrible chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of my nails dried, some never hardened- for over 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What went wrong? It worked on some nails, but today I woke up after finishing my nails yesterday afternoon and polish on one hand was still not hard. It wasn&#x27;t wet, or \\&quot;tacky\\&quot;, but there were sheet impressions on my nails from overnight and I can still make marks in the polish, not smudges, if I press down on them with something hard. I think this is because I was using a fortifying/protein polish that wasn&#x27;t meant to be used with a manicure and I put a few coats of color over it, then used these Nicole OPI drops. This was probably not the intended use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the \\&quot;drying drops\\&quot; accomplish the task of saving your manicure when you brush your freshly painted nails against something like clothing by lessening surface friction while they cure/dry/harden. This is always helpful if you have to go to the bathroom or answer the phone or who knows what. Just make sure you have your manicure chemistry right and use the drops sparingly so your nail polish can completely harden.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well for me. It&#x27;s like a superficial &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s dry to the touch, but if you bump it or hit it, you will definitely ruin your nails. It also seemed to take even longer to dry than usual after I used this.</li>
            <li> I tried this treatment in a nail salon and ordered my own after that.  This is a great product that helps manis and pedis last longer and creates a shinier and stronger feel on the surface.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have bought about 4 bottles of this stuff, works that well. Nails dry instantly. Best I have found even better thuan heat cured, &amp; easier. Xo</li>
            <li> I have a one year old and I don&#x27;t have time to wait for my nails to dry... I&#x27;ve never had my polish get messed up after using th this product.</li>
            <li> This is really good. My nails are dry to the touch within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I use these when I don&#x27;t want to use a fast dry top coat. I even bought one for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own nails for over twenty years and I have tried a lot of drying products.  This one is wonderful. I dries extremely fast to the touch. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I decided to give this a try. In my experience, it works! I&#x27;ve been one to sit down like a statue for a while waiting for my nails to dry, and didn&#x27;t paint them as often as I&#x27;d like due to the wait time every time. Not anymore! My nails felt dry to touch like 5 mins after the drops (I also used seche vite top coat) and about 10 mins later playing with my dog and my nails were intact. I am recommending this to my friends and anyone who cares.</li>
            <li> This product works ok but I always seem to have marks in my nails when I wake up in the morning even after 4 plus hours of dry time before bed. I have much better results with a fast dry top coat and never have marks in the morning.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts but needed to find something to help dry my nails. They always end up smudging because they&#x27;re still wet. After using 2 drops per nail they were dry to the touch in 5 minutes. I can do my nails in the evening, go to bed, and not wake up with smudges or marks from the sheets.</li>
            <li> I literally can&#x27;t live without this!  I get a mani every week and have my salon lady use this on my nails after the clear topcoat.  These drying drops add an extra shine.  And I swear they help protect my mani as I am in the service industry and am hard on my nails.  I bought out Target&#x27;s stock.  So yes...great product!  The best!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really works or if it&#x27;s I&#x27;m imagination. But I like them :)</li>
            <li> This works amazingly well, and even more so when used with Nicole by OPi nail color (says me!). The first time I used it with a different brand of polish and it took twice as long to dry. I was spending a fortune on gel Mani-pedi&#x27;s because they dry quickly and last 3x as long but this stuff solves one of those problems!!! A few drops go a long way - well worth the money.</li>
            <li> When I purchased these drying drops I was a little skeptical of how well they&#x27;d work.  I like to use many coats of polish when I paint my nails and I have a hard time keeping still until they dry.  I used the drying drops today and they are THE BEST. I used one drop on each nail between each coat and my nails were dry to the touch within seconds, and fully dry within 5-10 minutes! If you&#x27;re up in the air on buying this product take my advice and go for it.  Great purchase especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this! I have no idea how I went without it before. Itâ€™s great and very affordable. Plus it lasts a long time</li>
            <li> This has changed doing my nails!  I&#x27;ve been so unmotivated to do my nails over the last few years because of how much time it takes to paint then dry and make sure you don&#x27;t mess them up in the mean time.  I do two or three drops on each nail after using a top coat and let it set in.  I don&#x27;t worry about smudging anymore! :D</li>
            <li> I gave this product several attempts before throwing it out. What a waste of multiple time consuming manicures. I expected this to hasten the dry time so I could get the top coat on a bit faster then use my hands soon after. This just ruined my nail polish by making my nails oily then repelled my top coat. Plus my nails did not dry well or quickly. I should have just been patient instead of wasting an hour or more to only have to remove all the damn polish.</li>
            <li> I have tried to use it with several different nail polishes and the effect was the same - my nails were not dry even after 2 hours. Actually I thin this product was slowing down drying. I could touch the nails but they weren&#x27;t hard - I had marks all over my nails after hitting them with different things. Doing my nails close to the bedtime ended with the sheet marks next morning. Very frustrating!!!! What is the point of using this product...</li>
            <li> Great drying drops.  They do help polish to dry quickly and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> Not in the amount of time stated but it does help the nails drying time cut at least in half</li>
            <li> I have nail polish that does not dry quickly. Instead of doing the girlie hand phial thing or placing my hands I front of a fan, I just place 1 or 2 drops on each nail and within a few seconds, my nails are instantly dry. I recommend using this on nails with 2 coats of polish anything more and it tends to smear the underplaying coats leaving bad indentations on your nails causing you only to repeat the process again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-jilly</li>
            <li> This product is not intended to be used between coats of polish! Put on all the polish you want, then use this as the last step. It works OK but I like the Nails Alive 6-second drops better. [...]</li>
            <li> before this thing came up, I was never able to completly dry my nails, even after hours, my polish would still not be completly dry..the nail polish on my toenails, used to just melt in the shoes, but not anymore, thanks to the Drying Drops by OPI</li>
            <li> Really works. And when used in addition to a base coat and top coat, polish lasts up to a week. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Ever since I bought this item I never paint my nails without finishing them off with it! Takes about 20 full minutes to dry the polish. Works fabulously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never do my nails without this again. It really works. Ever since using it, I haven&#x27;t had any accidental \\&quot;dings\\&quot; in my nails, which I used to ALWAYS get before they finished drying. And it&#x27;s dropped my total mani time from like 15-20 minutes to 5! Huge fan!</li>
            <li> I use this every time I paint my nails now, it makes them dry faster, but the paint will still take an impression and move when brushed up against things. I would say it takes about 15 minutes until it is dry enough to wash your hands and change your clothes.</li>
            <li> I bought this last night at another store. I was pretty stoked to try it, because I like to paint my nails at night but I dont like staying up till all hours waiting for my nails to dry. I (for once) followed the directions precisely, since this was my first time using any sort of drying drops. It was quite oily, and my fingers left oily spots on the surfaces I touched. (I used two drops per nail, my nails are long.) I waited about 45 minutes before I went to bed, and my nails seemed pretty dry. When I woke up this morning, however, I found that I had been mistaken. There are smudges and sheet prints in the surface of my nail. This product is less \\&quot;nail polish dryer\\&quot; and more akin to mink oil. If you are looking for something to protect you from smudges while you are up and about, then this is for you. If you are looking for a quick-dry, keep on looking.</li>
            <li> I just did my nails with 2 coats of Sally Hansen Complete Manicure (which by the way is awesome) I waited one minute before I applied the drying drops. I held my hand up and applied two drops at the top of each nail. This way the liquid slid over the whole nail. It works perfect and as described. Now I will always use this when I do my nails. Oh I&#x27;d also try the Sally Hansen Complete Manicure.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I hate painting my nails and having to be stationary for the next 2 hours so I don&#x27;t smudge. This does help it dry a little quicker but overall, I feel it was a waste for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> The instructions tell you to apply this only at the end of manicure once you&#x27;re done with both the laquer and the top coat. I tried using this product between multiple layers of polish and it worked well every time. Overall, I think this is a great product for the price. Normally I would need to wait for 30-60 minutes between coats for proper drying, but this cut down my time to about 10 minutes between layers. not bad at all!</li>
            <li> pretty cool but very oily and drips too much. gets the job done but not fast enough. would try somethign else</li>
            <li> This product is amazing at drying the polish!! I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it woud work at first.  I also was concerned about it being greasy and it is not!!!</li>
            <li> My salon uses these drops and knew they worked well there.  I decided to buy some for when I do my nails at home.  After polishing my nails, I wait a minute and put a drop or two on the top of the nail and I can even see the color dry as it spreads.  My nails are immediately dry to the touch afterwards.  Awesome.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old wants to play as soon as nails are painted. This product works fast and she is not grumpy from not having to sit still a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the best drying drops.  I think they work better than the spray or the other drip dry drops.  Put these drops on and you can literally do anything you would do with nails that set for hours.  These drops are awesome!  What are you waiting for?  Order these!</li>
            <li> Really gets the nails dry quickly</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Works with regular nail polish and Sally Hansen&#x27;s Miracle Gel Polish.  I think it says somewhere not to use it on the Miracle Gel but I did and it&#x27;s fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this very moment I have on a base coat, three coats of Sinful nail polish in Flower Power, and a top coat of Sally Hansen&#x27;s Miracle Gel Top Coat. Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I have been using these drops for the last year or so and absolutely love them. They do help drying time substantially. I was even happier when I found I could have these shipped to Afg. Its not often we get to do our nails here with our working conditions, but in a pinch this helped to dry our nails so we didn&#x27;t have to worry about ruining them quickly! Definitely love this product!</li>
            <li> These drops are the best I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;ve been painting my nails faithfully since I was 13.. I&#x27;m now 35 so that portrays the experiences I&#x27;ve had. I would highly recommend. Love these!!</li>
            <li> Every time I do my nails at home they smudge and it can be nerve racking because i spent so much time getting them to look nice. The drying drops are heaven sent. One drop and your nails are good to go... I just love this stuff!!!!!!</li>
            <li> i can now enjoy smooth nails without polish being smudged here and there, or my clothes texture to be visible on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;i polish, wait a minute or so, then drop couple of drops on my nails, then wait for another 5-6 minutes and that&#x27;s all.&lt;br /&gt;additionally, it seems to do good on my cuticles too, as it&#x27;s quite oily. Has a nice scent too!</li>
            <li> I bought these drops with the purpose of setting my nails to be hard so that it wouldn&#x27;t get lines from sheets or smudges if my nail hit something.  This is great for being able to touch the nail after a few minutes but it doesn&#x27;t set it fully.  First time I used this, it was two hours before bed and I still woke up with sheet marks.  I will continue to use the bottle until it&#x27;s gone (I&#x27;m halfway there since I have been using this for two months) but will try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it leaves an oily film which drives me nuts.  You can wash your hands to get if off, so long as you don&#x27;t dry your hands afterward.</li>
            <li> This is great product for good price. It dries nails pretty fast. If you regularly doing your nails at home I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recently discovered quick dry drops and I am obsessed. I paint my nails probably every other evening because I like coordinating my polish to my outfit, and these drying drops work great to dry them fast.</li>
            <li> This product works amazing! Will never use any other drying product again!  My 8 year old daughter loves it too.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that is actually worked. I found that the Nicole by opi drying drops worked better than the more expensive opi ones.</li>
            <li> How did I not know about this product until now?!  It works amazingly!  Just one drop and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> Definitely dries your nails fast! It also makes them shiny!</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It dries like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used before. It&#x27;s like magic. I use base coat 3 coats then top coat, so drying is a n issue for me. problem solved with this. i hate to support kardashian anything, but this is an exception.</li>
            <li> Love this. My nails were dry super fast. Don&#x27;t even think my nails lost their shiny-ness! Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These drops consistently speed up my manicure drying time. The drying lacquer doesn&#x27;t affect the shininess or durability of my polish.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try something new. I always get &amp;#34;Seche Vite&amp;#34; but said okay let me try this one. Unfortunately these were nothing like seche vite which does exactly what it says it does...dry quick. These drops actually feel like the coats underneath never dry...hours later I&#x27;ve messed up the coats. I&#x27;m very disappointed only thing I can say is possibly the conditioning oils are interfering with the drying. The oils are good for your cuticles but are not to be mixed with drying agents. If you are looking for best quick drying top coat stick or try tried &amp; true &amp;#34;Seche Vite&amp;#34; its flawless &amp; worth the price.</li>
            <li> I really do love these drops. So far, I&#x27;ve purchased two of these and I&#x27;m about to purchase a third one. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 years. I paint my nails frequently and this item is extremely helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you finish painting your nails, wait a minute and apply one or two drops. The dropper helps so you don&#x27;t put too much on, but even if you did put too much, it doesn&#x27;t really matter. It feels a little but oily at first. Wait a minute after you&#x27;ve applied the drops and the top layer should be completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does help on the go, but you still have to be careful. The layers underneath are not dry yet so if you hit your nail on something, depending on how hard, you may still have smudge it or chip it. Just try not to do anything crazy until your nails are completely dry. The first time I used it, I accidentally hit my nail on the corner of a table kind of hard and it did get messed up. But as long as you&#x27;re not rough with it, you should be fine. I went to grab a cup once and hit the side of my nail a little bit and it was still perfectly painted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I would recommend this item to anyone that paints their own nails. It save a lot of nail re-dos.</li>
            <li> Seriously amazing!! A few drops of these babies and my nails are completely dry!! Best thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased!!</li>
            <li> This product is great and I am glad that I purchased it.  It is quick and easy to use.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I picked it up at the store one day, but was obviously skeptical. There&#x27;s so many make up products that say they work \\&quot;faster\\&quot; or \\&quot;quicker\\&quot; or \\&quot;like magic,\\&quot; so I wasn&#x27;t sure. However, after using them I am happy to say they do work! After applying your top coat, wait 60 seconds and put on a drop or two. Within minutes your nails are totally dry to the touch, and not that tacky, almost dry! I&#x27;m already on my second bottle and always recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> i just used this with some O.P.I nail polish and i just waited the 60 seconds and aplied a drop or 2 as the bottle says , this stuff really works !</li>
            <li> Anyone who paints their nails CANNOT miss this product.  Turns a 30 minute dry into a 10 minute dry.  Excellent!  A staple in my world.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product, having never used drying drops before.  It does work well to dry nails quickly.  I now use it every time I paint my nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I found this product.  I use this after every coat of polish.  It&#x27;s greasy but so what?  After 5 minutes in between each coat I just wash the grease off and continue to put on my next layer of polish.  I don&#x27;t think it can dry polish 100% in 5 minutes if you layer it on heavy like me, but it will still cut your drying time quite a bit.  Highly recommended.</li>
