            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>What a great deal for me!</li>
            <li>This one has been working great too.</li>
            <li>For the money, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>so I ordered one for my very own.  </li>
            <li>I tried others but they just were not as good.  </li>
            <li>Love Jilbere!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This hot air brush iron is just perfect.  </li>
            <li>I know how to maneuver these tools whether it be on my own hair or on someone else.</li>
            <li>It is easy to handle, heats up quickly and produces great results.</li>
            <li>For someone with more texture to their hair may work better.</li>
            <li>My old brush dryer, which was not a Jilbere, did a great job until it died.  </li>
            <li>Easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d appreciate recommendations on a dryer with a better cool shot that this one.</li>
            <li>For my baby fine hair I did not like this product.  </li>
            <li>When I want just a little curl on the ends this works perfectly!</li>
            <li>Ha ha Family, I love them just like this Jilbere hot air curl!</li>
            <li>and I use this Iron to smooth it</li>
            <li>This is the last of the great curling irons.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great size for me, my hair is short, I keep getting body perms</li>
            <li>I have used this hot air iron for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love this air curl so much!</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t get the jet of cool air.</li>
            <li>Perfect size, perfect heat, and a tough little product!</li>
            <li>This hot air brush works fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and completely removes the frizz from my hair while giving it a lovely soft curl.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t to impressed, very hard to get hair to wrap around the brush, quit using it almost immediately</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I have owned this Jilbere Hot Air Brush Iron for several years and absolutley love it.&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li>This is not the first one of these that I have had over the years.  </li>
            <li>It finally gave out, but it had also been dropped and knocked out of the holder many times over the years.  </li>
            <li>I have had other hair dryers with a much, much better cool shot button than this one.  </li>
            <li>Turning off the blower did more than using the cool shot, which only changed the heat from hot to warm, and it made the change slowly.  </li>
            <li>The first lasted over 10 years and would probably still be going strong except that I took it to South America with me and it got cooked from their current</li>
            <li>The cool shot button only seems to try to block the flow of hot air and doesn&#x27;t do it very well.  </li>
            <li>This one works very well.</li>
            <li>Really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li>It heats well, not too much.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone needi ng minimum curl without much fuss.</li>
            <li>and they wrote me the packinging had changed - the color of the item had changed - but - it was still the same item - and sure enough it was.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>unfortunately, like everything else that works great, they will probably take them off the market.  </li>
            <li>I am ordering another one - I have used others in the past and none have lasted as long or done as good a job as this one.</li>
            <li>I have owned the larger Jilbere hot air brush for a couple of years.</li>
            <li>I tried out three different hot air curlers today on my cousin.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended this hot air brush to me, and I had used it almost daily for over 10 years.  </li>
            <li>I have straight chin length hair which I wear in a simple under curl style.</li>
            <li>If my hair wasn&#x27;t so thick, it might work better.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, straight hair</li>
            <li>My old one - of probably 5 years - finally gave up the ghost - so I replaced it.  </li>
            <li>Okay but not great...</li>
            <li>So I had to wait way too long for the hair to cool down.      </li>
            <li>I have used the Helen of Troy air curl in the salon for years but had a hard time finding the 3/4\\&quot; and happened on the right size in the Jilbere!</li>

            <li> In addition, it does not give me a long lasting curl with body, and my hair seems much limper overall than it did with my previous product.</li>
            <li> The new brush ones are awful, but this has solid teeth and works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> Barely or no air blew out of it!</li>
            <li> Unlike others I&#x27;ve used it actually runs without stopping until my hair is dry and styled.</li>
            <li> I have used this comb daily for several years to curl my short hair with no problems at all until it finally died a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> I blow dried it totally dry and wanted to use the hot air curler to add a little curl to the ends.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with people with long hair and the long spikes on the Helen of Troy getting tangled.</li>
            <li> I find that with this tool, even when my hair is slightly wet, the brush does not grip onto my hair, and as a result, the ends often flip up instead of under.</li>
            <li> I have thin whimpy hair and this iron really does the trick for me.  </li>
            <li> Operates as expected.</li>
            <li> I hated to give it back to her :)</li>
            <li> While other similiar products broke down within 6 months, this one is still going.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t recommend it for thick hair even if your hair is semi short</li>
            <li> I have thick, slightly wavy hair that is just above my shoulder by an inch.</li>
            <li> There really is no \\&quot;cool</li>
            <li> The Jilbere won, hands down!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the performance of this expensive item: The cool shot of air button does not work and if you happen to turn off the instrument in the middle of doing your hair it will not start again.</li>
            <li> It would not even dry my hair, the plastic brush was hard and useless.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser lent me this curling brush when I complained about repeatedly burning myself with a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> She has hair past her shoulders and very, very thick hair.</li>
            <li> bought this hair/curl dryer and it was a total disappointment!</li>
            <li> i thought I&#x27;d been shipped the wrong item - but - after I wrote you - you checked with sallys beauty supply</li>
            <li> I had doubts when I purchased this, but I was desperate to find something to take even 10 minutes off my styling time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find anything bad to say about it.</li>

            <li> I have used this hot air iron for many years.  This is a replacement.  I cannot do without it!  When I want just a little curl on the ends this works perfectly! My hairdresser got me started with it and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser lent me this curling brush when I complained about repeatedly burning myself with a curling iron.  I hated to give it back to her :) so I ordered one for my very own.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and completely removes the frizz from my hair while giving it a lovely soft curl.  I think it&#x27;s just a terrific product.</li>
            <li> Perfect size.  Easy to handle.  Couldn&#x27;t get the jet of cool air.</li>
            <li> For my baby fine hair I did not like this product.  For someone with more texture to their hair may work better.</li>
            <li> I have owned the larger Jilbere hot air brush for a couple of years. While other similiar products broke down within 6 months, this one is still going. I came back for the next size smaller after getting my hair cut shorter. This one has been working great too. Love Jilbere!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have owned this Jilbere Hot Air Brush Iron for several years and absolutley love it.&lt;br /&gt;Mine just went out today and am reordering another one to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is in an permed Afro and I use this Iron to smooth it out.&lt;br /&gt;It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have straight chin length hair which I wear in a simple under curl style. My old brush dryer, which was not a Jilbere, did a great job until it died.  I find that with this tool, even when my hair is slightly wet, the brush does not grip onto my hair, and as a result, the ends often flip up instead of under. In addition, it does not give me a long lasting curl with body, and my hair seems much limper overall than it did with my previous product.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the performance of this expensive item: The cool shot of air button does not work and if you happen to turn off the instrument in the middle of doing your hair it will not start again. You may have to wait 15-20 minutes!</li>
            <li> If someone else has a different experience with this, I would like to know about it.  There really is no \\&quot;cool shot.\\&quot;  The cool shot button only seems to try to block the flow of hot air and doesn&#x27;t do it very well.  Turning off the blower did more than using the cool shot, which only changed the heat from hot to warm, and it made the change slowly.  So I had to wait way too long for the hair to cool down.      I have had other hair dryers with a much, much better cool shot button than this one.  I am going to have to return it for a refund.  I&#x27;d appreciate recommendations on a dryer with a better cool shot that this one.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t to impressed, very hard to get hair to wrap around the brush, quit using it almost immediately</li>
            <li> This is the last of the great curling irons.  The new brush ones are awful, but this has solid teeth and works beautifully.  unfortunately, like everything else that works great, they will probably take them off the market.  I recommend buying 2 or 3 at a time.</li>
            <li> This is my second one. I tried others but they just were not as good.  I would order it again.</li>
            <li> Have a short hair and looking for thinner air brush. This one works very well.</li>
            <li> My old one - of probably 5 years - finally gave up the ghost - so I replaced it.  I have fine, thin, straight hair - this gives it lift without damaging it.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have used this comb daily for several years to curl my short hair with no problems at all until it finally died a few days ago.  I am ordering another one - I have used others in the past and none have lasted as long or done as good a job as this one.</li>
            <li> bought this hair/curl dryer and it was a total disappointment! It would not even dry my hair, the plastic brush was hard and useless. Barely or no air blew out of it! When I requested a refund, I was stiffed on the return shipment of $8.36, they would not refund my expense. I would never do business with &amp;#34;Sally Beauty Supply&amp;#34;. They were unhelpful and strict about refunds because they know this stuff is junk! Save your money don&#x27;t buy this piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> This is my second brush of this model. The first lasted over 10 years and would probably still be going strong except that I took it to South America with me and it got cooked from their current -yes I used an adaptor.  I have thin whimpy hair and this iron really does the trick for me.  I&#x27;ve never mastered using a blow dryer &amp; brush together but when I&#x27;ve had to use that method, I don&#x27;t get the volume I do with this iron.I don&#x27;t find anything bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> Okay but not great... Really wanted to like this product but I can&#x27;t recommend it for thick hair even if your hair is semi short</li>
            <li> This is not the first one of these that I have had over the years.  actually it&#x27;s my 3rd one, and I can&#x27;t tell you anything I don&#x27;t like about it, or obviously I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten another one.  It&#x27;s a great size for me, my hair is short, I keep getting body perms so I have some curl in my hair.  It heats well, not too much.  For the money, it&#x27;s great.  I would recommend it to anyone needi ng minimum curl without much fuss.</li>
            <li> I have thick, slightly wavy hair that is just above my shoulder by an inch. I had doubts when I purchased this, but I was desperate to find something to take even 10 minutes off my styling time.&lt;br /&gt;Turns out this styler is no answer. I have to blowdry my hair about 92% still as this appliance doesn&#x27;t have enough power. I use it for about 7 to 8 minutes to finish, to add some shine. It doesn&#x27;t curl or style my hair. If I need that, I&#x27;m still stuck with a curling iron. If my hair wasn&#x27;t so thick, it might work better. Or, if you&#x27;re looking for a bit of smoothing but no curl, maybe it&#x27;ll do. Otherwise, save your money. It&#x27;s no hair dryer, either.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Operates as expected.</li>
            <li> This hot air brush works fine. Unlike others I&#x27;ve used it actually runs without stopping until my hair is dry and styled.</li>
            <li> I have used the Helen of Troy air curl in the salon for years but had a hard time finding the 3/4\\&quot; and happened on the right size in the Jilbere! What a great deal for me! I love this air curl so much! I have trouble with people with long hair and the long spikes on the Helen of Troy getting tangled. Not with Jilbere. I tried out three different hot air curlers today on my cousin. She has hair past her shoulders and very, very thick hair. I blow dried it totally dry and wanted to use the hot air curler to add a little curl to the ends. The Jilbere won, hands down! Remember that I am a cosmetologist and have been for 35 years. I know how to maneuver these tools whether it be on my own hair or on someone else. My cousin happened to be leaving on a trip in the morning so I had picked up some air curls for her. We tried them both and she ended up borrowing my Jilbere 3/4\\&quot; and asking me to get her one just like that because she was not going to return mine until I had a replacement for her to purchase! Ha ha Family, I love them just like this Jilbere hot air curl! No hair tangles and the cord rotates.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this hot air brush to me, and I had used it almost daily for over 10 years.  It finally gave out, but it had also been dropped and knocked out of the holder many times over the years.  Perfect size, perfect heat, and a tough little product!</li>
            <li> This hot air brush iron is just perfect.  It is easy to handle, heats up quickly and produces great results.</li>
            <li> i thought I&#x27;d been shipped the wrong item - but - after I wrote you - you checked with sallys beauty supply and they wrote me the packinging had changed - the color of the item had changed - but - it was still the same item - and sure enough it was.</li>
