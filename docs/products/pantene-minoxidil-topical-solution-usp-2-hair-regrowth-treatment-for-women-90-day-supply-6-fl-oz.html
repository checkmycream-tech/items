    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am very happy and plan to continue use - just bought 6 month supply.</li>
            <li>Very happy with results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled!!</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>Great buy, Great Seller!!</li>
            <li>That did not happen, I never have felt that it was greasy or that a product was &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; my scalp (all good news!).  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>I am proud to say, I am noticing that the bald spot is no longer bald.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>looks great in the wind</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s happy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>If it helps some: great.</li>
            <li>If it helps some: great.</li>
            <li>My mother whose elderly and whose hair has thinned some has been using this product and has been happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Very effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s remarkable.  </li>
            <li>Good seeing lots improvement</li>
            <li>It dries fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Adding water to it makes it precipitate crystals, and that can&#x27;t be good.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s my understanding that these treatments take a good bit of time -- four months -- to show progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is cheaper than some competitors, so I would say if you are into Minoxidil, it works for you, the price is good.</li>
            <li>great service .am pleased with product.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I have found the Pantene version to have a more pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I rated 3 stars not because I dont like it,I&#x27;m sure its great for whoever its able to use this product....</li>
            <li>so I decide it to donate it to Goodwill, did not charge me for it,so that was really nice of them,as for my hair</li>
            <li>Honestly: all of the pictures look like the gal</li>
            <li>Like, there shouldn’t be ANY growth of ANY KIND before that?</li>
            <li>Like, there shouldn’t be ANY growth of ANY KIND before that?</li>
            <li>Pantene Minoxidil is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The FDA has approved the much more effective 5% solution for over-the-counter sales to men; women need a doctor&#x27;s prescription.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to see Pantene has made the leap into addressing a problem that affects many women of all ages.</li>
            <li>to mention that in the directions, it talks about dropping it on one drop at a time for “most effective results” – or something to that effect(????)</li>
            <li>But, I did try 2% first - Maybe this will work for you which would be great.</li>
            <li>It comes with its own dropper and is quite easy to apply.</li>
            <li>what do you have to lose but more hair?</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product and have already seen growth, it is also affordable compared to products offering the same strength.</li>
            <li>Just screw off the bottle top … screw on the eyedropper.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works ok.</li>
            <li>I need more time</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>we all await something better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will try and update this when I know more...</li>
            <li>my hair on top and around my hair line in the front has been falling out</li>
            <li>However I did see more hair in my sink after using it for almost a month.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was glad to see that Pantene had come out with a Minoxidil treatment for women.</li>
            <li>Then I massage in product into my scalp in that area to make sure that all areas have been treated.</li>
            <li>I sure hope it&#x27;s approved and</li>
            <li>MD said okay to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Came home and thoroughly read the package insert to be sure I understood how to use the product.  </li>
            <li>somehow instead of producing hair growth, this product seems to have my hair falling out more?</li>
            <li>I am 73 and have better things to do with my time than worry about baldness.  </li>
            <li>The box comes with plenty of product to complete a cycle (more good news!).  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, I&#x27;ve experienced no allergic response which is amazing as I react to many perfumes, dyes and topical medications.</li>
            <li>, normally, I’m like a great majority</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and wonderful and this Pantene version just as good or better than Rogaine.</li>
            <li>That also means any comparison should ideally be between what you see with this product, and what you would see if you hadn&#x27;t started using it months ago--which is simply not possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found it easy to make it part of my morning and night routines.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and does seem to help promote hair growth.  </li>
            <li>Product was easy to use but had to be applied forever or lose the outcome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using for 2 months and very satisfied to not be losing the large amounts</li>
            <li>Well, since this is such a “new” product for me – one that I’ve never seen on the shelves or experienced using myself – I figured it’d be wise to read the directions.</li>
            <li>and I do notice a huge regrowth there.</li>
            <li>Great price too, especially if you use subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using Pantene product</li>
            <li>such great news in my eyes, but maybe all hair re-growth products work this way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I am fairly fortunate</li>
            <li>When I lift up these locks of hair, though, they are clearly more distinct.</li>
            <li>While it worked great for me, someone else might not have the same results.</li>
            <li>Last year I used minoxidil for 8 months on that area and was very happy to see the new growth.  </li>
            <li>I had my own idea that this boosted growth and allowed for folicles to produce new growth that lasted.  </li>
            <li>I strongly suggest women investigate this product thoroughly before purchasing it to be sure it will address their particular hair loss problem.</li>
            <li>else, I can’t remember but it makes applying it and living (i.e. bathing and keeping clean)</li>
            <li>It says you should use for 90 days but because we have to write a review in a certain time frame it may do better using it the longer period of time</li>
            <li>As a woman of a certain age with drastically thinning hair in both sexes on both sides of the family, I was very pleased to find that this stuff, which is not pricey, really does work.</li>
            <li>Still have a couple of months before seeing the full benefit but it seems that my hair has stopped falling out</li>
            <li>and i was able to get a prescription through my insurance for the copay which was much cheaper than what this would have costed.</li>
            <li>Not some “easy process” or a simple kind of “measure-and-apply.”</li>
            <li>I experienced a real change from one summer to the next.</li>
            <li>A quick scan of WebMD gives you this information:</li>
            <li>I &#x27;lightly&#x27; comb scalp with a plastic large-tooth comb first to stimulate scalp and then apply solution by rubbing tip of applicator around on scalp where needed.  </li>
            <li>My hair is not totally thick now, but it&#x27;s better than it was, and I can see that this has helped a lot.</li>
            <li>Propylene glycol is more effective at getting the active ingredient to the scalp, but it leaves hair looking greasy.</li>
            <li>Alcohol has a better &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; on the hair, but is less effective as a medium.</li>
            <li>My hair, always fine but once upon a time also reasonably thick, has become both fine and thin--but fairly evenly so.</li>
            <li>AWESOME, my big toe hair is growing super fast finally.</li>
            <li>This is the same as a generic from the drug store or Walmart, and the price is very good.</li>
            <li>“successful” as this product seems to claim itself, I just hesitate and would STRONGLY caution consumers to use this product, for, it just seems like [literally] a shot in the dark as to weather or not the solution would help that particular individual…</li>

            <li>The point is, if something is needed and useful, you continued to use it.  </li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>If you have a problem with thinning hair and if you are patient, this product would be worth trying.</li>
            <li>That is where I have found it to be useful.</li>
            <li>but it was worth trying just to know</li>
            <li>It says it can take up to 3-4 months before i see any results, which is kind of counterproductive since vine only gives us 1 month to write a review for a product...why offer a product that we can&#x27;t give the recommended amount of time to use?</li>
            <li>It says it will not work on all hair but worth a try if it works on your  hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite not having complete evidence to support me yet, I can&#x27;t give this product more than two stars.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite not having complete evidence to support me yet, I can&#x27;t give this product more than two stars.</li>
            <li>I am also pleased that it does not make my scalp, or the hair near my scalp, greasy.</li>
            <li>.almost like playing a kind of hair re-growth “Russian Roulette” with this hair product.</li>
            <li>.almost like playing a kind of hair re-growth “Russian Roulette” with this hair product.</li>
            <li>But it is worth a try.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought this would be something “similar” to a kind of shampoo, or some other kind of special ‘cream’ or mixture that was more for the whole head (to stimulate growth and help with thickness of hair/hair that has slowed down or stopped growing).</li>
            <li>Things still aren&#x27;t quite right</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for at the right price.</li>
            <li>how strong each strand is going to be, but I&#x27;m delighted with the regrowth and only wish I&#x27;d decided earlier to go for it.  </li>
            <li>and I’ve experienced no new growth so far.</li>
            <li>It has just about filled all the way in with my normal hair growth.</li>
            <li>From my non-hairstylist-professional background and understanding, hair – in general – GROWS (without the aid of any solution of any kind) EVERY month, and one typically notices/can notice SOME kind of growth within 2 – 3 months…</li>
            <li>From my non-hairstylist-professional background and understanding, hair – in general – GROWS (without the aid of any solution of any kind) EVERY month, and one typically notices/can notice SOME kind of growth within 2 – 3 months…</li>
            <li>I can you that it is easy to use but as far as results, well the Pantene experts say it will be 4 months before I see &amp;#34;true results&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and it works easy to put the product directly on your head.  </li>
            <li>I had several patches of hair loss on top and right side of my head.</li>
            <li>there are a LOT of short hairs now around my face and top of head where I apply the minoxidil solution.  </li>
            <li>If I was not experiencing results, I&#x27;d be the first to post that it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Same as women&#x27;s rogaine but a better price.</li>
            <li>you are willing to make a lifetime commitment to keeping to the rigid schedule, then this product will probably work for you.</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just seems imperfect and troublesome at this stage; I hope they simplify this product in the future to better suit consumers like me.</li>
            <li>Maybe because of where my thinning/needs-more-hair growth areas are, but the first week – or two – was the.</li>
            <li>I can say without a doubt that when used consistently my shedding in the shower drops to almost nothing.  </li>
            <li>I have not noticed any knew hair growth, but when using consistently to reduce shedding my hair does feel and look thicker.</li>
            <li>Nothing really happened, but it was fun thinking of the possibilities.</li>
            <li>She dislikes having to use it twice a day, every day, but that is more about the medicine and would be the same regardless of maker.</li>
            <li>so i will continue to use the AgeDefy Advanced Thickening treatment and hope that it will help hide the thinness my hair seems to have developed.</li>
            <li>As we get older, most of us experience a little thinning on top.</li>
            <li>I wish they would come up with something that would disappear more quickly and be less noticeable when applied and over time to make it more practical for daily living.</li>
            <li>a positive note:</li>
            <li>Have seen positive results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 3-4 months now and have regrowth that is about 1\\&quot; or more long.  </li>
            <li>Pantene for women works very well, was using Minoxidal for me at first, until you included Minoxidal for women on the list.</li>
            <li>Also, if I get too much of the minoxidil in my hair (instead of just on my scalp), then it doesn&#x27;t play nicely with other hair products.</li>
            <li>Also, if I get too much of the minoxidil in my hair (instead of just on my scalp), then it doesn&#x27;t play nicely with other hair products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found Pantene to be a good product and have used their other products over the years, so it was natural for me to try this, and</li>
            <li>Obviously this product is mostly for older women.  </li>
            <li>That being the case, and not wanting to test this product by, say, applying it regularly to one side but not the other, I did my best to treat my entire scalp.</li>
            <li>product is easy enough to apply.</li>
            <li>Small clinical trials have shown that the 5% solution is significantly more effective in both retaining and regrowing hair in women with androgenetic alopecia, the most common form of hair loss.</li>
            <li>Doesnt give much time concidering its a 3 month supply.</li>
            <li>Applying it is a bit of a hassle because it’s a liquid, so if you accidentally apply too much, it drips.</li>
            <li>Too much liquid is released at once.</li>
            <li>since I then have to wash it off (because, really, who wants hair growing on their forehead).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am hopeful that this will continue, so I will continue to apply it for the recommended time and write an update in another 2 months, which is why I gave it a 4 star, not knowing how much growth there will be.</li>
            <li>The thing is this product has to be used in the earliest stage of hair loss to be of much help.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t really bothered me much but since this was an option from vine</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t really know whether this stuff works, or not.  </li>
            <li>price for 3 months supply is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not very encouraging.</li>
            <li>And don&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>This product had to be reviewed within thirty days and that does not allow me the time to see if it really works.</li>
            <li>plan to update this review after I have had plenty of time to see if this product really does what it claims.</li>
            <li>REALLY DIDN&#x27;T SEE MUCH CHANGE.</li>
            <li>– one is supposed to wait so many hours before (and/or after) applying solution to wet hair or…</li>
            <li>VERY.</li>
            <li>very.</li>
            <li>The real differences are between the women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s formulation, and of course the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using this product for a month, I can&#x27;t really say whether it works or not.</li>
            <li>the whole</li>
            <li>the whole</li>
            <li>Very prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on this, because the first week I used this product, I knocked the bottle into the bathroom sink and then watched in horror as my precious minoxidil ran down the drain.</li>
            <li>so I was interested in trying this new product for my thinning hairline.  </li>
            <li>I like it a lot better than the other minoxidil products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s considerably more expensive than most store brands; the higher price gives you no additional benefits whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I have experienced a certain amount of hair loss lately after losing weight, and it is noticible in places, especially on the crown of my head and at my temples.</li>
            <li>Therefore, your results may differ, especially if you give it the full 90 days.</li>
            <li>Pantene is cheating us from the gitgo by providing insufficient product to determine efficacy, we must make a second investment just to find out we are  among the tiny percentage for whom it works, and on top of that, they&#x27;re charging us considerably more than other manufacturers.  </li>

            <li>This allows me to wash to product out of my hair and style as usual, while still getting effective</li>
            <li>The price is much better than other brands!</li>
            <li>:/ I haven’t been too terribly impressed thus far with the product, or rather, the issues concerning the actual implementation of the actual use of the product.</li>
            <li>:/ I haven’t been too terribly impressed thus far with the product, or rather, the issues concerning the actual implementation of the actual use of the product.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the results, especially as the cost is less than 30% of full retail on the shelves at my local drug stores.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the Vine program mandates that a review be written within 30 days, so I&#x27;ll do my best to report my experience using it and will come back after four months to report results.</li>
            <li>Some of these Vine reviews need a little more time.  </li>
            <li>So far I don&#x27;t really notice any difference on my scalp yet, but I have been apying it to my eye word</li>
            <li>My widow&#x27;s peak started to round out as hair began to fill in at the top of my forehead.</li>
            <li>Unless/until I can see an easier method and/or see ANY kind of remote effectiveness from this product, I see no reason (for me, personally and my experience thus far)</li>
            <li>Unless/until I can see an easier method and/or see ANY kind of remote effectiveness from this product, I see no reason (for me, personally and my experience thus far) to like it.</li>
            <li>She reports that although it is easy to use, she&#x27;s not likely to continue after the trial is up unless she sees a definite improvement.</li>
            <li>I’m not really willing to purchase another pack, as I wasn&#x27;t hugely keen on the fact it was a liquid and the lack of results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First things first, the instructions in the box say that it will at least be 4 months before you see true results.</li>
            <li>I see new hair growth.</li>
            <li>One thing people need to keep in mind with this product is that it is a lifetime commitment as any new growth will fall out if you stop using it.</li>
            <li>New hair growth all over my head.  </li>
            <li>I did not see any new growth at all.  </li>
            <li>It has produced a slight dryness to my scalp but is easily manageable with just a drop of moisturizer to offset the alcohol in the product.</li>
            <li>and if I see a HUGE different will report back.</li>
            <li>According to their included information, it requires four months or more before signs of re-growth appear (package contains three bottles which is expected to last three months).  </li>
            <li>Be aware that you have to faithully do this twice a day or hair will fall back out.</li>
            <li>Not an issue before bed, of course, but definitely a problem first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>She showed me and I did note that smaller lengthed hairs were evident.</li>
            <li>Normally when I purchse non food items I make sure they dont expire for at least a year after I buy.</li>
            <li>According to the package information, results become apparent after 4 months -- but Pantene only gives us 3 month&#x27;s worth of product.</li>
            <li>I know several men and women who have had it done on thinning scalps that were not actually bald, and the cost was much closer to $4,000 that the higher figure...</li>

            <li>told, I&#x27;m curious whether the Minoxidil itself will make a difference, and I&#x27;d love to have a thick, full head of hair ...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have near the results I do now.</li>
            <li>I’m surprised they didn&#x27;t opt for something like a foam.</li>
            <li>she thinned too much and now I am back to using it again...  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The product will expired before i complete</li>
            <li>So far i have seen no improvement on the area after 1 month.</li>
            <li>The directions did say that some of the area might have been too far gone.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re hoping for a fast fix, a permanent fix, or a definite fix, this is not it.</li>
            <li>I would not waste your money on it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s too early for her to tell if there have been any changes.</li>
            <li>Kind of frustrating when it does that</li>
            <li>At first, my scalp was dry and flaking, then that subsided with continued use.</li>
            <li>Tricky, eh? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is priced slightly higher than other brands and yet it does the exact same job if not less.</li>
            <li>Be warned to make sure that it doesn’t get on any other part of your skin (other than scalp) or you may risk hair growth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smart not to wait too long, by the way.</li>
            <li>First, this is hard to review because I didn&#x27;t start using this product right away.  </li>
            <li>So, not sure if I read the description wrong, or if I just didn’t understand what this product actually IS, but I’ve NOT been enjoying it and have found it WAAAAY more complex, complicated, and almost more work than it seems to be worth the effort since it is so much more of a “process” than anything.</li>
            <li>Whether one showers in the morning or evening, they essentially would have to wait several hours before applying, or apply it and wait several hours to apply – which, to my understanding – does NOT suit a ‘typical’ American workday, or even just ANY kind of day.</li>
            <li>My fine, thin hair needs as much of a boost as it can get, but because I have to wait until the minoxidil dries, I don&#x27;t always have the time to add a volume booster.</li>
            <li>I know however that it will work, but I will be a little more careful about who I have style my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 8 months and my hair is thicker and the short new hairs are getting longer.  </li>
            <li>and I do think the short hairs I see are new growth - maybe would be there any way, but hair seems thicker.  </li>
            <li>and I see new hairs starting!  </li>
            <li>So, if you at some point put all this money into new growth (lets say your a female and use it for 1 year to gain 6 or so inches of hair...</li>
            <li>She has seen a definite difference in the quantity of her hair and believes that she has been growing new hair in some of the area that has been thinning.</li>
            <li>But the actual APPLICATION turned out to be even more complex than I</li>
            <li>Her suggestions are to let the liquid flow from the eye dropper as close to the top of your head down and then guide the drops down along the area that you want covered.</li>
            <li>I might investigate other brands first.</li>
            <li>I used previously the Walgreens brand which I think is better because I noticed less irritation/white flakes/dryness on my scalp.</li>
            <li>topical solution has not worked for me so far, but perhaps it’s because of my type of hair loss.</li>
            <li>After our daughter was born my wife developed moderate Alopecia areata.</li>
            <li>I’m not sure this is a fair amount of assessment time or not, but I would at least expect some baby fuzz by this point.</li>
            <li>Results from clinical studies of mostly white women ages 18 to 45 years with mild to moderate degrees of hair loss report that after using minoxidil for eight months, 19% of users had moderate regrowth and 40% had minimal regrowth.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m really growing new hair or if it&#x27;s just the power of suggestion, but I&#x27;m definitely losing less.</li>
            <li>In any case, the only “easy” part about the whole process – which, I don’t appreciate how it’s ended up becoming…a process…just to apply a little solution – is that the dropper is not quite hard to get to the ‘1 mL’ line that is (thankfully) VERY clearly marked on the dropper.</li>

            <li>This whole thing has cycled and peaked in about a year, so it&#x27;s hard to know if her body has just begun to restore hair, or if the minoxidil is really working, or if it was the steroid injections.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working as expected my hair is not falling off as much as before I starting using this product.</li>
            <li>The active ingredient is the same as the other marketed and widely available minoxidil topical solutions.  </li>
            <li>And I do like that it is marketed for women as opposed to the others being generally for the male population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have had success with Minoxidil in the past and plan to continue the use of this Pantene version.</li>
            <li>She says that you have to move fast to stop the liquid from going down your forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My scary big balding crown area is all filled in with hair thick enough to attach a hairclip in, which is much more than it was 6 months ago.</li>
            <li>Let’s just say, that while the directions are understandable, they are SUPER confusing.</li>
            <li>So far, no new hair, but the package states that it may take six weeks or longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m posting this a bit early, because the package says it takes at least 4 months to notice results; the active ingredient affects hair regrowth, since nothing can really change how much hair you already have.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I am very happy and plan to continue use - just bought 6 month supply.</li>
            <li> Very happy with results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled!!</li>
            <li> Very good product.</li>
            <li> Great buy, Great Seller!!</li>
            <li> That did not happen, I never have felt that it was greasy or that a product was &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; my scalp (all good news!).  </li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> I am proud to say, I am noticing that the bald spot is no longer bald.</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> looks great in the wind</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> If it helps some: great.</li>
            <li> If it helps some: great.</li>
            <li> My mother whose elderly and whose hair has thinned some has been using this product and has been happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Very effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s remarkable.  </li>
            <li> Good seeing lots improvement</li>
            <li> It dries fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Adding water to it makes it precipitate crystals, and that can&#x27;t be good.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s my understanding that these treatments take a good bit of time -- four months -- to show progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is cheaper than some competitors, so I would say if you are into Minoxidil, it works for you, the price is good.</li>
            <li> great service .am pleased with product.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I have found the Pantene version to have a more pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I rated 3 stars not because I dont like it,I&#x27;m sure its great for whoever its able to use this product....</li>
            <li> so I decide it to donate it to Goodwill, did not charge me for it,so that was really nice of them,as for my hair</li>
            <li> Honestly: all of the pictures look like the gal</li>
            <li> Like, there shouldn’t be ANY growth of ANY KIND before that?</li>
            <li> Like, there shouldn’t be ANY growth of ANY KIND before that?</li>
            <li> Pantene Minoxidil is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The FDA has approved the much more effective 5% solution for over-the-counter sales to men; women need a doctor&#x27;s prescription.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to see Pantene has made the leap into addressing a problem that affects many women of all ages.</li>
            <li> to mention that in the directions, it talks about dropping it on one drop at a time for “most effective results” – or something to that effect(????)</li>
            <li> But, I did try 2% first - Maybe this will work for you which would be great.</li>
            <li> It comes with its own dropper and is quite easy to apply.</li>
            <li> what do you have to lose but more hair?</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and have already seen growth, it is also affordable compared to products offering the same strength.</li>
            <li> Just screw off the bottle top … screw on the eyedropper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works ok.</li>
            <li> I need more time</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> we all await something better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will try and update this when I know more...</li>
            <li> my hair on top and around my hair line in the front has been falling out</li>
            <li> However I did see more hair in my sink after using it for almost a month.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was glad to see that Pantene had come out with a Minoxidil treatment for women.</li>
            <li> Then I massage in product into my scalp in that area to make sure that all areas have been treated.</li>
            <li> I sure hope it&#x27;s approved and</li>
            <li> MD said okay to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Came home and thoroughly read the package insert to be sure I understood how to use the product.  </li>
            <li> somehow instead of producing hair growth, this product seems to have my hair falling out more?</li>
            <li> I am 73 and have better things to do with my time than worry about baldness.  </li>
            <li> The box comes with plenty of product to complete a cycle (more good news!).  </li>
            <li> On the plus side, I&#x27;ve experienced no allergic response which is amazing as I react to many perfumes, dyes and topical medications.</li>
            <li> , normally, I’m like a great majority</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and wonderful and this Pantene version just as good or better than Rogaine.</li>
            <li> That also means any comparison should ideally be between what you see with this product, and what you would see if you hadn&#x27;t started using it months ago--which is simply not possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found it easy to make it part of my morning and night routines.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and does seem to help promote hair growth.  </li>
            <li> Product was easy to use but had to be applied forever or lose the outcome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for 2 months and very satisfied to not be losing the large amounts</li>
            <li> Well, since this is such a “new” product for me – one that I’ve never seen on the shelves or experienced using myself – I figured it’d be wise to read the directions.</li>
            <li> and I do notice a huge regrowth there.</li>
            <li> Great price too, especially if you use subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using Pantene product</li>
            <li> such great news in my eyes, but maybe all hair re-growth products work this way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I am fairly fortunate</li>
            <li> When I lift up these locks of hair, though, they are clearly more distinct.</li>
            <li> While it worked great for me, someone else might not have the same results.</li>
            <li> Last year I used minoxidil for 8 months on that area and was very happy to see the new growth.  </li>
            <li> I had my own idea that this boosted growth and allowed for folicles to produce new growth that lasted.  </li>
            <li> I strongly suggest women investigate this product thoroughly before purchasing it to be sure it will address their particular hair loss problem.</li>
            <li> else, I can’t remember but it makes applying it and living (i.e. bathing and keeping clean)</li>
            <li> It says you should use for 90 days but because we have to write a review in a certain time frame it may do better using it the longer period of time</li>
            <li> As a woman of a certain age with drastically thinning hair in both sexes on both sides of the family, I was very pleased to find that this stuff, which is not pricey, really does work.</li>
            <li> Still have a couple of months before seeing the full benefit but it seems that my hair has stopped falling out</li>
            <li> and i was able to get a prescription through my insurance for the copay which was much cheaper than what this would have costed.</li>
            <li> Not some “easy process” or a simple kind of “measure-and-apply.”</li>
            <li> I experienced a real change from one summer to the next.</li>
            <li> A quick scan of WebMD gives you this information:</li>
            <li> I &#x27;lightly&#x27; comb scalp with a plastic large-tooth comb first to stimulate scalp and then apply solution by rubbing tip of applicator around on scalp where needed.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not totally thick now, but it&#x27;s better than it was, and I can see that this has helped a lot.</li>
            <li> Propylene glycol is more effective at getting the active ingredient to the scalp, but it leaves hair looking greasy.</li>
            <li> Alcohol has a better &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; on the hair, but is less effective as a medium.</li>
            <li> My hair, always fine but once upon a time also reasonably thick, has become both fine and thin--but fairly evenly so.</li>
            <li> AWESOME, my big toe hair is growing super fast finally.</li>
            <li> This is the same as a generic from the drug store or Walmart, and the price is very good.</li>
            <li> “successful” as this product seems to claim itself, I just hesitate and would STRONGLY caution consumers to use this product, for, it just seems like [literally] a shot in the dark as to weather or not the solution would help that particular individual…</li>
            <li> “successful” as this product seems to claim itself, I just hesitate and would STRONGLY caution consumersto use this product, for, it just seems like [literally] a shot in the dark as to weather or not the solution would help that particular individual…</li>
            <li> The point is, if something is needed and useful, you continued to use it.  </li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> If you have a problem with thinning hair and if you are patient, this product would be worth trying.</li>
            <li> That is where I have found it to be useful.</li>
            <li> but it was worth trying just to know</li>
            <li> It says it can take up to 3-4 months before i see any results, which is kind of counterproductive since vine only gives us 1 month to write a review for a product...why offer a product that we can&#x27;t give the recommended amount of time to use?</li>
            <li> It says it will not work on all hair but worth a try if it works on your  hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite not having complete evidence to support me yet, I can&#x27;t give this product more than two stars.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite not having complete evidence to support me yet, I can&#x27;t give this product more than two stars.</li>
            <li> I am also pleased that it does not make my scalp, or the hair near my scalp, greasy.</li>
            <li> .almost like playing a kind of hair re-growth “Russian Roulette” with this hair product.</li>
            <li> .almost like playing a kind of hair re-growth “Russian Roulette” with this hair product.</li>
            <li> But it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought this would be something “similar” to a kind of shampoo, or some other kind of special ‘cream’ or mixture that was more for the whole head (to stimulate growth and help with thickness of hair/hair that has slowed down or stopped growing).</li>
            <li> Things still aren&#x27;t quite right</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for at the right price.</li>
            <li> how strong each strand is going to be, but I&#x27;m delighted with the regrowth and only wish I&#x27;d decided earlier to go for it.  </li>
            <li> and I’ve experienced no new growth so far.</li>
            <li> It has just about filled all the way in with my normal hair growth.</li>
            <li> From my non-hairstylist-professional background and understanding, hair – in general – GROWS (without the aid of any solution of any kind) EVERY month, and one typically notices/can notice SOME kind of growth within 2 – 3 months…</li>
            <li> From my non-hairstylist-professional background and understanding, hair – in general – GROWS (without the aid of any solution of any kind) EVERY month, and one typically notices/can notice SOME kind of growth within 2 – 3 months…</li>
            <li> I can you that it is easy to use but as far as results, well the Pantene experts say it will be 4 months before I see &amp;#34;true results&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and it works easy to put the product directly on your head.  </li>
            <li> I had several patches of hair loss on top and right side of my head.</li>
            <li> there are a LOT of short hairs now around my face and top of head where I apply the minoxidil solution.  </li>
            <li> If I was not experiencing results, I&#x27;d be the first to post that it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Same as women&#x27;s rogaine but a better price.</li>
            <li> you are willing to make a lifetime commitment to keeping to the rigid schedule, then this product will probably work for you.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just seems imperfect and troublesome at this stage; I hope they simplify this product in the future to better suit consumers like me.</li>
            <li> Maybe because of where my thinning/needs-more-hair growth areas are, but the first week – or two – was the.</li>
            <li> I can say without a doubt that when used consistently my shedding in the shower drops to almost nothing.  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed any knew hair growth, but when using consistently to reduce shedding my hair does feel and look thicker.</li>
            <li> Nothing really happened, but it was fun thinking of the possibilities.</li>
            <li> She dislikes having to use it twice a day, every day, but that is more about the medicine and would be the same regardless of maker.</li>
            <li> so i will continue to use the AgeDefy Advanced Thickening treatment and hope that it will help hide the thinness my hair seems to have developed.</li>
            <li> As we get older, most of us experience a little thinning on top.</li>
            <li> I wish they would come up with something that would disappear more quickly and be less noticeable when applied and over time to make it more practical for daily living.</li>
            <li> a positive note:</li>
            <li> Have seen positive results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3-4 months now and have regrowth that is about 1\\&quot; or more long.  </li>
            <li> Pantene for women works very well, was using Minoxidal for me at first, until you included Minoxidal for women on the list.</li>
            <li> Also, if I get too much of the minoxidil in my hair (instead of just on my scalp), then it doesn&#x27;t play nicely with other hair products.</li>
            <li> Also, if I get too much of the minoxidil in my hair (instead of just on my scalp), then it doesn&#x27;t play nicely with other hair products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found Pantene to be a good product and have used their other products over the years, so it was natural for me to try this, and</li>
            <li> Obviously this product is mostly for older women.  </li>
            <li> That being the case, and not wanting to test this product by, say, applying it regularly to one side but not the other, I did my best to treat my entire scalp.</li>
            <li> product is easy enough to apply.</li>
            <li> Small clinical trials have shown that the 5% solution is significantly more effective in both retaining and regrowing hair in women with androgenetic alopecia, the most common form of hair loss.</li>
            <li> Doesnt give much time concidering its a 3 month supply.</li>
            <li> Applying it is a bit of a hassle because it’s a liquid, so if you accidentally apply too much, it drips.</li>
            <li> Too much liquid is released at once.</li>
            <li> since I then have to wash it off (because, really, who wants hair growing on their forehead).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am hopeful that this will continue, so I will continue to apply it for the recommended time and write an update in another 2 months, which is why I gave it a 4 star, not knowing how much growth there will be.</li>
            <li> The thing is this product has to be used in the earliest stage of hair loss to be of much help.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t really bothered me much but since this was an option from vine</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t really know whether this stuff works, or not.  </li>
            <li> price for 3 months supply is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not very encouraging.</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> This product had to be reviewed within thirty days and that does not allow me the time to see if it really works.</li>
            <li> plan to update this review after I have had plenty of time to see if this product really does what it claims.</li>
            <li> REALLY DIDN&#x27;T SEE MUCH CHANGE.</li>
            <li> – one is supposed to wait so many hours before (and/or after) applying solution to wet hair or…</li>
            <li> VERY.</li>
            <li> very.</li>
            <li> The real differences are between the women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s formulation, and of course the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using this product for a month, I can&#x27;t really say whether it works or not.</li>
            <li> the whole</li>
            <li> the whole</li>
            <li> Very prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on this, because the first week I used this product, I knocked the bottle into the bathroom sink and then watched in horror as my precious minoxidil ran down the drain.</li>
            <li> so I was interested in trying this new product for my thinning hairline.  </li>
            <li> I like it a lot better than the other minoxidil products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s considerably more expensive than most store brands; the higher price gives you no additional benefits whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I have experienced a certain amount of hair loss lately after losing weight, and it is noticible in places, especially on the crown of my head and at my temples.</li>
            <li> Therefore, your results may differ, especially if you give it the full 90 days.</li>
            <li> Pantene is cheating us from the gitgo by providing insufficient product to determine efficacy, we must make a second investment just to find out we are  among the tiny percentage for whom it works, and on top of that, they&#x27;re charging us considerably more than other manufacturers.  </li>

            <li> This allows me to wash to product out of my hair and style as usual, while still getting effective</li>
            <li> The price is much better than other brands!</li>
            <li> :/ I haven’t been too terribly impressed thus far with the product, or rather, the issues concerning the actual implementation of the actual use of the product.</li>
            <li> :/ I haven’t been too terribly impressed thus far with the product, or rather, the issues concerning the actual implementation of the actual use of the product.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the results, especially as the cost is less than 30% of full retail on the shelves at my local drug stores.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the Vine program mandates that a review be written within 30 days, so I&#x27;ll do my best to report my experience using it and will come back after four months to report results.</li>
            <li> Some of these Vine reviews need a little more time.  </li>
            <li> So far I don&#x27;t really notice any difference on my scalp yet, but I have been apying it to my eye word</li>
            <li> My widow&#x27;s peak started to round out as hair began to fill in at the top of my forehead.</li>
            <li> Unless/until I can see an easier method and/or see ANY kind of remote effectiveness from this product, I see no reason (for me, personally and my experience thus far)</li>
            <li> Unless/until I can see an easier method and/or see ANY kind of remote effectiveness from this product, I see no reason (for me, personally and my experience thus far) to like it.</li>
            <li> She reports that although it is easy to use, she&#x27;s not likely to continue after the trial is up unless she sees a definite improvement.</li>
            <li> I’m not really willing to purchase another pack, as I wasn&#x27;t hugely keen on the fact it was a liquid and the lack of results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First things first, the instructions in the box say that it will at least be 4 months before you see true results.</li>
            <li> I see new hair growth.</li>
            <li> One thing people need to keep in mind with this product is that it is a lifetime commitment as any new growth will fall out if you stop using it.</li>
            <li> New hair growth all over my head.  </li>
            <li> I did not see any new growth at all.  </li>
            <li> It has produced a slight dryness to my scalp but is easily manageable with just a drop of moisturizer to offset the alcohol in the product.</li>
            <li> and if I see a HUGE different will report back.</li>
            <li> According to their included information, it requires four months or more before signs of re-growth appear (package contains three bottles which is expected to last three months).  </li>
            <li> Be aware that you have to faithully do this twice a day or hair will fall back out.</li>
            <li> Not an issue before bed, of course, but definitely a problem first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> She showed me and I did note that smaller lengthed hairs were evident.</li>
            <li> Normally when I purchse non food items I make sure they dont expire for at least a year after I buy.</li>
            <li> According to the package information, results become apparent after 4 months -- but Pantene only gives us 3 month&#x27;s worth of product.</li>
            <li> I know several men and women who have had it done on thinning scalps that were not actually bald, and the cost was much closer to $4,000 that the higher figure...</li>
            <li> I know several men and women who have had it done on thinning scalps that were not actually bald, and the cost was much closer to $4,000 that the higher figure...</li>
            <li> told, I&#x27;m curious whether the Minoxidil itself will make a difference, and I&#x27;d love to have a thick, full head of hair ...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have near the results I do now.</li>
            <li> I’m surprised they didn&#x27;t opt for something like a foam.</li>
            <li> she thinned too much and now I am back to using it again...  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The product will expired before i complete</li>
            <li> So far i have seen no improvement on the area after 1 month.</li>
            <li> The directions did say that some of the area might have been too far gone.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re hoping for a fast fix, a permanent fix, or a definite fix, this is not it.</li>
            <li> I would not waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s too early for her to tell if there have been any changes.</li>
            <li> Kind of frustrating when it does that</li>
            <li> At first, my scalp was dry and flaking, then that subsided with continued use.</li>
            <li> Tricky, eh? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is priced slightly higher than other brands and yet it does the exact same job if not less.</li>
            <li> Be warned to make sure that it doesn’t get on any other part of your skin (other than scalp) or you may risk hair growth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smart not to wait too long, by the way.</li>
            <li> First, this is hard to review because I didn&#x27;t start using this product right away.  </li>
            <li> So, not sure if I read the description wrong, or if I just didn’t understand what this product actually IS, but I’ve NOT been enjoying it and have found it WAAAAY more complex, complicated, and almost more work than it seems to be worth the effort since it is so much more of a “process” than anything.</li>
            <li> Whether one showers in the morning or evening, they essentially would have to wait several hours before applying, or apply it and wait several hours to apply – which, to my understanding – does NOT suit a ‘typical’ American workday, or even just ANY kind of day.</li>
            <li> My fine, thin hair needs as much of a boost as it can get, but because I have to wait until the minoxidil dries, I don&#x27;t always have the time to add a volume booster.</li>
            <li> I know however that it will work, but I will be a little more careful about who I have style my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 8 months and my hair is thicker and the short new hairs are getting longer.  </li>
            <li> and I do think the short hairs I see are new growth - maybe would be there any way, but hair seems thicker.  </li>
            <li> and I see new hairs starting!  </li>
            <li> So, if you at some point put all this money into new growth (lets say your a female and use it for 1 year to gain 6 or so inches of hair...</li>
            <li> She has seen a definite difference in the quantity of her hair and believes that she has been growing new hair in some of the area that has been thinning.</li>
            <li> But the actual APPLICATION turned out to be even more complex than I</li>
            <li> Her suggestions are to let the liquid flow from the eye dropper as close to the top of your head down and then guide the drops down along the area that you want covered.</li>
            <li> I might investigate other brands first.</li>
            <li> I used previously the Walgreens brand which I think is better because I noticed less irritation/white flakes/dryness on my scalp.</li>
            <li> topical solution has not worked for me so far, but perhaps it’s because of my type of hair loss.</li>
            <li> After our daughter was born my wife developed moderate Alopecia areata.</li>
            <li> I’m not sure this is a fair amount of assessment time or not, but I would at least expect some baby fuzz by this point.</li>
            <li> Results from clinical studies of mostly white women ages 18 to 45 years with mild to moderate degrees of hair loss report that after using minoxidil for eight months, 19% of users had moderate regrowth and 40% had minimal regrowth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m really growing new hair or if it&#x27;s just the power of suggestion, but I&#x27;m definitely losing less.</li>
            <li> In any case, the only “easy” part about the whole process – which, I don’t appreciate how it’s ended up becoming…a process…just to apply a little solution – is that the dropper is not quite hard to get to the ‘1 mL’ line that is (thankfully) VERY clearly marked on the dropper.</li>

            <li> This whole thing has cycled and peaked in about a year, so it&#x27;s hard to know if her body has just begun to restore hair, or if the minoxidil is really working, or if it was the steroid injections.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working as expected my hair is not falling off as much as before I starting using this product.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient is the same as the other marketed and widely available minoxidil topical solutions.  </li>
            <li> And I do like that it is marketed for women as opposed to the others being generally for the male population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have had success with Minoxidil in the past and plan to continue the use of this Pantene version.</li>
            <li> She says that you have to move fast to stop the liquid from going down your forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My scary big balding crown area is all filled in with hair thick enough to attach a hairclip in, which is much more than it was 6 months ago.</li>
            <li> Let’s just say, that while the directions are understandable, they are SUPER confusing.</li>
            <li> So far, no new hair, but the package states that it may take six weeks or longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m posting this a bit early, because the package says it takes at least 4 months to notice results; the active ingredient affects hair regrowth, since nothing can really change how much hair you already have.</li>
            <li> If it is approved for me to use, it will take a few weeks, or until the supply is exhausted, to know whether or not it is effective.  </li>
            <li> hair had begun receding and was very thin on top.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that it does build up a residue if you don&#x27;t wash your hair frequently, but if you&#x27;re washing it every other day even, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Granted, I can understand if they mean to encourage people to apply it slowly so that it doesn’t squirt/drip everywhere, but why not just say, “Apply with dropper slowly,” and leave it at that (more or less, for lack of a better term).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li> saw new growth in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> , this is really designed for people with small patches of specific hair loss, which I didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> On the downside, it’s really hard to get this product exactly where you want it on the head.</li>
            <li> Use it on dry hair only, too, same reason.</li>
            <li> That takes rather a long time, especially since I&#x27;m supposed to do this twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I have given it a try for one month ( 3 months is recommended) and there is definitely a little growth in the area on the top of my head where the hair was extremely thin or gone.</li>
            <li> Second, Amazon wants a review turned in 30 days from the shipment date...which makes it hard to completly use a product to its fullest to report on it.  </li>
            <li> I have a thick head of hair now  - thanks to using this  product daily.  </li>
            <li> I have seen previous hair growing faster but limited bald spots having new growth.</li>
            <li> I know there are many woman out there like me, suffering with hair loss, desperately searching for something that works.</li>
            <li> If you have androgenetic alopecia, those empty hair follicles die and you can&#x27;t bring them back.</li>
            <li> That brings me to another point: how long to use and how often to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> That brings me to another point: how long to use and how often to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Moral to that story: set the bottle carefully away from you until you can close it securely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just did her part “down the middle,” with a different width of the “gap” for the part.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of those using a liquid without active minoxidil (a placebo) during the same time period, 7% reported moderate hair regrowth while 33% had minimal</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can give it a try, but personally I’d recommend using a foam or some other option.</li>
            <li> You are supposed to apply this product and let it dry before you style your hair.</li>
            <li> Minoxidil has been around for quite awhile now and most people who have tried it generally have been a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> drawback to this minoxidil solution is that you have to let it dry on your scalp before you can use any styling products.</li>
            <li> Twice a day for a few months, then you can back off to once daily 4-5 days a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;According to the directions, it provides a few pictures (three or four, can’t remember &amp; don’t have the box with/near me currently) and the pictures show “acceptable hair loss” – or, ‘if your hair looks like this, you can use it,’ of which there are two or three examples, and then the last example being of what it looks like when one should not use it.</li>
            <li> I find myself contorting my head back and forth trying to get the minoxidil to stay put rather than dripping down the nape of my neck and forehead.</li>
            <li> Like any medicine it only works if you use it consistently without fail.</li>
            <li> I do not know that it actually &#x27;regrows&#x27; hair, but I am not loosing the large amounts previously when washing hair, or found in my brush during the week and especially round brush blow-dry styling.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not long enough yet to tell how thick it&#x27;s going to be or</li>
            <li> It is considerably less costly than the brand name &amp;#34;Rogaine&amp;#34; with the same active and inactive ingredients.</li>
            <li> My hair loss may be hereditary because my mom&#x27;s hair did the same, but I do also have to take an oral chemo drug everyday for cancer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Pantene 2% Minoxidil treatment per directions for a couple of weeks now, and there are absolutely no visible results.</li>
            <li> so do be careful and apply slowly.&lt;br /&gt;By</li>
            <li> Be careful when using.</li>
            <li> As soon as I slack off with using the product my shedding increases alarmingly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m supposed to cover the &amp;#34;hair loss area&amp;#34; while using no more than 1 mL at a time ... but spreading 1 mL over my whole scalp, when presumably someone else out there is using 1 mL in one specific spot, is not only very difficult, but also creates doubt that I&#x27;m using enough to do the job</li>
            <li> – that is both long and thick enough – to cover these places.</li>
            <li> The other issue, the expiration date is September this year.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never had a reaction like this to any other product with Minoxidil.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, still using other brand of minoxidil</li>
            <li> There is one spot on my scalp that has lost some hair due to stress.</li>
            <li> The product feels like it is dripping, but it doesn&#x27;t really, a little bit goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> I will discontinue use due to the fact  hair fell out after using it.</li>
            <li> The other difference is concentration: 2% (womens) vs. 5% (mens).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I might investigate other brands first.add a volume booster.</li>
            <li> likes that there is no scent and that the bottles are small enough to travel with.</li>
            <li> Maybe the follicles that are active again just had not turned gray yet when they went dormant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> The only area of my hair that was thin is at my temples and it has been that way for almost 30 years however now those areas are the same thickness as on the rest of my head.  </li>
            <li> It does work, but only if you use at least every other day.</li>
            <li> And since the first big pack will run empty before I have any expectation of seeing results, I&#x27;m a little frustrated with that,</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the residue it leaves on the hair.  </li>
            <li> I could really use some help with my thinning hair, but I am simply unable to keep to the rigid schedule.</li>
            <li> I used another product from a different line with the same ingredients and it left the hair by my scalp dirty and oily</li>
            <li> At least try it for several months.</li>
            <li> A few months later I asked a stylist (in a big box walk in beauty shop) to thin the area a bit.  </li>
            <li> I had previously purchased.</li>
            <li> directions say that for “optimal effect,” in essence, one should use it TWICE a day – hence my reference to the twice-a-day use previously.</li>

            <li> I feel that this is a brand I can trust, so I was less hesitant to give this a shot.</li>
            <li> A typical Minoxidil 2% hair growth remedy.</li>
            <li> the directions say that your hair should be dry (or as dry as you can) – [very inconvenient if you ask me…just makes things more complicated, whether you put it on in the morning or evening]</li>
            <li> I have used other Minoxidil products in the past but thought I&#x27;d give Pantene a try.  </li>
            <li> The application took a little getting used to, but now it&#x27;s a breeze.</li>
            <li> She said that aside from the fact that it is a little runny, it goes on well, and she&#x27;s still using it after three weeks.</li>
            <li> After 5 months, however, little difference in hair growth,</li>
            <li> And the product itself is a little</li>
            <li> Am not able to rate this product at this time due to the fact that the instructions say to wait 4 months for results.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> Moving on from how often to how long, the directions/description was saying something like ‘It could take up to 6 to 8 months before noticing any effects…’ Seriously?</li>
            <li> Moving on from how often to how long, the directions/description was saying something like ‘It could take up to 6 to 8 months before noticing any effects…’ Seriously?</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.  </li>
            <li> I sleep on one spot of my head and constantly rub it thin.  </li>
            <li> : Women, don&#x27;t get the 5% solution for men and try to dilute it to 2% for women to save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> I have short THIN hair.</li>
            <li> I will update in a few months when I reach the 3 month mark and update the progress on how it is going.</li>
            <li> Then those individuals just wasted all of that money – time, energy, and effort no doubt – on a product that may/may not work (and, in some cases, doesn’t even end up working)</li>

            <li> Closer study of directions revealed a few problems for a short-term trial and review.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;According to all the research I can locate, Minoxidil 2% solution is not very effective.</li>
            <li> The bad news is I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough for results.  </li>
            <li> This medication comes in three small bottles (one per month) along with a dropper that allows you to pull up the recommended dose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another problem is, when I take a shower, I am usually in a hurry.</li>
            <li> so I decide it to purchase it,but when I read all the info,I&#x27;m not able to use it,due to the fact that people like me taking meds for hypothyroids problems cannot use this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will continue using this product.</li>

            <li> you prefer to use a women&#x27;s formula, this Pantene version is no better or worse than any other.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Only used it about a week. No visible results yet, ask me again in three months.</li>
            <li> Great buy, Great Seller!!</li>
            <li> Havent started using it on a medication that will not allow the product to work (which I didnt know at time of purchase) No medication information in the advertizing. The other issue, the expiration date is September this year. Doesnt give much time concidering its a 3 month supply. Normally when I purchse non food items I make sure they dont expire for at least a year after I buy. Of course online you cant look at the dates.</li>
            <li> Good seeing lots improvement</li>
            <li> Within 6 weeks I had visible results. My widow&#x27;s peak started to round out as hair began to fill in at the top of my forehead. I usually only applied it once a day, instead of twice a day. Very effective.</li>
            <li> This stuff works for me for growing hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 8 months and my hair is thicker and the short new hairs are getting longer.  My only complaint is the residue it leaves on the hair.  It takes just about 4 hours until it &amp;#34;disappears,&amp;#34; although it does build up over time.  I wish they would come up with something that would disappear more quickly and be less noticeable when applied and over time to make it more practical for daily living.</li>
            <li> Wish I could show you my \\&quot;before\\&quot; and \\&quot;after\\&quot; photos.  It&#x27;s remarkable.  I use this everyday.  Some people don&#x27;t like to get started on minoxidil because you do have to continue it the rest of your life once you start, but I look at it this way...  I also have to wash my hair for the rest of my life, get haircuts, wash clothes, put gas in my car, etc...  The point is, if something is needed and useful, you continued to use it.  I&#x27;ve found that it does build up a residue if you don&#x27;t wash your hair frequently, but if you&#x27;re washing it every other day even, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found Pantene to be a good product and have used their other products over the years, so it was natural for me to try this, and I like it a lot better than the other minoxidil products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people claim they have a hard time controlling the liquid, and in the beginning I had to figure it out, too.  Now I just lay my head back on the back of my chair or sofa, and let the liquid run backward onto my scalp.  Just remember how gravity works - everything runs downhill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair had begun receding and was very thin on top.  My hair loss may be hereditary because my mom&#x27;s hair did the same, but I do also have to take an oral chemo drug everyday for cancer.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 3-4 months now and have regrowth that is about 1\\&quot; or more long.  All of the area that had receded has regrown fully.  It&#x27;s not long enough yet to tell how thick it&#x27;s going to be or how strong each strand is going to be, but I&#x27;m delighted with the regrowth and only wish I&#x27;d decided earlier to go for it.  AND it may be my imagination, but I don&#x27;t seem to be as gray around my face as I was.  Maybe the follicles that are active again just had not turned gray yet when they went dormant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I continue using it?  You can bet on it !</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother. After doctor consultation, told To use 5%. No prescription, no follow up. It worked. Biggest thing Is finding a suspension you like. There Is a variety on Amazon, give them a try. Be patient, give it a year- what do you have to lose but more hair? And I take a hair vitamin supp as well. I experienced a real change from one summer to the next. But, I did try 2% first - Maybe this will work for you which would be great.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Will reorder soon.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m really growing new hair or if it&#x27;s just the power of suggestion, but I&#x27;m definitely losing less. Great price too, especially if you use subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this twice and have noticed my hair filling in around the edges and looking fuller I would recommend this product to a friend</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 months and can see a noticeable difference.  The only area of my hair that was thin is at my temples and it has been that way for almost 30 years however now those areas are the same thickness as on the rest of my head.  The product is odorless and absorbs almost instantly. It has produced a slight dryness to my scalp but is easily manageable with just a drop of moisturizer to offset the alcohol in the product. Very satisfied with the results, especially as the cost is less than 30% of full retail on the shelves at my local drug stores.</li>
            <li> Definite improvement!  I do not know that it actually &#x27;regrows&#x27; hair, but I am not loosing the large amounts previously when washing hair, or found in my brush during the week and especially round brush blow-dry styling.  there are a LOT of short hairs now around my face and top of head where I apply the minoxidil solution.  I use this a.m. and p.m. before going to bed.  I &#x27;lightly&#x27; comb scalp with a plastic large-tooth comb first to stimulate scalp and then apply solution by rubbing tip of applicator around on scalp where needed.  I&#x27;ve been using for 2 months and very satisfied to not be losing the large amounts and I do think the short hairs I see are new growth - maybe would be there any way, but hair seems thicker.  I am very happy and plan to continue use - just bought 6 month supply.</li>
            <li> I just started bottle number three and I see new hairs starting!  I have a thyroid disease that makes hair loss a problem, but this product seems to be reversing it!!!  The price is much better than other brands!</li>
            <li> it is working!! saw new growth in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone suffering from alopecia or hormonal hair loss. I am on my second bottle. I am proud to say, I am noticing that the bald spot is no longer bald. I am now growing hair. I have suffered with hair loss and a bald spot since 2008. If I was not experiencing results, I&#x27;d be the first to post that it doesn&#x27;t work. I know there are many woman out there like me, suffering with hair loss, desperately searching for something that works. Try this! I will admit that I also use a hair growth product recommended by my hair-dresser. However, when I was using that product by itself I didn&#x27;t have near the results I do now.</li>
            <li> If I could give 0 stars I would.  I have used other Minoxidil products in the past but thought I&#x27;d give Pantene a try.  My hair started falling in by the handfulls after using this for a month instead of making my hair come in thicker.  I know everyone reacts differently but I&#x27;ve never had a reaction like this to any other product with Minoxidil.  This one also made my scalp itch.</li>
            <li> I have a thick head of hair now  - thanks to using this  product daily.  Why men get a stronger  solution -5% minoxidil - for the same price seems a bit fishy to me.</li>
            <li> does not penetrate into the scalp, therefore the liquid was falling into my face.</li>
            <li> I have used the generic version of Rogaine and the brand version. I can&#x27;t tell a difference. The 5% made my scalp itch, but this doesn&#x27;t, and it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a year. I stopped losing hair, and have kept the hair that&#x27;s grown in from using the 2%. This is the same as a generic from the drug store or Walmart, and the price is very good. I will reorder. My hair is not totally thick now, but it&#x27;s better than it was, and I can see that this has helped a lot. I prefer this to the mousse. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy like the mousse did. I use it twice a day as directed. I found it easy to make it part of my morning and night routines. The application took a little getting used to, but now it&#x27;s a breeze. It&#x27;s very watery, and I got it in my eyes a few times before I figured out what I was doing.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Same as women&#x27;s rogaine but a better price. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> First things first, the instructions in the box say that it will at least be 4 months before you see true results. It is sold in a 3 month supply pack. Tricky, eh? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is priced slightly higher than other brands and yet it does the exact same job if not less. So is the price hike simply because it&#x27;s made by Pantene? Probably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s going to take a while for me to say how this goes. I can you that it is easy to use but as far as results, well the Pantene experts say it will be 4 months before I see &amp;#34;true results&amp;#34; lol.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working as expected my hair is not falling off as much as before I starting using this product.</li>
            <li> This medication comes in three small bottles (one per month) along with a dropper that allows you to pull up the recommended dose. Applying it is a bit of a hassle because it’s a liquid, so if you accidentally apply too much, it drips. I’m surprised they didn&#x27;t opt for something like a foam. It dries fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really though, it’s tough to tell whether it made any difference. My hair grows very slow, and I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference. It comes with three months’ worth of the chemical, but says in the information insert that you have to use it for at least 4 months to notice any change. I’m not really willing to purchase another pack, as I wasn&#x27;t hugely keen on the fact it was a liquid and the lack of results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can give it a try, but personally I’d recommend using a foam or some other option.</li>
            <li> I see new hair growth.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and have already seen growth, it is also affordable compared to products offering the same strength.</li>
            <li> AWESOME, my big toe hair is growing super fast finally. looks great in the wind</li>
            <li> Bought this brand because it was on sale. I used previously the Walgreens brand which I think is better because I noticed less irritation/white flakes/dryness on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, still using other brand of minoxidil I had previously purchased.</li>
            <li> Worked as described.  Actually brought my hair back.  Will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> This product made my scalp itch and I did not see any hair growth.  I tried it for 90 days.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as instructed for between three and four weeks. So far, no new hair, but the package states that it may take six weeks or longer. On the plus side, I&#x27;ve experienced no allergic response which is amazing as I react to many perfumes, dyes and topical medications. It comes with its own dropper and is quite easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I could really use some help with my thinning hair, but I am simply unable to keep to the rigid schedule. I have flexible work hours, so I don&#x27;t always take a shower at the same time every day, or go to bed at the same time every night. It&#x27;s difficult for me to remember to apply this twice per day, every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem is, when I take a shower, I am usually in a hurry. You are supposed to apply this product and let it dry before you style your hair. I don&#x27;t seem to have the time or the patience for that extra step in my grooming routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are willing to make a lifetime commitment to keeping to the rigid schedule, then this product will probably work for you.</li>
            <li> If this works I would like it, however to have to use it for 8 months in order to  have &amp;#34;same results&amp;#34; requires a leap of faith, especially considering how pricey this product is.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using Pantene product so I was interested in trying this new product for my thinning hairline.  This product is easy to use and does seem to help promote hair growth.  My hair does look fuller.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for almost a year now.  Working well.</li>
            <li> Before getting to my review, I’d like to point out that it’s a flaw in the Vine program that reviews are required within 30 days for a product that may take up to 90 days to see results. That being said, I’ve been using this Pantene minoxidil topical solution for over a month now and I’ve experienced no new growth so far. I’m not sure this is a fair amount of assessment time or not, but I would at least expect some baby fuzz by this point. I will continue to use and if my (non) results change, I will come back and alter my rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the application, there are some pros and cons. On the plus side, the eyedropper screws directly onto the bottle and stays there until empty. Just screw off the bottle top … screw on the eyedropper. No fuss, no muss. On the downside, it’s really hard to get this product exactly where you want it on the head. Too much liquid is released at once. I find myself contorting my head back and forth trying to get the minoxidil to stay put rather than dripping down the nape of my neck and forehead. Kind of frustrating when it does that since I then have to wash it off (because, really, who wants hair growing on their forehead).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pantene minoxidil topical solution has not worked for me so far, but perhaps it’s because of my type of hair loss. The product packaging indicates it is for widening of the center part and my thin spot is more in the back of my head. Therefore, your results may differ, especially if you give it the full 90 days.</li>
            <li> Still using this. It&#x27;s works ok. I need more time</li>
            <li> Box states it takes four months to see results but only sell it in three month boxes.  Not liking it</li>
            <li> Still have a couple of months before seeing the full benefit but it seems that my hair has stopped falling out and I can see a bit of growth in the bald areas</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I sleep on one spot of my head and constantly rub it thin.  Last year I used minoxidil for 8 months on that area and was very happy to see the new growth.  A few months later I asked a stylist (in a big box walk in beauty shop) to thin the area a bit.  Big mistake...she thinned too much and now I am back to using it again...  I know however that it will work, but I will be a little more careful about who I have style my hair.</li>
            <li> Zerrrrrrrroooooooo&lt;br /&gt;The product will expired before i complete the course&lt;br /&gt;Bad company</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and wonderful and this Pantene version just as good or better than Rogaine. Be aware that you have to faithully do this twice a day or hair will fall back out. It takes seconds and I do it when I brush my teeth. Worth it.</li>
            <li> Product was easy to use but had to be applied forever or lose the outcome. An expensive project and it might not even work. Stopped throwing my money after it.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t helped yet - maybe too soon to tell</li>
            <li> Obviously this product is mostly for older women.  Why put the childproof unopenable cap on it?  I don&#x27;t know about the product because I can&#x27;t open it.  Of course, I&#x27;ll never buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product is a topical solution for hair regrowth and I have to say that I was somewhat skeptical to begin with. However, I have given it a try for one month ( 3 months is recommended) and there is definitely a little growth in the area on the top of my head where the hair was extremely thin or gone. I am hopeful that this will continue, so I will continue to apply it for the recommended time and write an update in another 2 months, which is why I gave it a 4 star, not knowing how much growth there will be. That said, it has been the ONLY product of all the products I have tried where I have actually seen some result. If you have a problem with thinning hair and if you are patient, this product would be worth trying.</li>
            <li> Minoxidil has been around for quite awhile now and most people who have tried it generally have been a bit disappointed. Don&#x27;t expect any miracle here. The thing is this product has to be used in the earliest stage of hair loss to be of much help. Myself, I use it to help maintain what I have. That is where I have found it to be useful. That is in reducing the rate of hair loss. The big problem for both men and women is incorporating the use of this product into your daily routine. Like any medicine it only works if you use it consistently without fail. If you do, and it&#x27;s a challenge, you will see results. That said...we all await something better.</li>
            <li> After our daughter was born my wife developed moderate Alopecia areata. It was devastating to her self esteem, so we tried a variety of things including minoxidil and sub-q cranial steroid injections to knock out the inflammation. Hair is growing back now, but slowly, gray, and very thin. This whole thing has cycled and peaked in about a year, so it&#x27;s hard to know if her body has just begun to restore hair, or if the minoxidil is really working, or if it was the steroid injections.  Maybe it was all three. Things still aren&#x27;t quite right but it was worth trying just to know we did everything we could to support hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> There is one spot on my scalp that has lost some hair due to stress. It hasn&#x27;t really bothered me much but since this was an option from vine i figured why not. So far i have seen no improvement on the area after 1 month. It says it can take up to 3-4 months before i see any results, which is kind of counterproductive since vine only gives us 1 month to write a review for a product...why offer a product that we can&#x27;t give the recommended amount of time to use? i have gone to my doctor for the hair loss and i was able to get a prescription through my insurance for the copay which was much cheaper than what this would have costed. My advice, go see a doctor.</li>
            <li> First, this is hard to review because I didn&#x27;t start using this product right away.  Second, Amazon wants a review turned in 30 days from the shipment date...which makes it hard to completly use a product to its fullest to report on it.  That being said, I can tell you what I have learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned that the product would leave my scalp greasy as I used this.  That did not happen, I never have felt that it was greasy or that a product was &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; my scalp (all good news!).  The product comes with a &amp;#34;dropper&amp;#34; type wand and it works easy to put the product directly on your head.  The product feels like it is dripping, but it doesn&#x27;t really, a little bit goes a long way!  The box comes with plenty of product to complete a cycle (more good news!).  The bad news is I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough for results.  I also didn&#x27;t like the idea that &amp;#34;if&amp;#34; you quit using the product the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; hair you grow will slowly fall out.  I had my own idea that this boosted growth and allowed for folicles to produce new growth that lasted.  So, if you at some point put all this money into new growth (lets say your a female and use it for 1 year to gain 6 or so inches of hair...it could be gone if you quit).  This was &amp;#34;not&amp;#34; such great news in my eyes, but maybe all hair re-growth products work this way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try and update this when I know more...</li>
            <li> As a woman of a certain age with drastically thinning hair in both sexes on both sides of the family, I was very pleased to find that this stuff, which is not pricey, really does work. My scary big balding crown area is all filled in with hair thick enough to attach a hairclip in, which is much more than it was 6 months ago. Twice a day for a few months, then you can back off to once daily 4-5 days a week. At least that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;Caveat: Women, don&#x27;t get the 5% solution for men and try to dilute it to 2% for women to save a few bucks. Adding water to it makes it precipitate crystals, and that can&#x27;t be good. Use it on dry hair only, too, same reason.</li>
            <li> great service .am pleased with product.</li>
            <li> I rated 3 stars not because I dont like it,I&#x27;m sure its great for whoever its able to use this product....my hair on top and around my hair line in the front has been falling out so I decide it to purchase it,but when I read all the info,I&#x27;m not able to use it,due to the fact that people like me taking meds for hypothyroids problems cannot use this product. I call amazon and explain my situation and they told me not to send it back to donate it,pass it along to someone else give it away,just throw it out so I decide it to donate it to Goodwill, did not charge me for it,so that was really nice of them,as for my hair I purchase spring valley vitamis for my hair,skin and nails.I just started taking the vitamis so I hope they will work for me.</li>
            <li> Pantene for women works very well, was using Minoxidal for me at first, until you included Minoxidal for women on the list. Very happy with results.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a month - I have seen previous hair growing faster but limited bald spots having new growth. The directions did say that some of the area might have been too far gone. Will keep using and if I see a HUGE different will report back.</li>
            <li> My wife has thinning hair and I gave this product to her to try. She said that aside from the fact that it is a little runny, it goes on well, and she&#x27;s still using it after three weeks. She believes that it is working. She&#x27;s happy. I&#x27;m happy. I expect her to continue to use it after the sample runs out.</li>
            <li> I have short THIN hair. I thought after 60days I would see a Difference .I did not see anything that made my hair thicker or grew my hair. Smells bad and does not work on my hair. It says it will not work on all hair but worth a try if it works on your  hair.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t really know whether this stuff works, or not.  The person for which this was ordered has been unable to use it due to a severe accident.  When she finished rehab, she will resume treatment and will update this review accordingly.  I have used the male version of Minoxidil to no effect.  One thing people need to keep in mind with this product is that it is a lifetime commitment as any new growth will fall out if you stop using it.</li>
            <li> As well as I can tell it works the same as Rogine and a lot cheaper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m posting this a bit early, because the package says it takes at least 4 months to notice results; the active ingredient affects hair regrowth, since nothing can really change how much hair you already have. That also means any comparison should ideally be between what you see with this product, and what you would see if you hadn&#x27;t started using it months ago--which is simply not possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is really designed for people with small patches of specific hair loss, which I didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered it. My hair, always fine but once upon a time also reasonably thick, has become both fine and thin--but fairly evenly so. My &amp;#34;hair loss area&amp;#34; is basically my entire scalp. That being the case, and not wanting to test this product by, say, applying it regularly to one side but not the other, I did my best to treat my entire scalp. That takes rather a long time, especially since I&#x27;m supposed to do this twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, that&#x27;s a problem in itself. I&#x27;m supposed to cover the &amp;#34;hair loss area&amp;#34; while using no more than 1 mL at a time ... but spreading 1 mL over my whole scalp, when presumably someone else out there is using 1 mL in one specific spot, is not only very difficult, but also creates doubt that I&#x27;m using enough to do the job properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, I&#x27;m curious whether the Minoxidil itself will make a difference, and I&#x27;d love to have a thick, full head of hair ... but when this runs out, I&#x27;ll probably switch to a foam application product rather than this dropper-based one. That just sounds easier to me. And since the first big pack will run empty before I have any expectation of seeing results, I&#x27;m a little frustrated with that, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just seems imperfect and troublesome at this stage; I hope they simplify this product in the future to better suit consumers like me.</li>
            <li> price for 3 months supply is reasonable.  After 5 months, however, little difference in hair growth,</li>
            <li> Cannot use with hypothyroid meds. Need to check if you have this condition this will not help. Also, if you color your hair, product states your hair may grow in a different color. Not going to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Pantene 2% Minoxidil treatment per directions for a couple of weeks now, and there are absolutely no visible results. If you&#x27;re hoping for a fast fix, a permanent fix, or a definite fix, this is not it. According to the package information, results become apparent after 4 months -- but Pantene only gives us 3 month&#x27;s worth of product. Marketing of this sort strikes me as dishonest and we shouldn&#x27;t tolerate it.  And the product itself is a little questionable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to all the research I can locate, Minoxidil 2% solution is not very effective. Small clinical trials have shown that the 5% solution is significantly more effective in both retaining and regrowing hair in women with androgenetic alopecia, the most common form of hair loss. A quick scan of WebMD gives you this information: Results from clinical studies of mostly white women ages 18 to 45 years with mild to moderate degrees of hair loss report that after using minoxidil for eight months, 19% of users had moderate regrowth and 40% had minimal regrowth. Of those using a liquid without active minoxidil (a placebo) during the same time period, 7% reported moderate hair regrowth while 33% had minimal regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not very encouraging. And don&#x27;t forget that minoxidil is not a permanent cure. If (and that&#x27;s a big if) it works for you, you have to keep using it. Twice a day, every day.  Quit and the hair falls out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FDA has approved the much more effective 5% solution for over-the-counter sales to men; women need a doctor&#x27;s prescription.  Don&#x27;t ask me why. As we get older, most of us experience a little thinning on top. Mine isn&#x27;t a problem and when it is, I&#x27;ll deal with it. It&#x27;s smart not to wait too long, by the way. If you have androgenetic alopecia, those empty hair follicles die and you can&#x27;t bring them back. Nothing will work. So don&#x27;t wait too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some women may want to explore hormone replacement therapy (HRT) if their hair loss is related to perimenopause or  menopause.  Estrogen and progesterone pills may provide some help.  You can also investigate follicle transplants.  You&#x27;ll have to shell out $4,000 to $15,000 for a transplant, one session takes from 4 to 8 hours. I know several men and women who have had it done on thinning scalps that were not actually bald, and the cost was much closer to $4,000 that the higher figure...but it&#x27;s out of your pocket and not covered by health insurance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite not having complete evidence to support me yet, I can&#x27;t give this product more than two stars. I suspect it deserves just one. Pantene is cheating us from the gitgo by providing insufficient product to determine efficacy, we must make a second investment just to find out we are  among the tiny percentage for whom it works, and on top of that, they&#x27;re charging us considerably more than other manufacturers.  If you want to take a chance with 2% minoxidil, go price shopping. Don&#x27;t pay for the Pantene label. And don&#x27;t expect much.d to perimenopause or  menopause.

            <li> This product had to be reviewed within thirty days and that does not allow me the time to see if it really works. The instructions stated it would take a minimum of four months to see any changes and this makes it difficult to review on the affects it will have on my hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note: Pantene Minoxidil is very easy to apply. I am also pleased that it does not make my scalp, or the hair near my scalp, greasy. I used another product from a different line with the same ingredients and it left the hair by my scalp dirty and oily looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to update this review after I have had plenty of time to see if this product really does what it claims.</li>
            <li> This product takes some time (up to 4 months) to see visible results. I have been using it for 32 days without fail. The active ingredient is the same as the other marketed and widely available minoxidil topical solutions.  It is dispensed in the same dropper and bottle as the generic version I have used years ago. It is considerably less costly than the brand name &amp;#34;Rogaine&amp;#34; with the same active and inactive ingredients. I have found the Pantene version to have a more pleasant smell. And I do like that it is marketed for women as opposed to the others being generally for the male population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had success with Minoxidil in the past and plan to continue the use of this Pantene version. It is nice to see Pantene has made the leap into addressing a problem that affects many women of all ages.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Pantene regrowth hair treatment treatment for about a month now.  The box says I have to apply twice a day for three months before I will see any results. So far I don&#x27;t really notice any difference on my scalp yet, but I have been apying it to my eye word and I do notice a huge regrowth there. I will update in a few months when I reach the 3 month mark and update the progress on how it is going.</li>
            <li> Am not able to rate this product at this time due to the fact that the instructions say to wait 4 months for results.&lt;br /&gt;What I can say is that it is a liquid eye-drop applicator and not foam so do be careful and apply slowly.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the generic formulation is basically the same and for lower price.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> New hair growth all over my head.  My hair stylist couldn&#x27;t believe the difference. I&#x27;m thrilled!!</li>
            <li> REALLY DIDN&#x27;T SEE MUCH CHANGE.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for at the right price.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I did not have the type of hair loss this product treats. And worse, I could not return it as Amazon has a policy regarding the return of &amp;#34;hazardous&amp;#34; material. I strongly suggest women investigate this product thoroughly before purchasing it to be sure it will address their particular hair loss problem.</li>
            <li> RETURNED PER DR INSTRUCTION</li>
            <li> I did not see any new growth at all.  However I did see more hair in my sink after using it for almost a month. I used it since the day it arrived. It says you should use for 90 days but because we have to write a review in a certain time frame it may do better using it the longer period of time but I won&#x27;t hold my breath!  I will discontinue use due to the fact  hair fell out after using it. I would not waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> So, not sure if I read the description wrong, or if I just didn’t understand what this product actually IS, but I’ve NOT been enjoying it and have found it WAAAAY more complex, complicated, and almost more work than it seems to be worth the effort since it is so much more of a “process” than anything. I honestly thought this would be something “similar” to a kind of shampoo, or some other kind of special ‘cream’ or mixture that was more for the whole head (to stimulate growth and help with thickness of hair/hair that has slowed down or stopped growing). Boy was I mistaken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, normally, I’m like a great majority when it comes to directions: I don’t often read them. Well, since this is such a “new” product for me – one that I’ve never seen on the shelves or experienced using myself – I figured it’d be wise to read the directions. Let’s just say, that while the directions are understandable, they are SUPER confusing. This is the gist of what [I remember] them saying: ‘Don’t use if you know the reason of your hair loss or if you do know the reason. Be warned to make sure that it doesn’t get on any other part of your skin (other than scalp) or you may risk hair growth. Be careful when using. Consult your doctor before using to see what the cause of hair loss might be,’…a bit contradictory in several places. But the actual APPLICATION turned out to be even more complex than I anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the directions, it provides a few pictures (three or four, can’t remember &amp; don’t have the box with/near me currently) and the pictures show “acceptable hair loss” – or, ‘if your hair looks like this, you can use it,’ of which there are two or three examples, and then the last example being of what it looks like when one should not use it. Honestly: all of the pictures look like the gal just did her part “down the middle,” with a different width of the “gap” for the part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, my hair loss is NOT that obvious. I have a thinning part, yes, but I also have areas of actual hair loss, HOWEVER, I am fairly fortunate considering that I have enough hair – that is both long and thick enough – to cover these places. When I lift up these locks of hair, though, they are clearly more distinct. Sadly, my impression from the directions is that (for my condition) it may not work/it doesn’t seem/appear to be an “acceptable” state for this solution….not to mention that in the directions, it talks about dropping it on one drop at a time for “most effective results” – or something to that effect(????) What?!?!? (I don’t understand that.) Granted, I can understand if they mean to encourage people to apply it slowly so that it doesn’t squirt/drip everywhere, but why not just say, “Apply with dropper slowly,” and leave it at that (more or less, for lack of a better term).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding application: WAY. TOO. CHALLENGING.&lt;br /&gt;Yes: that is what it’s turning out to be: a challenge. Not some “easy process” or a simple kind of “measure-and-apply.” Maybe because of where my thinning/needs-more-hair growth areas are, but the first week – or two – was the. HARDEST. Not that it’s any easier – about a month later – but the directions say that your hair should be dry (or as dry as you can) – [very inconvenient if you ask me…just makes things more complicated, whether you put it on in the morning or evening] – one is supposed to wait so many hours before (and/or after) applying solution to wet hair or….whatever else, I can’t remember but it makes applying it and living (i.e. bathing and keeping clean) VERY. very. INVCONVENIENT. Whether one showers in the morning or evening, they essentially would have to wait several hours before applying, or apply it and wait several hours to apply – which, to my understanding – does NOT suit a ‘typical’ American workday, or even just ANY kind of day. I’ve found it VERY difficult and quite inconvenient at times to use, but, since I’ve already have in my possession the three-month supply, I’m just going to use it up. If it helps some: great. If not, well…tough beans for me, I guess. Oh! That brings me to another point: how long to use and how often to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say that for “optimal effect,” in essence, one should use it TWICE a day – hence my reference to the twice-a-day use previously. That is one of the reasons why it is/can be so inconvenient….understandably, one doesn’t HAVE to use it twice a day, but I’d like to think that using it as recommended would prove beneficial/helpful. In any case, the only “easy” part about the whole process – which, I don’t appreciate how it’s ended up becoming…a process…just to apply a little solution – is that the dropper is not quite hard to get to the ‘1 mL’ line that is (thankfully) VERY clearly marked on the dropper. Moving on from how often to how long, the directions/description was saying something like ‘It could take up to 6 to 8 months before noticing any effects…’ Seriously? Like, there shouldn’t be ANY growth of ANY KIND before that? From my non-hairstylist-professional background and understanding, hair – in general – GROWS (without the aid of any solution of any kind) EVERY month, and one typically notices/can notice SOME kind of growth within 2 – 3 months….and yet, this solution says wait 6 – 8 months (or so) to see ****IF***** there is any growth/noticeable growth/re-growth, etc. (??!!??) That just seems like a way for the company to get people to buy their product. What if it DOESN’T work? Then those individuals just wasted all of that money – time, energy, and effort no doubt – on a product that may/may not work (and, in some cases, doesn’t even end up working)….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As “successful” as this product seems to claim itself, I just hesitate and would STRONGLY caution consumers to use this product, for, it just seems like [literally] a shot in the dark as to weather or not the solution would help that particular individual….almost like playing a kind of hair re-growth “Russian Roulette” with this hair product. :/ I haven’t been too terribly impressed thus far with the product, or rather, the issues concerning the actual implementation of the actual use of the product. Unless/until I can see an easier method and/or see ANY kind of remote effectiveness from this product, I see no reason (for me, personally and my experience thus far) to like it.nd it VERY difficult and quite inconvenient at times to use, but, since I’ve already have in my possession the three-month supply, I’m just going to use it up.

            <li> I have been using this on and off for 3 months now.  I can say without a doubt that when used consistently my shedding in the shower drops to almost nothing.  As soon as I slack off with using the product my shedding increases alarmingly.  I have not noticed any knew hair growth, but when using consistently to reduce shedding my hair does feel and look thicker.</li>
            <li> After using one bottle of this product I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair growth.  Not sure if I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I applied it as per directions.&lt;br /&gt;It made my scalp itch. I guessed that it meant it was growing hair. Nothing really happened, but it was fun thinking of the possibilities.</li>
            <li> These minoxidil products simply don&#x27;t change from one brand to another. The real differences are between the women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s formulation, and of course the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women&#x27;s products are alcohol-based, which can be irritating and drying. Men&#x27;s are based in propylene glycol. Propylene glycol is more effective at getting the active ingredient to the scalp, but it leaves hair looking greasy. Alcohol has a better &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; on the hair, but is less effective as a medium. The other difference is concentration: 2% (womens) vs. 5% (mens).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I visited a dermatologistabout my thinning hair, he advised me to I use any store brand men&#x27;s liquid formula, and to apply it only at night. This allows me to wash to product out of my hair and style as usual, while still getting effective treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you prefer to use a women&#x27;s formula, this Pantene version is no better or worse than any other. However, it&#x27;s considerably more expensive than most store brands; the higher price gives you no additional benefits whatsoever.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a month, I can&#x27;t really say whether it works or not. Unfortunately, the Vine program mandates that a review be written within 30 days, so I&#x27;ll do my best to report my experience using it and will come back after four months to report results. (Note to self: remember to do this!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was glad to see that Pantene had come out with a Minoxidil treatment for women. I feel that this is a brand I can trust, so I was less hesitant to give this a shot. I have experienced a certain amount of hair loss lately after losing weight, and it is noticible in places, especially on the crown of my head and at my temples. For the last four weeks, I have been applying this minoxidil to my scalp twice a day. No results yet, but it&#x27;s my understanding that these treatments take a good bit of time -- four months -- to show progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This box contains three bottles of treatment and one dropper. Each bottle is supposed to last a month. I can&#x27;t comment on this, because the first week I used this product, I knocked the bottle into the bathroom sink and then watched in horror as my precious minoxidil ran down the drain. Moral to that story: set the bottle carefully away from you until you can close it securely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is easy enough to apply. I set the dropper on my scalp in the areas of thinning and dispense enough liquid to cover the area. Then I massage in product into my scalp in that area to make sure that all areas have been treated. Finally, I wash my hands thoroughly, because I don&#x27;t have the time or patience to pull on nitrile gloves before each application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A drawback to this minoxidil solution is that you have to let it dry on your scalp before you can use any styling products. Not an issue before bed, of course, but definitely a problem first thing in the morning. My fine, thin hair needs as much of a boost as it can get, but because I have to wait until the minoxidil dries, I don&#x27;t always have the time to add a volume booster. Also, if I get too much of the minoxidil in my hair (instead of just on my scalp), then it doesn&#x27;t play nicely with other hair products. My hair ends up looking dirty if I add product or limp and lifeless if I do not. I&#x27;m disappointed that Pantene did not deal with this issue, especially since this product is targeted to women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic about this product but disappointed at how difficult it is to style my hair after using it. Given the price I&#x27;m not sure that I would repurchase it. I might investigate other brands first.add a volume booster.

            <li> My appointment is 3/5/14.  If it is approved for me to use, it will take a few weeks, or until the supply is exhausted, to know whether or not it is effective.  Some of these Vine reviews need a little more time.  I&#x27;ll be back.  I sure hope it&#x27;s approved and works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** 3/27/2014 Update:  MD said okay to give it a try.  Came home and thoroughly read the package insert to be sure I understood how to use the product.  Closer study of directions revealed a few problems for a short-term trial and review.  According to their included information, it requires four months or more before signs of re-growth appear (package contains three bottles which is expected to last three months).  And -- the hair will fall out again if the product use is not continuously maintained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since there is not enough product in the package to make it to the four month time line for re-growth to show, I&#x27;m not even going to start because there is only a three month supply in the package.  It could become expensive to maintain hair growth with this type of product.</li>
            <li> My mother whose elderly and whose hair has thinned some has been using this product and has been happy with the results. She has seen a definite difference in the quantity of her hair and believes that she has been growing new hair in some of the area that has been thinning. She showed me and I did note that smaller lengthed hairs were evident.</li>
            <li> My female friend has been using the Pantene Minoxidil for over a month now. She reports that although it is easy to use, she&#x27;s not likely to continue after the trial is up unless she sees a definite improvement. Her suggestions are to let the liquid flow from the eye dropper as close to the top of your head down and then guide the drops down along the area that you want covered. She says that you have to move fast to stop the liquid from going down your forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She likes that there is no scent and that the bottles are small enough to travel with. She dislikes having to use it twice a day, every day, but that is more about the medicine and would be the same regardless of maker. She would prefer a foam if it were available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too early for her to tell if there have been any changes. The literature that comes with it says it takes several - up to six months - to see a difference.</li>
            <li> A typical Minoxidil 2% hair growth remedy. It is cheaper than some competitors, so I would say if you are into Minoxidil, it works for you, the price is good.</li>
            <li> Started using thos product to grow my thin curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months. I had several patches of hair loss on top and right side of my head. It has just about filled all the way in with my normal hair growth. I would reccomend Pantene Minoxidil to anyone with hair loss. At least try it for several months. While it worked great for me, someone else might not have the same results. But it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for six months.  Yes, I see an improvement and hair growth!</li>
            <li> still waiting for progress</li>
            <li> somehow instead of producing hair growth, this product seems to have my hair falling out more?</li>
            <li> Have seen positive results. At first, my scalp was dry and flaking, then that subsided with continued use.</li>
            <li> Very prompt delivery. Received as it was described.</li>
            <li> just started trying no results yet</li>
            <li> Hair seams to be thicking ...but I also take biotin!</li>
            <li> 65 plus with thinning hair.  It does work, but only if you use at least every other day.</li>
            <li> I was not happy to find out that it needed to be applied twice a day and if you discontinued use the loss of hair would return.  I am 73 and have better things to do with my time than worry about baldness.  so i will continue to use the AgeDefy Advanced Thickening treatment and hope that it will help hide the thinness my hair seems to have developed.</li>
