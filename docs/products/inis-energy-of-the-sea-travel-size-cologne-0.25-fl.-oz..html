            <li>The lotion is nice too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells really nice, a man or woman could wear it, though its leaning toward a man, in my opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great summer fragrance, so light and clean!  </li>
            <li>Product arrived very quickly!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to buy more of this scent.</li>
            <li>Had a bit of a problem with the bottle, and Heather at eBubbles immediately took care of it, and sent some lovely emails as well.  </li>
            <li>Purchasing it through Amazon has proven to be MUCH more affordable too.</li>
            <li>I had purchased Inis Lotion and fell in love.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>and I love how it smells.  </li>
            <li>Sort of like CK N2U.  Not girly or flowery, more unisex.</li>
            <li>get many complements when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Love the scent .  </li>
            <li>I saw how many great reviews this product had, and my expectations were high.</li>
            <li>Got my first bottle in Ireland and have loved it ever since.  </li>
            <li>At first, the scent was slightly masculine, but as it settled it was wonderfully soothing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delighted with it and can&#x27;t wait to stow it in my TSA-approved clear plastic bag and smell heavenly everywhere</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and clean, isn&#x27;t too strong, but lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Very clean and crisp.</li>
            <li>My headline might sound absurd, but this very pretty cologne -- the most popular perfume in Ireland apparently -- is great for day wear.</li>
            <li>Inis roll-on is not so easy to get, so I was thrilled when one finally came up.  </li>
            <li>It smells so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Inis has a clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Luckily this was the one she like.</li>
            <li>The problem is that I was going through it quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was super quick.</li>
            <li>I love a clean, crisp scent and this certainly was one.</li>
            <li>Fresh.</li>
            <li>, just right.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this for everyone who wants a like clean scent</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean, this is one of those rare scents that I think would smell good on almost anyone, male or female, no matter what your body chemistry is.</li>
            <li>Very much like a walk on a beach.  </li>
            <li>it was so appreciated!  </li>
            <li>I first learned of this scent years ago from QVC, or HSN and have been seeking places to buy it ever since.</li>
            <li>I first saw this perfume while visiting Ireland and have been wearing it ever since.</li>
            <li>It is light and fresh, with mostly floral notes, but with a hint of citrus so not the least bit cloying.</li>
            <li>They really care and went out of their way...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I love the small compact size to the travel cologne and will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>So I purchased this small bottle to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li>My 18 year old daughter loves it and gets compliments on it when she wears it.</li>
            <li>Not too sweet, not too sour</li>
            <li>It seems slightly fragile, but you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem if you are gentle when you open it.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so start with a tiny dab on your pulse points and put more on if you need</li>
            <li>Like other posters, I was hesitant to purchase this scent (without smelling it first), so I decided to purchase this smaller portion of cologne.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway when you open the top, it screws off, and it doesnt have a spray nozzle, it just has a small opening, so be careful you hold it upright when opening or it will spill out.</li>
            <li>When I was ordering directly from Ireland, it was much more expensive.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong, yet its not too weak either.</li>

            <li> i found this fragrance in Ireland years ago and have been wearing it since. Everyone always asks me what i wearing. I love the small compact size to the travel cologne and will be purchasing it again. I can&#x27;t wait to buy more of this scent. The delievery was very good and I would buy from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> Got my first bottle in Ireland and have loved it ever since.  The smell lasts all day and everybody seems to like the smell.</li>
            <li> The service was quick, the product was wonderful.  I will use them again and often as the perfume and cologne supply needs replenishing...</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful!  And it does smell differently on other people.  I tried it on my two daughters and their friends</li>
            <li> Inis roll-on is not so easy to get, so I was thrilled when one finally came up.  Had a bit of a problem with the bottle, and Heather at eBubbles immediately took care of it, and sent some lovely emails as well.  They really care and went out of their way...it was so appreciated!  And thank you to my friend for introducing this wonderful scent to me...she only found it in Ireland for a long time, and now it&#x27;s on Amazon...thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a fragrance that is not overwhelming and it is just like it says, Energy of the Sea.  Not too sweet, not too sour, just right.  It&#x27;s the best.  I just love it!  I will buy bigger than a travel size next time.</li>
            <li> Like other posters, I was hesitant to purchase this scent (without smelling it first), so I decided to purchase this smaller portion of cologne.  At first, the scent was slightly masculine, but as it settled it was wonderfully soothing.  It reminds me of a great beach candle I smelled once.  I can&#x27;t stop sniffing myself!    The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product was the lid.  It seems slightly fragile, but you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem if you are gentle when you open it.</li>
            <li> I like the scent. I can carry this in my purse. Should have bought the spray. Oh well, next time. Thanks</li>
            <li> Have to have a traveler for your purse - this is a nice size.  I have also tried the roll on.  Both sizes are nice for traveling.</li>
            <li> I first learned of this scent years ago from QVC, or HSN and have been seeking places to buy it ever since. It smells fresh and clean, isn&#x27;t too strong, but lasts all day. The lotion is nice too.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend located this item in an Irish gift store. We didn&#x27;t purchase it at that time. Then I located it on Amazon and realized there were several Inis scents, but I couldn&#x27;t remember which one it was. So I purchased this small bottle to be on the safe side. Luckily this was the one she like. Comes with a screw off cap and is not a spray bottle (the .25 fl. oz.). But no worries.</li>
            <li> My headline might sound absurd, but this very pretty cologne -- the most popular perfume in Ireland apparently -- is great for day wear. It is light and fresh, with mostly floral notes, but with a hint of citrus so not the least bit cloying. The .25fl.oz is great to carry in your purse.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an incredible scent --this is it! It&#x27;s a clean, crisp smell that isn&#x27;t flowery or unpleasant in any way.  I first saw this perfume while visiting Ireland and have been wearing it ever since. Purchasing it through Amazon has proven to be MUCH more affordable too. When I was ordering directly from Ireland, it was much more expensive.  Try it! You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I do not buy colognes or perfumes. I am a body lotion person. I had purchased Inis Lotion and fell in love. The problem is that I was going through it quickly. I decided to try this product hoping the smell might linger longer and take care of my problem. I did not find that it did. The smell doesn&#x27;t seem to linger in fact it disappears. I am strictly body lotion from here on out.The Inis Lotion is divine. Perhaps, I simply deserve to be slathered....</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne. It smells so clean and fresh. It reminds me of Ireland every time I put it on.</li>
            <li> I saw how many great reviews this product had, and my expectations were high. It came, and I immediately put some on!&lt;br /&gt;It smells really nice, a man or woman could wear it, though its leaning toward a man, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway when you open the top, it screws off, and it doesnt have a spray nozzle, it just has a small opening, so be careful you hold it upright when opening or it will spill out. I placed it on my wrist, turned my wrist and it upside down, then back, and I did that twice- it lasted for a good while! at least a few hours. It&#x27;s not too strong, yet its not too weak either.</li>
            <li> this is the only cologne my husband will wear and I love how it smells.  We discovered it on an anniversary retreat to St. Amillia&#x27;s Island and can only get through internet sales now.</li>
            <li> I smell like heaven. Which, in case you were wondering, smells something like the sea without all that salt and sand. Fresh. Free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a perfect travel size. I&#x27;m delighted with it and can&#x27;t wait to stow it in my TSA-approved clear plastic bag and smell heavenly everywhere I go.</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean, this is one of those rare scents that I think would smell good on almost anyone, male or female, no matter what your body chemistry is. A little goes a long way, so start with a tiny dab on your pulse points and put more on if you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on, close my eyes and I&#x27;m back on the Dingle Peninsula, standing at the tip of Sleagh Head with the sea wind in my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was super quick. I ordered on a Friday and allowing for the Monday holiday, it was here on Tuesday. I&#x27;m delighted to have it before leaving on vacation.</li>
            <li> my loves the aroma or smell ivalso see they have one for men might be ordering that for my self for xmas</li>
            <li> Four stars only because I think it should be cheaper! I borrow this from my daughter. It came with lotion, too. Very clean and crisp. Sort of like CK N2U.  Not girly or flowery, more unisex. My 18 year old daughter loves it and gets compliments on it when she wears it.</li>
            <li> Great summer fragrance, so light and clean!  Product arrived very quickly!  Very pleased with this purchase and transaction!</li>
            <li> I had seen this fragrance while we were on vacation. Ordered it to try it out and was very pleased. I love a clean, crisp scent and this certainly was one. Reminds me of the sea.</li>
            <li> Inis has a clean fresh scent.I got this travel size purchase for my 15 yr.old Grand-dqughter qnd she loves it.I have the larger size .I get many complements when I wear it.</li>
            <li> product came as promised.  Love the scent .  smells like an ocean breeze.  I would recommend this for everyone who wants a like clean scent</li>
            <li> I have loved this perfume from the moment I smelled it on my friend who purchased hers in Ireland.  I have worn it almost every day since (at least 5 years now).</li>
            <li> I have been wondering about this scent for a while and when I found this small bottle decided  it was time to give it a try.  I would call the scent breezy and earthy, not floral.  Very much like a walk on a beach.  I really like it as an everyday choice.</li>
