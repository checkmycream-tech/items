            <li>I love it....</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Such an amazing kit , ideal for beginners and prof.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t have to step a foot in a makeup department.</li>
            <li>The bronzers are actually BETTER than the bronzers I have purchased before</li>
            <li>and i love the lighter colors to set.</li>
            <li>Love it, but banana shade doesn&#x27;t show up at all.</li>
            <li>I will never use anything else! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I use it every time :)</li>
            <li>Love this kit.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many makeup combos  </li>
            <li>If anyone else noticed the things I have, I&#x27;d love to know.&lt;br /&gt;PROS</li>
            <li>It blends beautifully and naturally as well as the highlight.</li>
            <li>If you are new to makeup this is a great palette to start off with.</li>
            <li>Blends so easily and has the stay power of 8 hours or more for me.....</li>
            <li>I literally was staring at it for a good 15mins just admiring such good quality.</li>
            <li>Made my fine lines and pores more visible but please note I do not use powder often for this reason.</li>
            <li>This has helped even my skin out instead of just putting on one flat color you can tell I had make up on, but with this it just makes my skin look amazing!!</li>
            <li>I do know they have a lot more shades available</li>
            <li>It also contours very well with my fair skin.</li>
            <li>of them stay put all day and blend out easily.</li>
            <li>Nicely pigmented very blendable</li>
            <li>like we already didn&#x27;t have enough to do to our faces- lol).</li>
            <li>Such a great kit.</li>
            <li>shipped really fast and came in one piece and works amazingly</li>
            <li>A bit pricier than options out there but worth every penny!</li>
            <li>The top-left color is a perfect match for my skin, and I usually use it to set my foundation and under-eyes.</li>
            <li>Leaves such a nice smooth look!</li>
            <li>I can use every single color in this palette which makes it a great purchase for me.</li>
            <li>: try some of your own colors first before buying a whole kit for contouring.</li>
            <li>Does not take much space and works on most skin tones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true it doesn&#x27;t come with directions</li>
            <li>and this is the first I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t 1) settle into every fine line on my face 2)</li>
            <li>The tutorial on Ulta is quick and to the point.</li>
            <li>Neutral and warm deep Browns can give you a natural or more bronze look!</li>
            <li>(Highly recommend) just love 👉</li>
            <li>Pretty convenient to get it on amazon plus free 2 day shipping because of amazon prime.</li>
            <li>My new favorite thing.</li>
            <li>SO many compliments on my new makeup</li>
            <li>quite a bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fairly easy to figure out, much easier than the cream version for people unfamiliar with contour.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>Amazing Amazing Amazing, but that is expected with all her products I have never bought anything and been let down..</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>sOOOO beautiful!!!&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Well worth the price ....been using since the product came out....</li>
            <li>The makeup is high quality and goes on easily.</li>
            <li>and I just mix the colors to get them right.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten to mess around with this much yet, but I searched the colors on my hand&amp; they looked very nice.</li>
            <li>Two of the darker ones are slightly too orange for my particular skintone, but when I blend them they look great.</li>
            <li>exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>Even I. Hot humid weather.</li>
            <li>I love Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Whiz and even though it is overpriced, it is the ONLY eyebrow pencil I will use,  </li>
            <li>I really like this!</li>
            <li>I love the overall look.</li>
            <li>exactly as it looks, it&#x27;s what I ordered</li>
            <li>I got it in 2 fast days!</li>
            <li>The banana is amazing for dark circles around the eyes!</li>
            <li>came so fast.</li>
            <li>The powders are very pigmented, you don&#x27;t need lots to contour.</li>
            <li>Blends very well.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this palette to anyone!</li>
            <li>My absolute fave contour kit.....</li>
            <li>works really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient for the oily skin</li>
            <li>The receipt of the request Thanks</li>
            <li>the darker contour colors start to break up and leave my face looking really splotchy.</li>
            <li>Really like this product, except I wish it had come with a guide.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the real one before and</li>
            <li>Really liking the colors and the quality of the powders.</li>
            <li>This palette is great, but I might purchase individual colors next time if possible.</li>
            <li>I get paranoid that my product isn&#x27;t real.</li>
            <li>I really like the banana powder, but the other highlight color is more like just a powder.</li>
            <li>That being said, it will most likely be the only product I purchase from the line after trying the contour kit.  </li>
            <li>Apparently this makes my wife pretty</li>
            <li>By the time I was done getting ready the powder had already worn off, but applying lotion first may help make it last</li>
            <li>Came quick wasnt broken and I love my new contouring kit, cant wait to get anastasias new CREAM contouring kit!</li>
            <li>Only had this product a few days, but so far very satisfied</li>
            <li>I was really excited for the top-middle color for my under-eye area as I&#x27;ve heard great things about it, but it&#x27;s too dark for my skin, sadly.</li>
            <li>but I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Colors are natural looking.</li>
            <li>A little bit expensive but is a great product ;-)</li>
            <li>Can be subtle or more noticeable, and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>most of us need at least some general tips on how to contour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would warn to go light on the contours unless you like the dramatic look - they are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was disappointed with this product for the price and will stick to my preferred method of using light taupe eyeshadow and creme highlighter which provides for a much more polished contour at a drastically reduced price.</li>
            <li>High quality and just as expected</li>
            <li>Apparently the actual Anastasia website allows for custom matching for your undertone and saves you money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit tricky to learn how to apply them at first, but a few YouTube videos and you&#x27;ll get the hang of it.</li>

            <li> I love it....</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Such an amazing kit , ideal for beginners and prof.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t have to step a foot in a makeup department.</li>
            <li> The bronzers are actually BETTER than the bronzers I have purchased before</li>
            <li> and i love the lighter colors to set.</li>
            <li> Love it, but banana shade doesn&#x27;t show up at all.</li>
            <li> I will never use anything else! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I use it every time :)</li>
            <li> Love this kit.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many makeup combos  </li>
            <li> If anyone else noticed the things I have, I&#x27;d love to know.&lt;br /&gt;PROS</li>
            <li> It blends beautifully and naturally as well as the highlight.</li>
            <li> If you are new to makeup this is a great palette to start off with.</li>
            <li> Blends so easily and has the stay power of 8 hours or more for me.....</li>
            <li> I literally was staring at it for a good 15mins just admiring such good quality.</li>
            <li> Made my fine lines and pores more visible but please note I do not use powder often for this reason.</li>
            <li> This has helped even my skin out instead of just putting on one flat color you can tell I had make up on, but with this it just makes my skin look amazing!!</li>
            <li> I do know they have a lot more shades available</li>
            <li> It also contours very well with my fair skin.</li>
            <li> of them stay put all day and blend out easily.</li>
            <li> Nicely pigmented very blendable</li>
            <li> like we already didn&#x27;t have enough to do to our faces- lol).</li>
            <li> Such a great kit.</li>
            <li> shipped really fast and came in one piece and works amazingly</li>
            <li> A bit pricier than options out there but worth every penny!</li>
            <li> The top-left color is a perfect match for my skin, and I usually use it to set my foundation and under-eyes.</li>
            <li> Leaves such a nice smooth look!</li>
            <li> I can use every single color in this palette which makes it a great purchase for me.</li>
            <li> : try some of your own colors first before buying a whole kit for contouring.</li>
            <li> Does not take much space and works on most skin tones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true it doesn&#x27;t come with directions</li>
            <li> and this is the first I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t 1) settle into every fine line on my face 2)</li>
            <li> The tutorial on Ulta is quick and to the point.</li>
            <li> Neutral and warm deep Browns can give you a natural or more bronze look!</li>
            <li> (Highly recommend) just love 👉</li>
            <li> Pretty convenient to get it on amazon plus free 2 day shipping because of amazon prime.</li>
            <li> My new favorite thing.</li>
            <li> SO many compliments on my new makeup</li>
            <li> quite a bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fairly easy to figure out, much easier than the cream version for people unfamiliar with contour.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing Amazing Amazing, but that is expected with all her products I have never bought anything and been let down..</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> sOOOO beautiful!!!&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Well worth the price ....been using since the product came out....</li>
            <li> The makeup is high quality and goes on easily.</li>
            <li> and I just mix the colors to get them right.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten to mess around with this much yet, but I searched the colors on my hand&amp; they looked very nice.</li>
            <li> Two of the darker ones are slightly too orange for my particular skintone, but when I blend them they look great.</li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> Even I. Hot humid weather.</li>
            <li> I love Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Whiz and even though it is overpriced, it is the ONLY eyebrow pencil I will use,  </li>
            <li> I really like this!</li>
            <li> I love the overall look.</li>
            <li> exactly as it looks, it&#x27;s what I ordered</li>
            <li> I got it in 2 fast days!</li>
            <li> The banana is amazing for dark circles around the eyes!</li>
            <li> came so fast.</li>
            <li> The powders are very pigmented, you don&#x27;t need lots to contour.</li>
            <li> Blends very well.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this palette to anyone!</li>
            <li> My absolute fave contour kit.....</li>
            <li> works really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient for the oily skin</li>
            <li> The receipt of the request Thanks</li>
            <li> the darker contour colors start to break up and leave my face looking really splotchy.</li>
            <li> Really like this product, except I wish it had come with a guide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the real one before and</li>
            <li> Really liking the colors and the quality of the powders.</li>
            <li> This palette is great, but I might purchase individual colors next time if possible.</li>
            <li> I get paranoid that my product isn&#x27;t real.</li>
            <li> I really like the banana powder, but the other highlight color is more like just a powder.</li>
            <li> That being said, it will most likely be the only product I purchase from the line after trying the contour kit.  </li>
            <li> Apparently this makes my wife pretty</li>
            <li> By the time I was done getting ready the powder had already worn off, but applying lotion first may help make it last</li>
            <li> Came quick wasnt broken and I love my new contouring kit, cant wait to get anastasias new CREAM contouring kit!</li>
            <li> Only had this product a few days, but so far very satisfied</li>
            <li> I was really excited for the top-middle color for my under-eye area as I&#x27;ve heard great things about it, but it&#x27;s too dark for my skin, sadly.</li>
            <li> but I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Colors are natural looking.</li>
            <li> A little bit expensive but is a great product ;-)</li>
            <li> Can be subtle or more noticeable, and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> most of us need at least some general tips on how to contour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would warn to go light on the contours unless you like the dramatic look - they are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was disappointed with this product for the price and will stick to my preferred method of using light taupe eyeshadow and creme highlighter which provides for a much more polished contour at a drastically reduced price.</li>
            <li> High quality and just as expected</li>
            <li> Apparently the actual Anastasia website allows for custom matching for your undertone and saves you money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit tricky to learn how to apply them at first, but a few YouTube videos and you&#x27;ll get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Seems like it lasts a very long time, I use it daily</li>
            <li> The size is smaller than what expected</li>
            <li> The product is long wearing also.</li>
            <li> only negative is that its hard to get your hands on &amp; goes out of stock quickly</li>
            <li> The lighter shades seemed to not make a difference at all, other than make my skin look dry.  </li>
            <li> As expected....</li>
            <li> not all the colors are useful and again this is a expensive way to try a color out.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m curious.</li>
            <li> Smh shame on me for not reading the other ratings</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only bought Anastasia brow prods in past--</li>
            <li> I can remove the tins to transfer to other palettes if I desire.</li>
            <li> And the top-right is just to glittery and odd for me</li>
            <li> It does not provide a heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> I do notice after a few hours it needs to be touched up or els</li>
            <li> the browns are too orange for my pale skin.</li>
            <li> In the begining I thought its fake then later</li>
            <li> Also I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have been lazy to go to a store and rest it out.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t crazy about the rest of the color because I only used three.</li>
            <li> so maybe I&#x27;m just being a bit negative for no reason.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 and one of them was broken !</li>
            <li> Fake -.-</li>
            <li> I felt that it made my face appear dirty.  </li>
            <li> how disappointing.</li>
            <li> so it makes me break out :(</li>
            <li> OBSESSED!!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I thought this was cream-based.</li>
            <li> came so fast. exactly what i wanted. love it</li>
            <li> I now know why it is so popular. This is a great kit and it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love this palette for contouring. Every time I tried to get it at Ulta it was always sold out. Very good quality and pigmented. Pretty convenient to get it on amazon plus free 2 day shipping because of amazon prime. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great powder contour kit!</li>
            <li> I just received my package today &amp;&#x27; I&#x27;m in love!!!! the only reason im giving a 4 star because I haven&#x27;t used the actual product but I love the quality of the kit!</li>
            <li> I had to return the kit because it was in pieces .</li>
            <li> I like the contouring but I have sensitive skin so it makes me break out :(</li>
            <li> High quality and just as expected</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect it , there is better than it</li>
            <li> nice palette. fulfilled my expectations.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!! Perfect seller!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing Amazing Amazing, but that is expected with all her products I have never bought anything and been let down.. The colours in here are great for contouring light to medium skin tones.. I do know they have a lot more shades available and you are able to build your own kits also.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!! Great quality looks espectacular, sets well on my skin 🙌🏼 definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Best contour kit I have ever owned. My experience with this product is amazing. The powders are very pigmented, you don&#x27;t need lots to contour. It does not provide a heavy feeling. Colors are natural looking. I hae fair skin and I get lots of compliments with this product.</li>
            <li> Came quick wasnt broken and I love my new contouring kit, cant wait to get anastasias new CREAM contouring kit!</li>
            <li> I love this kit! The makeup is high quality and goes on easily. It also contours very well with my fair skin. It does not irritate my skin. I will be recommending this to all my friends and look forward to trying more of their products!</li>
            <li> This is NOT the cream pallette!</li>
            <li> Product is superb I know that but not delivered to me</li>
            <li> Nicely pigmented very blendable</li>
            <li> A little bit expensive but is a great product ;-)</li>
            <li> I heard about this through Jaclyn Hill youtuber. I am using this contour kit daily. I love the highlighting powder as well as the contour powders. The palette is a larger palette each powder color is 1.5&amp;#34;-2&amp;#34; across. Regular size. Worth every penny. Then when finished I follow it with Urban Decay All Nighter finishing spray. It stays all day. Even I. Hot humid weather.</li>
            <li> I love Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Whiz and even though it is overpriced, it is the ONLY eyebrow pencil I will use,  That being said, it will most likely be the only product I purchase from the line after trying the contour kit.  I&#x27;m very fair and this contour kit which is intended for fair skinned individuals is too orange and muddy to be deemed a good fit for fair skinned people like myself. I felt that it made my face appear dirty.  The lighter shades seemed to not make a difference at all, other than make my skin look dry.  Overall, I was disappointed with this product for the price and will stick to my preferred method of using light taupe eyeshadow and creme highlighter which provides for a much more polished contour at a drastically reduced price.</li>
            <li> Not so great. Could of been better.</li>
            <li> Apparently this makes my wife pretty so I was bribed into getting it for her.</li>
            <li> Great condition! I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> A perfect gift for any makeup lover .. My wife loved it</li>
            <li> love this contour kit! i&#x27;m able to match to my skin without looking orange. very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> As expected.... Good for contour and highlight... But you will need a good concealor for the highlighting areas. just the lighter colors wont do the trick.</li>
            <li> Its ok .. Not that pigmented ..</li>
            <li> I really like this! It&#x27;s a bit darker than I anticipated in the highlight colors anyway. I really like the banana powder, but the other highlight color is more like just a powder. Two of the darker ones are slightly too orange for my particular skintone, but when I blend them they look great. It&#x27;s a bit tricky to learn how to apply them at first, but a few YouTube videos and you&#x27;ll get the hang of it. I love the overall look. Make sure you use a primer with this. I would definitely buy this again. Great product!</li>
            <li> works wonders if you know what you&#x27;re doing</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Nice pigmentation. Blends easily.&lt;br /&gt;Colors as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> My new favorite thing.</li>
            <li> Product was very gritty to touch. Did not go on good and made my face itch.</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this palette</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 and one of them was broken !</li>
            <li> So easy to use!  Blends very well.  A bit pricier than options out there but worth every penny! (And this coming from a woman who loves a bargain).  The best part is that the pallet has a diverse array of colors, so you can also take care of your highlighting and your strobing (which I guess is the thing now... like we already didn&#x27;t have enough to do to our faces- lol).</li>
            <li> I was waiting for creamy product&lt;br /&gt;i found it in powder????</li>
            <li> This palette is sold out everywhere. So when I saw it was on Amazon AND it was Prime eligible. I knew I had to order it.&lt;br /&gt;The highlighter color is sOOOO beautiful!!!&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this palette to anyone! If you are new to makeup this is a great palette to start off with. It has contour AND bronzing up the face colors and a highlighter. there is even a highlighter with no shimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Just saying..</li>
            <li> GRATE product but you can get this at ulta for $40</li>
            <li> i love this contour kit tbh!!!</li>
            <li> No too  impress.. Quality ok.</li>
            <li> I love it....but Sephora&lt;br /&gt;has it $40</li>
            <li> Great and worked as described.</li>
            <li> My absolute fave contour kit..... Well worth the price ....been using since the product came out.... Blends so easily and has the stay power of 8 hours or more for me..... Would buy over and over again....</li>
            <li> Very nice kit for my travelling makeup bag and to use on myself. Does not take much space and works on most skin tones. Good texture and colour a quality product.</li>
            <li> i use this daily for contouring and highlighting. works really well. good pigmentation and color.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! I love this product! Great colors and wonderful pigments! Fast sipping and great packaging! I wish it came with an instruction guide...but she has one on her website.</li>
            <li> El mejor kit de contour para maquillaje a mis clientas y para mi...buen producto..siempre compro productos de Anastasia Beverly Hills....</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this brand!</li>
            <li> this contour kit is amazing !!  I heard a lot of praise about it so I encouraged to buy it . It&#x27;s very convenient for the oily skin so I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product, great service!</li>
            <li> The receipt of the request Thanks</li>
            <li> exactly as it looks, it&#x27;s what I ordered (Highly recommend) just love 👉</li>
            <li> Made my fine lines and pores more visible but please note I do not use powder often for this reason. It won&#x27;t deter me from trying the cream version of the product.</li>
            <li> really love this palette! I do notice after a few hours it needs to be touched up or els the darker contour colors start to break up and leave my face looking really splotchy. I can use every single color in this palette which makes it a great purchase for me.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!! I literally was staring at it for a good 15mins just admiring such good quality. All the colors are perfect for my skintone the banana is my favorite for under the eyes, and I Mix the three bronze shades for my Contour. I love it.</li>
            <li> OBSESSED!!!! best contour kit I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> beautiful finish &amp; love that its all in one pallet. only negative is that its hard to get your hands on &amp; goes out of stock quickly</li>
            <li> Such an amazing kit , ideal for beginners and prof. As well has all the right shades to provide the best cotouring results :)) worth waiting !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t have to step a foot in a makeup department. My girlfriend got what she wanted. All good.</li>
            <li> I watched a tutorial on you tube! Looks great! Love these products!</li>
            <li> The size is smaller than what expected</li>
            <li> Amazing contouring kit and also looks great worth the money</li>
            <li> It was a gift... they loved it... i loved it for them</li>
            <li> In the begining I thought its fake then later I knew Anastasia changed their cover ! Thank you nice one </li>
            <li> I like this palette quite a bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fairly easy to figure out, much easier than the cream version for people unfamiliar with contour. The bronzers are actually BETTER than the bronzers I have purchased before and i love the lighter colors to set. Seems like it lasts a very long time, I use it daily and I haven&#x27;t made a dent.</li>
            <li> I love it!! This has helped even my skin out instead of just putting on one flat color you can tell I had make up on, but with this it just makes my skin look amazing!!</li>
            <li> Love it, but banana shade doesn&#x27;t show up at all.</li>
            <li> It is honestly THE best contore kit I&#x27;ve ever used. It blends beautifully and naturally as well as the highlight. I will never use anything else! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work out but Amazon was great</li>
            <li> Love it. The pigment is amazing .</li>
            <li> Love Anastasia! The banana colour is perfect for under the eyes</li>
            <li> Really like this product, except I wish it had come with a guide. However, I found several &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; videos on You Tube. Only had this product a few days, but so far very satisfied</li>
            <li> Fake -.- how disappointing. I&#x27;ve had the real one before and this is just disrespectful what is this??? Smh shame on me for not reading the other ratings</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with this product. I use it every time :)</li>
            <li> Excellent seller, highly recommended +++++A</li>
            <li> I regret purchasing this product from Amazon... the browns are too orange for my pale skin. Apparently the actual Anastasia website allows for custom matching for your undertone and saves you money. Would return if I could.</li>
            <li> Such a great kit. Really liking the colors and the quality of the powders. Can be subtle or more noticeable, and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Love this kit. I&#x27;m fair skinned and I just mix the colors to get them right. It&#x27;s true it doesn&#x27;t come with directions but there are plenty of tutorials on UTube about using it. The best tutorial I found was on the Ulta website. Contouring is a personal preference and everyone does it differently. The tutorial on Ulta is quick and to the point. Shows the best way to blend . I&#x27;ve not had as problem with it not lasting.</li>
            <li> I love this Anastasia contour kit!!!! I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stop staring at it once I received it! It&#x27;s gorgeous! And the shipping, was amazing! I got it in 2 fast days!</li>
            <li> Beautiful contour kit. SO many compliments on my new makeup</li>
            <li> This palette is great, but I might purchase individual colors next time if possible. The top-left color is a perfect match for my skin, and I usually use it to set my foundation and under-eyes. I was really excited for the top-middle color for my under-eye area as I&#x27;ve heard great things about it, but it&#x27;s too dark for my skin, sadly. And the top-right is just to glittery and odd for me personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I love all of the contour colors! I use them on different days, depending on how I&#x27;m feeling and how the rest of my makeup looks. I don&#x27;t think I have a favorite out of the three, as they all look great in their own way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of them stay put all day and blend out easily. I would warn to go light on the contours unless you like the dramatic look - they are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I splurged on this item! I have tried so many makeup combos  and this is the first I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t 1) settle into every fine line on my face 2) wear off within 2 hours. the colors are so great! I love all of them! Neutral and warm deep Browns can give you a natural or more bronze look! The banana is amazing for dark circles around the eyes! Leaves such a nice smooth look!</li>
            <li> shipped really fast and came in one piece and works amazingly will deff be buying the darker contour for my kit</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t crazy about the rest of the color because I only used three.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit.  Lots of colors so it would be alright for almost everyone.  The product is long wearing also.</li>
            <li> Cons&lt;br /&gt;1. way over priced because its not coverage that will last long.&lt;br /&gt;2. not all the colors are useful and again this is a expensive way to try a color out.&lt;br /&gt;3. no directions included. most of us need at least some general tips on how to contour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a powder that just doesn&#x27;t last. By the time I was done getting ready the powder had already worn off, but applying lotion first may help make it last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tip: try some of your own colors first before buying a whole kit for contouring. you might be albe to find similar colors in your eye shadows, counselors, blush, seasonal foundation and bronzers.</li>
            <li> I just received this today, and I&#x27;m wondering why my product looked like the packaging had been tampered with. The protective sleeve looked so scratched. They have stickers on outside of case, names of colors of powders. They are placed as if they are in order of how they are lined up in case, but if the &amp;#34;banana&amp;#34; color is what it&#x27;s labeled as--it&#x27;s not. (As I&#x27;m writing this, MAYBE I should use my brain&amp; take the tin out&amp; check the back...oh how the mind starts to work)...so maybe I&#x27;m just being a bit negative for no reason. I get paranoid that my product isn&#x27;t real. I&#x27;ve only bought Anastasia brow prods in past--so I&#x27;m curious. If anyone else noticed the things I have, I&#x27;d love to know.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: packaging itself was sturdy, like the mirror in the compact, but I like that I can remove the tins to transfer to other palettes if I desire. I haven&#x27;t gotten to mess around with this much yet, but I searched the colors on my hand&amp; they looked very nice.</li>
            <li> Me Wife love it and love me more!! Lol</li>
            <li> Beware there maybe a double charge. Also I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have been lazy to go to a store and rest it out. I would have gone with Kat Von D palette instead.</li>
