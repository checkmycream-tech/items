            <li>Wish it came in more colors.</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to the photo.  </li>
            <li>Will buy more</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>(my husband and I are really into vintage), but it worked great as well.</li>
            <li>So I thought ok then I&#x27;ll use it for children</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t so sure about the pattern.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my boyfriend who is a barber, he is going to love this.</li>
            <li>and I love the look</li>
            <li>price is surprisingly low considering how well it&#x27;s made, how well it works, and how happy I am with it!</li>
            <li>I have to sew more snaps on myself.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a great value and has worked well so far.</li>
            <li>THIS WAS A  GOOD PURCHASE FOR ME, REASONABLE PRICING.  </li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>These are very big and great quality, will probably buy 10 more from this person.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to any one</li>
            <li>: The back is shorter than the front as most barber capes are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this cape.  </li>
            <li>So far I have not disappointed with this product, it is good as advertise, happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This makes a great gift or quality enough for the salon..</li>
            <li>, it is nice and masculine looking for him.</li>
            <li>Overall it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>This is sturdy, full, and looks cool.  </li>
            <li>Great material and looks sharp.</li>
            <li>Smooth transaction, fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with this item, however, once hair clippings get on it</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband who is a barber and he REALLY likes it!!</li>
            <li>I bought them for a friend and the cape is salon quality for sure, plus the design is good for either male or female clients.</li>
            <li>How cute with the old time barber stuff on them</li>
            <li>this cape really is nice and has snaps on the back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars for nice quality of fabric/construction, but I&#x27;m sending it back because I don&#x27;t want to be tempted to give my husband a mullet.</li>
            <li>Just like the use in the fancy salons, hair slides right off and rarely needs laundering.</li>
            <li>Out side of that its fun to look at and the price is right.</li>
            <li>it is waterproof and lightweight and has several snaps to fit comfortably around the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons...</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>light weight, doesnt attract hair, and it fits my 4 year old.</li>
            <li>Love these hair cloths are made well, made to last.</li>
            <li>The snaps are not lined up close enough to adjust to most necks.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if the material would be super flimsy like other capes I&#x27;ve purchased online.</li>
            <li>it does exactly what i need it to, but I really like the look for this.</li>
            <li>This cape was exactly the one used by my real barber.  </li>
            <li>The multiple snaps allow easy adjusting for all sizes.</li>
            <li>After a couple years of draping towels over myself so my daughter could cut my hair, I got smart and ordered a barber&#x27;s cape.  </li>
            <li>very durable and holding up in the wash</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and was out into use the day it arrived.</li>
            <li>I really like the cape...</li>
            <li>Thanks...</li>
            <li>Fast shipping...</li>
            <li>not so much if you want to cut the person&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li>Very professiona, recommended</li>
            <li>Looks awesome and fits perfect but it has a positive charge which causes the hair clippings to cling on making it crazy impossible to get off.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s due to static cling.  </li>
            <li>Still silky smooth and showing no major signs of wear and tear.  </li>
            <li>The back part sits at or barely covers the top of the chair.</li>
            <li>Perhaps this doesn&#x27;t matter as much at barber shops (or they actually use a different material), but I found most of the hair stuck on the cape due to static.  </li>
            <li>This style cape can help a barber take his image to a New Level!  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and wS exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I would highly rev omens this cape for</li>
            <li>Very intrigued by all the old time barber products depicted on the cape.</li>
            <li>The material of this cape is nice, but the image is misleading--it looks like it comes down to this guy&#x27;s hands, but his arms must be bent (or maybe he has REALLY short arms)--I put this on my husband and the sides of the cape</li>
            <li>This looks very professional.</li>
            <li>I am a barber and a stylist and I purchased this for men&#x27;s cuts only and the fit is absolutely not working for me.</li>
            <li>I got this Barber Cape for when I cut my 8 year old son&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>The neck hole should be in the center of the fabric, and the fabric should be more of a square, but it&#x27;s a long rectangle and the neck hole is only about 8-12 inches from one end.</li>
            <li>It is quite long in the front for a 8 year old but it hasn&#x27;t caused any issues and I expect I will like the length when he gets older.  </li>
            <li>It big enough to cover the whole body...</li>
            <li>It does not drape far enough over the chair to protect the clients clothes from hair.  </li>
            <li>The clippings even worked their way around to the underside, which renders it kind of useless until you can remove them.  </li>
            <li>every 2 inches, HINT: wrap a small towel around the neck first to ensure no hair will pass!</li>
            <li>High quality cripsp print doesn&#x27;t look cheap or cheesy.  </li>

            <li> every 2 inches, HINT: wrap a small towel around the neck first to ensure no hair will pass!</li>
            <li> High quality cripsp print doesn&#x27;t look cheap or cheesy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long enough in the front, but short in the back where it buttons around the neck letting hair land on the back of shirts, etc.  </li>
            <li> its just, I wish back side is long too so it covers all area not just front side.  </li>
            <li> Long enough for us tall people and sturdy, too.</li>
            <li> I often find myself turning it around so the long part covers the back.</li>
            <li> It fits all neck size and it&#x27;s long enough to cover tall people.</li>
            <li> Long enough to keep your pants \\&quot;hair-free.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> A complete waste</li>
            <li> It sets it apart at the salon so it doesn&#x27;t get mixed in with the other stylist capes.</li>
            <li> So as you can imagine cut hair goes down the back and that won&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> so no hair goes down your back.  </li>
            <li> Not only does this cutting cape look cool</li>
            <li> I would have preferred a solid black pattern but went for this one based on price and the reviews.  </li>
            <li> This does make home haircuts less messy, but I do wish it was the same length all the way around.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t even come down to his elbows (and he&#x27;s fairly average height).</li>
            <li> This is not ok for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past 6 months on both my 4 year-old and my husband.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the usual cape you see in a barbershop.</li>
            <li> so I use this cape all day but its just to small for some of my clients.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves to look at cape but its thin and a bit on the small side.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Beats putting a towel around his shoulders while cutting his hair.</li>
            <li> Unhappy.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost impossible to remove them.  </li>

            <li> very durable and holding up in the wash</li>
            <li> I have been a hair stylist for 11years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros are...i love the pattern on this cape. It sets it apart at the salon so it doesn&#x27;t get mixed in with the other stylist capes. it is waterproof and lightweight and has several snaps to fit comfortably around the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons... it&#x27;s too short in the back. It does not drape far enough over the chair to protect the clients clothes from hair.  This is not ok for me. I would not purchase another one for this reason alone.</li>
            <li> I bought them for a friend and the cape is salon quality for sure, plus the design is good for either male or female clients.</li>
            <li> Good quality product. Hairs do not stick to the material. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Very nice! Just what I needed!  Perfect !</li>
            <li> Just what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past 6 months on both my 4 year-old and my husband.  The snaps around the neck can accommodate for both widths of their necks.  Still silky smooth and showing no major signs of wear and tear.  Definitely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great nice size....and durable......</li>
            <li> its just, I wish back side is long too so it covers all area not just front side.  they picture do not show back side so....</li>
            <li> We like the fabric instead of vinyl (my hubby was sweating in the vinyl one) and the print of vintage barber items is very nice. We&#x27;re happy with our purchase.</li>
            <li> I love these capes! How cute with the old time barber stuff on them &amp; I&#x27;ve never seen them in my supply places. My clients in assisted living will think these are great. The snap closures are the best! I cannot wait to take them to work! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great cape, with a great design</li>
            <li> This style cape can help a barber take his image to a New Level!  It&#x27;s not the usual cape you see in a barbershop.</li>
            <li> it catches the eye but don&#x27;t buy it caz i have it.  watch ur self</li>
            <li> Looks awesome and fits perfect but it has a positive charge which causes the hair clippings to cling on making it crazy impossible to get off. I&#x27;ve tried placing it in the dryer with dryer sheets and...no luck.</li>
            <li> Awesome barber cape. Long enough for us tall people and sturdy, too. Shipped fast and was out into use the day it arrived.</li>
            <li> Smooth transaction, fast delivery!  Overall I am very pleased with this item, however, once hair clippings get on it it&#x27;s almost impossible to remove them.  The clippings even worked their way around to the underside, which renders it kind of useless until you can remove them.  I think it&#x27;s due to static cling.  I&#x27;m going to try washing and using plenty of fabric softener on it.  Hopefully this will solve the problem.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Item just as described!</li>
            <li> Very nicely made, looks good too.  I only give 4 stars, because I was expecting the cape length all around, but the cape is short in the back.</li>
            <li> it does exactly what i need it to, but I really like the look for this. Wish it came in more colors.</li>
            <li> This does make home haircuts less messy, but I do wish it was the same length all the way around.  I should have paid more attention to the photo.  It&#x27;s long enough in the front, but short in the back where it buttons around the neck letting hair land on the back of shirts, etc.  I often find myself turning it around so the long part covers the back.</li>
            <li> my wife cuts my hair and trims my beard. this cape really is nice and has snaps on the back. easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great cape excellent around the neck area great hair catcher. Item is very good worth every penny. Will buy more</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if the material would be super flimsy like other capes I&#x27;ve purchased online. Great material and I love the design!</li>
            <li> I really like the cape...My customer like it too. It big enough to cover the whole body...Really happy to buy the product..Thanks...Fast shipping...</li>
            <li> So far I have not disappointed with this product, it is good as advertise, happy with it so far. ok</li>
            <li> These are very big and great quality, will probably buy 10 more from this person.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to any one</li>
            <li> Looks awesome, the clasps and buttons work well and have a good variety of sizes for different sized necks.&lt;br /&gt;Fits well on everyone I&#x27;ve used the cape with.</li>
            <li> Not only does this cutting cape look cool (my husband and I are really into vintage), but it worked great as well. Beats putting a towel around his shoulders while cutting his hair. This looks very professional.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great material and looks sharp.</li>
            <li> Great Product......wife liked</li>
            <li> it does the job perfectly</li>
            <li> does what its suppose to do at a very good price!</li>
            <li> I am a barber and a stylist and I purchased this for men&#x27;s cuts only and the fit is absolutely not working for me. The back part sits at or barely covers the top of the chair. So as you can imagine cut hair goes down the back and that won&#x27;t work for me. So I thought ok then I&#x27;ll use it for children but the snaps are not close enough so it&#x27;s way too big for children. A complete waste and I&#x27;m not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great cape !!!I was very pleased !!!</li>
            <li> I got this Barber Cape for when I cut my 8 year old son&#x27;s hair.  It has a quality feel to it and it has several snaps so it adjusts to different neck sizes.  It is quite long in the front for a 8 year old but it hasn&#x27;t caused any issues and I expect I will like the length when he gets older.  I wasn&#x27;t so sure about the pattern.  I would have preferred a solid black pattern but went for this one based on price and the reviews.  I think it looks nicer in person than it does on the picture and the pattern is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note: The back is shorter than the front as most barber capes are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this cape.  I think it&#x27;s a great value and has worked well so far.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend who is a barber, he is going to love this. The material is really nice and I love the look, it is nice and masculine looking for him.</li>
            <li> Great cape for the price. It fits all neck size and it&#x27;s long enough to cover tall people. Overall it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> As advertised, works great.</li>
            <li> After a couple years of draping towels over myself so my daughter could cut my hair, I got smart and ordered a barber&#x27;s cape.  It&#x27;s one of those things you buy that you kick yourself for not getting one earlier...  This is sturdy, full, and looks cool.  Adjustable neck snaps from \\&quot;loose\\&quot; to \\&quot;strangle\\&quot; so no hair goes down your back.  Long enough to keep your pants \\&quot;hair-free.\\&quot;  And the pattern looks great, not wimpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is surprisingly low considering how well it&#x27;s made, how well it works, and how happy I am with it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who is a barber and he REALLY likes it!! It&#x27;s great quality and looks just like the picture! Great product would buy again! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> THIS WAS A  GOOD PURCHASE FOR ME, REASONABLE PRICING.  THE ART WORK ON IT IS EXCELLENT AND I RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE INTHE BUSSINESS!</li>
            <li> Very intrigued by all the old time barber products depicted on the cape. The multiple snaps allow easy adjusting for all sizes.</li>
            <li> light weight, doesnt attract hair, and it fits my 4 year old. perfect.</li>
            <li> This was a Big Hit..very well made, and totally looks vintage. This makes a great gift or quality enough for the salon..</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and wS exactly what I expected. I would highly rev omens this cape for it&#x27;s quality and style.</li>
            <li> Nice cutting cape, cleans up well.</li>
            <li> Good material. Good length.</li>
            <li> Love these hair cloths are made well, made to last. Are great for work &amp; wash up well.</li>
            <li> The material of this cape is nice, but the image is misleading--it looks like it comes down to this guy&#x27;s hands, but his arms must be bent (or maybe he has REALLY short arms)--I put this on my husband and the sides of the cape didn&#x27;t even come down to his elbows (and he&#x27;s fairly average height). The cape also hangs open in the back, so you only get about six inches of coverage on the person&#x27;s back.  The neck hole should be in the center of the fabric, and the fabric should be more of a square, but it&#x27;s a long rectangle and the neck hole is only about 8-12 inches from one end. GREAT if you just cut bangs or mullets... not so much if you want to cut the person&#x27;s hair all the way around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars for nice quality of fabric/construction, but I&#x27;m sending it back because I don&#x27;t want to be tempted to give my husband a mullet.</li>
            <li> CONVERSATIONS starter</li>
            <li> The snaps are not lined up close enough to adjust to most necks.  Unhappy.  I have to sew more snaps on myself.</li>
            <li> This cape was exactly the one used by my real barber.  Didn&#x27;t use it yet, but the material and fit seem good.  Arrived in a timely fashion with good packaging.</li>
            <li> This is one gorgeous cape.  High quality cripsp print doesn&#x27;t look cheap or cheesy.  Shorter back flaps, but that is standard for barbering capes.  Nice weight and material as well.</li>
            <li> My barber had the white colored version of this so I knew it would be good quality. Looks good, good material and quality.</li>
            <li> Just like the use in the fancy salons, hair slides right off and rarely needs laundering. Print helps to hide spots from dying and or bleaching. Adjustable neck sizes using snaps every 2 inches, HINT: wrap a small towel around the neck first to ensure no hair will pass! Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Everyone loves to look at cape but its thin and a bit on the small side. I&#x27;m a barber so I use this cape all day but its just to small for some of my clients. Out side of that its fun to look at and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this doesn&#x27;t matter as much at barber shops (or they actually use a different material), but I found most of the hair stuck on the cape due to static.  Otherwise, it works as intended.</li>
            <li> Very professiona, recommended</li>
