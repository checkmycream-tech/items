            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get the client back wet.</li>
            <li> There was water on the floor, down the client&#x27;s back.  </li>
            <li> It does help, but finding the right height of chair is difficult.</li>
            <li> Other than that, awsome product.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer that the unit be bent downward about 3-4 inches past the neck area so that the client doesn&#x27;t have to feel as though they have to lean back.</li>
            <li> It did not fit under arms like instructed,but works well to do the job even from a wheelchair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I usually just tell my client to tilt their neck downward a bit and that seems to help.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product at all, not enough neck room for the client</li>
            <li> Big let down. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awkward (and wet) trying to keep the tray against my neck while I raise my arms to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find anything that will work well.</li>
            <li> When wetting the hairline it puts client in weird position that causes tention in the neck.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the neck opening size.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving 4 stars is because I wish the tray had a rubber grip on bottom of tray to keep from sliding. When wetting the hairline it puts client in weird position that causes tention in the neck. Other than that, awsome product.  I use it for my clients I take out of my home. So recommend  for home or moble salon use.</li>
            <li> I have been wheelchair bound for many months and unable to get to the salon or wash my hair.  I ordered this and we tried it and we both really liked it.  Keeps all the water in the tray.  My stylist told one of her co-workers about the tray and she borrowed it to help finish a perm on an elderly stroke-victim.</li>
            <li> I have a home salon and this has been a great addition. I would prefer that the unit be bent downward about 3-4 inches past the neck area so that the client doesn&#x27;t have to feel as though they have to lean back. Even though it&#x27;s meant to not have to lean backward, you still need to so that it creates a good seal at the neck so that washing at the nape is easier. I usually just tell my client to tilt their neck downward a bit and that seems to help. Great product overall.</li>
            <li> As a professional stylist,  I was looking for something for our aging clients. This product did not preform well. There was water on the floor, down the client&#x27;s back.  It is very hard to find anything that will work well. This will not.</li>
            <li> It works great!!! Very pleased.....</li>
            <li> It does help, but finding the right height of chair is difficult. I don&#x27;t see hoe anyone could sit in a wheelchair and this work... the wheels of the chair protrude to far back to back up far enough to any sink. It does get the back wet as it doesn&#x27;t fit around my moms neck. Still use it though.</li>
            <li> The tray is made of strong lightweight material, but of good quality, and works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anyone who needs help washing their hair.</li>
            <li> Very functional especially with people in wheelchairs.  The people on wheelchairs cannot get up nor can they tilt their neck backwards.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do what I expected</li>
            <li> The product was fine.  It just didn&#x27;t work for us because my daughter is in a wheel chair and the tray didn&#x27;t fit between the push arms in the back.</li>
            <li> this is good for kitchen hair. I used it once on a client it is very convenient. ummm ... ... that&#x27;s all</li>
            <li> Love this tray worked so well when I wad washing my sisters hair she fell asleep ..lol said it relt so good she couldn&#x27;t help herself since she has trouble leanimg all the way back</li>
            <li> all products are wonderful they all work so well together. And they are all quality well made</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the neck opening size. It just fits my son&#x27;s neck. I bought it for my mother who is in a wheelchair and it doesn&#x27;t come close to fitting right against her neck. Water everywhere. Big let down. :(</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product at all, not enough neck room for the client</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really work for me. Water went everywhere.</li>
            <li> I love this product ;), I used the first time and I liked it a lot .</li>
            <li> Great invention for long hair washing!</li>
            <li> Good product, my daughter is enjoying it!</li>
            <li> The groove opening for the neck doesn&#x27;t fit snug, so water runs down the neck, wet up the patient, and water all over the floor. Apparently, they didn&#x27;t test the product before putting out there.</li>
            <li> When I tried to wash a wheelchair bound persons hair without this it was too much of a strain for her. In chair,at sink,EASY</li>
            <li> A very good product overall.It did not fit under arms like instructed,but works well to do the job even from a wheelchair.</li>
            <li> There are days when I can&#x27;t make it into the shower, so I bought this to help me use the sink instead of leaning over the tub. It&#x27;s awkward (and wet) trying to keep the tray against my neck while I raise my arms to wash my hair. I still use it because it&#x27;s a better option.  I know it wasn&#x27;t designed for use this way so I can&#x27;t fault it. It works very well when someone is washing my hair for me.  Inventors out there....make a tray for someone who wants to wash their own hair!</li>
            <li> Works well for my needs. Especially with a reclining salon chair.</li>
            <li> Most of my clients are in wheel chairs, and this product works great to get the hair shampooed. It doesn&#x27;t get the client back wet. It works with all type of chairs. The client can hold the front straps for tension. All around a great product.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful for an aging person who won&#x27;t bend their head back as easily.  It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Helpful! Makes life easier.</li>
            <li> whoever came up with this, needs to rethink.Don&#x27;t waste your money. not like the picture. water goes everywhere plus hurts the neck.</li>
            <li> Really wok in out. Great product.</li>
            <li> not quite secure enough to keep water from running down neck area,</li>
            <li> Was not worth the price and didn&#x27;t work very well. Would work better if it had some give to it.</li>
            <li> It has made my work so much easier very handy love it and so does the client&#x27;s however I can see that it works best with a hydraulic chair which I have.:-)</li>
            <li> It is very good item for clients that cannot normal receive shampoo keeps clients clothes dry and client comfort is great.</li>
            <li> This product was obtained for an older woman who had difficulty getting her hair washed. It has met the need in fine fashion.</li>
