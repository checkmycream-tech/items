            <li>Moist, but not messy.</li>
            <li>Put it on daily like suggested and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>All of a sudden it is harder to find this blue tube Original Formula.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> This was a heck of a deal. The original formula is great. Not greasy. This size is perfect for traveling. Not too small. Lasts a lot longer than the smaller sizes available.</li>
            <li> I gave been purchasing curel for many years and i really love it.  it is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> The is the one Curel product I like and use.  There is a white tube that some sites are trying to push as being the Original Formula and they are NOT the same.  The white tube is a tad greasy. Not as bad as some of their other lotions, but it IS greasier than the blue tube Original Formula.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product a 5 star is that for some reason they have jacked the price way up there!  I have 6oz tubes that I bought at Walmart last year and they were under $4.00 each.  All of a sudden it is harder to find this blue tube Original Formula.  Why is that?</li>
            <li> I want to order again! Although, it&#x27;s fair warning to say that this feels more watery than normal lotion. But it does moisturize without making me feel oiled up.</li>
            <li> great product that works as good as the premium moisturizers at the department stores at a fraction of the price..  A basic necessity for me..</li>
            <li> Got this free so you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> I keep a tube of this lotion in my desk at work, and it comes in especially handy in the winter when everything dries-out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is non-greasy, absorbs quickly, has no heavy fragrance, and is great for dry, rough or chapped skin.  This product claims to be gentle enough to use on the face, although I have not tried it for this purpose.  My primary use is for hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is meant to be informative of the product I have personally tried, and is not reflective of the seller distributing this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great cream. No alcohol. Moist, but not messy.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, not sticky and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> prefect for my dry hands</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. You only need a drop for your hands. It goes on very silky and doesn&#x27;t have a sticky feeling afterward. I love the way it makes my hands feel, and my cuticles look better.</li>
            <li> This is a rich, creamy lotion without feeling greasy.  I bought this size for travel (not carry on though) and will purchase larger size next time.</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my skin feel.  And got a good buy here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This lotion is good and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth. Put it on daily like suggested and it really makes a difference. Good Buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to Curel lotion. I have to buy this product on Amazon because it&#x27;s hard to find the squeeze bottle of the original formula in stores. I like the squeeze bottle for traveling, and will be ordering more as I need them.</li>
            <li> really good moisture ! not so oily and works well all time around the year. The only drawback is it takes some while to absorb but I reckon it&#x27;s okay for me, I just massage them seconds longer</li>
            <li> I do not recommend buying this. The quality is simply atrocious. It must have been diluted. Stay away from this product and buy some other hand cream, any hand cream</li>
            <li> I love this lotion for a lot of reasons. I like that it is not greasy and goes in quickly. I like that it is not too overly fragranced. It is just an easy lotion to apply, doesn&#x27;t sting on really dry skin, and does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not for super cracked or deep dry patches, although with a lot of application, I&#x27;m sure it would do a good job. This particular size is great for keeping in the car or on your nightstand. My feet and elbows are always screaming for a little moisture, especially in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other lotions and always come back to Curel.</li>
            <li> Great travel size lotion. I love curel and I am glad they made this size so I can travel with it.</li>
            <li> great for chapped hands, really keeps them from drying up.</li>
