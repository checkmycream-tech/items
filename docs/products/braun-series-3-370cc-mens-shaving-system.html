            <li>I was impressed.  </li>

            <li>I like keeping my girl happy</li>
            <li>and it was GREAT until I needed a head for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this product for 2 years now, and have been generally happy with it until recently.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>They work great, but cost over $2.50 a blade, even in bulk.  </li>
            <li>Great shaver no problems came on time  A 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised-Been using electric shavers for years.</li>
            <li>Braun&#x27;s quality and superior designing seems to be waning.</li>
            <li>But I have yet to hear of an electric razor that does as good a job as a manual one.</li>
            <li>It is performing as good as the 1st one.</li>
            <li>and the side burn trimmer is better as well!</li>
            <li>I have used the shaver since that time and I am very pleased with its close shave, not irritating blades, and the battery life is excellent.  </li>
            <li>After receiving it I couldn&#x27;t be happier, it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>I bought another Braun shaver about a decade ago and liked it so well that I gave one to each of my three sons.  </li>
            <li>Before this one I had all Series one shavers so I was hoping for a nice improvement.  </li>
            <li>I had a top of the line Braun shaver for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>It cleans with a lemon scented, alcohol based cleaning agent which is nice.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good product!</li>
            <li>the Braun Series 3-370cc fit my budget and had good reviews.  </li>
            <li>He is 100% pleased with this Braun shaver and wonders</li>
            <li>I was pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Just put it in the cradle and touch the button on top to lock it in and start up the cleaning cycle.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s happy to have an electric razor instead of a straight blade now.</li>
            <li>I will admit the cleaning feature was cool, and the solution made the bathroom smell nice, but it just did not work on my face.  </li>
            <li>, it does a pretty good job (7.5/10).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Braun shavers and as far as shaving is concerned this is a good product too.</li>
            <li>I called Braun because it has a 2 year warranty, and the best they had for me to handle the situation is for ME to pay to ship it to a service center for them to take a look at it.  </li>
            <li>My experience is that it is made cheaply and just doesn&#x27;t hold up as well as their better shavers.  </li>
            <li>You can easily travel with this (without the cleaner/holder).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to charge too -</li>
            <li>It had sexy packaging and looked cool with the cleaning system.  </li>
            <li>Hairs shaved are so fine, I cant even find them.</li>
            <li>I owned the original 7000 series Clean and Charge, the top of the line one.  </li>
            <li>The clean and renew system is pretty nice and works well.  </li>
            <li>(I fooled myself thinking that it would be more powerful because of it&#x27;s size).    </li>
            <li>The heads are so easy to clean, though once in a while I will buy another cartridge (btw, they are cheapest here).</li>
            <li>I also get ingrown hairs from cheap dollar store blades (which, don&#x27;t lie, a lot of you out there have tried.)</li>
            <li>not a heavy beard grower so this shaver is good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy to use, no shaving cream, easy to clean, and gives a close shave.  </li>
            <li>After the 3 week trial period, I took it back and got the new blades for my Norelco and have been very happy since.</li>
            <li>He was so excited</li>
            <li>I also like the ability to clean the removable shaver head under running water and the cleaning system is an added bonus as it sanitizes and lubricates the shaver after each use.  </li>
            <li>You can wash the heads or you can let the machine clean it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get many reviews, and the ones it did weren&#x27;t very good compared to the cheaper models which should essentially do the same thing, so i went with this one.    </li>
            <li>For that matter, it was just so much nicer when I came home and used my electric, and it just showed me how much I love my Braun.</li>
            <li>not bad...</li>
            <li>In the next batch of refills, the wash left a residue that was described as being more attractive.  </li>
            <li>I like Braun shavers (just ordered a new top of the line one)</li>
            <li>how much easier it is to leave straight lines for my beard when not using round heads, and the quality of the shave is excellent.</li>
            <li>In June 2009 I severely broke my right arm.  </li>
            <li>they want you to purchase alchohol to clean the product do we really need it?  </li>
            <li>With the Braun costing close to $100, it isn&#x27;t cheap, but I was willing to give it a try thanks to the decent reviews.  </li>
            <li>Based on the VASTLY higher number of 5-star reviews of the 790, I think it will.  </li>
            <li>After first washing my razor, the oily residue from the wash rubbed off on my lips and smelled like isopropyl alcohol.  </li>
            <li>This is the first shaver in my experience that oils your face whether you want it or not.  </li>
            <li>I would never have bought this shaver online if I had been aware that I needed to buy refills for this funny system for the life of the razor.</li>
            <li>Not as close as a blade, but really pretty close.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the norelco, but the new one looks cool.</li>
            <li>As one who has spent much of his life studying carcinogens, I wonder what kind of oil is spread over my face with the flavor.  </li>
            <li>When I first started using it, I couldn&#x27;t say it shaved any better or worse than my Panasonic shavers and if anything it didn&#x27;t seem any more powerful</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true you have to go over most areas a few times, but the shave is pretty close.  </li>
            <li>Within that time the trimmer thing popped off and a spring came off of it &amp; wouldn&#x27;t go back together easily.  </li>
            <li>Instead the red light flashes that it is not charged when it has been docked in the charging/cleaning station the whole time.  </li>
            <li>So much so, that I don&#x27;t really see much of a difference between this and a razor, even one with the 4 blades on it.</li>
            <li>On and off that whole day, it kept turning on</li>
            <li>Shaves just as fast and as close as my Norelco.</li>
            <li>You get a very close shave.</li>
            <li>I realized how much I missed my Braun.</li>
            <li>He gets a very close shave and the razor doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;miss\\</li>
            <li>I must say, it doesn&#x27;t shave very close.</li>
            <li>and then it&#x27;s ready to go tomorrow.  </li>
            <li>My brother has a very sensitive neck and this is the first electric he has used that DOESNT irritate his neck.</li>
            <li>This electric razor is just so much better than a Norelco, or any of the other triangular razors.</li>
            <li>Just plug it in, the LED flashes blue and looks cool</li>
            <li>It does keep everything clean, however it is also an extra expense, and one that you really do not need to use unless you have the need because of some kind of medical issue.</li>
            <li>but after so many uses of the trimmer, flipping it up &amp; down on the razor, the clips must have worn out.</li>
            <li>It is kinda annoying to sensitive ears,making a higher pitched (neeeerrragghhhh) sound, but hey, its nice to have that cool fresh scent on a razor every time you use it.    </li>
            <li>When shopping for a new one, Braun&#x27;s website didn&#x27;t say much about the difference between the 3 series and 5 series and 7 series</li>
            <li>The silver coating one the shaver where the cartridge attaches to the main unit keeps coming off</li>
            <li>The replacement blades, I might also add, are significantly cheaper than norelco for the long term investment.    </li>
            <li>I have very coarse facial hair, and as a result, always nick, cut, and wear out my razors faster than most (for the person thinking you have coarser hair, you&#x27;re wrong, so there, I win).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now for the bad news.&lt;br /&gt;I mainly chose this model because of 1) the excellent reviews, and 2)</li>
            <li>I needed new blades for my older Noreclo Rotary razor and went to Wal-Mart to get them with my girlfriend.</li>
            <li>And as far as the Braun goes, I&#x27;d buy it again, and that&#x27;s what really matters to me.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even remember when the wife bought this razor for me, a few yrs for sure.</li>
            <li>The cleaning system (port, whatever) is a little loud when it&#x27;s cleaning, so make sure you do it when music is on and when no one is sleeping unless you want to annoy them.</li>
            <li>She asked why I don&#x27;t just buy a new one as it is something I use every day.  </li>
            <li>Still works like it did when brand new.</li>
            <li>Brand new</li>
            <li>I have been using Braun for many years and have tried other brands but always came back to Braun.</li>
            <li>Who knew that shaggy sideburns and the typical starter kit mustache were no longer cool in junior high?  </li>
            <li>(no i&#x27;m not whipped, I just know little things make a big difference :)    </li>
            <li>And the difference is clearly visible.</li>
            <li>I have been using a Mach 3, which does really get a lot of those coarse hairs, but ends up running me into a hole with replacement blade costs.</li>
            <li>&quot; sections of beard like his old Norelco did.</li>
            <li>and I got it fixed as it was under warranty.</li>
            <li>I am 70 years old and have used a lot of electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>I do not see an improvement with this one from my 3 year old Series 1.  </li>
            <li>The Braun actually works very well.  </li>
            <li>the shaver has to go over the same area multiple times to get a clean shave and even then it is hard to get a smooth feel everywhere.  </li>
            <li>It got hot very quickly, took 2-3 times longer to do the job and did a poor job on my neck.  </li>
            <li>I bought a Braun Series 3-370cc Mens Shaver System because it was given high marks in the Amazon review; however, there had been only one reviewer.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what i expected it to do for the cost.</li>
            <li>About 4 or 5 months later, I was surprised to hear it turn on (by itself) in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>While this is just my opinion, I would advise trying this and getting it only if you old one has died and get it somewhere you can return it.  </li>
            <li>He said no matter how many times he goes over his face, it leaves a lot behind.</li>
            <li>Unabashedly, my girlfriend said that my face felt like a baby&#x27;s ass as she caressed my gentle features once hidden underneath a bushel of thorny beard.</li>

            <li> I have been a long time Panasonic shaver user and when I was ready to replace my last one, I made the decision to branch out and try another shaver to see if I am missing out.  I decided upon the Braun Series 3 370cc system.  It had sexy packaging and looked cool with the cleaning system.  When I first started using it, I couldn&#x27;t say it shaved any better or worse than my Panasonic shavers and if anything it didn&#x27;t seem any more powerful (I fooled myself thinking that it would be more powerful because of it&#x27;s size).    About 4 or 5 months later, I was surprised to hear it turn on (by itself) in the bathroom.  On and off that whole day, it kept turning on and I would have to go turn it off and sometimes the off button wouldn&#x27;t respond.  Eventually that day, it stopped and never happened again.    Now, 9 months later, it doesn&#x27;t respond to turning on at all.  Instead the red light flashes that it is not charged when it has been docked in the charging/cleaning station the whole time.  I called Braun because it has a 2 year warranty, and the best they had for me to handle the situation is for ME to pay to ship it to a service center for them to take a look at it.  I spent $140 for this shaver and _I_ have to pay THEM to take a look at it?  I am sorely disappointed at Braun and wish I had never tried this shaver.</li>
            <li> I needed new blades for my older Noreclo Rotary razor and went to Wal-Mart to get them with my girlfriend. She asked why I don&#x27;t just buy a new one as it is something I use every day.  I took her advice and got one of these Braun 370cc and tried it.  I will admit the cleaning feature was cool, and the solution made the bathroom smell nice, but it just did not work on my face.  It got hot very quickly, took 2-3 times longer to do the job and did a poor job on my neck.  After the 3 week trial period, I took it back and got the new blades for my Norelco and have been very happy since. While this is just my opinion, I would advise trying this and getting it only if you old one has died and get it somewhere you can return it.  I have since read a few reviews and there is a theme about the neck shaving problems and poor customer service.</li>
            <li> they want you to purchase alchohol to clean the product do we really need it?  not bad...but struggling w/ neck hair...</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised-Been using electric shavers for years. Shaves just as fast and as close as my Norelco. But with less irritation. And cost less too.I dont use the alachol bath. Hairs shaved are so fine, I cant even find them. My brother has a very sensitive neck and this is the first electric he has used that DOESNT irritate his neck. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for years and was uncertain about going to a \\&quot;straight\\&quot; shaver. After receiving it I couldn&#x27;t be happier, it&#x27;s amazing how much easier it is to leave straight lines for my beard when not using round heads, and the quality of the shave is excellent.</li>
            <li> In June 2009 I severely broke my right arm.  I hadn&#x27;t used an electric shaver since the 80s and my experience then, with a Norelco shaver, was not good at all (Horrible skin irritation!!!).  Now, I needed something I could use with one hand and the Braun Series 3-370cc fit my budget and had good reviews.  I have used the shaver since that time and I am very pleased with its close shave, not irritating blades, and the battery life is excellent.  I also like the ability to clean the removable shaver head under running water and the cleaning system is an added bonus as it sanitizes and lubricates the shaver after each use.  My \\&quot;healed\\&quot; arm allows me to utilize it somewhat for shaving now, but I continue to use the Braun Series 3-370cc.  If you are looking for a mid-range electric razor this is the one I would recommend without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Worst electric razor I have ever owned. Changed blades twice in three months and still can&#x27;t handle my beard, my bald head, or my wife&#x27;s legs. Yanks instead of cuts. Going back to my razor.</li>
            <li> This electric razor is just so much better than a Norelco, or any of the other triangular razors. It is easier to cut your side burns...and the side burn trimmer is better as well! You get a very close shave. So much so, that I don&#x27;t really see much of a difference between this and a razor, even one with the 4 blades on it. We recently stayed over a friends house and in the morning I wanted to shave and used a hand razor, I forget the brand.....I realized how much I missed my Braun. No burning with the Braun. No nicks either. For that matter, it was just so much nicer when I came home and used my electric, and it just showed me how much I love my Braun. You can wash the heads or you can let the machine clean it. I will mention one thing. Don&#x27;t think that if you do not clean it every day the liquid will last longer. It will not. It evaporates, so use it. It does keep everything clean, however it is also an extra expense, and one that you really do not need to use unless you have the need because of some kind of medical issue. The heads are so easy to clean, though once in a while I will buy another cartridge (btw, they are cheapest here). You can easily travel with this (without the cleaner/holder). One last thing, my wife loves that it doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of shavings in the sink. If you are considering this, all I can say is go for it. You won&#x27;t be looking back!</li>
            <li> The braun 370c is not a good shaver.  It&#x27;s will not last. I don&#x27;t if the company is making products with inferior material or what, however I suggest you buy something else.  For some reason this shaver &#x27;series 3 370 series,&#x27; is defected.   This shaver will stop working and the company will not stand behind their product!!!  If you google this shaver and add complaints, you will see all the problems people have had with this shaver.  The company knows about this problem, but fails to do anything about it!!!!!  If they don&#x27;t care, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t care to buy from them again,&#x27;</li>
            <li> I come from a family that is, to say the least, beard enabled. I have very coarse facial hair, and as a result, always nick, cut, and wear out my razors faster than most (for the person thinking you have coarser hair, you&#x27;re wrong, so there, I win). I have been using a Mach 3, which does really get a lot of those coarse hairs, but ends up running me into a hole with replacement blade costs. The razors also gets pretty dull after a few weeks use. I also get ingrown hairs from cheap dollar store blades (which, don&#x27;t lie, a lot of you out there have tried.) So here&#x27;s my review of this Braun Series 3-370cc electric shaver.    It&#x27;s nice. It does exactly what i expected it to do for the cost. I found it at walmart, on rollback, for $1[...] bucks. It has a 60 day return value (keep your receipt and box and anything else) so if you don&#x27;t like it, return it. Norelco only has a 45 day return period. Anyway, make the small investment and try an electric shaver( If you do the math, even if you only have this razor for a year, it&#x27;s only $[...] a month.) Unabashedly, my girlfriend said that my face felt like a baby&#x27;s ass as she caressed my gentle features once hidden underneath a bushel of thorny beard. I like keeping my girl happy (no i&#x27;m not whipped, I just know little things make a big difference :)    It&#x27;s easy to charge too - Just plug it in, the LED flashes blue and looks cool (it makes your bathroom look cooler too with the dark blue glow it presents... Like tron....)     I&#x27;ve done multiple shaves since and will never, ever go back to a regular razor (unless I forget this for some foolish reason, or because I&#x27;m hyperactive.)     I haven&#x27;t tried the norelco, but the new one looks cool. It didn&#x27;t get many reviews, and the ones it did weren&#x27;t very good compared to the cheaper models which should essentially do the same thing, so i went with this one.    The cleaning system (port, whatever) is a little loud when it&#x27;s cleaning, so make sure you do it when music is on and when no one is sleeping unless you want to annoy them. It is kinda annoying to sensitive ears,making a higher pitched (neeeerrragghhhh) sound, but hey, its nice to have that cool fresh scent on a razor every time you use it.    The replacement blades, I might also add, are significantly cheaper than norelco for the long term investment.    So, 5 stars, it could be 4, but whatever, I like it. Again, at least here in upperstate new york area, the walmart had it for $[...] bucks.</li>
            <li> I have a series 3 370cc and it was GREAT until I needed a head for it. Then just TRY and find one!! Dont ever EVER buy anything you can&#x27;t find the parts for. Walk away from this one, get a Remington, do anything else but buy a series 3 370cc, same thing for the 350cc, avoid them both!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what my husband claims. And the difference is clearly visible. He gets a very close shave and the razor doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;miss\\&quot; sections of beard like his old Norelco did. He is 100% pleased with this Braun shaver and wonders why it took him so long to switch!</li>
            <li> I have been a Braun user for long time, and I found this shaver is a lot quieter than previous models, whether it&#x27;s in the shaving mode or cleaning mode.  Same comfort, same convenience, and same cleanness for this model.  Pretty good product!</li>
            <li> Vastly worse than the higher-end models.  I owned the original 7000 series Clean and Charge, the top of the line one.  It was the best shaver I ever owned.  Had it for 10 years before it finally died.  A battery replacement did not bring it back to life.  When shopping for a new one, Braun&#x27;s website didn&#x27;t say much about the difference between the 3 series and 5 series and 7 series so I thought I&#x27;d save some cash and go for this lower-end model.  Their website focuses on the differences between LCD screens and so on, but nothing about shaving quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been unhappy with this shaver ever since I got it.  It just takes forever to shave, doesn&#x27;t work well, tugs, etc. I&#x27;m gonna save my $20 or $30 on a foil replacement and instead throw this out and buy a 790cc.  I&#x27;m crossing my fingers the extra money brings me the quality I remember from my 7000 series.  Based on the VASTLY higher number of 5-star reviews of the 790, I think it will.  Chinese junk versus German quality.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for his birthday and we&#x27;re returning it today. He said no matter how many times he goes over his face, it leaves a lot behind. He tried it after showering and before showering (like the instructions recommend) and just hates it. The only part he likes was the beard and mustache trimmer. We&#x27;re exchanging it for a Norelco.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Braun shavers and as far as shaving is concerned this is a good product too. However a few quibbles remain.&lt;br /&gt;- The trimmer is really poorly made. broke once and I got it fixed as it was under warranty. It broke again and I can&#x27;t do anything about it since its out of warranty now. I just travel with an additional trimmer (again a Braun)&lt;br /&gt;- The silver coating one the shaver where the cartridge attaches to the main unit keeps coming off</li>
            <li> Head occasionally falls off while shaving; battery needs charging after just 3 uses. Braun&#x27;s quality and superior designing seems to be waning.</li>
            <li> The shaver upholds the Braun tradition. I&#x27;ve owned Braun shavers for over 20 years and come to rely on their quality.</li>
            <li> I bought another Braun shaver about a decade ago and liked it so well that I gave one to each of my three sons.  When that shaver died of old age and was not able to be repaired, I decided to buy a Braun shaver again.  That model was no longer manufactured.  I bought a Braun Series 3-370cc Mens Shaver System because it was given high marks in the Amazon review; however, there had been only one reviewer.  I am 70 years old and have used a lot of electric shavers.  This was the worst ever.  Unlike my earlier model Braun shaver, the head does not rotate.  It scratches my neck.  The shave is not as close as I got with the earlier model Braun razor.  Its purchase price is expensive; and, after my purchase, I learned that I had to buy refills (a mixture of an alcohol and oil) for a machine that washes the head of this Braun after 2-3 shaves.  After first washing my razor, the oily residue from the wash rubbed off on my lips and smelled like isopropyl alcohol.  In the next batch of refills, the wash left a residue that was described as being more attractive.  It was worse than the isopropyl odor and tasted bad.  As one who has spent much of his life studying carcinogens, I wonder what kind of oil is spread over my face with the flavor.  What might that oil contain?  This is the first shaver in my experience that oils your face whether you want it or not.  I would never have bought this shaver online if I had been aware that I needed to buy refills for this funny system for the life of the razor.</li>
            <li> My Husband has used the same razor for years.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even remember when the wife bought this razor for me, a few yrs for sure. Still works like it did when brand new. I&#x27;ve tried several brands of razors and prefer Braun&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Does not shave close, very poor performance  sold it on ebay for $15. Would not recommend it to anyone.  N</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun for many years and have tried other brands but always came back to Braun. Before this one I had all Series one shavers so I was hoping for a nice improvement.  Brand new the shaver has to go over the same area multiple times to get a clean shave and even then it is hard to get a smooth feel everywhere.  I do not see an improvement with this one from my 3 year old Series 1.  The clean and renew system is pretty nice and works well.  May try another brand again after this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this product for 2 years now, and have been generally happy with it until recently.&lt;br /&gt;For starters, I&#x27;m used to shaving with a manual razor. Thought I could save some time every once in a while by just using this for 2 minutes (as opposed to 5 or 6 with the manual razor). I must say, it doesn&#x27;t shave very close. But I have yet to hear of an electric razor that does as good a job as a manual one. That being said (and after hearing about this same model used by my father and brother who have used ONLY electric razors.... EVER!), it does a pretty good job (7.5/10).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the bad news.&lt;br /&gt;I mainly chose this model because of 1) the excellent reviews, and 2) the fact that it has a built-in beard trimmer. The trimmer itself works as well as anyone can expect a trimmer to. I was pleased with it. However, after 2 years, the PLASTIC CLIPS that hold the trimmer portion of the razor on BROKE! I&#x27;ve never dropped it &amp; only set it down on it&#x27;s side (so as not to possibly damage it), but after so many uses of the trimmer, flipping it up &amp; down on the razor, the clips must have worn out. Now the trimmer cant stay on the razor, thus making it useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least I can still shave my face with it! I&#x27;ll just have to use something else to trim my beard!</li>
            <li> I had a top of the line Braun shaver for years and loved it.  After a long time it stopped recharging properly and my wife bought me this one to replace it.  This one lasted just over a year.  Within that time the trimmer thing popped off and a spring came off of it &amp; wouldn&#x27;t go back together easily.  Then yeseterday the On button stopped working. It&#x27;s fully charged but it just won&#x27;t turn on.  I like Braun shavers (just ordered a new top of the line one) but I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this one. My experience is that it is made cheaply and just doesn&#x27;t hold up as well as their better shavers.  Don&#x27;t buy this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I was skeptical when my son who is 13 wanted to get an electric shaver to touch up his face for school.  Who knew that shaggy sideburns and the typical starter kit mustache were no longer cool in junior high?  I ran to one of the big box stores and picked up the Braun 370.  It comes with the cleaning kit that&#x27;s shown.  Just put it in the cradle and touch the button on top to lock it in and start up the cleaning cycle.  It revs up a couple times during the cleaning and that&#x27;s it.  It continues to charge and then it&#x27;s ready to go tomorrow.  It cleans with a lemon scented, alcohol based cleaning agent which is nice.  I like to pop off the head and tap the excess whiskers into the sink and rinse them down prior to putting it in the cleaning cradle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I was skeptical to start using an electric shaver having using the Gillette Mach 3&#x27;s forever.  They work great, but cost over $2.50 a blade, even in bulk.  I would buy $100 at a time from the warehouse club and try to stretch them with one per week over the next 6 months.  With the Braun costing close to $100, it isn&#x27;t cheap, but I was willing to give it a try thanks to the decent reviews.  Day one.....I was impressed.  I expected my skin to be red and irritated and the shave to be poor - thanks to an old electric razor from the mid 80s that left a bad impression on me.  The Braun actually works very well.  It&#x27;s true you have to go over most areas a few times, but the shave is pretty close.  Not as close as a blade, but really pretty close.  If I was to say that a blade gives me a satisfaction rating of 100, then I would put the Braun around a 95.  It&#x27;s quick, easy to use, no shaving cream, easy to clean, and gives a close shave.  I understand that I&#x27;ll have the expense of buying the cleaning cartridges every so often, but they are less than $6 a month.  And as far as the Braun goes, I&#x27;d buy it again, and that&#x27;s what really matters to me.</li>
            <li> Great shaver no problems came on time  A 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1</li>
            <li> This was ordered as a replacement for the same one that I had used for 10 years. It is performing as good as the 1st one.</li>
            <li> This was a surprise present for my husband for Christmas.  He was so excited and he&#x27;s been using it ever since. He&#x27;s happy to have an electric razor instead of a straight blade now.</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND COULD NOT MASTER USING THIS RAZOR. THEREFORE HE WENT BACK TO HIS NORELCO</li>
            <li> This is best shaver I have used.Tried all of the brands over the years. Never felt like I had a close shave. I damaged my Seies 3-350. Did not hesitate to replace. Cleaning/charging system is grat.</li>
            <li> not a heavy beard grower so this shaver is good.  but honestly i only shave once a week.  On time deleivery</li>
