            <li> The package it came in leaked while in the mail because cap was not screwed on tight and plastic seal had split open.</li>
            <li> My little jar of this is helping with the elasticity I need to shrink my skin back.  </li>
            <li> This small 3 oz jar will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> the small jar last a long time.</li>
            <li> I melt it with other oils to make sunscreen as well as body butter.</li>
            <li> and I can melt it to add other oils to it.</li>
            <li> but of course is not a quick fix.  </li>
            <li> It is a off white faint yellow color.</li>
            <li> I dig a little out at a time and mix it with the coconut butter I have.  </li>
            <li> I just scrape a little out of the jar and melt it in my hands.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t certified, anyhow you get little chunks that can be spread on the skin.  </li>
            <li> then I spread and melt a little lump of this over my hands, arms and legs to help make a moisture barrier.  </li>
            <li> This is a hard butter not smooth like you would think.  </li>
            <li> The cocoa butter itself was rock hard.</li>
            <li> Is very hard but is suppose to be like that, but you melted and mix with carrier oils and is so creamy.</li>

            <li> This is a hard butter not smooth like you would think.  Don&#x27;t let that hold you back from purchasing this product though.  I dig a little out at a time and mix it with the coconut butter I have.  I place it in the microwave for a few seconds, give it stir and the warm yummy oils are rubbed all over my face, body and a little in my hair.  I have lost a bunch of weight and I have been left with lose skin.  My little jar of this is helping with the elasticity I need to shrink my skin back.  It is working but of course is not a quick fix.  This small 3 oz jar will last a long time.  You won&#x27;t regret purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Organic Cocoa Butter - Unrefined - 3 Oz. is nice cocoa butter and works exactly like a good cocoa butter should.</li>

            <li> I ordered the cocoa butter to use it as a moisturizer. I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality. The cocoa butter smells like chocolate and melts very easily. Will definitely recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on the ends of my hair and also on my hands and cuticles. I just scrape a little out of the jar and melt it in my hands. It smells like heavenly chocolate and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy at all. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Great product, no complaints, works well for damaged skin. My family uses this cocoa butter on face and body. Very nice results.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious! Just wondering if it is REALLY organic... since it is not certified... I will take there word for it? Happy with the product so far.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use in lip balm recipes and it serves the purpose well. Packaged nicely. No complaints. Would recommend</li>
            <li> Really like this cocoa butter ,i mix it with organic shea butter , coconut oil , sweet almond and grapeseed oil , the best moisturizer,and smell really good. Is very hard but is suppose to be like that, but you melted and mix with carrier oils and is so creamy.</li>

            <li> I really enjoyed this product. I have had the jar for a few months now and it is still just as good as when i purchased it. I do keep in a cool place and when i use it. I normally scoop some out and melt it before applying. Love the smell and it actually helped minimize a scar&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, smooth, spreads easily.</li>
            <li> This smells like chocolate and is a wonderful cocoa butter.  I purchased this to have on hand for blemishes, burns, scrapes and scars. I also ordered the shea butter from this company too, and I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality of both products.  I will order more products from this company again and highly recommend!</li>

            <li> I just love this cocoa butter. I am not the talented type like many others who are making soaps, lotions, ect.. Not yet anyway, lol.&lt;br /&gt;But this is so much different than the palmers, ect. that you buy in bottles at the store, and there so yellow, and nice and creamy. Big difference in the scent !  As others state, it smells just like Chocolate ! You just want to eat it !&lt;br /&gt;I use a baby spoon and just scrape some out into another container and keep a lid on it.  If your hands are nice and warm, it will just melt into a perfect oil, and you smooth it all over your dry areas. I especially use it on my elbows, feet, hands,face and lips. It stays on longer, and very beneficial. I have not had any problems with breakouts on my face using it. I even put some on the ends of my hair where it is dry.&lt;br /&gt;I plan on purchasing more. I little bit of this goes a long way. :)</li>
            <li> When I first purchase this product I was not very satisfied with the size and the price range. In turn I was provide with excellent costomer service. Thanks you. Now I feel that I can recommend this brand to future shopper.</li>
            <li> If you want pure and good get this.</li>
            <li> i really like this cocoa butter. love the smell and once melted, it rubs in well. the small jar last a long time.</li>
            <li> I use cocoa butter as a body moisturizer. Love the scent and I can melt it to add other oils to it.</li>
            <li> I wonder if it is really organic??  it isn&#x27;t certified, anyhow you get little chunks that can be spread on the skin.  They melt and I smell like cocoa.  In the evening sometimes I will apply an oil, such as almond, avocado, argon etc. then I spread and melt a little lump of this over my hands, arms and legs to help make a moisture barrier.  Very soft skin the next day.  This cocoa butter looks like the real deal, I just wouldn&#x27;t count on it being organic.  It is a off white faint yellow color.</li>
