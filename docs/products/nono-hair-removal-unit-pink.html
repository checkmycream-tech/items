            <li>Good luck!  </li>
            <li>the company is a no no \\&quot;good for nothing\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had extremely good results with the No!No!.  </li>
            <li>not $260 great.  </li>
            <li>I got the NoNo and was expecting great results from everything I&#x27;d heard.</li>
            <li>Laser gave me great results.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>internet is great for some things.</li>
            <li>I called to ask about refund procedure and they tried to persuade me at great length from a script, to keep the product</li>
            <li>I brought this product in hopes of receiving the great benefits they endorse.</li>
            <li>After my No No hair system broke,the fly wheel (band) popped out</li>
            <li>but I can say I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I am not going to advertise who did the great job on me, because that&#x27;s not what this review is about.</li>
            <li>No! would be a great solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yet they&#x27;re happy to take your money and keep selling it.</li>
            <li>and it works great, from the Nono company.</li>
            <li>It does a great job on &#x27;peach fuzz&#x27; however.  </li>
            <li>I called the company and was told that they would be happy to replace if I paid for an extended warranty</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>I would recommend Ideal Image to anyone and October is when they run there best sales :)</li>
            <li>I have always been able to get a refund from legitimate  businesses!!  </li>
            <li>Their customer service rep was very courteous and cancelled this for me.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin stubbly at best, the smell of burnt hair is overwhelming, and it stings like a mamma jamma.</li>
            <li>i had never bought anything from a tv ad before, but it seemed soooo wonderful that i went online to look for a better price and ordered.  </li>
            <li>I am sooo very happy with my results and have sent many blessings to the maker and distributors of this product.</li>
            <li>:P  </li>
            <li>I gave it every chance to be successful.</li>
            <li>The sun is shining brightly in the window</li>
            <li>The marketing campaign is good</li>
            <li>Perhaps it is a good product if you want to spend a couple of hours each time to remove hair from your legs...</li>
            <li>Sounds good.</li>
            <li>Get a good men&#x27;s 5 blade razor and some shave cream instead.</li>
            <li>not everyone is good.</li>
            <li>(followed instructions meticulously), it doesn&#x27;t even do a good thorough job on the peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s so good, why isn&#x27;t it advertised for mens&#x27; beards?  </li>
            <li>I am considered the optimum candidate.  </li>
            <li>what good did that do me?</li>
            <li>what good did that do me?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if their claims of good reviews are all garbage.  </li>
            <li>because I thought it would be a good alternative to laser or waxing.  </li>
            <li>Good luck on your adventure.</li>
            <li>I go and good riddence to no</li>
            <li>TV and google reviews make this sound like the greatest thing since sliced bread.</li>
            <li>and I thought it would be a good investment.  </li>
            <li>I just laughed and laughed.</li>
            <li>but all in all the product sounded so good</li>
            <li>A good laser hair removal clinic will give you quite an education on what they&#x27;re doing, why they&#x27;re doing it, and whether or not your hair and skin are a good match for the procedure.  </li>
            <li>You out lay a fair amount of money for the product</li>
            <li>Works really good.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t over use it, that isnt good for your skin and wont speed up the process.</li>
            <li>The NoNo commercials are very convincing</li>
            <li>I opened the box with trembling hands and decided to follow the instructions to the letter because I refused to be duped again by &amp;#34;an amazing, too good to be true&amp;#34; television product.</li>
            <li>I read good reviews for fine hair, but if you are olive toned and beastly hairy, like me, this product will not make you happy.</li>
            <li>MORE HAIR!</li>
            <li>and I have to sandpaper it some more with their exfoliating paper!</li>
            <li>in fact I fell asleep during my latest session!</li>
            <li>Please make absolutely sure you want this product before you purchase it!</li>
            <li>The return process could not have been simpler or more efficient -- thank-you!</li>
            <li>This many people cannot be lying!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I took the time to look at reviews on Amazon before I bought this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not the one who paid the money for this!</li>
            <li>Shelved for a year because quite frankly I found unwieldy then decided to try one more time to find that the no!no!</li>
            <li>Heard nothing but amazing things about the no</li>
            <li>I honestly just use this on my legs when I&#x27;m on the computer or watching tv.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my own fault for trusting them.  </li>
            <li>, the guy was nice, he gave me a return number</li>
            <li>Kind of pissed because I bought this when it was priced at $300.  </li>
            <li>I have returned to shaving my legs and am loving the difference.</li>
            <li>So, taking matters into my own hand, I called their 888 customer service number.</li>
            <li>Representatives will not divulge that kind of information.</li>
            <li>Thieves own and run this co.  </li>
            <li>I liked the idea of 60 days to return it</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m getting really adept at shaving, make it a time to relax and indulge.</li>
            <li>but I was thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>Basically, you&#x27;re paying all that money for a nice buffer.</li>
            <li>My skin had a rash kind of like sun burn or something.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know how scams like this are allowed to continue.  </li>
            <li>Kind of deceptive advertising.</li>
            <li>This product arrived on time and packaged nicely, however, I didn&#x27;t realize it burns your unwanted hair off, leaving the smell of burned hair with you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even worth rating 1/2 a star!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m most happy with the results on my arms and can easily be done just before your shower.</li>
            <li>If it sounds too good to be true, it is!  </li>
            <li>This was about $500 but honestly has given me amazing results (hair free underarms, legs, and arms!).  </li>
            <li>thank you ,the customers i reviewed was very un satisfied if it sounds to good to be true</li>
            <li>Very easy.  </li>
            <li>No was that it was very easy to get a refund</li>
            <li>We have much more important things to spend our time and money on!!</li>
            <li>It is also incredibly time-consuming and the gadget itself conks out whenever it wants to.</li>
            <li>Its amazing how many people will do and believe anything Dr Oz says or products he has on his programs</li>
            <li>For this kind of money, I thought I would have better results.  </li>
            <li>sound good, but</li>
            <li>I tried it on my fingers to test it out and it removed some of the (very fine) hairs, but not all.</li>
            <li>ALTHOUGH MY HAIR IS VERY FINE, I COULD USE NO NO FOR 20 MINUTES A DAY {</li>
            <li>If it sounds to good to be true...</li>
            <li>In their adverts the movement appears relaxed and gliding with the user smiling - I&#x27;m a pretty confident person, but I could never be smiling and relaxed when using No!no!!</li>
            <li>I thought that with all the positive advertisement that it was receiving that it was going to be a great product.  </li>
            <li>and so I tried that again - more wounds.</li>
            <li>When I called I was told that I have been placed on a 30-days payment program without my knowledge and without my OK.  </li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>it did okay,</li>
            <li>so many of you have.  </li>
            <li>When you call for the return the operators insist that either the product was not used correctly or more time is needed.</li>
            <li>I have no problem adhering to this because I know that at the lower level that you just have to use this more often.</li>
            <li>This product literally just singes the top layer of hair</li>
            <li>I am not waiting for them to pull any more money out of my account</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I got it in Peru and was my favorite hair removal since then.</li>
            <li>I tried on my legs following the instructions and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I was so proud of my legs and ready for a swimming suit.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>My favorite comment, \\&quot;was</li>
            <li>It cut her face in many places</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li>I have better ways to spend my time...and to top it all off...</li>
            <li>you better start the process in September...</li>
            <li>The instructions are explicit, \\&quot;do not go over an area more than 3 times and do not allow it to come in contact with the lips.  </li>
            <li>Glad I was able to dodge the bullet, than to you for making these reports.</li>
            <li>No!No! and better yet b/c it was more than 30 days after the charge on my credit card, I still had to pay for the thing.  </li>
            <li>Most reviews are one-star or less.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been watching the infomercials for a while, and I&#x27;ve been wanting to find that magic solution to smoother legs (aren&#x27;t we all, ladies?).  </li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t buy the blades you need any more.</li>
            <li>More burned skin and the house smelling like a sulphur factory?</li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;m off to shave my legs now.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the results but not the price I had to pay.</li>
            <li>I started with TRIA laser hair removal and had astonishing results in just three weeks.</li>
            <li>Okay, I admit up front that it is not me that is using this No-No product, but the person who I purchased it as a gift for is, or should I say....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, will the hair get thinner and more sparse as time goes on?</li>
            <li>I am quite hairy and spend most the year in pants because I also have eczema and get in grown hairs a lot.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
            <li>I think it might work better on hair that&#x27;s never been shaved.</li>
            <li>Now after reading some of these reviews I am not so sure if I want to use this on her at all.</li>
            <li>make sure that they don&#x27;t use it in your house, or you will smell the stinch of burning hair all over.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>( I was able to go online and view their instruction video.)</li>
            <li>I love the reviews here, it has helped me prevent being cheated.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad to be able to read before trying this.  </li>
            <li>I should have known better, but the infomercial was quite convincing.    </li>
            <li>Sure, it removes hair, but so does a disposable razor or a Norelco.</li>
            <li>are more details of the conversation between me and the customer service rep.  </li>
            <li>So, do some models break more than others?</li>
            <li>Sure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure, given time and patience, no-no will do what is promised in their advertisement.</li>
            <li>How many replacements will you put up with before calling it quits?</li>
            <li>For the amount of time I&#x27;ve devoted to this thing I could have had most of it removed, now I have so much more to remove.</li>
            <li>I worked on it every night for a week, sometimes making as many as 30 passes in one area (with the required rest time in between).  </li>
            <li>I have used many many hair removal products, and aside fron tria laser</li>
            <li>I am glad I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will write more as time goes</li>
            <li>Interesting..., because when I bought mine, it was being advertised for the face.  </li>
            <li>So glad I did save my money</li>
            <li>I have had mine for 9 months or more and the hair is as it was when I started.</li>
            <li>but I do feel that this may be a product fault the system has and many more people will find that their No</li>
            <li>OK, I got sucked in by an off-hours TV ad.  </li>
            <li>, this was looking even more like a scam...</li>
            <li>That sure doesn&#x27;t cost $300 to produce.  </li>
            <li>And it sure doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes indeed it works but it takes a while to learn to use and to get used to I already need more tips</li>
            <li>I have avoided being burned, in more ways than one</li>
            <li>I record Dr Oz while at work and catch up when am able.</li>
            <li>This might work for people who do not have a hair problem, but for the rest of us who would love to have lasik but can&#x27;t afford it, then no.</li>
            <li>We will see if I get better results on my legs with time.</li>
            <li>An ok investment for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe if I were more faithful about using the unit, they&#x27;d be gone by now.</li>
            <li>more thing --</li>
            <li>i went in both directions and went over the area many times..</li>
            <li>Its just a hassel and is causing more stress than helping..</li>
            <li>The thing will not run for more than two seconds at a time just keeps clicking on &amp; off.</li>
            <li>There r more complaints then compliments for this, wonder why?.</li>
            <li>She continued asking me questions and more questions.</li>
            <li>OR MORE}  </li>
            <li>I went online to order this product &amp; started reading some of the Amazon reviews &amp; boy, was I glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t get blindsided by the media magic.  </li>
            <li>So glad I read the customer reviews before ordering.</li>
            <li>I made sure it was fully charged, but it would still move like this.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I hope more people read these reviews so the company can stop selling it.</li>
            <li>but no matter better than waxing and threading.</li>
            <li>, i.e., give us even more money.  </li>
            <li>When attempting to buy on line yesterday, I mistakenly clicked on one of the many extras they offer.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>They said that it was more than 60 days.</li>
            <li>I was sure that the product advertisement showed a woman shaving her mustache area (which I have seen the ad since then, and it does).  </li>
            <li>- I made sure to mark my calendar and set an alert for Day 45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On top of that, it quit working 6 months after purchase.</li>
            <li>oh, wait, theres more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s more of a Gimmick than anything else</li>
            <li>I would never purchase any more products from this company again.</li>
            <li>I tried it for about 3 months and all that resulted was a lovely bouquet of burning hair smell.  </li>
            <li>I found that immediately after I used it (no matter how many swipes) there was still \\&quot;stubble\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>, I will set a calandar reminder and will call during the precious time frame of 45-60 days and request my return authorization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I called after the 45 days (but before the 60) and was given a return authorization number.  </li>
            <li>Then I went on with my more than peach fuzzy face.</li>
            <li>Sure it took more than the recommended two to three passes over each spot.</li>
            <li>I bought the nono about six weeks ago and am 100% satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>More on that</li>
            <li>/&gt;After it not working or burning my face if I did more than the recommended 2 swipes, I called them July  3 to cancel the order of any more cream &amp; return</li>
            <li>it is nothing more than a shaver with heat and</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I thought if I used it more I would get results.</li>
            <li>Thanks for stopping me!!!!</li>
            <li>I was given the NO!NO! as a gift and was very excited to get it.</li>
            <li>well i&#x27;m still shaving and enjoying a cheap and cheerful relationship with my new best and trusted friend bic !!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited for this product and used the no!no!</li>
            <li>Lubriderm is the best, unscented for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I could just kick myself for not reading Amazon reviews first, but I let my excitement for something new get the best of me.</li>
            <li>The TV ad for no!no!is really great... sounds almost too good to be true, but not quite so much that women aren&#x27;t willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to read ALL the fine print before you hand over your information.</li>
            <li>And, the energy part for me, is the most important part.</li>
            <li>But trust me, you will love your smooth silky arms and legs.</li>
            <li>no she is now hair free, has much more confidence</li>
            <li>I am currently getting laser hair removal through Ideal Image.</li>
            <li>I will continue the professional service that has already given me great results.</li>
            <li>I cant speak for permanent hair removal in the long run, but for the time being, I am VERY happy with my impeccably smooth results.</li>
            <li>I have found better results with a cheap shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would have rather had the free ginzu knives : )</li>
            <li>but this company said it was my own fault for having not used the right amount of cream.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>removal\\&quot; where it was actually TRUE!</li>
            <li>This item is quite easy to use and am looking forward to the results.</li>
            <li>I was using the Braun epilator for a year when I saw the television ad for this and found it looked so easy.  </li>
            <li>I have some very mild burns on my face</li>
            <li>the instructions are easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>The technology was also portrayed as being very quick and easy to use, but it was not.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quite easy to use.</li>
            <li>Although it did produce a strong burned hair odor.      </li>
            <li>Liked the product when I first got it.  </li>
            <li>I am always trying new products to find the best in new ways for hair removal.</li>
            <li>The seller was fine and I had no issues.  </li>
            <li>I was fine with it not being permanent, i just wanted it to remove hair and for it to remain gone for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>Also, the latest newest technology in electrolysis is so much better than 12 years ago when I first tried it...</li>
            <li>I since switched to a cream for removal which works fine.  </li>
            <li>I have medium brown fine hair with medium skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Pain free, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It should turn out fine if the NoNo does what it says it does and has permanently removed your hair, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I blame myself for not researching the product before buying and even more for not returning within the first month when I may have had the chance to recoup my monies although I am sure Radiance would have tried to talk me into keeping.  </li>
            <li>That being said, it works fine</li>
            <li>I got to the billing info after entering my AMX card and noticed in fine print that I would be charged 2 additional payments.  </li>
            <li>It must be in the fine</li>
            <li>Luckily I bought my no!no!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m praying for some kind of miracle and  positive results.</li>
            <li>When I got it, I first used it on my legs and not only would it burn the hair, it wouldn&#x27;t even move smoothly!!!!</li>
            <li>and/or are getting paid a huge amount of money to exaggerate.</li>
            <li>I have a huge problem with chin hair</li>
            <li>am returning it tonight, but I hear the return process is a huge nightmare.  </li>
            <li>thought it must be something about my technique and (once my face had healed and I felt brave enough)</li>
            <li>You never get a smooth leg/arm whatever.  </li>
            <li>It states on the web page that tel lines are available from 9 - 5.30.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I bought it on the trial basis &amp; my card was never charged</li>
            <li>A fantastic product.</li>
            <li>If I would have read the reviews here before I bought the nono, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it, but this is one of those rare times where I&#x27;m actually glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>once you use the buffer pad, it was as smooth as if I had shaved.</li>
            <li>I might have had more success.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Never did I have smooth legs or anything else smooth for that matter.</li>
            <li>I have to shave every time if I want my legs smooth...</li>
            <li>I was told there was a 60 days free trial</li>
            <li>Looks cheaply made.    </li>
            <li>Hope this review can help shed some light for those who are considering in purchasing a no-no.</li>
            <li>I visited their website and filled out the contact form with a barrage of questions...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>The hair was gone and skin was smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I know for a fact that stuff will fit in a one price 4.95 box from the post office.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a no go for me because I have light colored</li>
            <li>I should have known, because the laser hair removal at the spa does not work for light or graying hair, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be hair free after one use or even one week.  </li>
            <li>Would be really great if a future model was chargeable and did not need to be plugged in while it is being used.    </li>
            <li>it is worth about 30 to 50 bucks at most in my view.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaply made.</li>
            <li>You can get an even better buffer that comes with replacement pads at Wal-mart for seven bucks (the Smooth Away kit, which isn&#x27;t perfect but at least it&#x27;s cheap).   </li>
            <li>you have any questions, please feel free to write.</li>
            <li>which would be one thing if you were smooth and \\&quot;hairfree\\&quot; at the end.  </li>
            <li>I called before the free trial was up to get an RDA number</li>
            <li>My legs have never been so smooth.</li>
            <li>smooth legs&lt;</li>
            <li>Just another unwanted hassle.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it does not glide smoothly over your skin, and they don&#x27;t tell you that the heads need replacement.  </li>
            <li>It takes awhile for you to train the hairs, so there is a great potential for ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>was offered another product: a cream to use after using the NoNO...a $50 value for free.</li>
            <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was then told that I would have to wait until 45 days had elapsed before I could return the product or else they would not honor the free return shipping.  </li>
            <li>You WILL lose money, there IS NO risk free trial, as it is a scam.</li>
            <li>Maybe it just depends on the coarseness of the hair, or maybe people aren&#x27;t using it correctly, but in any case, so far so good</li>
            <li>Maybe it just depends on the coarseness of the hair, or maybe people aren&#x27;t using it correctly, but in any case, so far so good</li>
            <li>Good ole fashioned waxing on a regular basis works a hundred times better.</li>
            <li>After having every hair removal process, I found that only real laser treatments work the best for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it and think it&#x27;s well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re not stupid.</li>
            <li>My cheap electric razor does a much better job; usually right after trying to use the no no shaver.</li>
            <li>And hey, gals, listen up: they say you can easily return it for a full refund.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it to use on my legs, however, it did not work on my legs at all.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t brave enough to try it on any portion of my face, I&#x27;ve had really good luck with the Bellabe Facial Hair Remover</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this</li>
            <li>This devise is a glorified shaver, the most it does is to shave your unwanted hair, make your skin feel hot, and have your room smell like burnt hair.     </li>
            <li>I was so excited and hopeful when I bought this product</li>
            <li>So I was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>so they could review the original phone call to do the return to see If I was missled.  </li>
            <li>After more than two months of consistent use (5x per week), my hair growth has not diminshed.</li>
            <li>I was excited about it &amp; it did nothing but hair</li>
            <li>I returned the first one just be be sure it wasn&#x27;t just a defective unit.</li>
            <li>Zero success on legs!</li>
            <li>The one I received in return was refurbished and they said that the warranty would not be extended to year from the replacement date and the original date of purchase still determined to end of the one year warranty.</li>
            <li>This price should be significantly lower.</li>
            <li>IF you have fine, light hair, this product might be useful to you.  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old grand daughter doesn&#x27;t want me kissing her because I scratch her!</li>
            <li>I have a problem with facial hair; and like many women, I jump for joy every time a new product comes out that promises to remove it.  </li>
            <li>I bought the No!No! hair removal from HSN when they had their \\&quot;special deal\\&quot; on it.  </li>
            <li>And they have a special wand to take out the redness now...</li>
            <li>He started reading a script and tried to get me to jump aboard and take advantage of their special promotion...</li>
            <li>14 days, two more large tips broke &lt; 42 days.</li>
            <li>people see right through you!</li>
            <li>right!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s where it is right now !</li>
            <li>The wires/blades kink and break very easily and rapidly with normal use.</li>
            <li>I just got super excited by the infomercial and jump on the phone and order it.  </li>
            <li>It did remove some hair around my bikini area, but my skin swelled up and was bright red.</li>
            <li>It is true that it is painelss-physically that is.  </li>
            <li>I want something that is close like shaving, and the product still left a good bit of stubble where I used it; legs and face.  </li>
            <li>As of 4 Jan 2011 I am still waiting for my refund even though the company agrees that I returned the product and met all their requirements for a full refund.</li>
            <li>and now they are saying I didn&#x27;t pay in full.  </li>
            <li>tip status still shows 3 full bars after doing my legs, so</li>
            <li>The tip status still shows 3 full bars after doing my legs, so</li>
            <li>The advertisements and commercials are very deceiving as are most things like this.  </li>
            <li>I returned the product this week and will track to ensure I recieve a full refund.</li>
            <li>I not only gave this thing a fair shake...</li>
            <li>I wish I would have bought it through the manufacturer, because then I could get a full refund.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; that comes with it is so full of perfume its unwearable.</li>
            <li>the reply received back from them was again surprising</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shameful these type companies make a fortune selling products that don&#x27;t hold true to their claims.  </li>
            <li>The instructions said not to go over one area more than three times so you really have to watch that you remember what areas you already went over.</li>
            <li>I told her on TV and the website, it said return for a full refund plus shipping and handling.</li>
            <li>Please do not get your hopes up, but if you must try it like I really wanted to believe the advertisement-make sure you return it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They really have an ingenious system of fraud.</li>
            <li>Try calling to get your money back, good luck.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product and paid full price for it......</li>
            <li>they want you to do the full trial.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, if you start to develop boil-like eruptions on your skin from this product like I did, they expect you to continue using it for the full trial period before they will pay the return shipping.  </li>
            <li>I contacted nono for a full refund, and received it within 3 days.</li>
            <li>I used the NO No for the full 60 days and no results what so ever.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about the NO</li>
            <li>I CANNOT believe for one minute that the endorsements they claim they have are true.</li>
            <li>I suggest that you follow the directions and make sure you buff after each nono use, since that really seemed to help get rid of those stubborn hairs.  </li>
            <li>I paid for it which was&#x27;nt full price as I had a voucher.</li>
            <li>Not bad...</li>
            <li>on.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, and I would recommend it for anyone who wants to remove hair quickly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve not had it since - you need to go easy for the first couple of days</li>
            <li>Got the unit quickly.  </li>
            <li>The company quickly replaced it, and since it would not be under warranty, I bought another 3 year warranty for $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Luckily I just used it on my chin and legs, if I&#x27;d used it on my face</li>
            <li>keep your expectations realistic, don&#x27;t expect magic or a miracle</li>
            <li>When I hung up the phone after ordering, I checked my bank account, and was very upset to see an authorized hold already charged on my account which, in my bank, once that is done, it already takes that amount and deducts it from my available balance, which if I don&#x27;t habe the funds available, it will go through, but will charge me an overdraft fee for it.</li>
            <li>I believe waiting three days is allowing the next batch of hair to grow to the perfect length for removal, so its easier in my skin too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be disheartened, muscle thru it just as described above.  </li>
            <li>Also, hair grows back no matter the system, so go with a more reasonable priced, better result device!</li>
            <li>I have been told that have a 60-days free trial and my account was charged on the 22nd day with the first payment of $90 (3 pmts</li>
            <li>First of all, it is finicky to use and often did nothing (you can tell because the light was not flashing).  </li>
            <li>I have to say, this is the FIRST time where they say \\&quot;pain free hair</li>
            <li>I will remain with waxing and if laser comes down in price, I&#x27;ll elect that procedure.  </li>
            <li>When I asked to speak with a manager, still trying to  get a new battery, I was put on hold for 10 more minutes</li>
            <li>Purchased this primarily for 12-20 stubborn dark chin hairs on my fair headed self.  </li>
            <li>I saw this item on the HSN network the other night and was so excited to see them selling it because I was under the impression they sold good products</li>
            <li>It makes me wonder how it got such good reviews in the first place.</li>
            <li>Anyway, after 2 months I went back to the epilator and find that works much better!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve actually had some laser hair removal to compare this to, and that hurts WAY more than this does!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually had some laser hair removal to compare this to, and that hurts WAY more than this does!</li>
            <li>Really !?!</li>
            <li>People that are satisfied with a product usually do not get on the internet to bitch, they just go on using whatever it they are using.</li>
            <li>I tried to send it back in the first 45 days because I saw zero results, and they convinced me that I needed to try it for 30 more days to see better results.</li>
            <li>I wish I read the customer reviews first!</li>
            <li>- you need to practise first!</li>
            <li>BUYER BE AWARE!</li>
            <li>Three hundred dollars later, the No No the most overpriced hair removal machine on the market!</li>
            <li>On my legs, what did come off was not as good as a clean shave with one of the new multiple blade razors, I tend to like the razor with the battery that vibrates the blade, clean shave with rarely a nick.  </li>
            <li>I had large areas that were hair free.</li>
            <li>It removes fine hair, but does nothing on anything more coarse.</li>
            <li>any results(I have light fine hair naturally.  </li>
            <li>Check the facebook page and all you will see are a few raves like &#x27;just got it and it works great&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>This is why I find reviews to be important and very helpful.  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely pain free (unlike the torture I put myself through with laser).  </li>
            <li>It appears to be a pretty cool product.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes they point out flaws that have already been fixed (like cordless models etc..) in an effort to upsell people even more.   </li>
            <li>Looks like a fun product on tv</li>
            <li>and it is worth the money to you, to get rid of said sideburns; then go ahead and buy.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to start using it on my 11 year old daughter&#x27;s legs because I thought it was better than shaving.</li>
            <li>if anything, shaving will be as effective than this product, because it works the same way.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S WORTH GOING TO HAVE THE LASER REMOVAL WHICH IS ABOUT $500</li>
            <li>well worth the effort</li>
            <li>If it worked, it was still worth it, so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s another deal where they sing its praises, rake in the money...and laugh all the way to the bank.</li>
            <li>If you feel the need to try it-make sure you purchase it when it offers a 60 guaranteed return.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised my favorite stars from the soaps would endorse this.  </li>
            <li>while it didn&#x27;t work for me, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re thinking about it.</li>
            <li>It is going to take months for the hair to start growing in more softly and thinner.  </li>
            <li>customer service DON&#x27;T MAKE ME LAUGH</li>
            <li>Like I said luckily I didn&#x27;t do my whole face, if I  had I would have a full beard.</li>
            <li>But with some sincere determination and nothing but time on my hands... I watched the dark patches of hair give way to smooth hair free skin.</li>
            <li>No matter how much time you give it, it does not remove any better than a high end electric or disposable razor.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to return the product right away and costumer servicesaid</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t shower and scrub right after, the smell stays on your skin and you&#x27;ll notice it when you rub it.  </li>
            <li>RIGHT---</li>
            <li>right?.....</li>
            <li>I could have blond hair on both sides of my face right now....</li>
            <li>(Surprise surprise, right?)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: This doesn&#x27;t feel right at all to me.</li>
            <li>and when I asked about returning it even though they gave me 60 days, they insisted 45.Also writing to them and expecting an answer right away is out of the question.</li>
            <li>Right now I am waiting to see what my attorney have to say.</li>
            <li>[yeah, right].  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t hold it just right</li>
            <li>Instead they said mine was not working right, and  sent me a replacement.</li>
            <li>the credit card number right but not our name or address.</li>
            <li>but it right now.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness I could return it right to Bed Bath and Beyond.</li>
            <li>IS RIGHT</li>
            <li>I charged the battery and followed all the directions, used the right tip</li>
            <li>I kept it up, I am lucky to have very light hair so only noticeable when the sun hits it just right.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give a true review, but so far it has worked great on my face and arms, and did an OK job on my legs.</li>
            <li>It states in the literature that it works best for dark, coarse hair and this is what I have.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to get burned, especially on curved surfaces.</li>
            <li>But with that said I&#x27;m not about to spend that much money on laser since most of my body hair is baby fine and blonde.</li>
            <li>I just want to do the right thing and post a real and true review.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to buy this &amp; it looked like a cool concept</li>
            <li>I experienced it on my own sucker&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li>So, now I have to call them again to straighten this out, but judging by the fact that they have not done anything right so far, I dont anticipate this being an easy process.</li>
            <li>and despite the fact that I had light and fairly fine hair to begin with, I STILL have the same amount of hair  </li>
            <li>It can manage only light and fine hair that almost invisible anyway.  </li>
            <li>Is it true that certain models have a higher rate of failure?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The after-treatment lotion that came in the kit has kind of a depilatory cream after-smell, and they really don&#x27;t give you much, but I&#x27;m not sure how effective it will be vs. just purchasing some hair reduction lotion at WalMart, or how my skin will react to it...</li>
            <li>I have very dark, coarse hair, so I am the perfect candidate for laser.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that works is the advertisement convincing you that the product is worth $300.00.</li>
            <li>I bought this product and, to be honest was very cautious about trying it on my face, but finally did.</li>
            <li>I must say that it is a great product if you are simply using it to remove unwanted facial hair but</li>
            <li>But after several weeks I still have not had anywhere near good results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it primarily on my face exactly as the instructions stated so the heads and face sander is still new and don&#x27;t need to be replaced</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the vanqia as i should, so it has to be the no no doing it, but you have to use it right, and you have to understand that it is burning your hair, so it does work after burning your hair so many times you root will finally die.</li>
            <li>If I can stretch my skin out right it does ok with my upper lip.   </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what to do, I can&#x27;t afford to loose this kind of money.  </li>
            <li>I were both looking very much fwd to it....</li>
            <li>He abruptly cut me off and said, \\&quot;thanks for calling, have a good day,\\&quot; and hung up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I was really excited about this product, then I became discouraged because I expected more drastic results sooner.</li>
            <li>But at the cost of this tiny piece of equipment, I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the fact that I would have to continually buy replacement parts at high prices that cost them pennies to make.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>After the wonderful reviews and the fake infermerical I deceided to give the No No a try.  </li>
            <li>I bought it mostly for my daughter who believes that has to remove the fuzz on her upper lip.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it on my legs</li>
            <li>because it didn&#x27;t do anything at all after the first time.  </li>
            <li>If you are not dedicated and consistent this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li>i have more hair than ever and burns to go along with the extra hair!  </li>
            <li>So the claw terminals hit your face first and cut it, while the hot wire is farther away.  </li>
            <li>Save your money and invest in a Silk&#x27;n SensEpil at home laser hair removal system (the first at home laser to be FDA approved).  </li>
            <li>I like this product although it isn&#x27;t as effective as I had expected.   </li>
            <li>My chin and upper lip hurt the most and I felt sun-burned and stinging, plus my chin was cut and bleeding.</li>
            <li>And I had to exfoliate again the next day to finally be able to remove it all.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the No!No!...</li>
            <li>The infommercial makes it seem like it&#x27;s going to make you smooth and soft....</li>
            <li>I should have read the reviews first.</li>
            <li>Mine is NOT the first horror story.  </li>
            <li>It works at higher settings.</li>
            <li>came to the conclusion about 3 years into it that I am willing to put up with it and call it temporary hair removal.</li>
            <li>It only removes my arm hair which is super fine.</li>
            <li>Funny coz</li>
            <li>You can get it on-line for $100 at an outside website, though, so be sure to make your purchase there instead of here.</li>
            <li>If you want fast hair removal this product is not for you!  </li>
            <li>They get you to buy their product promising they won&#x27;t charge you and THEY WILL PAY FOR S&amp;H, but that wasn&#x27;t the case!  </li>
            <li>and I remember reading that you can return it anytime but NOT the first 2 months.</li>
            <li>First, it does not work.  </li>
            <li>First, it takes forever to use, then it scorches the skin, then you have to shave over the area in any case because it just singes the hair</li>
            <li>, then you try to return the product and that is where the fun really begins.</li>
            <li>I would say if the customer service was better try it yourself as your results may be different from mine, but the company seems to try to get you to hang on to it</li>
            <li>I looked pretty funny with burn stripes on my mouth that looked like wrinkles at first glance.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews first.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given the product 4 stars for now since I just used it for the first time today, so</li>
            <li>Was also unsuccessful at getting my money back despite the 60 day warranty although they were willing to sell me more tips.  </li>
            <li>After a while it didn&#x27;t preform like it did at first.  </li>
            <li>The first warning on instructions is &amp;#34;don&#x27;t use on face!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I thought at first that it may have been me</li>
            <li>and I was more interested in facial hair removal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the results, but I gave the product 4 stars because I had to reorder extra blades.</li>
            <li>that I wanted answers to first before dropping $270.00.</li>
            <li>(Although, I&#x27;ve seen a couple of reviews where they&#x27;ve been able to get their warranty got extended because of multiple defective devices and replacements.)</li>
            <li>so just be aware...</li>
            <li>Something else to be aware of.  </li>
            <li>and they told me to do exactly what I was doing which wasn&#x27;t working</li>
            <li>After my first session, I figured out it takes an eternity to do just your legs.  </li>
            <li>I had course hair and when I first used the nono&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wish I had read these reviews first.  </li>
            <li>and it only trimmed the top of the hair</li>
            <li>for 11 months, for the first 6 months I did it twice a week as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;revolutionary technology\\&quot; is a hot wire that is supposed to burn the hair away, powered by a rechargable battery.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was defective.  </li>
            <li>(note  you have to shave first......)    </li>
            <li>When I was browsing the various sites for the NoNo hair removal products, I noted that most of them were associated with the company.  </li>
            <li>Thanks everyone!</li>
            <li>sure thank you for helping others like me keep from doing the same!!</li>
            <li>As a cosmetologist I have tried many of the current ways to remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>After that first time, I could never get it to duplicate the results.</li>
            <li>It simply glided over most of the hair without doing anything.</li>
            <li>I am also affraid that the hair on my face will come back darker and more prominant than before.</li>
            <li>The smell of burnt hair didn&#x27;t really bother me, but the fact that it didn&#x27;t even take off one piece of hair did!</li>
            <li>They refused to refund me my money because I kept it beyond the first 45 days, even though it was at their request.  </li>
            <li>and I used it exactly how the video told me.</li>
            <li>First off, I didn&#x27;t buy this product through Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I bought the device for, and it&#x27;s doing exactly what I had hoped it would.</li>
            <li>First, the product didn&#x27;t work and</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even burn off the entire top of the hair.  </li>
            <li>I now know how hot something has to get for a follicle to die.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot.  </li>
            <li>Hot wire.  </li>
            <li>I followed all instructions exactly.</li>
            <li>I have not only more hair, but I am cut up and burnt all the time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since my many trys I now have ingrown hairs that turned into sores &amp; now I have noticeable scars, I truly can tell you this not only does not do what it is said to do, but I now have bumps under my chin area thanks to NO!</li>
            <li>Against my better judgement, I ordered through the official website on a trial 60-day money back TRIPLE Guarantee, which meant I supposedly would not pay postage coming in or going out for this device.</li>
            <li>Thanks guys!</li>
            <li>I used it exactly how they instructed</li>
            <li>really wish I could give it no stars!</li>
            <li>the first time i tried it was on my face, it burned.</li>
            <li>suggest facial hair around mouth can be safely removed.  </li>
            <li>Upon redoing the order, the preferred price became evident.</li>
            <li>STA MENGHIA WOULD DO BETTER TO GET RID OF MY FACIAL HAIR</li>
            <li>My first go on the thigh area</li>
            <li>you must watch every section first</li>
            <li>First off, beware the return shipping policy...</li>
            <li>Also make sure if you change any information when ordering, go back and start from the beginning.  </li>
            <li>Once you get better with the technique and how to use your no no properly, this problem will disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have been working on just my face for the first two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Followed the instructions exactly.  </li>
            <li>The smell of burning hair the first time I used it concerned me, but the appliance itself does not burn the skin.</li>
            <li>I first tried a patch on my forearm just to get the feel of the product.</li>
            <li>On top of that they charged my extra 100 dollars after a month.</li>
            <li>First off, if you use it on you face, you will most likely burn yourself.  </li>
            <li>I tried to give the unit an opportunity to work, I gave it longer than 60 days because I wanted to make sure that I was using it properly, but when I still had to razor shave</li>
            <li>, I wasted a perfectly good shower on not shaving my bikini area.  </li>
            <li>Now all of a sudden on the submit page it says my $104.00 payment is the first of THREE!!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when i got the product and was really looking forward to be hair free on my upper lip n chin.</li>
            <li>I feel that it may take several weeks to achieve that clean look for a long term, BUT I&#x27;m sold and very satisfied with my no no.</li>
            <li>Speaking of yuck, if you got a house full of guests and you want to clear them out, try this!  </li>
            <li>And they also have the nonohair removal system which was probably not worth more than $50!</li>
            <li>Anyway, for those who are thinking of purchasing, don&#x27;t buy as it really does not work and customer service is interested only in extracting more money.  </li>
            <li>Most feedback showed that the device was only half effective in eliminating hair growth plus you couldn&#x27;t use it on the face.    </li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t want that blue light around my eyes!</li>
            <li>Oh, and a word to the wise -- don&#x27;t try to send it back before the minimum 45 day trial period is up, or you have to cover the cost of shipping it back yourself.</li>
            <li>I find it very Fishy how most of the 5 star reviews are all on same day.</li>
            <li>I wanted what I saw on TV, the facial product, I got one that was only good for legs.  </li>
            <li>It also DOES handle the fine hairs on the TOP of my upper thighs, but the coarser hair under my upper thigh?  </li>
            <li>THOSE POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE PROBABLY ALL LIES created by the manufacturer, just like their phoney web sites!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What bothers me about some of these responses to the positive reviews is people accusing others and calling them liars....</li>
            <li>If all the reviews on any website are positive, be leary, because it is paid for by NoNo.</li>
            <li>a lot when I first got it, but wasn&#x27;t disciplined in using it as much as I should, so</li>
            <li>, they really didn&#x27;t buff much of anything no matter how many times I went over the spot or in different \\&quot;buffing\\&quot; motions (circular, rubbing).  </li>
            <li>first use did absolutely nothing to my hair</li>
            <li>so you never really have a clean hair free skin.</li>
            <li>so you never really have a clean hair free skin.  </li>
            <li>The pros always do it a little better!</li>
            <li>It looked so simple, easy and convincing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ones I used seemed to become less effective over time.</li>
            <li>To treat a large area you would need to spend hours on it.  </li>
            <li>I received a flyer in large stores catalogue mail outs, and it was for nono hair removal.  </li>
            <li>Please read all reviews as this product looks like it certainly doesn&#x27;t work for anyone.</li>
            <li>My concern is the large number of defective no-no&#x27;s being returned or replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Zipper case broke within 7 days, large tip broke &lt;</li>
            <li>To all those who wrote positive reviews on this product, they are very misleading.  </li>
            <li>This product may work for people with peach fuzz, fine hair but not on coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t you know, all my fine hairs are back</li>
            <li>This only works in my opinion on fine hair on arms..</li>
            <li>Enter the buffing pad (essentially this is extremely fine sandpaper).  </li>
            <li>would not recommend this product to anyone who doesnt have blonde fine</li>
            <li>So I looked at the smaller attachment, the wire was fine.  </li>
            <li>I went back to the website to see about returning the product and found the \\&quot;fine print\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But there was a lot of fine print, in light gray on the white background, that only appeared when it came time to charge my credit card.  </li>
            <li>I will always check this site for now on about a product It is hard to believe it got a good review from the program view.</li>
            <li>If you really want a smooth finish that actually last this isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
            <li>I have light hairs, and elder facial hairs, and it doesn&#x27;t really work on the face.</li>
            <li>If it actually did work for those few, great for them.  </li>
            <li>A lot of pain and huge eritation which last for 3 days!</li>
            <li>I also had a huge issue with the actual purchase.</li>
            <li>and i cannot see much of a difference, we will see how it ends..</li>
            <li>I agree with everyone about the smell, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me much.  </li>
            <li>my 60 day guarantee will have expired so I am really nervous that this is just a ploy to get out of paying my refund.  </li>
            <li>stars cuz its very expansive and takes a lot time to do its job</li>
            <li>didnt do the job of removing hair very well.    </li>
            <li>but I also didn&#x27;t pay as much as everyone else did.</li>
            <li>But they don&#x27;t really WANT you to return it - so they&#x27;ve made it a real hassel to get said refund.</li>
            <li>Of course I let too much time go and kept it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been seeing commercials &amp; really wanted to buy this product.</li>
            <li>According to them it takes months to see real progress so those reviews shouldn&#x27;t even be counted.    </li>
            <li>Not so much as a courtesy fob off call.</li>
            <li>Very disapointing product.  </li>
            <li>and I need fast hair removal so this product was not for me.    </li>
            <li>As a man trying to remove unwanted chest hair it does not seem to work and it is very time consuming.</li>
            <li>I would much rather prefer shaving and deal with razor burns vs dealing with the time consuming hassel with the NO NO.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t do the job of removing hair very well.     </li>
            <li>My mom ordered it for me because the commercial made it sound miraculous.  </li>
            <li>(like how fabulous it really is if only I&#x27;d give it another try).</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a pre-med student, so I really don&#x27;t have spare time).</li>
            <li>Very deceiving practices.</li>
            <li>It stops and starts on whim, and refuses to light up even though I am following instructions and pushing it against the skin and hair shaft as instructed.</li>
            <li>It was very embarrassing.  </li>
            <li>I have light to medium coarse hair on my legs, and while it did not remove all of the hair (you can feel stubble),</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll update this review after I&#x27;ve spent more time with my nono.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll update this review after I&#x27;ve spent more time with my nono.</li>
            <li>Oh, also, it really did make my leg hair grow in thinner, but not lighter.  </li>
            <li>and really I don&#x27;t think there has been any change in the 2 years I have been using it.</li>
            <li>Anyway - thanks to all those who have taken the time to write a review.</li>
            <li>REALLY WELL.</li>
            <li>An absolute godsend for anybody struggling with polycystic ovaries.</li>
            <li>I have had this for six months and it really does absolutely nothing except</li>
            <li>Mine looks larger than the ones on TV, they are free from cords.  </li>
            <li>The box was incredibly damaged upon receiving it, and the instructions are vague and not at all what the product is advertised as.  </li>
            <li>It is a disgraceful money-stealing scam and should be legally challenged in all countries.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really decrease anything, just a painless way to remove some hair, not even all of it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>If this item really did all it was supposed to do.....</li>
            <li>Yes, there is a 60-days guarantee where you can try no-no for free, and if you don&#x27;t like it, you can send it back, no questions asked.</li>
            <li>(let&#x27;s say 5...and that&#x27;s being generous), you would really offer no assistance to the customer once their 2-year warranty expires?\\</li>
            <li>And that is too high!  </li>
            <li>one star is too high a rating!</li>
            <li>Almost no hair removal after a week straight of use!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I chose to pay the whole thing at once,</li>
            <li>So, you don&#x27;t really know it&#x27;s not working until way after 60 days.</li>
            <li>Instead I have a very burnt face.</li>
            <li>thanks people for taking time.to write reviews</li>
            <li>On my face, it really does not work.</li>
            <li>SOOOOOO, if you REALLY want one.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>The ladies at the Reno Sephora, at the Summit mall, were very helpful when I visited the store and asked for assistance with the product.    </li>
            <li>Thanks,  Sandy</li>
            <li>My hair thinned out after time and now grows in really patchy,</li>
            <li>Thanks,</li>
            <li>Who wants to go around with half-hairy legs or shave their legs twice?</li>
            <li>product did absolutely NOTHING for ANY of the coarser hair</li>
            <li>Those hairs are very stubborn.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had much luck with things sold on TV</li>
            <li>You really cant over do it.</li>
            <li>Not so much.  </li>
            <li>I tried it for 6 weeks with absolutely zero results.</li>
            <li>But what I did get was an email offer the next day to purchase the product with free shipping because it seemed that while I had browsed the site, I did not make a purchase.</li>
            <li>I have dealt with excess hair for years, and it is the one thing that really bothers me.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the No No, but you have to remember to be patient!</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for writing the reviews.</li>
            <li>I suppose I cannot really rate the no</li>
            <li>This is the only thing they made easy-the return of the item free of charge.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again for warning.</li>
            <li>I purchased it over the phone straight from the company.</li>
            <li>think the buffer pad is where the real hair removal happens</li>
            <li>I should have known that there was a reason it was so much cheaper than the model advertised on T.V.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work.  </li>
            <li>I was really sold on the product You have saved me and probably millions of people lots of money</li>
            <li>I believe the whole thing is a scam.</li>
            <li>Any hair removal is a very time consuming process, I don&#x27;t care what method you use.  </li>
            <li>I had very course chin hair, and my chin felt like sandpaper when I ran my hand over my chin area for about two weeks.  </li>
            <li>This really does NOT work , but forget that - the company itself is a SCAM company</li>
            <li>/&gt;1st sign of SCAM was that their Advertisement on TV didn&#x27;t really say the price...</li>
            <li>All I got out of it was the smell of burned hair, and after using it, I had just as much hair as before using it.</li>
            <li>Really???  </li>
            <li>After a couple weeks of sporadic uses, I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in my hair thickness/darkness, but the condition of the device itself.</li>
            <li>So much easier.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an absolute scam.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>What a complete waste of good money.  </li>
            <li>I honestly have never been motivated enough about a product purchase to actually write a review, but I feel this is warranted:  </li>
            <li>First off i will start by saying i only ordered cause it say good for black women  </li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Easy enough to use, but I have a life to live and do not wish to invest the time they say it will take to get results.</li>
            <li>After the first time I used it I sent it back to make sure I received my close to $400.00 refund as soon as possible.   </li>
            <li>I felt like it was not doing anything much (other than pissing off my husband, and consuming my precious time).  </li>
            <li>The other lists the face as ok &amp; has &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; tips.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am actually atching the comercial and got so excited, I came on to Amazon thinking I would</li>
            <li>Ok so my husband purchased the pink no!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to finally order the no!no! hair removal system</li>
            <li>This updated version is COMPLETELY PAINLESS to use and has a much higher percentage of success than the old model.    </li>
            <li>Mexico never really cared about the Chevy \\&quot;NOVA,\\&quot; because NO VA means no go in Spanish, although it may have been a good car, the name was less represent able.  </li>
            <li>When the first version of the No No Classic was released a while back, not many people were impressed.</li>
            <li>At first the hair was just singed, so I thought maybe I needed to go over it a few more times as the instructions said.</li>
            <li>I have more coarse hair, so I can&#x27;t speak for finer haired results, but it took for me to do it and at the end it was super rough and wasn&#x27;t all gone anyway.  </li>
            <li>In large bold letter, they advertised the online price as only $89 plus $15 shipping.  </li>
            <li>Do be warned, if you have very light hair, or very dark skin laser hair removal may not be advanced enough at this point to treat you.  </li>
            <li>I cant believe the level of deception that&#x27;s being advertised here, it should not be legal to falsify the results of a product as much as is done for the New NONO.</li>
            <li>bought the product on a special discount using a promo on the TV commercial.  </li>
            <li>The unit burned his skin, and the stench of burning hair was so strong, I had to open my windows in February to clear the air.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it consistently every other day for about 6 months and have seen a huge decrease in the hair growth on my legs.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately I charged this to my Amex card, and Amex is now battling the Radiency Co., on my behalf, to get them  to cease charging me $89.94 a month, for an item I returned long ago.   </li>
            <li>The only reason they want you to try it for the full 45-60 days is because then they have all your payments.</li>
            <li>Like most people looking for the golden system for home hair removal, I ordered the No No.  It turned out to be a complete waste of my time and money.  </li>
            <li>that being said, one needs to keep the unit level inorder to obtain consistant results, which is very difficult to do when it is continiously losing power...thank you for your time, have a wonderful life!  </li>
            <li>The green light was on and all it did was burn the top part of the hair off and left my skin itchy and still had to shave.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see one of the first things it said was NOT to use it on your face.  </li>
            <li>I saw this on one of the shopping channels (like that&#x27;s not bad enough) and fell for it.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s more $$ down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s more $$ down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are slick, hide the true price in the fine print.</li>
            <li>I eventually ended up returning it to HSN, for what it was advertised to do, and what it actually did certainly wasn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have had to buy a new version from NO NO!</li>
            <li>She had no interest in investigating whether my particular model was faulty - it was all my fault.</li>
            <li>and that is it actually ends up creating more hairgrowth coming back than before for some women.  </li>
            <li>Luckily it went away without any lasting damages or scarring after I stop using it.  </li>
            <li>I asked for a replacement, i was sent a different color one, but I liked the pink one.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried the Nono, it actually worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>WHICH, is one of the MAIN reasons for ME purchasing the unit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I&#x27;d seen good reviews on this product too though, so I actually tried it for a few months.  </li>
            <li>i would only recommend this product if you love your facial hair and are in to getting your skin burned.</li>
            <li>Not only does this device not remove hair adequately, but it also creates ingrown hairs, and does not work on tan skin.</li>
            <li>If your hair grows back quickly with shaving it will grow back just as quickly with this.  </li>
            <li>I bought the classic no no</li>
            <li>(it was only 1 payment of 2, but they quickly remedied that issue when I emailed them - I have been fully refunded as of today).</li>
            <li>Only I was lucky</li>
            <li>Not only do you spend a tremendous amount of time doing it, it doesn&#x27;t even give results.</li>
            <li>and I would still have to go shave to feel confident enough to go into public!  </li>
            <li>Funny, I have seen the infomercial many times and that was never prominently mentioned.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was buying an older model to save some money.  </li>
            <li>No Skin seems to be effective in preventing or at least alleviating a full blown pimple if you apply it enough.</li>
            <li>Also have medium to heavy amount of very light hair on my arms and thought I would just give this a thorough workout during the trial.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll leave you high and dry...with a $270.00 paperweight...</li>
            <li>Again, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I will admit that I didn&#x27;t have high expectations of it, because I thought if laser didn&#x27;t work this probably wouldn&#x27;t either.  </li>
            <li>WHen I first went online to see reviews of the NONO hair removal system, I found only positive endorsements.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be the solution to my problem, but after reading other reviews and conducting my own trial, this is definitely not it.</li>
            <li>However, Radiancy quickly released a new and vastly improved version called the No No 8800 series.</li>
            <li>but I have a really tiny stall shower, and this is WAY more convenient for me than trying to shave sitting on the toilet since I can use it while watching TV, etc.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t smart enough to read the reviews first.  </li>
            <li>It is only good for the legs and chest and considering I don&#x27;t have hair on my chest and very little on my legs, it will probably sit in the closet until I toss it out.</li>
            <li>all worded almost exactly the same and all with a link to the company website, which miraculously is only offering the \\&quot;special introductory trial\\</li>
            <li>Laser may be more expensive but it WORKS and waxing is cheap and fast and it WORKS.</li>
            <li>and I really like it so far.</li>
            <li>I have had this product for nearly a year, and it does absolutely NOTHING it claims.</li>
            <li>Better to wax than waste money on this.  </li>
            <li>Forget underarms, legs which are normal thickness and ladies, don&#x27;t even hope for bikini or Brazilian.  </li>
            <li>no no SUCKS</li>
            <li>/&gt;She tells me that it is pretty much a product that burns off the hairs, stinking up the house and leaving her with a lasting burning sensation when she was finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not yet sure how long they will last,</li>
            <li>not yet sure how long they will last,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Spend a few more dollars and get a RIO Laser those work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a waste of consumers money and precious time.  </li>
            <li>When I called the number to tell them I was returning it (a required step, in order to get your \\&quot;return number\\&quot;), I was interrogated by a male operator who asked for uncomfortably intimate details on exactly where and</li>
            <li>I mostly use an epilator (shave occasionally) and use the No!No! in between for maintenance and long term treatment.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely write another review after using it for a year, but seeing results as fast as I did I don&#x27;t have any doubt that the No No will do exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>and once you get past the smell its way more convenient than shaving and much nicer than waxing.</li>
            <li>I am glad I didn&#x27;t waste my time or money on the product for once.</li>
            <li>When there are a small handful of positive reviews to hundreds of negative ones, it wouldn&#x27;t be very wise on my part to buy it anyway.</li>
            <li>While holding the skin taut, I tried slower, waited some weeks for my new wounds to heal, then I tried faster (more cuts and missing skin).</li>
            <li>The process is totally painless, relatively speedy, and as easy as can be.</li>
            <li>I did, I kept it for a few months, but found out very quickly that this does absolutely nothing for</li>
            <li>However the hair grows right back....</li>
            <li>The hair grows right back.  </li>
            <li>and I will Never purchase anything from Amazon, unless they do the right thing and credit my card back.</li>
            <li>I hope you do the right thing for future business.</li>
            <li>As soon as I saw this, I called right back and got another guy</li>
            <li>This product works slightly better then rubbing your legs with plain paper.</li>
            <li>A label was smacked right on the outside of the NoNo box, which was trashed by the time it got to me!</li>
            <li>Before I go further I will say that I have baby fine hair, not coarse.</li>
            <li>, I still have prominent blue veins apparent on my shins, veins that surfaced only after my use of the no!no!     </li>
            <li>When I got the light flashing it was extremely time consuming.</li>
            <li>I am a very hairy African American woman who had a full 5&#x27;o clock shadow by noon, when I waxed or tweezed.</li>
            <li>but it seems like you would have to have a new buffer for each use........</li>
            <li>you live and learn.</li>
            <li>I never got my new</li>
            <li>No Hair have upgraded to a new one</li>
            <li>The one I ordered from the site should have been a new item.</li>
            <li>Some were online \\&quot;newspapers\\&quot; reporting new technology.  </li>
            <li>I had to call 5 times before I got a live person.</li>
            <li>Sure, it may slow down hair regrowth, but trust me, it all COMES BACK, and more!</li>
            <li>(and yes I was using the buffer, the blue light remained steadily on and it seems I was doing everything right; it did say the product does not work well on really fine hair nor on really coarse hair which leaves a narrow group the product MIGHT potentially work for - some of my hair issues fell into the correct range</li>
            <li>You have to use it regularly, but after trying epilation, waxing etc., this is the only thing that works and is pain free.  </li>
            <li>I still shave, but repeated use of the no no has left me much smoother much longer.</li>
            <li>This was over a week ago, and my chin still mildly hurts, and even with the soothing cream provided, moisturizers, lotions, and petroleum jelly, my skin is STILL peeling and flaking and dry.</li>
            <li>If you really think about it, most people that write product reviews have negative experience.</li>
            <li>it would be much easier to shave the hair with a shaver.. same result, also painless and no smell, and much cheaper</li>
            <li>, whenever I used the larger tip, the red light always came and the No-No stopped no matter how I angled it.</li>
            <li>But even after several weeks of use, following the instructions, I have never gotten a smooth spot on my legs and all it did on my face was burn.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s short, it sticks straight out, it is VERY noticeable, and when my hair touches my face it STICKS TO MY FACE.  </li>
            <li>No Co. to STOP charging your credit card even 1 1/2 months AFTER you have returned the unsatisfactory item, this is a product and company that you should stay very far away from.  </li>
            <li>The refurb battery had an even shorter life than the original did and after the second request to go through what would have only been a battery replacement again, the company informed me that I would have to purchase a new</li>
            <li>Newer technology that is intriguing and will see how it works out long term.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 59 years old today!</li>
            <li>Your first red flag should be the fact that a d-list soap opera actress is hawking this product.  </li>
            <li>Two days after my first (and only) use of the no!</li>
            <li>This was the first time I bought something because of a TV commercial.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>It was a complete joke!</li>
            <li>, I only used the first treatment level.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, the makers of no!no! are simply price-gouging customers (and wasting their time by burning the hair first) in order to sell buffing pads.  </li>
            <li>Magic pipe dream wonder products usually end up on TV infomercials.....</li>
            <li>I am willing to wait an extra day or two to get it.</li>
            <li>It also makes this smell, which I showered afterwards so it shouldn&#x27;t have been a big deal, but I could smell that smell off and on the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Considering how shady this company is, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I used this daily and never saw the first result.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle product and definitely didn&#x27;t zap the hair away in a minute but with consistent use it IS working for me.  </li>
            <li>Not only did I do exactly what I was supposed to do</li>
            <li>First, the product simply does not work.</li>
            <li>First thing in the morning, the next day, which by now was the third day, I called first thing in the morning around 7am.</li>
            <li>I was thinking about giving it the 60 day trial since I already paid my first payment, but after reading these reviews, im going to write REFUSED on it and send it back</li>
            <li>customer service reps are professional liars and should be reviewed!</li>
            <li>I was enticed by the company&#x27;s offer of a triple money back guarantee (*see note below*), but I was worried that they wouldn&#x27;t follow through with their promise if the product didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everyone should be contacting the better business bureau and whoever else may help about all their problems with the product and the company that sells it being so shady.</li>
            <li>This products is grossly over priced and the web site missadvertises the price, They said it would be 110 but each month following the original purchace date they charged and additional hundred.</li>
            <li>Full marks to nono, pity it did not</li>
            <li>Please know that if you buy this product and pay in full, you CANNOT return it, after 60 days, for even a partial refund.</li>
            <li>and it most definitely does not slow down the growth.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t really say one way or the other right now.</li>
            <li>It took me six long calls over 2 months just to get the RMA in order to ship this back to the company for free (which they claimed was part of my purchase agreement).  </li>
            <li>This thing is a waste of money   it breaks so easy pls.</li>
            <li>Not safe, evidently, to use on the face, and so that&#x27;s a No No for the \\&quot;full</li>
            <li>I use mine multiple times though the instructions say only two pulses at a time when I am breaking out or have a full blown pimple.</li>
            <li>although I was promised a double my money back guarantee they made me keep it and charged my credit card for the full price before I was allowed to return it.  </li>
            <li>When talking to customer service, they stated that they were aware of the problem, yet I would still have to pay for the shipping to have it fixed a second time.</li>
            <li>And considering the amount of time it takes to complete a full-body treatment, not to mention having to do it every other day, it would just make far more sense to simply shave once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>DO find that this product DOES work FAMOUSLY on FINE little hairs.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After carefully reading all instructions carefully, I couldn&#x27;t figure out why I could smell the burnt hair of the very fine hairs of my face</li>
            <li>After reading 10+ pages of reviews on this site I found only 4 or 5 positive experiences.  </li>
            <li>Company will harass you once they have your credit card and falsely charge more money!</li>
            <li>NO,\\&quot; I am more or less biased, never having tried the product, reading the related reviews</li>
            <li>I had slight facial hair like most women.  </li>
            <li>The unit burns the hair, sure, but it takes several SUPER SLOW strokes over the same spot to leave the skin hair free but with black dots corresponding the singed hair.</li>
            <li>It is not easy, it hurts and it does not remove the hair easily.  </li>
            <li>The hair looks thinner to a certain extent because you&#x27;re not getting shaving stubble, but you&#x27;d get the same result from waxing.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I called to order it and the guy on the phone told me the first payment, which was $104.00, I told him I would have to call back the next day because I didn&#x27;t have enough in my account to cover it until my direct deposit came in the next day, and he promised it wouldnt be charged until the next two days anyway, so I went ahead and told him if that was the case, then ok.</li>
            <li>If the bars go down on the display, clean the tips and if that doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s time to change them.  </li>
            <li>but you have to wait until the 45th day you&#x27;ve owned it to claim it; they do this in the hopes that there will be so little time left that you won&#x27;t be able to pack it and ship it in the fifteen days allotted.</li>
            <li>Not a quick fix at all, but at a fraction of the price of professional laser hair removal it is worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read most of the reviews on here and most people seem to have had a bad time with it</li>
            <li>Stay clear.</li>
            <li>If your willing to put the time in and spend the money, it&#x27;s worth it for working on small areas.</li>
            <li>, I also advised that they had replied to my husband when the email was clearly from me.</li>
            <li>: clear DVD instructions -</li>
            <li>I used it on my legs where I do not have who knows how much hair as I waxed and used Burn&#x27;s (German company) extraction machine all my life.  </li>
            <li>I thought no-no would completely rid off my hair.</li>
            <li>Meaning, it completely removed the hair in some spots, but not in others.  </li>
            <li>Please do not waste your time or your money.</li>
            <li>I have done professional laser hair removal before</li>
            <li>and so I can tell this is doing the same thing at a MUCH slower pace.</li>
            <li>So far, my underarm hair is 100% gone while my leg and arm hair are 50% gone.</li>
            <li>I wish so much that I would have read Amazon reviews prior to making my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>People,  Did anyone else notice that even the 4 &amp; 5 star reviews only say they&#x27;re trying it and have not seen much?  </li>
            <li>I continue to use it with modest satisfaction.   </li>
            <li>I just bought my No No a few days ago.</li>
            <li>They say that the only really PERMANENT solution to unwanted hair is electrolysis...</li>
            <li>However, I have friends who are completely hairless</li>
            <li>They close the line at 5 - probably too many complaint calls.</li>
            <li>This is one time I am glad I didn&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews.    </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t like falling for late night</li>
            <li>I have only used it for a week and am very dissastisifed with the product.</li>
            <li>After professional hair removal, I bought this product as a safety measure and upkeep.</li>
            <li>Save your money on a professional laser removal appt.  </li>
            <li>This is completely unprofessional and lacks any semblance of customer service.</li>
            <li>I finally got a real person and was told to wait another 7-10 days for my refund.  </li>
            <li>1 treatment costs as much as this set and will actually work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me about 45-60 minutes to complete both legs.</li>
            <li>did have to go over a few areas more than once, and because I have such sensitive skin</li>
            <li>maybe I won&#x27;t have to go over the same area as much (about 3 or 4 times on</li>
            <li>I reluctantly kept the device longer then the 60 days money back guarantee period (even though the product wasn&#x27;t really producing said results).</li>
            <li>(I used on only one side of my face to see if it was really doing anything).  </li>
            <li>what a complete rip off.</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;miracle from the Twilight Zone\\&quot; sells for as much as 200 bucks on the net too.  </li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t have clear or concise answers for any of my questions.  </li>
            <li>but it takes forever to complete the process.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping the company will honour their promises to completely refund what I paid for this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Repeat this process at least three to four times in one session, and after three months or more</li>
            <li>and it would cost a considerable amount of money to do so</li>
            <li>therefore believe that training is required for the customer services unless the company policy or vision is to direct all customers to the premium number for some sort of gain.</li>
            <li>Naturally you will smell the burning of hair.  </li>
            <li>this by far being the strangest thing I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
            <li>I bought the NONO and so far I like it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a sensitive area</li>
            <li>I bought it directly from the No No company.</li>
            <li>The hair grows back just as fast as if shaving.  </li>
            <li>and you may be surprised.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re causing your hair growing cycles to stagger, like when I get patchy hair growth after frequent waxing/shaving.  </li>
            <li>They said the deposit money I paid would go straight back into my account when they received the &#x27;No No&#x27; machine</li>
            <li>If you have, send it straight back.</li>
            <li>Please do not waste any money on this product, I will be returning it a.s.a.p.</li>
            <li>Both of these products did not work anywhere near what the promos lead u to believe.</li>
            <li>My hair is growing back much slower than it used to.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like the difference of getting your hair professionally colored and doing a box dye job at home...</li>
            <li>I was really psyched about finally getting rid of my mustache.  </li>
            <li>So far every time I&#x27;ve used it</li>
            <li>as I was really hoping to get rid of my facial hair</li>
            <li>So I guess I&#x27;ve thrown away nearly $300.</li>
            <li>It causes a pinching sensation that is far from Painless.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>WOW..</li>
            <li>When I hit next, instead of the expected grand total of $104.00, it was nearly $400.00.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anywhere else though (stomach, chest, legs, etc.), it&#x27;s COMPLETELY ineffective.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product after much consideration of the possible pros and cons.</li>
            <li>I am in a Professional office.  </li>
            <li>PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS a complete SCAM, SCAM,</li>
            <li>In the infomercial, they don&#x27;t really show anyone up close as they&#x27;re using the product, just from farther away, so there is no visual proof that it works before buying it.</li>
            <li>It has been 4 business days so far and no email.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times since I purchased it.</li>
            <li>you have to use it daily in order to get it to work, but it really does not work.  </li>
            <li>I got a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach after seeing more than 90% of the reviews were negative.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time or money.</li>
            <li>during that period of time and making a profit out of it even if you ultimately return the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an absolute scam</li>
            <li>do not waste your time or money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have spent most of my adult life trying everything on my face to get rid of the stubborn chin and upper lip growth and this is the only product that has worked for me.  </li>
            <li>The device stopped working completely in about 8 weeks</li>
            <li>Save your money and pay a professional.</li>
            <li>Beyond offers this product for around $250..not to mention you can use a coupon on it..</li>
            <li>After a few days of trying someone finally answered &amp; I was able to return it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t suggest buying this product as I followed all the instructions, used it for a few weeks a few times a week without any good results.  </li>
            <li>All it did WAS MAKE THE HAIR MORE THICK AND BLACKER, LIKE A MAN&#x27;S BIERD.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care what they say about everyone loving it that is false advertisement and according to the reviews I read ( all of them)</li>
            <li>First a little bit of the positive: the No</li>
            <li>It has saved myself and I am sure numerous other women the money, frustration, and apparently facial burns.  </li>
            <li>It takes four times longer than just shaving, hours a week, actually... and then they want you to let the hair it didn&#x27;t get to grow back to a certain length so you can go over the area again... and again... and AGAIN!</li>
            <li>Most laser/electrolysis combo salons are lazy and inexperienced in electrolysis which is very time consuming.</li>
            <li>I actually schedule this in my calendar to do it 3 times a week for the first 6 weeks, then 2 times a week, following the recommended usage in the instructions.</li>
            <li>dissatified and was unaware it was the older model before I used it</li>
            <li>What woman can&#x27;t be caught by the commercial, even though the first red flag is that on the one I taped, no price was given.  </li>
            <li>There is never less hair.</li>
            <li>Tria only works on dark hair and light skin, but no no works on any hair any skin type.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they wear out quickly and need replacing after going over HALF a leg.  </li>
            <li>removed most hair from face but had a rash and the hair just grew back as usual.</li>
            <li>I ordered the new model and received the old one had to open box to see item, I tried it and it work somewhat but not altogether.</li>
            <li>but I read various reviews on line and there were enough positive one that I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li>It takes a long time and I really don&#x27;t have time to do it 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li>Interesting that there are no good reviews on this item.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately not what was expected.</li>
            <li>properly.you really have to move as slowly as you can over an area (without the light turning red of course)</li>
            <li>I used it on my legs on found that it took forever to use on the entire thing, the smell of burning hair filled my house, not all hair was removed on the first few tries.</li>
            <li>This old model incorporates a blade which cuts the skin if not very carefully used.</li>
            <li>All the negative reviews are true!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s seems that my hair grows back faster and in new places.</li>
            <li>You must purchase new replacement solutions and buffing pads regularly.</li>
            <li>I live in Alabama and out of the blue, I get a letter from a collection agency saying I owe $150-195 or something.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other has a battery to be charged up.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found positive &amp; negatives for both so far.</li>
            <li>I write straight up what I think about a product -- good or bad.</li>
            <li>I write straight up what I think about a product -- good or bad.</li>
            <li>Now I am reading all the negative reviews from Amazon,,,,, I am so glad I sent it back.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t send this product back fast enough.</li>
            <li>After a while of using it, it does make the hair not grow back as much, my doctor recommended me to use it with vanqia a prescription for unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li>The terminals are like claws protruding much farther than the wire, and the wire is ten times farther back.  </li>
            <li>The representative suggested to her to get the black no-no (no-no for men) as those rarely got returned.</li>
            <li>Instead they replied to my husband (obviously they had not taken the time to read to the end as i clearly stated my name)and informed that I should direct my query to their 0844 ect ect number if I required an answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I went back to my regular shaver which I decided was much faster, easier, and efficient.</li>
            <li>but why waste so much money on a Gimmick that doesn&#x27;t really do its job ?&lt;</li>
            <li>The representative &#x27;knew what I meant&#x27; and she said I had to use the product quickly and firmly -</li>
            <li>So, I decided to just test the NoNo out on my right leg from the knee down.  </li>
            <li>I have done laser, but stopped....and the first rule in laser is to not use any other hair removal technique.</li>
            <li>Everyone who has tried to return it seems to have had major issues.</li>
            <li>You have to jump through so many hoops to send it back, and I&#x27;m not confident I&#x27;ll ever see my money back from it.  </li>
            <li>It was even on Dr. Oz, apparently he hasn&#x27;t read the reviews either!  </li>
            <li>instructions tell you to go over a small area 3-4 times and if the area needs more treatment after that to come back to it later after your skin has had time to \\&quot;rest\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>That was the major point.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason no other company invented a hair removal that works on HEAT</li>
            <li>Subsequently it toook three months of phone calls (each time I was assured the refund was in progress) and finally the threat of legal action to FINALLY get a refund.</li>
            <li>I want the hairs to grow back quickly so I can shoot them down again.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these a few years ago and want to warn anyone interested in getting it - Don&#x27;t do it!  </li>
            <li>I have had my no no for going on two years, I have the older model not the newer one, and only paid 75.00 for the entire system when Dillard&#x27;s stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li>It was hard to get used to the sound, but it works.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product if you have a little patience at the start - I&#x27;m in it for the long haul and think this is a very useful product.</li>
            <li>The consensus is that this product DOES NOT WORK, doesn&#x27;t work as advertised, is cheaply constructed, shoddy, unreliable.</li>
            <li>The smell of burning hair didn&#x27;t bother me too much, but i found that it only worked on decently long hair-no leg stubble.</li>
            <li>I have blonde hair, so my hair growth is NOT heavy.</li>
            <li>I marked RETURN TO SENDER for Canada Post, otherwise I would have had to pay a further charge to return the product.  </li>
            <li>i used it on my face and neck and legs nothing barely and hair was gone my face was burnt</li>
            <li>I thought wow, I don&#x27;t have to tweez my facial hair..</li>
            <li>apparently I bought junk.</li>
            <li>definitely no where NEAR the pain of an epilator or those so-called \\&quot;pain</li>
            <li>But No No is what it says it is, a big no no as far a eliminating body hair.</li>
            <li>I stopped using this product altogehter when I developed a rash on both sides of my face in the sideburn area, which is like a ton of tiny pimples.</li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde, so my skin and hair are too ligjt for it to work.</li>
            <li>I contacted the customer service via email,to ask them if it could be repaired or had to be replaced, the reply surprised me as I was expecting a list of recommended companies for fixing the fault or a simple it can not be repaired.</li>
            <li>I only wanted to know where to get it fixed</li>
            <li>Ladies, I have had real laser hair removal, and there is absolutely no reason why this product would work the way it says it does.  </li>
            <li>There is absolutely no comparison of how REAL laser hair removal works and burning your hair to root.  </li>
            <li>not work and all  that nono offers is a second hand machine with 3 months warranty for $120.00 + postage</li>
            <li>/&gt;the drive band will not last ,the nono can&#x27;t be fixed and no one at head office gives a toss&lt;br</li>
            <li>It burned my skin, which felt sensitive &amp; looked red for days and the hair grew sooner than the product claims.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent so much time trying to get this thing to work for me</li>
            <li>now, like a dummy I sit here waiting for my money (nearly $500) to be put back into my account though I called them immediately to cancel both orders.</li>
            <li>So then I moved on to the more expensive laser hair removal which actually worked really well.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and invest the extra money in professional laser hair removal.</li>
            <li>I find it useless on leg/bikini hair, and somewhat effective on arm hair.</li>
            <li>I see 60 day return promises all over the advertising, but when I go to return it, I see I am past a 30 day window for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>The way the product is designed, there&#x27;s basically a sort of thin electric wire that just burns off the top of the hair.  </li>
            <li>This little product ranks right up there with the Pet Rock, \\&quot;boil in the bag lettuce\\&quot; and the elastic tape measure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure many people are skeptical about the no-no due to the large number of negative reviews, including this one.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I get a new tech that doesn&#x27;t read my chart and see I have been coming since 2003 and getting my back, shoulders, upper arms and neck and chest.</li>
            <li>Not only does it appear that my mom wasted her money (luckily there is a reimbursement on returned items)</li>
            <li>I obtained it beginning of May, only a few days after ordering it, to my amazement that they managed their orders so quickly &amp; efficiently.  </li>
            <li>i kept on trying to perfect my technique (not the issue, the issue is that it is impossible to use on your upper lip or chin due to facial contours) and waiting for the results promised, so the 60 day trial period ran out.  </li>
            <li>The first one didn&#x27;t work, the head was a half inch below the place where it could even reach the skin.  </li>
            <li>First of all I am a guy, I have had the black and silver</li>
            <li>I will not be wasting my money or worse yet risking damage to my skin thanks to the honest reviews given by all of you that did unfortunately waste your money only to have no results and burnt skin.  </li>
            <li>It basically clipped off the top bit of hair, leaving behind some stubble near the root and grew back just the same as it had been shaved.  </li>
            <li>Hair is a very poor heat conductor, that&#x27;s why it keeps your head warm</li>
            <li>I had to replace the thermicon tip after 2 weeks of use and my buffer is completely worn out, my legs are dry and scaly and I have no less hair than when I started using it.</li>
            <li>I have blonde, fine hair, this product sucks.  </li>
            <li>You have to go over the same very small area many times just to get a little hair gone and not even that much looked gone.</li>
            <li>As someone else said, it just burned off the hair from the top of the skin and there was still stubble there that you rub away with the little round sand paper thing.  </li>
            <li>The blades don&#x27;t have any effect for very long and when you try to buy some new ones</li>
            <li>As far as their claims about less hair coming back and eventually stopping, they are absolutely untrue.</li>
            <li>It has so far removed only facial skin...</li>
            <li>Well, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to get all the way down to the follicle.  </li>
            <li>I almost did, just decided to do a little research first.  </li>
            <li>They first sent me one that looked used and had little burnt hairs on it.</li>
            <li>Bottom line if it doesn&#x27;t remove your hair on the first go, how will you ever get to the point of having little or no hair to remove....??</li>
            <li>Even daily use on this area never made it the least bit smooth, still needed to be shaved several times a week.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not a long term product  DONT BUY THIS</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell you whether it offers long term removal because it did not remove the hair to begin with.</li>
            <li>It barely worked on my facial peach fuzz but</li>
            <li>The first time we used the narrow tip for her chin / jaw area.  </li>
            <li>It takes an hour to do both full legs because you have to go over each leg at least 4 times to get all the hair.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten past the point that you are using it three or four times a week to say whether its really worth it or not.  </li>
            <li>Be aware it will take a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>God only knows how many people they&#x27;ve ripped off this way simply because those people don&#x27;t keep a tight watch on their statements (I didn&#x27;t even notice the problem with the refund until a few weeks after it happened).   </li>
            <li>I also must say that all the other positive reviews that could be real were written by people who have only used it a few weeks.</li>
            <li>The name ironically carries new meaning for me now as a fleece down for my dollars by a foreign con artists hiding behind a website to pretending to be legitimate!In canada if the customer is unsatisfied with the product and has the original reciept we believe its the customers right to return it.</li>
            <li>The life of the razors are not very long.</li>
            <li>Less eager to part with so much money I decided to check the reviews expecting to see accolades.  </li>
            <li>As I usually do with returns that cost more than a few dollars, I sent it by certified mail that required their signature, so that I would have proof that they received it.</li>
            <li>The product is also poorly made and can easily cause burns.</li>
            <li>If I had thick masses of dark body hair, it might be ok,</li>
            <li>Plus, when it grows, it grows soft and doesn&#x27;t poke like a hair that was shaved as shaving is cutting the hair and has flat surface and grows evenly together but extracted one has pointy ends and every different hair grows at its own time and is not chaffing when touch.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no magic bullet (like newer, more expensive products might be), but I think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>consider an overweight person who constantly wears tight jeans that rub on certain parts of the legs.  </li>
            <li>I used the buffer &#x27;wet &amp; dry sandpaper really&#x27; provided to remove it, nothing happened.  </li>
            <li>It is not a 5 star because I had to make several calls and do some serious convincing that the product was not for me before they refunded me my money and due to the fact that it did not help my situation .</li>
            <li>If you have really fine thin hair, maybe this is the gadget for you.  </li>
            <li>I used the No-No for 1 1/2 years and really never did see much if any permanent hair loss--although I kept hoping!When my battery stopped working properly, as lithium batteries tend to do eventually, the company informed me that they have a no new battery policy.  </li>
            <li>I used the buffer provided, but the next day my skin is just as dry and scaly, and I don&#x27;t have a problem with dry skin normally.</li>
            <li>I have very thick coarse facial hair (the reason for the NoNo) and it WILL NOT deliver a smooth skin surface as promised.  </li>
            <li>The hair on my face (upper lip and a very noticeable patch on my chin) is very dark and coarse; as is the hair on my legs.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> ha ha ha ((( exception the set it and forget it rotisserie that is the best product EVER!!!))).  </li>
            <li> I am very experienced in hair removal, and wish I had not bought it.  </li>
            <li> I can see I&#x27;m not alone in not being impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li> This is the best product for your mother in law.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I have gone over this one fine hair  1000 times!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> best.</li>
            <li> Proiduct arrived in excellent and timely manner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably the best gag gift I have seen!</li>
            <li> Theres not even CLOSE to a good review on here!!</li>
            <li> , no no is the best word to describe this fraud, no no don&#x27;t use</li>
            <li> What an excellent scam!  </li>
            <li> am I glad I did!!!    </li>
            <li> It is an incredible waster of money...DO not buy it</li>
            <li> and she thinks it is brilliant.  </li>
            <li> Good thing I wasn&#x27;t going out that night!    </li>
            <li> Good luck!  </li>
            <li> the company is a no no \\&quot;good for nothing\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had extremely good results with the No!No!.  </li>
            <li> not $260 great.  </li>
            <li> I got the NoNo and was expecting great results from everything I&#x27;d heard.</li>
            <li> Laser gave me great results.</li>
            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> internet is great for some things.</li>
            <li> I called to ask about refund procedure and they tried to persuade me at great length from a script, to keep the product</li>
            <li> I brought this product in hopes of receiving the great benefits they endorse.</li>
            <li> After my No No hair system broke,the fly wheel (band) popped out</li>
            <li> but I can say I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I am not going to advertise who did the great job on me, because that&#x27;s not what this review is about.</li>
            <li> No! would be a great solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yet they&#x27;re happy to take your money and keep selling it.</li>
            <li> and it works great, from the Nono company.</li>
            <li> It does a great job on &#x27;peach fuzz&#x27; however.  </li>
            <li> I called the company and was told that they would be happy to replace if I paid for an extended warranty</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> I would recommend Ideal Image to anyone and October is when they run there best sales :)</li>
            <li> I have always been able to get a refund from legitimate  businesses!!  </li>
            <li> Their customer service rep was very courteous and cancelled this for me.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin stubbly at best, the smell of burnt hair is overwhelming, and it stings like a mamma jamma.</li>
            <li> i had never bought anything from a tv ad before, but it seemed soooo wonderful that i went online to look for a better price and ordered.  </li>
            <li> I am sooo very happy with my results and have sent many blessings to the maker and distributors of this product.</li>
            <li> :P  </li>
            <li> I gave it every chance to be successful.</li>
            <li> The sun is shining brightly in the window</li>
            <li> The marketing campaign is good</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is a good product if you want to spend a couple of hours each time to remove hair from your legs...</li>
            <li> Sounds good.</li>
            <li> Get a good men&#x27;s 5 blade razor and some shave cream instead.</li>
            <li> not everyone is good.</li>
            <li> (followed instructions meticulously), it doesn&#x27;t even do a good thorough job on the peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s so good, why isn&#x27;t it advertised for mens&#x27; beards?  </li>
            <li> I am considered the optimum candidate.  </li>
            <li> what good did that do me?</li>
            <li> what good did that do me?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if their claims of good reviews are all garbage.  </li>
            <li> because I thought it would be a good alternative to laser or waxing.  </li>
            <li> Good luck on your adventure.</li>
            <li> I go and good riddence to no</li>
            <li> TV and google reviews make this sound like the greatest thing since sliced bread.</li>
            <li> and I thought it would be a good investment.  </li>
            <li> I just laughed and laughed.</li>
            <li> but all in all the product sounded so good</li>
            <li> A good laser hair removal clinic will give you quite an education on what they&#x27;re doing, why they&#x27;re doing it, and whether or not your hair and skin are a good match for the procedure.  </li>
            <li> You out lay a fair amount of money for the product</li>
            <li> Works really good.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t over use it, that isnt good for your skin and wont speed up the process.</li>
            <li> The NoNo commercials are very convincing</li>
            <li> I opened the box with trembling hands and decided to follow the instructions to the letter because I refused to be duped again by &amp;#34;an amazing, too good to be true&amp;#34; television product.</li>
            <li> I read good reviews for fine hair, but if you are olive toned and beastly hairy, like me, this product will not make you happy.</li>
            <li> MORE HAIR!</li>
            <li> and I have to sandpaper it some more with their exfoliating paper!</li>
            <li> in fact I fell asleep during my latest session!</li>
            <li> Please make absolutely sure you want this product before you purchase it!</li>
            <li> The return process could not have been simpler or more efficient -- thank-you!</li>
            <li> This many people cannot be lying!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I took the time to look at reviews on Amazon before I bought this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not the one who paid the money for this!</li>
            <li> Shelved for a year because quite frankly I found unwieldy then decided to try one more time to find that the no!no!</li>
            <li> Heard nothing but amazing things about the no</li>
            <li> I honestly just use this on my legs when I&#x27;m on the computer or watching tv.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my own fault for trusting them.  </li>
            <li> , the guy was nice, he gave me a return number</li>
            <li> Kind of pissed because I bought this when it was priced at $300.  </li>
            <li> I have returned to shaving my legs and am loving the difference.</li>
            <li> So, taking matters into my own hand, I called their 888 customer service number.</li>
            <li> Representatives will not divulge that kind of information.</li>
            <li> Thieves own and run this co.  </li>
            <li> I liked the idea of 60 days to return it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m getting really adept at shaving, make it a time to relax and indulge.</li>
            <li> but I was thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li> Basically, you&#x27;re paying all that money for a nice buffer.</li>
            <li> My skin had a rash kind of like sun burn or something.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know how scams like this are allowed to continue.  </li>
            <li> Kind of deceptive advertising.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and packaged nicely, however, I didn&#x27;t realize it burns your unwanted hair off, leaving the smell of burned hair with you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even worth rating 1/2 a star!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m most happy with the results on my arms and can easily be done just before your shower.</li>
            <li> If it sounds too good to be true, it is!  </li>
            <li> This was about $500 but honestly has given me amazing results (hair free underarms, legs, and arms!).  </li>
            <li> thank you ,the customers i reviewed was very un satisfied if it sounds to good to be true</li>
            <li> Very easy.  </li>
            <li> No was that it was very easy to get a refund</li>
            <li> We have much more important things to spend our time and money on!!</li>
            <li> It is also incredibly time-consuming and the gadget itself conks out whenever it wants to.</li>
            <li> Its amazing how many people will do and believe anything Dr Oz says or products he has on his programs</li>
            <li> For this kind of money, I thought I would have better results.  </li>
            <li> sound good, but</li>
            <li> I tried it on my fingers to test it out and it removed some of the (very fine) hairs, but not all.</li>
            <li> ALTHOUGH MY HAIR IS VERY FINE, I COULD USE NO NO FOR 20 MINUTES A DAY {</li>
            <li> If it sounds to good to be true...</li>
            <li> In their adverts the movement appears relaxed and gliding with the user smiling - I&#x27;m a pretty confident person, but I could never be smiling and relaxed when using No!no!!</li>
            <li> I thought that with all the positive advertisement that it was receiving that it was going to be a great product.  </li>
            <li> and so I tried that again - more wounds.</li>
            <li> When I called I was told that I have been placed on a 30-days payment program without my knowledge and without my OK.  </li>
            <li> OK</li>
            <li> it did okay,</li>
            <li> so many of you have.  </li>
            <li> When you call for the return the operators insist that either the product was not used correctly or more time is needed.</li>
            <li> I have no problem adhering to this because I know that at the lower level that you just have to use this more often.</li>
            <li> This product literally just singes the top layer of hair</li>
            <li> I am not waiting for them to pull any more money out of my account</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I got it in Peru and was my favorite hair removal since then.</li>
            <li> I tried on my legs following the instructions and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I was so proud of my legs and ready for a swimming suit.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> My favorite comment, \\&quot;was</li>
            <li> It cut her face in many places</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li> I have better ways to spend my time...and to top it all off...</li>
            <li> you better start the process in September...</li>
            <li> The instructions are explicit, \\&quot;do not go over an area more than 3 times and do not allow it to come in contact with the lips.  </li>
            <li> Glad I was able to dodge the bullet, than to you for making these reports.</li>
            <li> No!No! and better yet b/c it was more than 30 days after the charge on my credit card, I still had to pay for the thing.  </li>
            <li> Most reviews are one-star or less.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been watching the infomercials for a while, and I&#x27;ve been wanting to find that magic solution to smoother legs (aren&#x27;t we all, ladies?).  </li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t buy the blades you need any more.</li>
            <li> More burned skin and the house smelling like a sulphur factory?</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m off to shave my legs now.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the results but not the price I had to pay.</li>
            <li> I started with TRIA laser hair removal and had astonishing results in just three weeks.</li>
            <li> Okay, I admit up front that it is not me that is using this No-No product, but the person who I purchased it as a gift for is, or should I say....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, will the hair get thinner and more sparse as time goes on?</li>
            <li> I am quite hairy and spend most the year in pants because I also have eczema and get in grown hairs a lot.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
            <li> I think it might work better on hair that&#x27;s never been shaved.</li>
            <li> Now after reading some of these reviews I am not so sure if I want to use this on her at all.</li>
            <li> make sure that they don&#x27;t use it in your house, or you will smell the stinch of burning hair all over.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ( I was able to go online and view their instruction video.)</li>
            <li> I love the reviews here, it has helped me prevent being cheated.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad to be able to read before trying this.  </li>
            <li> I should have known better, but the infomercial was quite convincing.    </li>
            <li> Sure, it removes hair, but so does a disposable razor or a Norelco.</li>
            <li> are more details of the conversation between me and the customer service rep.  </li>
            <li> So, do some models break more than others?</li>
            <li> Sure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure, given time and patience, no-no will do what is promised in their advertisement.</li>
            <li> How many replacements will you put up with before calling it quits?</li>
            <li> For the amount of time I&#x27;ve devoted to this thing I could have had most of it removed, now I have so much more to remove.</li>
            <li> I worked on it every night for a week, sometimes making as many as 30 passes in one area (with the required rest time in between).  </li>
            <li> I have used many many hair removal products, and aside fron tria laser</li>
            <li> I am glad I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will write more as time goes</li>
            <li> Interesting..., because when I bought mine, it was being advertised for the face.  </li>
            <li> So glad I did save my money</li>
            <li> I have had mine for 9 months or more and the hair is as it was when I started.</li>
            <li> but I do feel that this may be a product fault the system has and many more people will find that their No</li>
            <li> OK, I got sucked in by an off-hours TV ad.  </li>
            <li> , this was looking even more like a scam...</li>
            <li> That sure doesn&#x27;t cost $300 to produce.  </li>
            <li> And it sure doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes indeed it works but it takes a while to learn to use and to get used to I already need more tips</li>
            <li> I have avoided being burned, in more ways than one</li>
            <li> I record Dr Oz while at work and catch up when am able.</li>
            <li> This might work for people who do not have a hair problem, but for the rest of us who would love to have lasik but can&#x27;t afford it, then no.</li>
            <li> We will see if I get better results on my legs with time.</li>
            <li> An ok investment for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe if I were more faithful about using the unit, they&#x27;d be gone by now.</li>
            <li> more thing --</li>
            <li> i went in both directions and went over the area many times..</li>
            <li> Its just a hassel and is causing more stress than helping..</li>
            <li> The thing will not run for more than two seconds at a time just keeps clicking on &amp; off.</li>
            <li> There r more complaints then compliments for this, wonder why?.</li>
            <li> She continued asking me questions and more questions.</li>
            <li> OR MORE}  </li>
            <li> I went online to order this product &amp; started reading some of the Amazon reviews &amp; boy, was I glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t get blindsided by the media magic.  </li>
            <li> So glad I read the customer reviews before ordering.</li>
            <li> I made sure it was fully charged, but it would still move like this.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I hope more people read these reviews so the company can stop selling it.</li>
            <li> but no matter better than waxing and threading.</li>
            <li> , i.e., give us even more money.  </li>
            <li> When attempting to buy on line yesterday, I mistakenly clicked on one of the many extras they offer.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> They said that it was more than 60 days.</li>
            <li> I was sure that the product advertisement showed a woman shaving her mustache area (which I have seen the ad since then, and it does).  </li>
            <li> - I made sure to mark my calendar and set an alert for Day 45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On top of that, it quit working 6 months after purchase.</li>
            <li> oh, wait, theres more.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s more of a Gimmick than anything else</li>
            <li> I would never purchase any more products from this company again.</li>
            <li> I tried it for about 3 months and all that resulted was a lovely bouquet of burning hair smell.  </li>
            <li> I found that immediately after I used it (no matter how many swipes) there was still \\&quot;stubble\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> , I will set a calandar reminder and will call during the precious time frame of 45-60 days and request my return authorization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I called after the 45 days (but before the 60) and was given a return authorization number.  </li>
            <li> Then I went on with my more than peach fuzzy face.</li>
            <li> Sure it took more than the recommended two to three passes over each spot.</li>
            <li> I bought the nono about six weeks ago and am 100% satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> More on that</li>
            <li> /&gt;After it not working or burning my face if I did more than the recommended 2 swipes, I called them July  3 to cancel the order of any more cream &amp; return</li>
            <li> it is nothing more than a shaver with heat and</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> I thought if I used it more I would get results.</li>
            <li> Thanks for stopping me!!!!</li>
            <li> I was given the NO!NO! as a gift and was very excited to get it.</li>
            <li> well i&#x27;m still shaving and enjoying a cheap and cheerful relationship with my new best and trusted friend bic !!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this product and used the no!no!</li>
            <li> Lubriderm is the best, unscented for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I could just kick myself for not reading Amazon reviews first, but I let my excitement for something new get the best of me.</li>
            <li> The TV ad for no!no!is really great... sounds almost too good to be true, but not quite so much that women aren&#x27;t willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to read ALL the fine print before you hand over your information.</li>
            <li> And, the energy part for me, is the most important part.</li>
            <li> But trust me, you will love your smooth silky arms and legs.</li>
            <li> no she is now hair free, has much more confidence</li>
            <li> I am currently getting laser hair removal through Ideal Image.</li>
            <li> I will continue the professional service that has already given me great results.</li>
            <li> I cant speak for permanent hair removal in the long run, but for the time being, I am VERY happy with my impeccably smooth results.</li>
            <li> I have found better results with a cheap shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would have rather had the free ginzu knives : )</li>
            <li> but this company said it was my own fault for having not used the right amount of cream.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> removal\\&quot; where it was actually TRUE!</li>
            <li> This item is quite easy to use and am looking forward to the results.</li>
            <li> I was using the Braun epilator for a year when I saw the television ad for this and found it looked so easy.  </li>
            <li> I have some very mild burns on my face</li>
            <li> the instructions are easy to follow.  </li>
            <li> The technology was also portrayed as being very quick and easy to use, but it was not.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quite easy to use.</li>
            <li> Although it did produce a strong burned hair odor.      </li>
            <li> Liked the product when I first got it.  </li>
            <li> I am always trying new products to find the best in new ways for hair removal.</li>
            <li> The seller was fine and I had no issues.  </li>
            <li> I was fine with it not being permanent, i just wanted it to remove hair and for it to remain gone for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Also, the latest newest technology in electrolysis is so much better than 12 years ago when I first tried it...</li>
            <li> I since switched to a cream for removal which works fine.  </li>
            <li> I have medium brown fine hair with medium skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Pain free, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It should turn out fine if the NoNo does what it says it does and has permanently removed your hair, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I blame myself for not researching the product before buying and even more for not returning within the first month when I may have had the chance to recoup my monies although I am sure Radiance would have tried to talk me into keeping.  </li>
            <li> That being said, it works fine</li>
            <li> I got to the billing info after entering my AMX card and noticed in fine print that I would be charged 2 additional payments.  </li>
            <li> It must be in the fine</li>
            <li> Luckily I bought my no!no!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m praying for some kind of miracle and  positive results.</li>
            <li> When I got it, I first used it on my legs and not only would it burn the hair, it wouldn&#x27;t even move smoothly!!!!</li>
            <li> and/or are getting paid a huge amount of money to exaggerate.</li>
            <li> I have a huge problem with chin hair</li>
            <li> am returning it tonight, but I hear the return process is a huge nightmare.  </li>
            <li> thought it must be something about my technique and (once my face had healed and I felt brave enough)</li>
            <li> You never get a smooth leg/arm whatever.  </li>
            <li> It states on the web page that tel lines are available from 9 - 5.30.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I bought it on the trial basis &amp; my card was never charged</li>
            <li> A fantastic product.</li>
            <li> If I would have read the reviews here before I bought the nono, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it, but this is one of those rare times where I&#x27;m actually glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> once you use the buffer pad, it was as smooth as if I had shaved.</li>
            <li> I might have had more success.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Never did I have smooth legs or anything else smooth for that matter.</li>
            <li> I have to shave every time if I want my legs smooth...</li>
            <li> I was told there was a 60 days free trial</li>
            <li> Looks cheaply made.    </li>
            <li> Hope this review can help shed some light for those who are considering in purchasing a no-no.</li>
            <li> I visited their website and filled out the contact form with a barrage of questions...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> The hair was gone and skin was smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I know for a fact that stuff will fit in a one price 4.95 box from the post office.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a no go for me because I have light colored</li>
            <li> I should have known, because the laser hair removal at the spa does not work for light or graying hair, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be hair free after one use or even one week.  </li>
            <li> Would be really great if a future model was chargeable and did not need to be plugged in while it is being used.    </li>
            <li> it is worth about 30 to 50 bucks at most in my view.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaply made.</li>
            <li> You can get an even better buffer that comes with replacement pads at Wal-mart for seven bucks (the Smooth Away kit, which isn&#x27;t perfect but at least it&#x27;s cheap).   </li>
            <li> you have any questions, please feel free to write.</li>
            <li> which would be one thing if you were smooth and \\&quot;hairfree\\&quot; at the end.  </li>
            <li> I called before the free trial was up to get an RDA number</li>
            <li> My legs have never been so smooth.</li>
            <li> smooth legs&lt;</li>
            <li> Just another unwanted hassle.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it does not glide smoothly over your skin, and they don&#x27;t tell you that the heads need replacement.  </li>
            <li> It takes awhile for you to train the hairs, so there is a great potential for ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> was offered another product: a cream to use after using the NoNO...a $50 value for free.</li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was then told that I would have to wait until 45 days had elapsed before I could return the product or else they would not honor the free return shipping.  </li>
            <li> You WILL lose money, there IS NO risk free trial, as it is a scam.</li>
            <li> Maybe it just depends on the coarseness of the hair, or maybe people aren&#x27;t using it correctly, but in any case, so far so good</li>
            <li> Maybe it just depends on the coarseness of the hair, or maybe people aren&#x27;t using it correctly, but in any case, so far so good</li>
            <li> Good ole fashioned waxing on a regular basis works a hundred times better.</li>
            <li> After having every hair removal process, I found that only real laser treatments work the best for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it and think it&#x27;s well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re not stupid.</li>
            <li> My cheap electric razor does a much better job; usually right after trying to use the no no shaver.</li>
            <li> And hey, gals, listen up: they say you can easily return it for a full refund.</li>
            <li> I originally bought it to use on my legs, however, it did not work on my legs at all.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t brave enough to try it on any portion of my face, I&#x27;ve had really good luck with the Bellabe Facial Hair Remover</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this</li>
            <li> This devise is a glorified shaver, the most it does is to shave your unwanted hair, make your skin feel hot, and have your room smell like burnt hair.     </li>
            <li> I was so excited and hopeful when I bought this product</li>
            <li> So I was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> so they could review the original phone call to do the return to see If I was missled.  </li>
            <li> After more than two months of consistent use (5x per week), my hair growth has not diminshed.</li>
            <li> I was excited about it &amp; it did nothing but hair</li>
            <li> I returned the first one just be be sure it wasn&#x27;t just a defective unit.</li>
            <li> Zero success on legs!</li>
            <li> The one I received in return was refurbished and they said that the warranty would not be extended to year from the replacement date and the original date of purchase still determined to end of the one year warranty.</li>
            <li> This price should be significantly lower.</li>
            <li> IF you have fine, light hair, this product might be useful to you.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old grand daughter doesn&#x27;t want me kissing her because I scratch her!</li>
            <li> I have a problem with facial hair; and like many women, I jump for joy every time a new product comes out that promises to remove it.  </li>
            <li> I bought the No!No! hair removal from HSN when they had their \\&quot;special deal\\&quot; on it.  </li>
            <li> And they have a special wand to take out the redness now...</li>
            <li> He started reading a script and tried to get me to jump aboard and take advantage of their special promotion...</li>
            <li> 14 days, two more large tips broke &lt; 42 days.</li>
            <li> people see right through you!</li>
            <li> right!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s where it is right now !</li>
            <li> The wires/blades kink and break very easily and rapidly with normal use.</li>
            <li> I just got super excited by the infomercial and jump on the phone and order it.  </li>
            <li> It did remove some hair around my bikini area, but my skin swelled up and was bright red.</li>
            <li> It is true that it is painelss-physically that is.  </li>
            <li> I want something that is close like shaving, and the product still left a good bit of stubble where I used it; legs and face.  </li>
            <li> As of 4 Jan 2011 I am still waiting for my refund even though the company agrees that I returned the product and met all their requirements for a full refund.</li>
            <li> and now they are saying I didn&#x27;t pay in full.  </li>
            <li> tip status still shows 3 full bars after doing my legs, so</li>
            <li> The tip status still shows 3 full bars after doing my legs, so</li>
            <li> The advertisements and commercials are very deceiving as are most things like this.  </li>
            <li> I returned the product this week and will track to ensure I recieve a full refund.</li>
            <li> I not only gave this thing a fair shake...</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought it through the manufacturer, because then I could get a full refund.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; that comes with it is so full of perfume its unwearable.</li>
            <li> the reply received back from them was again surprising</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shameful these type companies make a fortune selling products that don&#x27;t hold true to their claims.  </li>
            <li> The instructions said not to go over one area more than three times so you really have to watch that you remember what areas you already went over.</li>
            <li> I told her on TV and the website, it said return for a full refund plus shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> Please do not get your hopes up, but if you must try it like I really wanted to believe the advertisement-make sure you return it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They really have an ingenious system of fraud.</li>
            <li> Try calling to get your money back, good luck.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and paid full price for it......</li>
            <li> they want you to do the full trial.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, if you start to develop boil-like eruptions on your skin from this product like I did, they expect you to continue using it for the full trial period before they will pay the return shipping.  </li>
            <li> I contacted nono for a full refund, and received it within 3 days.</li>
            <li> I used the NO No for the full 60 days and no results what so ever.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about the NO</li>
            <li> I CANNOT believe for one minute that the endorsements they claim they have are true.</li>
            <li> I suggest that you follow the directions and make sure you buff after each nono use, since that really seemed to help get rid of those stubborn hairs.  </li>
            <li> I paid for it which was&#x27;nt full price as I had a voucher.</li>
            <li> Not bad...</li>
            <li> on.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, and I would recommend it for anyone who wants to remove hair quickly.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve not had it since - you need to go easy for the first couple of days</li>
            <li> Got the unit quickly.  </li>
            <li> The company quickly replaced it, and since it would not be under warranty, I bought another 3 year warranty for $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Luckily I just used it on my chin and legs, if I&#x27;d used it on my face</li>
            <li> keep your expectations realistic, don&#x27;t expect magic or a miracle</li>
            <li> When I hung up the phone after ordering, I checked my bank account, and was very upset to see an authorized hold already charged on my account which, in my bank, once that is done, it already takes that amount and deducts it from my available balance, which if I don&#x27;t habe the funds available, it will go through, but will charge me an overdraft fee for it.</li>
            <li> I believe waiting three days is allowing the next batch of hair to grow to the perfect length for removal, so its easier in my skin too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be disheartened, muscle thru it just as described above.  </li>
            <li> Also, hair grows back no matter the system, so go with a more reasonable priced, better result device!</li>
            <li> I have been told that have a 60-days free trial and my account was charged on the 22nd day with the first payment of $90 (3 pmts</li>
            <li> First of all, it is finicky to use and often did nothing (you can tell because the light was not flashing).  </li>
            <li> I have to say, this is the FIRST time where they say \\&quot;pain free hair</li>
            <li> I will remain with waxing and if laser comes down in price, I&#x27;ll elect that procedure.  </li>
            <li> When I asked to speak with a manager, still trying to  get a new battery, I was put on hold for 10 more minutes</li>
            <li> Purchased this primarily for 12-20 stubborn dark chin hairs on my fair headed self.  </li>
            <li> I saw this item on the HSN network the other night and was so excited to see them selling it because I was under the impression they sold good products</li>
            <li> It makes me wonder how it got such good reviews in the first place.</li>
            <li> Anyway, after 2 months I went back to the epilator and find that works much better!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually had some laser hair removal to compare this to, and that hurts WAY more than this does!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually had some laser hair removal to compare this to, and that hurts WAY more than this does!</li>
            <li> Really !?!</li>
            <li> People that are satisfied with a product usually do not get on the internet to bitch, they just go on using whatever it they are using.</li>
            <li> I tried to send it back in the first 45 days because I saw zero results, and they convinced me that I needed to try it for 30 more days to see better results.</li>
            <li> I wish I read the customer reviews first!</li>
            <li> - you need to practise first!</li>
            <li> BUYER BE AWARE!</li>
            <li> Three hundred dollars later, the No No the most overpriced hair removal machine on the market!</li>
            <li> On my legs, what did come off was not as good as a clean shave with one of the new multiple blade razors, I tend to like the razor with the battery that vibrates the blade, clean shave with rarely a nick.  </li>
            <li> I had large areas that were hair free.</li>
            <li> It removes fine hair, but does nothing on anything more coarse.</li>
            <li> any results(I have light fine hair naturally.  </li>
            <li> Check the facebook page and all you will see are a few raves like &#x27;just got it and it works great&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> This is why I find reviews to be important and very helpful.  </li>
            <li> It is absolutely pain free (unlike the torture I put myself through with laser).  </li>
            <li> It appears to be a pretty cool product.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes they point out flaws that have already been fixed (like cordless models etc..) in an effort to upsell people even more.   </li>
            <li> Looks like a fun product on tv</li>
            <li> and it is worth the money to you, to get rid of said sideburns; then go ahead and buy.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to start using it on my 11 year old daughter&#x27;s legs because I thought it was better than shaving.</li>
            <li> if anything, shaving will be as effective than this product, because it works the same way.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S WORTH GOING TO HAVE THE LASER REMOVAL WHICH IS ABOUT $500</li>
            <li> well worth the effort</li>
            <li> If it worked, it was still worth it, so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s another deal where they sing its praises, rake in the money...and laugh all the way to the bank.</li>
            <li> If you feel the need to try it-make sure you purchase it when it offers a 60 guaranteed return.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised my favorite stars from the soaps would endorse this.  </li>
            <li> while it didn&#x27;t work for me, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re thinking about it.</li>
            <li> It is going to take months for the hair to start growing in more softly and thinner.  </li>
            <li> customer service DON&#x27;T MAKE ME LAUGH</li>
            <li> Like I said luckily I didn&#x27;t do my whole face, if I  had I would have a full beard.</li>
            <li> But with some sincere determination and nothing but time on my hands... I watched the dark patches of hair give way to smooth hair free skin.</li>
            <li> No matter how much time you give it, it does not remove any better than a high end electric or disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to return the product right away and costumer servicesaid</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t shower and scrub right after, the smell stays on your skin and you&#x27;ll notice it when you rub it.  </li>
            <li> RIGHT---</li>
            <li> right?.....</li>
            <li> I could have blond hair on both sides of my face right now....</li>
            <li> (Surprise surprise, right?)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: This doesn&#x27;t feel right at all to me.</li>
            <li> and when I asked about returning it even though they gave me 60 days, they insisted 45.Also writing to them and expecting an answer right away is out of the question.</li>
            <li> Right now I am waiting to see what my attorney have to say.</li>
            <li> [yeah, right].  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t hold it just right</li>
            <li> Instead they said mine was not working right, and  sent me a replacement.</li>
            <li> the credit card number right but not our name or address.</li>
            <li> but it right now.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I could return it right to Bed Bath and Beyond.</li>
            <li> IS RIGHT</li>
            <li> I charged the battery and followed all the directions, used the right tip</li>
            <li> I kept it up, I am lucky to have very light hair so only noticeable when the sun hits it just right.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give a true review, but so far it has worked great on my face and arms, and did an OK job on my legs.</li>
            <li> It states in the literature that it works best for dark, coarse hair and this is what I have.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to get burned, especially on curved surfaces.</li>
            <li> But with that said I&#x27;m not about to spend that much money on laser since most of my body hair is baby fine and blonde.</li>
            <li> I just want to do the right thing and post a real and true review.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to buy this &amp; it looked like a cool concept</li>
            <li> I experienced it on my own sucker&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li> So, now I have to call them again to straighten this out, but judging by the fact that they have not done anything right so far, I dont anticipate this being an easy process.</li>
            <li> and despite the fact that I had light and fairly fine hair to begin with, I STILL have the same amount of hair  </li>
            <li> It can manage only light and fine hair that almost invisible anyway.  </li>
            <li> Is it true that certain models have a higher rate of failure?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The after-treatment lotion that came in the kit has kind of a depilatory cream after-smell, and they really don&#x27;t give you much, but I&#x27;m not sure how effective it will be vs. just purchasing some hair reduction lotion at WalMart, or how my skin will react to it...</li>
            <li> I have very dark, coarse hair, so I am the perfect candidate for laser.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that works is the advertisement convincing you that the product is worth $300.00.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and, to be honest was very cautious about trying it on my face, but finally did.</li>
            <li> I must say that it is a great product if you are simply using it to remove unwanted facial hair but</li>
            <li> But after several weeks I still have not had anywhere near good results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it primarily on my face exactly as the instructions stated so the heads and face sander is still new and don&#x27;t need to be replaced</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the vanqia as i should, so it has to be the no no doing it, but you have to use it right, and you have to understand that it is burning your hair, so it does work after burning your hair so many times you root will finally die.</li>
            <li> If I can stretch my skin out right it does ok with my upper lip.   </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to do, I can&#x27;t afford to loose this kind of money.  </li>
            <li> I were both looking very much fwd to it....</li>
            <li> He abruptly cut me off and said, \\&quot;thanks for calling, have a good day,\\&quot; and hung up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I was really excited about this product, then I became discouraged because I expected more drastic results sooner.</li>
            <li> But at the cost of this tiny piece of equipment, I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the fact that I would have to continually buy replacement parts at high prices that cost them pennies to make.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> After the wonderful reviews and the fake infermerical I deceided to give the No No a try.  </li>
            <li> I bought it mostly for my daughter who believes that has to remove the fuzz on her upper lip.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it on my legs</li>
            <li> because it didn&#x27;t do anything at all after the first time.  </li>
            <li> If you are not dedicated and consistent this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> i have more hair than ever and burns to go along with the extra hair!  </li>
            <li> So the claw terminals hit your face first and cut it, while the hot wire is farther away.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and invest in a Silk&#x27;n SensEpil at home laser hair removal system (the first at home laser to be FDA approved).  </li>
            <li> I like this product although it isn&#x27;t as effective as I had expected.   </li>
            <li> My chin and upper lip hurt the most and I felt sun-burned and stinging, plus my chin was cut and bleeding.</li>
            <li> And I had to exfoliate again the next day to finally be able to remove it all.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the No!No!...</li>
            <li> The infommercial makes it seem like it&#x27;s going to make you smooth and soft....</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews first.</li>
            <li> Mine is NOT the first horror story.  </li>
            <li> It works at higher settings.</li>
            <li> came to the conclusion about 3 years into it that I am willing to put up with it and call it temporary hair removal.</li>
            <li> It only removes my arm hair which is super fine.</li>
            <li> Funny coz</li>
            <li> You can get it on-line for $100 at an outside website, though, so be sure to make your purchase there instead of here.</li>
            <li> If you want fast hair removal this product is not for you!  </li>
            <li> They get you to buy their product promising they won&#x27;t charge you and THEY WILL PAY FOR S&amp;H, but that wasn&#x27;t the case!  </li>
            <li> and I remember reading that you can return it anytime but NOT the first 2 months.</li>
            <li> First, it does not work.  </li>
            <li> First, it takes forever to use, then it scorches the skin, then you have to shave over the area in any case because it just singes the hair</li>
            <li> , then you try to return the product and that is where the fun really begins.</li>
            <li> I would say if the customer service was better try it yourself as your results may be different from mine, but the company seems to try to get you to hang on to it</li>
            <li> I looked pretty funny with burn stripes on my mouth that looked like wrinkles at first glance.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews first.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given the product 4 stars for now since I just used it for the first time today, so</li>
            <li> Was also unsuccessful at getting my money back despite the 60 day warranty although they were willing to sell me more tips.  </li>
            <li> After a while it didn&#x27;t preform like it did at first.  </li>
            <li> The first warning on instructions is &amp;#34;don&#x27;t use on face!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I thought at first that it may have been me</li>
            <li> and I was more interested in facial hair removal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the results, but I gave the product 4 stars because I had to reorder extra blades.</li>
            <li> that I wanted answers to first before dropping $270.00.</li>
            <li> (Although, I&#x27;ve seen a couple of reviews where they&#x27;ve been able to get their warranty got extended because of multiple defective devices and replacements.)</li>
            <li> so just be aware...</li>
            <li> Something else to be aware of.  </li>
            <li> and they told me to do exactly what I was doing which wasn&#x27;t working</li>
            <li> After my first session, I figured out it takes an eternity to do just your legs.  </li>
            <li> I had course hair and when I first used the nono&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wish I had read these reviews first.  </li>
            <li> and it only trimmed the top of the hair</li>
            <li> for 11 months, for the first 6 months I did it twice a week as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;revolutionary technology\\&quot; is a hot wire that is supposed to burn the hair away, powered by a rechargable battery.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was defective.  </li>
            <li> (note  you have to shave first......)    </li>
            <li> When I was browsing the various sites for the NoNo hair removal products, I noted that most of them were associated with the company.  </li>
            <li> Thanks everyone!</li>
            <li> sure thank you for helping others like me keep from doing the same!!</li>
            <li> As a cosmetologist I have tried many of the current ways to remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> After that first time, I could never get it to duplicate the results.</li>
            <li> It simply glided over most of the hair without doing anything.</li>
            <li> I am also affraid that the hair on my face will come back darker and more prominant than before.</li>
            <li> The smell of burnt hair didn&#x27;t really bother me, but the fact that it didn&#x27;t even take off one piece of hair did!</li>
            <li> They refused to refund me my money because I kept it beyond the first 45 days, even though it was at their request.  </li>
            <li> and I used it exactly how the video told me.</li>
            <li> First off, I didn&#x27;t buy this product through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I bought the device for, and it&#x27;s doing exactly what I had hoped it would.</li>
            <li> First, the product didn&#x27;t work and</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even burn off the entire top of the hair.  </li>
            <li> I now know how hot something has to get for a follicle to die.  </li>
            <li> It gets hot.  </li>
            <li> Hot wire.  </li>
            <li> I followed all instructions exactly.</li>
            <li> I have not only more hair, but I am cut up and burnt all the time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since my many trys I now have ingrown hairs that turned into sores &amp; now I have noticeable scars, I truly can tell you this not only does not do what it is said to do, but I now have bumps under my chin area thanks to NO!</li>
            <li> Against my better judgement, I ordered through the official website on a trial 60-day money back TRIPLE Guarantee, which meant I supposedly would not pay postage coming in or going out for this device.</li>
            <li> Thanks guys!</li>
            <li> I used it exactly how they instructed</li>
            <li> really wish I could give it no stars!</li>
            <li> the first time i tried it was on my face, it burned.</li>
            <li> suggest facial hair around mouth can be safely removed.  </li>
            <li> Upon redoing the order, the preferred price became evident.</li>
            <li> STA MENGHIA WOULD DO BETTER TO GET RID OF MY FACIAL HAIR</li>
            <li> My first go on the thigh area</li>
            <li> you must watch every section first</li>
            <li> First off, beware the return shipping policy...</li>
            <li> Also make sure if you change any information when ordering, go back and start from the beginning.  </li>
            <li> Once you get better with the technique and how to use your no no properly, this problem will disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have been working on just my face for the first two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Followed the instructions exactly.  </li>
            <li> The smell of burning hair the first time I used it concerned me, but the appliance itself does not burn the skin.</li>
            <li> I first tried a patch on my forearm just to get the feel of the product.</li>
            <li> On top of that they charged my extra 100 dollars after a month.</li>
            <li> First off, if you use it on you face, you will most likely burn yourself.  </li>
            <li> I tried to give the unit an opportunity to work, I gave it longer than 60 days because I wanted to make sure that I was using it properly, but when I still had to razor shave</li>
            <li> , I wasted a perfectly good shower on not shaving my bikini area.  </li>
            <li> Now all of a sudden on the submit page it says my $104.00 payment is the first of THREE!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when i got the product and was really looking forward to be hair free on my upper lip n chin.</li>
            <li> I feel that it may take several weeks to achieve that clean look for a long term, BUT I&#x27;m sold and very satisfied with my no no.</li>
            <li> Speaking of yuck, if you got a house full of guests and you want to clear them out, try this!  </li>
            <li> And they also have the nonohair removal system which was probably not worth more than $50!</li>
            <li> Anyway, for those who are thinking of purchasing, don&#x27;t buy as it really does not work and customer service is interested only in extracting more money.  </li>
            <li> Most feedback showed that the device was only half effective in eliminating hair growth plus you couldn&#x27;t use it on the face.    </li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t want that blue light around my eyes!</li>
            <li> Oh, and a word to the wise -- don&#x27;t try to send it back before the minimum 45 day trial period is up, or you have to cover the cost of shipping it back yourself.</li>
            <li> I find it very Fishy how most of the 5 star reviews are all on same day.</li>
            <li> I wanted what I saw on TV, the facial product, I got one that was only good for legs.  </li>
            <li> It also DOES handle the fine hairs on the TOP of my upper thighs, but the coarser hair under my upper thigh?  </li>
            <li> THOSE POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE PROBABLY ALL LIES created by the manufacturer, just like their phoney web sites!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What bothers me about some of these responses to the positive reviews is people accusing others and calling them liars....</li>
            <li> If all the reviews on any website are positive, be leary, because it is paid for by NoNo.</li>
            <li> a lot when I first got it, but wasn&#x27;t disciplined in using it as much as I should, so</li>
            <li> , they really didn&#x27;t buff much of anything no matter how many times I went over the spot or in different \\&quot;buffing\\&quot; motions (circular, rubbing).  </li>
            <li> first use did absolutely nothing to my hair</li>
            <li> so you never really have a clean hair free skin.</li>
            <li> so you never really have a clean hair free skin.  </li>
            <li> The pros always do it a little better!</li>
            <li> It looked so simple, easy and convincing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ones I used seemed to become less effective over time.</li>
            <li> To treat a large area you would need to spend hours on it.  </li>
            <li> I received a flyer in large stores catalogue mail outs, and it was for nono hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Please read all reviews as this product looks like it certainly doesn&#x27;t work for anyone.</li>
            <li> My concern is the large number of defective no-no&#x27;s being returned or replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Zipper case broke within 7 days, large tip broke &lt;</li>
            <li> To all those who wrote positive reviews on this product, they are very misleading.  </li>
            <li> This product may work for people with peach fuzz, fine hair but not on coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t you know, all my fine hairs are back</li>
            <li> This only works in my opinion on fine hair on arms..</li>
            <li> Enter the buffing pad (essentially this is extremely fine sandpaper).  </li>
            <li> would not recommend this product to anyone who doesnt have blonde fine</li>
            <li> So I looked at the smaller attachment, the wire was fine.  </li>
            <li> I went back to the website to see about returning the product and found the \\&quot;fine print\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But there was a lot of fine print, in light gray on the white background, that only appeared when it came time to charge my credit card.  </li>
            <li> I will always check this site for now on about a product It is hard to believe it got a good review from the program view.</li>
            <li> If you really want a smooth finish that actually last this isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
            <li> I have light hairs, and elder facial hairs, and it doesn&#x27;t really work on the face.</li>
            <li> If it actually did work for those few, great for them.  </li>
            <li> A lot of pain and huge eritation which last for 3 days!</li>
            <li> I also had a huge issue with the actual purchase.</li>
            <li> and i cannot see much of a difference, we will see how it ends..</li>
            <li> I agree with everyone about the smell, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me much.  </li>
            <li> my 60 day guarantee will have expired so I am really nervous that this is just a ploy to get out of paying my refund.  </li>
            <li> stars cuz its very expansive and takes a lot time to do its job</li>
            <li> didnt do the job of removing hair very well.    </li>
            <li> but I also didn&#x27;t pay as much as everyone else did.</li>
            <li> But they don&#x27;t really WANT you to return it - so they&#x27;ve made it a real hassel to get said refund.</li>
            <li> Of course I let too much time go and kept it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing commercials &amp; really wanted to buy this product.</li>
            <li> According to them it takes months to see real progress so those reviews shouldn&#x27;t even be counted.    </li>
            <li> Not so much as a courtesy fob off call.</li>
            <li> Very disapointing product.  </li>
            <li> and I need fast hair removal so this product was not for me.    </li>
            <li> As a man trying to remove unwanted chest hair it does not seem to work and it is very time consuming.</li>
            <li> I would much rather prefer shaving and deal with razor burns vs dealing with the time consuming hassel with the NO NO.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do the job of removing hair very well.     </li>
            <li> My mom ordered it for me because the commercial made it sound miraculous.  </li>
            <li> (like how fabulous it really is if only I&#x27;d give it another try).</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a pre-med student, so I really don&#x27;t have spare time).</li>
            <li> Very deceiving practices.</li>
            <li> It stops and starts on whim, and refuses to light up even though I am following instructions and pushing it against the skin and hair shaft as instructed.</li>
            <li> It was very embarrassing.  </li>
            <li> I have light to medium coarse hair on my legs, and while it did not remove all of the hair (you can feel stubble),</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll update this review after I&#x27;ve spent more time with my nono.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll update this review after I&#x27;ve spent more time with my nono.</li>
            <li> Oh, also, it really did make my leg hair grow in thinner, but not lighter.  </li>
            <li> and really I don&#x27;t think there has been any change in the 2 years I have been using it.</li>
            <li> Anyway - thanks to all those who have taken the time to write a review.</li>
            <li> REALLY WELL.</li>
            <li> An absolute godsend for anybody struggling with polycystic ovaries.</li>
            <li> I have had this for six months and it really does absolutely nothing except</li>
            <li> Mine looks larger than the ones on TV, they are free from cords.  </li>
            <li> The box was incredibly damaged upon receiving it, and the instructions are vague and not at all what the product is advertised as.  </li>
            <li> It is a disgraceful money-stealing scam and should be legally challenged in all countries.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really decrease anything, just a painless way to remove some hair, not even all of it.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> If this item really did all it was supposed to do.....</li>
            <li> Yes, there is a 60-days guarantee where you can try no-no for free, and if you don&#x27;t like it, you can send it back, no questions asked.</li>
            <li> (let&#x27;s say 5...and that&#x27;s being generous), you would really offer no assistance to the customer once their 2-year warranty expires?\\</li>
            <li> And that is too high!  </li>
            <li> one star is too high a rating!</li>
            <li> Almost no hair removal after a week straight of use!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I chose to pay the whole thing at once,</li>
            <li> So, you don&#x27;t really know it&#x27;s not working until way after 60 days.</li>
            <li> Instead I have a very burnt face.</li>
            <li> thanks people for taking time.to write reviews</li>
            <li> On my face, it really does not work.</li>
            <li> SOOOOOO, if you REALLY want one.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> The ladies at the Reno Sephora, at the Summit mall, were very helpful when I visited the store and asked for assistance with the product.    </li>
            <li> Thanks,  Sandy</li>
            <li> My hair thinned out after time and now grows in really patchy,</li>
            <li> Thanks,</li>
            <li> Who wants to go around with half-hairy legs or shave their legs twice?</li>
            <li> product did absolutely NOTHING for ANY of the coarser hair</li>
            <li> Those hairs are very stubborn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had much luck with things sold on TV</li>
            <li> You really cant over do it.</li>
            <li> Not so much.  </li>
            <li> I tried it for 6 weeks with absolutely zero results.</li>
            <li> But what I did get was an email offer the next day to purchase the product with free shipping because it seemed that while I had browsed the site, I did not make a purchase.</li>
            <li> I have dealt with excess hair for years, and it is the one thing that really bothers me.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the No No, but you have to remember to be patient!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for writing the reviews.</li>
            <li> I suppose I cannot really rate the no</li>
            <li> This is the only thing they made easy-the return of the item free of charge.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again for warning.</li>
            <li> I purchased it over the phone straight from the company.</li>
            <li> think the buffer pad is where the real hair removal happens</li>
            <li> I should have known that there was a reason it was so much cheaper than the model advertised on T.V.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work.  </li>
            <li> I was really sold on the product You have saved me and probably millions of people lots of money</li>
            <li> I believe the whole thing is a scam.</li>
            <li> Any hair removal is a very time consuming process, I don&#x27;t care what method you use.  </li>
            <li> I had very course chin hair, and my chin felt like sandpaper when I ran my hand over my chin area for about two weeks.  </li>
            <li> This really does NOT work , but forget that - the company itself is a SCAM company</li>
            <li> /&gt;1st sign of SCAM was that their Advertisement on TV didn&#x27;t really say the price...</li>
            <li> All I got out of it was the smell of burned hair, and after using it, I had just as much hair as before using it.</li>
            <li> Really???  </li>
            <li> After a couple weeks of sporadic uses, I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in my hair thickness/darkness, but the condition of the device itself.</li>
            <li> So much easier.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an absolute scam.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> What a complete waste of good money.  </li>
            <li> I honestly have never been motivated enough about a product purchase to actually write a review, but I feel this is warranted:  </li>
            <li> First off i will start by saying i only ordered cause it say good for black women  </li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Easy enough to use, but I have a life to live and do not wish to invest the time they say it will take to get results.</li>
            <li> After the first time I used it I sent it back to make sure I received my close to $400.00 refund as soon as possible.   </li>
            <li> I felt like it was not doing anything much (other than pissing off my husband, and consuming my precious time).  </li>
            <li> The other lists the face as ok &amp; has &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; tips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am actually atching the comercial and got so excited, I came on to Amazon thinking I would</li>
            <li> Ok so my husband purchased the pink no!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to finally order the no!no! hair removal system</li>
            <li> This updated version is COMPLETELY PAINLESS to use and has a much higher percentage of success than the old model.    </li>
            <li> Mexico never really cared about the Chevy \\&quot;NOVA,\\&quot; because NO VA means no go in Spanish, although it may have been a good car, the name was less represent able.  </li>
            <li> When the first version of the No No Classic was released a while back, not many people were impressed.</li>
            <li> At first the hair was just singed, so I thought maybe I needed to go over it a few more times as the instructions said.</li>
            <li> I have more coarse hair, so I can&#x27;t speak for finer haired results, but it took for me to do it and at the end it was super rough and wasn&#x27;t all gone anyway.  </li>
            <li> In large bold letter, they advertised the online price as only $89 plus $15 shipping.  </li>
            <li> Do be warned, if you have very light hair, or very dark skin laser hair removal may not be advanced enough at this point to treat you.  </li>
            <li> I cant believe the level of deception that&#x27;s being advertised here, it should not be legal to falsify the results of a product as much as is done for the New NONO.</li>
            <li> bought the product on a special discount using a promo on the TV commercial.  </li>
            <li> The unit burned his skin, and the stench of burning hair was so strong, I had to open my windows in February to clear the air.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it consistently every other day for about 6 months and have seen a huge decrease in the hair growth on my legs.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately I charged this to my Amex card, and Amex is now battling the Radiency Co., on my behalf, to get them  to cease charging me $89.94 a month, for an item I returned long ago.   </li>
            <li> The only reason they want you to try it for the full 45-60 days is because then they have all your payments.</li>
            <li> Like most people looking for the golden system for home hair removal, I ordered the No No.  It turned out to be a complete waste of my time and money.  </li>
            <li> that being said, one needs to keep the unit level inorder to obtain consistant results, which is very difficult to do when it is continiously losing power...thank you for your time, have a wonderful life!  </li>
            <li> The green light was on and all it did was burn the top part of the hair off and left my skin itchy and still had to shave.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see one of the first things it said was NOT to use it on your face.  </li>
            <li> I saw this on one of the shopping channels (like that&#x27;s not bad enough) and fell for it.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s more $$ down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s more $$ down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are slick, hide the true price in the fine print.</li>
            <li> I eventually ended up returning it to HSN, for what it was advertised to do, and what it actually did certainly wasn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have had to buy a new version from NO NO!</li>
            <li> She had no interest in investigating whether my particular model was faulty - it was all my fault.</li>
            <li> and that is it actually ends up creating more hairgrowth coming back than before for some women.  </li>
            <li> Luckily it went away without any lasting damages or scarring after I stop using it.  </li>
            <li> I asked for a replacement, i was sent a different color one, but I liked the pink one.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried the Nono, it actually worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> WHICH, is one of the MAIN reasons for ME purchasing the unit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I&#x27;d seen good reviews on this product too though, so I actually tried it for a few months.  </li>
            <li> i would only recommend this product if you love your facial hair and are in to getting your skin burned.</li>
            <li> Not only does this device not remove hair adequately, but it also creates ingrown hairs, and does not work on tan skin.</li>
            <li> If your hair grows back quickly with shaving it will grow back just as quickly with this.  </li>
            <li> I bought the classic no no</li>
            <li> (it was only 1 payment of 2, but they quickly remedied that issue when I emailed them - I have been fully refunded as of today).</li>
            <li> Only I was lucky</li>
            <li> Not only do you spend a tremendous amount of time doing it, it doesn&#x27;t even give results.</li>
            <li> and I would still have to go shave to feel confident enough to go into public!  </li>
            <li> Funny, I have seen the infomercial many times and that was never prominently mentioned.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was buying an older model to save some money.  </li>
            <li> No Skin seems to be effective in preventing or at least alleviating a full blown pimple if you apply it enough.</li>
            <li> Also have medium to heavy amount of very light hair on my arms and thought I would just give this a thorough workout during the trial.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll leave you high and dry...with a $270.00 paperweight...</li>
            <li> Again, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I will admit that I didn&#x27;t have high expectations of it, because I thought if laser didn&#x27;t work this probably wouldn&#x27;t either.  </li>
            <li> WHen I first went online to see reviews of the NONO hair removal system, I found only positive endorsements.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be the solution to my problem, but after reading other reviews and conducting my own trial, this is definitely not it.</li>
            <li> However, Radiancy quickly released a new and vastly improved version called the No No 8800 series.</li>
            <li> but I have a really tiny stall shower, and this is WAY more convenient for me than trying to shave sitting on the toilet since I can use it while watching TV, etc.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t smart enough to read the reviews first.  </li>
            <li> It is only good for the legs and chest and considering I don&#x27;t have hair on my chest and very little on my legs, it will probably sit in the closet until I toss it out.</li>
            <li> all worded almost exactly the same and all with a link to the company website, which miraculously is only offering the \\&quot;special introductory trial\\</li>
            <li> Laser may be more expensive but it WORKS and waxing is cheap and fast and it WORKS.</li>
            <li> and I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for nearly a year, and it does absolutely NOTHING it claims.</li>
            <li> Better to wax than waste money on this.  </li>
            <li> Forget underarms, legs which are normal thickness and ladies, don&#x27;t even hope for bikini or Brazilian.  </li>
            <li> no no SUCKS</li>
            <li> /&gt;She tells me that it is pretty much a product that burns off the hairs, stinking up the house and leaving her with a lasting burning sensation when she was finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not yet sure how long they will last,</li>
            <li> not yet sure how long they will last,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Spend a few more dollars and get a RIO Laser those work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of consumers money and precious time.  </li>
            <li> When I called the number to tell them I was returning it (a required step, in order to get your \\&quot;return number\\&quot;), I was interrogated by a male operator who asked for uncomfortably intimate details on exactly where and</li>
            <li> I mostly use an epilator (shave occasionally) and use the No!No! in between for maintenance and long term treatment.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely write another review after using it for a year, but seeing results as fast as I did I don&#x27;t have any doubt that the No No will do exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> and once you get past the smell its way more convenient than shaving and much nicer than waxing.</li>
            <li> I am glad I didn&#x27;t waste my time or money on the product for once.</li>
            <li> When there are a small handful of positive reviews to hundreds of negative ones, it wouldn&#x27;t be very wise on my part to buy it anyway.</li>
            <li> While holding the skin taut, I tried slower, waited some weeks for my new wounds to heal, then I tried faster (more cuts and missing skin).</li>
            <li> The process is totally painless, relatively speedy, and as easy as can be.</li>
            <li> I did, I kept it for a few months, but found out very quickly that this does absolutely nothing for</li>
            <li> However the hair grows right back....</li>
            <li> The hair grows right back.  </li>
            <li> and I will Never purchase anything from Amazon, unless they do the right thing and credit my card back.</li>
            <li> I hope you do the right thing for future business.</li>
            <li> As soon as I saw this, I called right back and got another guy</li>
            <li> This product works slightly better then rubbing your legs with plain paper.</li>
            <li> A label was smacked right on the outside of the NoNo box, which was trashed by the time it got to me!</li>
            <li> Before I go further I will say that I have baby fine hair, not coarse.</li>
            <li> , I still have prominent blue veins apparent on my shins, veins that surfaced only after my use of the no!no!     </li>
            <li> When I got the light flashing it was extremely time consuming.</li>
            <li> I am a very hairy African American woman who had a full 5&#x27;o clock shadow by noon, when I waxed or tweezed.</li>
            <li> but it seems like you would have to have a new buffer for each use........</li>
            <li> you live and learn.</li>
            <li> I never got my new</li>
            <li> No Hair have upgraded to a new one</li>
            <li> The one I ordered from the site should have been a new item.</li>
            <li> Some were online \\&quot;newspapers\\&quot; reporting new technology.  </li>
            <li> I had to call 5 times before I got a live person.</li>
            <li> Sure, it may slow down hair regrowth, but trust me, it all COMES BACK, and more!</li>
            <li> (and yes I was using the buffer, the blue light remained steadily on and it seems I was doing everything right; it did say the product does not work well on really fine hair nor on really coarse hair which leaves a narrow group the product MIGHT potentially work for - some of my hair issues fell into the correct range</li>
            <li> You have to use it regularly, but after trying epilation, waxing etc., this is the only thing that works and is pain free.  </li>
            <li> I still shave, but repeated use of the no no has left me much smoother much longer.</li>
            <li> This was over a week ago, and my chin still mildly hurts, and even with the soothing cream provided, moisturizers, lotions, and petroleum jelly, my skin is STILL peeling and flaking and dry.</li>
            <li> If you really think about it, most people that write product reviews have negative experience.</li>
            <li> it would be much easier to shave the hair with a shaver.. same result, also painless and no smell, and much cheaper</li>
            <li> , whenever I used the larger tip, the red light always came and the No-No stopped no matter how I angled it.</li>
            <li> But even after several weeks of use, following the instructions, I have never gotten a smooth spot on my legs and all it did on my face was burn.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s short, it sticks straight out, it is VERY noticeable, and when my hair touches my face it STICKS TO MY FACE.  </li>
            <li> No Co. to STOP charging your credit card even 1 1/2 months AFTER you have returned the unsatisfactory item, this is a product and company that you should stay very far away from.  </li>
            <li> The refurb battery had an even shorter life than the original did and after the second request to go through what would have only been a battery replacement again, the company informed me that I would have to purchase a new</li>
            <li> Newer technology that is intriguing and will see how it works out long term.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 59 years old today!</li>
            <li> Your first red flag should be the fact that a d-list soap opera actress is hawking this product.  </li>
            <li> Two days after my first (and only) use of the no!</li>
            <li> This was the first time I bought something because of a TV commercial.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> It was a complete joke!</li>
            <li> , I only used the first treatment level.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the makers of no!no! are simply price-gouging customers (and wasting their time by burning the hair first) in order to sell buffing pads.  </li>
            <li> Magic pipe dream wonder products usually end up on TV infomercials.....</li>
            <li> I am willing to wait an extra day or two to get it.</li>
            <li> It also makes this smell, which I showered afterwards so it shouldn&#x27;t have been a big deal, but I could smell that smell off and on the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Considering how shady this company is, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I used this daily and never saw the first result.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle product and definitely didn&#x27;t zap the hair away in a minute but with consistent use it IS working for me.  </li>
            <li> Not only did I do exactly what I was supposed to do</li>
            <li> First, the product simply does not work.</li>
            <li> First thing in the morning, the next day, which by now was the third day, I called first thing in the morning around 7am.</li>
            <li> I was thinking about giving it the 60 day trial since I already paid my first payment, but after reading these reviews, im going to write REFUSED on it and send it back</li>
            <li> customer service reps are professional liars and should be reviewed!</li>
            <li> I was enticed by the company&#x27;s offer of a triple money back guarantee (*see note below*), but I was worried that they wouldn&#x27;t follow through with their promise if the product didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everyone should be contacting the better business bureau and whoever else may help about all their problems with the product and the company that sells it being so shady.</li>
            <li> This products is grossly over priced and the web site missadvertises the price, They said it would be 110 but each month following the original purchace date they charged and additional hundred.</li>
            <li> Full marks to nono, pity it did not</li>
            <li> Please know that if you buy this product and pay in full, you CANNOT return it, after 60 days, for even a partial refund.</li>
            <li> and it most definitely does not slow down the growth.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t really say one way or the other right now.</li>
            <li> It took me six long calls over 2 months just to get the RMA in order to ship this back to the company for free (which they claimed was part of my purchase agreement).  </li>
            <li> This thing is a waste of money   it breaks so easy pls.</li>
            <li> Not safe, evidently, to use on the face, and so that&#x27;s a No No for the \\&quot;full</li>
            <li> I use mine multiple times though the instructions say only two pulses at a time when I am breaking out or have a full blown pimple.</li>
            <li> although I was promised a double my money back guarantee they made me keep it and charged my credit card for the full price before I was allowed to return it.  </li>
            <li> When talking to customer service, they stated that they were aware of the problem, yet I would still have to pay for the shipping to have it fixed a second time.</li>
            <li> And considering the amount of time it takes to complete a full-body treatment, not to mention having to do it every other day, it would just make far more sense to simply shave once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> DO find that this product DOES work FAMOUSLY on FINE little hairs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After carefully reading all instructions carefully, I couldn&#x27;t figure out why I could smell the burnt hair of the very fine hairs of my face</li>
            <li> After reading 10+ pages of reviews on this site I found only 4 or 5 positive experiences.  </li>
            <li> Company will harass you once they have your credit card and falsely charge more money!</li>
            <li> NO,\\&quot; I am more or less biased, never having tried the product, reading the related reviews</li>
            <li> I had slight facial hair like most women.  </li>
            <li> The unit burns the hair, sure, but it takes several SUPER SLOW strokes over the same spot to leave the skin hair free but with black dots corresponding the singed hair.</li>
            <li> It is not easy, it hurts and it does not remove the hair easily.  </li>
            <li> The hair looks thinner to a certain extent because you&#x27;re not getting shaving stubble, but you&#x27;d get the same result from waxing.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I called to order it and the guy on the phone told me the first payment, which was $104.00, I told him I would have to call back the next day because I didn&#x27;t have enough in my account to cover it until my direct deposit came in the next day, and he promised it wouldnt be charged until the next two days anyway, so I went ahead and told him if that was the case, then ok.</li>
            <li> If the bars go down on the display, clean the tips and if that doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s time to change them.  </li>
            <li> but you have to wait until the 45th day you&#x27;ve owned it to claim it; they do this in the hopes that there will be so little time left that you won&#x27;t be able to pack it and ship it in the fifteen days allotted.</li>
            <li> Not a quick fix at all, but at a fraction of the price of professional laser hair removal it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read most of the reviews on here and most people seem to have had a bad time with it</li>
            <li> Stay clear.</li>
            <li> If your willing to put the time in and spend the money, it&#x27;s worth it for working on small areas.</li>
            <li> , I also advised that they had replied to my husband when the email was clearly from me.</li>
            <li> : clear DVD instructions -</li>
            <li> I used it on my legs where I do not have who knows how much hair as I waxed and used Burn&#x27;s (German company) extraction machine all my life.  </li>
            <li> I thought no-no would completely rid off my hair.</li>
            <li> Meaning, it completely removed the hair in some spots, but not in others.  </li>
            <li> Please do not waste your time or your money.</li>
            <li> I have done professional laser hair removal before</li>
            <li> and so I can tell this is doing the same thing at a MUCH slower pace.</li>
            <li> So far, my underarm hair is 100% gone while my leg and arm hair are 50% gone.</li>
            <li> I wish so much that I would have read Amazon reviews prior to making my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li> People,  Did anyone else notice that even the 4 &amp; 5 star reviews only say they&#x27;re trying it and have not seen much?  </li>
            <li> I continue to use it with modest satisfaction.   </li>
            <li> I just bought my No No a few days ago.</li>
            <li> They say that the only really PERMANENT solution to unwanted hair is electrolysis...</li>
            <li> However, I have friends who are completely hairless</li>
            <li> They close the line at 5 - probably too many complaint calls.</li>
            <li> This is one time I am glad I didn&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews.    </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t like falling for late night</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a week and am very dissastisifed with the product.</li>
            <li> After professional hair removal, I bought this product as a safety measure and upkeep.</li>
            <li> Save your money on a professional laser removal appt.  </li>
            <li> This is completely unprofessional and lacks any semblance of customer service.</li>
            <li> I finally got a real person and was told to wait another 7-10 days for my refund.  </li>
            <li> 1 treatment costs as much as this set and will actually work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me about 45-60 minutes to complete both legs.</li>
            <li> did have to go over a few areas more than once, and because I have such sensitive skin</li>
            <li> maybe I won&#x27;t have to go over the same area as much (about 3 or 4 times on</li>
            <li> I reluctantly kept the device longer then the 60 days money back guarantee period (even though the product wasn&#x27;t really producing said results).</li>
            <li> (I used on only one side of my face to see if it was really doing anything).  </li>
            <li> what a complete rip off.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;miracle from the Twilight Zone\\&quot; sells for as much as 200 bucks on the net too.  </li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t have clear or concise answers for any of my questions.  </li>
            <li> but it takes forever to complete the process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping the company will honour their promises to completely refund what I paid for this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Repeat this process at least three to four times in one session, and after three months or more</li>
            <li> and it would cost a considerable amount of money to do so</li>
            <li> therefore believe that training is required for the customer services unless the company policy or vision is to direct all customers to the premium number for some sort of gain.</li>
            <li> Naturally you will smell the burning of hair.  </li>
            <li> this by far being the strangest thing I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
            <li> I bought the NONO and so far I like it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a sensitive area</li>
            <li> I bought it directly from the No No company.</li>
            <li> The hair grows back just as fast as if shaving.  </li>
            <li> and you may be surprised.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re causing your hair growing cycles to stagger, like when I get patchy hair growth after frequent waxing/shaving.  </li>
            <li> They said the deposit money I paid would go straight back into my account when they received the &#x27;No No&#x27; machine</li>
            <li> If you have, send it straight back.</li>
            <li> Please do not waste any money on this product, I will be returning it a.s.a.p.</li>
            <li> Both of these products did not work anywhere near what the promos lead u to believe.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing back much slower than it used to.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the difference of getting your hair professionally colored and doing a box dye job at home...</li>
            <li> I was really psyched about finally getting rid of my mustache.  </li>
            <li> So far every time I&#x27;ve used it</li>
            <li> as I was really hoping to get rid of my facial hair</li>
            <li> So I guess I&#x27;ve thrown away nearly $300.</li>
            <li> It causes a pinching sensation that is far from Painless.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li> WOW..</li>
            <li> When I hit next, instead of the expected grand total of $104.00, it was nearly $400.00.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anywhere else though (stomach, chest, legs, etc.), it&#x27;s COMPLETELY ineffective.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after much consideration of the possible pros and cons.</li>
            <li> I am in a Professional office.  </li>
            <li> PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS a complete SCAM, SCAM,</li>
            <li> In the infomercial, they don&#x27;t really show anyone up close as they&#x27;re using the product, just from farther away, so there is no visual proof that it works before buying it.</li>
            <li> It has been 4 business days so far and no email.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times since I purchased it.</li>
            <li> you have to use it daily in order to get it to work, but it really does not work.  </li>
            <li> I got a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach after seeing more than 90% of the reviews were negative.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> during that period of time and making a profit out of it even if you ultimately return the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an absolute scam</li>
            <li> do not waste your time or money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have spent most of my adult life trying everything on my face to get rid of the stubborn chin and upper lip growth and this is the only product that has worked for me.  </li>
            <li> The device stopped working completely in about 8 weeks</li>
            <li> Save your money and pay a professional.</li>
            <li> Beyond offers this product for around $250..not to mention you can use a coupon on it..</li>
            <li> After a few days of trying someone finally answered &amp; I was able to return it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suggest buying this product as I followed all the instructions, used it for a few weeks a few times a week without any good results.  </li>
            <li> All it did WAS MAKE THE HAIR MORE THICK AND BLACKER, LIKE A MAN&#x27;S BIERD.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care what they say about everyone loving it that is false advertisement and according to the reviews I read ( all of them)</li>
            <li> First a little bit of the positive: the No</li>
            <li> It has saved myself and I am sure numerous other women the money, frustration, and apparently facial burns.  </li>
            <li> It takes four times longer than just shaving, hours a week, actually... and then they want you to let the hair it didn&#x27;t get to grow back to a certain length so you can go over the area again... and again... and AGAIN!</li>
            <li> Most laser/electrolysis combo salons are lazy and inexperienced in electrolysis which is very time consuming.</li>
            <li> I actually schedule this in my calendar to do it 3 times a week for the first 6 weeks, then 2 times a week, following the recommended usage in the instructions.</li>
            <li> dissatified and was unaware it was the older model before I used it</li>
            <li> What woman can&#x27;t be caught by the commercial, even though the first red flag is that on the one I taped, no price was given.  </li>
            <li> There is never less hair.</li>
            <li> Tria only works on dark hair and light skin, but no no works on any hair any skin type.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they wear out quickly and need replacing after going over HALF a leg.  </li>
            <li> removed most hair from face but had a rash and the hair just grew back as usual.</li>
            <li> I ordered the new model and received the old one had to open box to see item, I tried it and it work somewhat but not altogether.</li>
            <li> but I read various reviews on line and there were enough positive one that I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> It takes a long time and I really don&#x27;t have time to do it 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> Interesting that there are no good reviews on this item.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately not what was expected.</li>
            <li> properly.you really have to move as slowly as you can over an area (without the light turning red of course)</li>
            <li> I used it on my legs on found that it took forever to use on the entire thing, the smell of burning hair filled my house, not all hair was removed on the first few tries.</li>
            <li> This old model incorporates a blade which cuts the skin if not very carefully used.</li>
            <li> All the negative reviews are true!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s seems that my hair grows back faster and in new places.</li>
            <li> You must purchase new replacement solutions and buffing pads regularly.</li>
            <li> I live in Alabama and out of the blue, I get a letter from a collection agency saying I owe $150-195 or something.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other has a battery to be charged up.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found positive &amp; negatives for both so far.</li>
            <li> I write straight up what I think about a product -- good or bad.</li>
            <li> I write straight up what I think about a product -- good or bad.</li>
            <li> Now I am reading all the negative reviews from Amazon,,,,, I am so glad I sent it back.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t send this product back fast enough.</li>
            <li> After a while of using it, it does make the hair not grow back as much, my doctor recommended me to use it with vanqia a prescription for unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> The terminals are like claws protruding much farther than the wire, and the wire is ten times farther back.  </li>
            <li> The representative suggested to her to get the black no-no (no-no for men) as those rarely got returned.</li>
            <li> Instead they replied to my husband (obviously they had not taken the time to read to the end as i clearly stated my name)and informed that I should direct my query to their 0844 ect ect number if I required an answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I went back to my regular shaver which I decided was much faster, easier, and efficient.</li>
            <li> but why waste so much money on a Gimmick that doesn&#x27;t really do its job ?&lt;</li>
            <li> The representative &#x27;knew what I meant&#x27; and she said I had to use the product quickly and firmly -</li>
            <li> So, I decided to just test the NoNo out on my right leg from the knee down.  </li>
            <li> I have done laser, but stopped....and the first rule in laser is to not use any other hair removal technique.</li>
            <li> Everyone who has tried to return it seems to have had major issues.</li>
            <li> You have to jump through so many hoops to send it back, and I&#x27;m not confident I&#x27;ll ever see my money back from it.  </li>
            <li> It was even on Dr. Oz, apparently he hasn&#x27;t read the reviews either!  </li>
            <li> instructions tell you to go over a small area 3-4 times and if the area needs more treatment after that to come back to it later after your skin has had time to \\&quot;rest\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> That was the major point.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason no other company invented a hair removal that works on HEAT</li>
            <li> Subsequently it toook three months of phone calls (each time I was assured the refund was in progress) and finally the threat of legal action to FINALLY get a refund.</li>
            <li> I want the hairs to grow back quickly so I can shoot them down again.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these a few years ago and want to warn anyone interested in getting it - Don&#x27;t do it!  </li>
            <li> I have had my no no for going on two years, I have the older model not the newer one, and only paid 75.00 for the entire system when Dillard&#x27;s stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> It was hard to get used to the sound, but it works.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product if you have a little patience at the start - I&#x27;m in it for the long haul and think this is a very useful product.</li>
            <li> The consensus is that this product DOES NOT WORK, doesn&#x27;t work as advertised, is cheaply constructed, shoddy, unreliable.</li>
            <li> The smell of burning hair didn&#x27;t bother me too much, but i found that it only worked on decently long hair-no leg stubble.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair, so my hair growth is NOT heavy.</li>
            <li> I marked RETURN TO SENDER for Canada Post, otherwise I would have had to pay a further charge to return the product.  </li>
            <li> i used it on my face and neck and legs nothing barely and hair was gone my face was burnt</li>
            <li> I thought wow, I don&#x27;t have to tweez my facial hair..</li>
            <li> apparently I bought junk.</li>
            <li> definitely no where NEAR the pain of an epilator or those so-called \\&quot;pain</li>
            <li> But No No is what it says it is, a big no no as far a eliminating body hair.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this product altogehter when I developed a rash on both sides of my face in the sideburn area, which is like a ton of tiny pimples.</li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde, so my skin and hair are too ligjt for it to work.</li>
            <li> I contacted the customer service via email,to ask them if it could be repaired or had to be replaced, the reply surprised me as I was expecting a list of recommended companies for fixing the fault or a simple it can not be repaired.</li>
            <li> I only wanted to know where to get it fixed</li>
            <li> Ladies, I have had real laser hair removal, and there is absolutely no reason why this product would work the way it says it does.  </li>
            <li> There is absolutely no comparison of how REAL laser hair removal works and burning your hair to root.  </li>
            <li> not work and all  that nono offers is a second hand machine with 3 months warranty for $120.00 + postage</li>
            <li> /&gt;the drive band will not last ,the nono can&#x27;t be fixed and no one at head office gives a toss&lt;br</li>
            <li> It burned my skin, which felt sensitive &amp; looked red for days and the hair grew sooner than the product claims.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent so much time trying to get this thing to work for me</li>
            <li> now, like a dummy I sit here waiting for my money (nearly $500) to be put back into my account though I called them immediately to cancel both orders.</li>
            <li> So then I moved on to the more expensive laser hair removal which actually worked really well.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and invest the extra money in professional laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> I find it useless on leg/bikini hair, and somewhat effective on arm hair.</li>
            <li> I see 60 day return promises all over the advertising, but when I go to return it, I see I am past a 30 day window for a full refund.  </li>
            <li> The way the product is designed, there&#x27;s basically a sort of thin electric wire that just burns off the top of the hair.  </li>
            <li> This little product ranks right up there with the Pet Rock, \\&quot;boil in the bag lettuce\\&quot; and the elastic tape measure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure many people are skeptical about the no-no due to the large number of negative reviews, including this one.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I get a new tech that doesn&#x27;t read my chart and see I have been coming since 2003 and getting my back, shoulders, upper arms and neck and chest.</li>
            <li> Not only does it appear that my mom wasted her money (luckily there is a reimbursement on returned items)</li>
            <li> I obtained it beginning of May, only a few days after ordering it, to my amazement that they managed their orders so quickly &amp; efficiently.  </li>
            <li> i kept on trying to perfect my technique (not the issue, the issue is that it is impossible to use on your upper lip or chin due to facial contours) and waiting for the results promised, so the 60 day trial period ran out.  </li>
            <li> The first one didn&#x27;t work, the head was a half inch below the place where it could even reach the skin.  </li>
            <li> First of all I am a guy, I have had the black and silver</li>
            <li> I will not be wasting my money or worse yet risking damage to my skin thanks to the honest reviews given by all of you that did unfortunately waste your money only to have no results and burnt skin.  </li>
            <li> It basically clipped off the top bit of hair, leaving behind some stubble near the root and grew back just the same as it had been shaved.  </li>
            <li> Hair is a very poor heat conductor, that&#x27;s why it keeps your head warm</li>
            <li> I had to replace the thermicon tip after 2 weeks of use and my buffer is completely worn out, my legs are dry and scaly and I have no less hair than when I started using it.</li>
            <li> I have blonde, fine hair, this product sucks.  </li>
            <li> You have to go over the same very small area many times just to get a little hair gone and not even that much looked gone.</li>
            <li> As someone else said, it just burned off the hair from the top of the skin and there was still stubble there that you rub away with the little round sand paper thing.  </li>
            <li> The blades don&#x27;t have any effect for very long and when you try to buy some new ones</li>
            <li> As far as their claims about less hair coming back and eventually stopping, they are absolutely untrue.</li>
            <li> It has so far removed only facial skin...</li>
            <li> Well, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to get all the way down to the follicle.  </li>
            <li> I almost did, just decided to do a little research first.  </li>
            <li> They first sent me one that looked used and had little burnt hairs on it.</li>
            <li> Bottom line if it doesn&#x27;t remove your hair on the first go, how will you ever get to the point of having little or no hair to remove....??</li>
            <li> Even daily use on this area never made it the least bit smooth, still needed to be shaved several times a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a long term product  DONT BUY THIS</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell you whether it offers long term removal because it did not remove the hair to begin with.</li>
            <li> It barely worked on my facial peach fuzz but</li>
            <li> The first time we used the narrow tip for her chin / jaw area.  </li>
            <li> It takes an hour to do both full legs because you have to go over each leg at least 4 times to get all the hair.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten past the point that you are using it three or four times a week to say whether its really worth it or not.  </li>
            <li> Be aware it will take a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> God only knows how many people they&#x27;ve ripped off this way simply because those people don&#x27;t keep a tight watch on their statements (I didn&#x27;t even notice the problem with the refund until a few weeks after it happened).   </li>
            <li> I also must say that all the other positive reviews that could be real were written by people who have only used it a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The name ironically carries new meaning for me now as a fleece down for my dollars by a foreign con artists hiding behind a website to pretending to be legitimate!In canada if the customer is unsatisfied with the product and has the original reciept we believe its the customers right to return it.</li>
            <li> The life of the razors are not very long.</li>
            <li> Less eager to part with so much money I decided to check the reviews expecting to see accolades.  </li>
            <li> As I usually do with returns that cost more than a few dollars, I sent it by certified mail that required their signature, so that I would have proof that they received it.</li>
            <li> The product is also poorly made and can easily cause burns.</li>
            <li> If I had thick masses of dark body hair, it might be ok,</li>
            <li> Plus, when it grows, it grows soft and doesn&#x27;t poke like a hair that was shaved as shaving is cutting the hair and has flat surface and grows evenly together but extracted one has pointy ends and every different hair grows at its own time and is not chaffing when touch.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no magic bullet (like newer, more expensive products might be), but I think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> consider an overweight person who constantly wears tight jeans that rub on certain parts of the legs.  </li>
            <li> I used the buffer &#x27;wet &amp; dry sandpaper really&#x27; provided to remove it, nothing happened.  </li>
            <li> It is not a 5 star because I had to make several calls and do some serious convincing that the product was not for me before they refunded me my money and due to the fact that it did not help my situation .</li>
            <li> If you have really fine thin hair, maybe this is the gadget for you.  </li>
            <li> I used the No-No for 1 1/2 years and really never did see much if any permanent hair loss--although I kept hoping!When my battery stopped working properly, as lithium batteries tend to do eventually, the company informed me that they have a no new battery policy.  </li>
            <li> I used the buffer provided, but the next day my skin is just as dry and scaly, and I don&#x27;t have a problem with dry skin normally.</li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse facial hair (the reason for the NoNo) and it WILL NOT deliver a smooth skin surface as promised.  </li>
            <li> The hair on my face (upper lip and a very noticeable patch on my chin) is very dark and coarse; as is the hair on my legs.  </li>
            <li> I had used this thing for about half a year (over twice the 3-month guarantee period) at full power without a SINGLE stitch of progress other than MAYBE my forearms.</li>
            <li> It came with 2 buffer pads (1 large and 1 small) as well as 3 tip attachments, and 2 different types of cream.  </li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t want this product its dangerous on your sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t even do what you wanted it to do in the first place.</li>
            <li> What angered me the most about this product (even more than the fact that it didn&#x27;t work), was the shoddy way the company deals with returns.</li>
            <li> this piece of junk, open it, and you&#x27;re flat out of luck if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it didn&#x27;t burn the hair down very far</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money if you have dark coarse hairs that you want to get rid of.     </li>
            <li> , I am the first to admit that I&#x27;m a sucker for infomercials, and have bought any and all hair removal systems that have come out in the last 20-25 years.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it takes awhile (6mo-1yr) to see long lasting results.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive in the long run...</li>
            <li> It ends up that it looked worse after than before leaving some of the burned off hairs with a dark, burned top just at skin level.  </li>
            <li> Once in a while I bring it out, but it takes so much time to do a small area</li>
            <li> As much as you&#x27;re tempted by the ads or their slick website, don&#x27;t buy into it.</li>
            <li> It was too late to return the first one.</li>
            <li> At least I had the foresight to check this product out first.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work and got stuck &#x27;on&#x27; after about 10 times using it which I reckon is not safe at all.</li>
            <li> First negative..</li>
            <li> It takes quite a long time for one treatment, so I have been working only on removing the hairs on my stomach.</li>
            <li> but I spent $400 on getting JUST my upper lip done, and after 5 sessions, the hair is still growing back in my biggest areas of concern (corners of upper lip), so</li>
            <li> but I spent $400 on getting JUST my upper lip done, and after 5 sessions, the hair is still growing back in my biggest areas of concern (corners of upper lip), so</li>
            <li> : it doesn&#x27;t work unless the hair is long enough.</li>
            <li> If my face was flat it would work.</li>
            <li> And didn&#x27;t really last all that long any way.</li>
            <li> No&#x27;s do not last as long as anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ended up with strange red spot on the skin that come and go.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I ended up with two</li>
            <li> Cannot allow my facial hair to get that long...</li>
            <li> ...try it a little longer, you need new heads, etc.</li>
            <li> After calling them weekly to tell them it hadn&#x27;t arrived, (due to their mistake), I finally obtained it July 27, &amp; returned the package the same day I finally had obtained the code &amp; return label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the rep completely went off on a tangent when I brought up this subject.</li>
            <li> I feel that some reviewers perhaps received bogus knock-offs and not the actual nono product as the reviews seem really severe in the negative direction.</li>
            <li> Too late to get my money back, really wish I&#x27;d never bought it.</li>
            <li> That is way too much to pay for it even if it DID work, but under the circumstances, it was just plain robbery!</li>
            <li> Why such a limited warranty?</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money on this mess.</li>
            <li> I was proved wrong (so far): They credited me less than a week after my item  had been confirmed as delivered</li>
            <li> I used it more aggressively than the instructions stated, daily and went over each area at least 20 times each since I am Italian and had some hairs that were really thick and dark.  </li>
            <li> My upper lip area has also been very dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> This product has a lot of negative reviews, but if you go into things with reasonable expectations</li>
            <li> Hi, I think there&#x27;s a confusion that could be (at least partialy) responsible for the complaints.    </li>
            <li> At least I talked to a real person and got names instead of</li>
            <li> The most disappointing item I ever bought, it did not work from day one.</li>
            <li> It will be long time before I will be tempted to buy anything featured on Infomercial TV program.</li>
            <li> It seems like it is a permanent hair removal tool to me since there hasn&#x27;t been any regrowth since using it that long ago.  </li>
            <li> I got this shaver for Christmas about 6 months ago and have been using several times a week with minimal results.</li>
            <li> My face hurt for a long time after.  </li>
            <li> since that was how long the paperwork said the trial was).</li>
            <li> This product is a glorified razor, it does nothing to remove the hair at the root, and you have to have really really long hairs for them to even make contact with the \\&quot;hotblade\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Lets see how long it takes them this time.</li>
            <li> This product is a complete waste of money and time.  </li>
            <li> i bought this online, and all i can say i spent hours using it trying to take off back hair</li>
            <li> (If the hair root is unaffected, you will still have hair growth.)  </li>
            <li> The hair will not continue to grow on the back of the calves, for instance, because the jeans rub everyday on that part of the skin and the constant rubbing/buffing removes the hair and discourages future hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried on my legs and it left a rough stubbly feeling.  </li>
            <li> This product is a complete waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I think they know how long you have it and make you squirm before answering you</li>
            <li> This is by FAR the biggest waste of money known to mankind.</li>
            <li> Who knows how long that will take though.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a long time hoping it would eventually see results.</li>
            <li> a fraud this company is and a complete letdown and waste of my hardearned money.</li>
            <li> have given it minus stars if possible.</li>
            <li> A few weeks later I was refunded for the discounted one, and then two weeks later, they added the charge back on...</li>
            <li> It is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> What a complete waste of time for me and money for my mother in law.  </li>
            <li> It would take you all day long to do one leg and it feels like you shaved it with an electric razor...</li>
            <li> , are there any studies of the long term effects of this product, or are we the guinea pigs?&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li> Zap the long hair, buff.  </li>
            <li> How long is one of their billing cycles, I&#x27;m wondering now.  </li>
            <li> I thought if I did the partial payments, I had only 60 days.</li>
            <li> Finally I called to return the product, which was achieved after much trouble and hassle, even though the product is apparently under a \\&quot;money back\\&quot; guarantee.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and the no-no is a very temporary solution for me.</li>
            <li> it has burned my skin no matter how fast or slow</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even theoretically possible to use hair to conduct enough heat down to the follicle causing it to die.  </li>
            <li> This makes it impossible to get most of the upper lip area.  </li>
            <li> I figured because I was a Black American and had coarse hair that it would take longer for hair removal.</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT unless you want major epidermis discomfort and damage.. and want to then BUFF your skin raw with a piece of glorified SAND PAPER to remove the STUBBLE it LEAVES AFTER BURNING OFF A TINY BIT OF HAIR!  </li>
            <li> In other words this product doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> But after I stopped (I moved from India to USA and its much more expensive here!)</li>
            <li> And, the results are not consistent from one area to the next.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want to risk the side effects of the No!No! which hasn&#x27;t been around as long as electrolysis!</li>
            <li> Other facial hair, at 54, is medium peach fuzz that shaving 1 or 2 times of year takes care of.  </li>
            <li> I used the nono on one leg and a standard razor on the other leg during that time.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give the NO NO a try due to the 60 day money back.</li>
            <li> After I open the package then I find the instructions inside that say specifically DO NOT use on your face and other body parts.  </li>
            <li> It took me a long time and the hair is still there!</li>
            <li> sent it back &amp; bought an other one.</li>
            <li> long as it ever has before.&lt;br /&gt;Please!</li>
            <li> I called again a few hours later with the proof of shipping with the tracking number and was told it could take 30 days to get my money back.  </li>
            <li> Also the reviews from those dates are careful to point out at least one flaw so that it looks real.</li>
            <li> and I think I probably won&#x27;t have to keep the box to return it like I expected to.convenient for me than trying to shave sitting on the toilet since I can use it while watching TV, etc.</li>
            <li> Just a few left, but I haven&#x27;t seen them since my last No No treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over the next few weeks I tried it on different lengths of stubble, all to no avail.</li>
            <li> Thank you for stopping 2 single mothers from getting scammed....</li>
            <li> Limited warranty...</li>
            <li> This product had to be plugged in, so your using options were limited.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell that it removed a single hair.</li>
            <li> I had limited results on arms, face and underarms.</li>
            <li> My legs hair is very thin and rare from constant extraction during all these years.  </li>
            <li> but  I would definitely steer clear of purchasing anything from them as I feel it was a big rip-off.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with dark facial hair since I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I have coarse stray dark hairs on my chin that I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of for years.     </li>
            <li> During my ordered of the product, I was asked to give my payment information only after I was told what the product cost (does not worth the price).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> At first I thought my device was broken</li>
            <li> Here it is now about three months later, and I&#x27;m riding down the road in the car with my husband.  </li>
            <li> Big thumb down.</li>
            <li> I was just sitting down to order this product, when suddenly I decided to check reviews</li>
            <li> Not only does it NOT remove hair, it just burns it down to a stubble.</li>
            <li> It didnt burn the hair down to the skin as seen on AD, but left about 2mm stubble.  </li>
            <li> Long story short: this is a small handheld device with a giant empty promise.  </li>
            <li> Getting the hair around the lips (which is what most women are after) is impossible.  </li>
            <li> I have the no no classic.</li>
            <li> No!No! Hair Removal Unit, Black and Red]]</li>
            <li> I am having some of the same &#x27;side-effects&#x27; as others here: black dots, increased hair; in addition, they are now ingrown</li>

            <li> The No No Classic Versus</li>

            <li> You can see my other reviews of various other products.</li>
            <li> That is the only place there is a slight discomfort</li>
            <li> I have used it for several months to see if there was less hair growing</li>
            <li> The hair on my legs and arms are thinning and growing less coarse.</li>
            <li> I thought it was clever marketing that they say it &amp;#34;crystallized&amp;#34; the hair when in fact the head has a small wire down the center that heats up and burns the hair off your skin.</li>
            <li> After rejecting all the other page long extras, at the bottom of the page it says \\&quot;next\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I bought this item thinking it sounded great and found myself very disappointed.</li>
            <li> First of all it was very difficult to talk to a live person.</li>
            <li> It only works on smooth surfaces, so shins and knees are impossible to do.  </li>
            <li> I usually rely very heavily on the reviews here before I make almost any purchase, and they&#x27;re usually 95% accurate, but not this time.</li>
            <li> I usually rely very heavily on the reviews here before I make almost any purchase, and they&#x27;re usually 95% accurate, but not this time.</li>
            <li> Note the negative reviews vs the positive ones and don&#x27;t waste your money like I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only sorry I did not return it right away, it is not worth the money, I believe that it&#x27;s a scam.</li>
            <li> This product is pure SCAM, falsely advertised, with lots of web sites that the manufacturer has created to legitimize their product.</li>
            <li> So my arms ended up with bald patches, and short stubby little hairs.  </li>
            <li> I had to go over the hairs numerous times to get them to burn off even a little bit.</li>
            <li> It claims that you will have less hair growing back over time - isn&#x27;t a year and a half a long time?  </li>
            <li> but it was not removing any of the coarse hairs on my upper lip or the ones in hard to get at places under my chin that started growing after menopause.  </li>
            <li> /&gt; if you are a female with average to course hair you are in serious trouble if you follow the user guidelines which clearly state how to use the product in a fluid continuous motion.&lt;br /&gt;you</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to get a constant green light over knees and ankles.  </li>
            <li> I have expperimeented with other areas with some limited results  </li>
            <li> No No gets so many bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> This item was a huge disappointment because the unit would not stay attached to it&#x27;s required power cord...</li>
            <li> It takes MANY painful passes before it is off.  </li>
            <li> I called back a second time to return it and was told now it&#x27;s to late.</li>
            <li> He tried to dodge the 3rd questions above, because if he had answered, it would have painted a negative picture of their company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry for those having so much trouble getting their money back, and those actually injured, but thank you all so much for reviewing this product...</li>
            <li> Some of the stubborn white hairs on my chin are gone (laser treatments are not effective on white hairs) since I started using No</li>
            <li> Sorry to everyone who got ripped off, but thanks for taking the time to put up a review to save others from the same fate!</li>
            <li> Bill to and ship to and delivered to were all as expected without any issues.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no interest at all in investigating why I was being harmed by their product or sending a replacement.</li>
            <li> It removed absolutely no hair, so I tried it on my arms.  </li>
            <li> The wide tip&#x27;s terminals looked smoother with the wire and terminals well below the tip&#x27;s surface.  </li>

            <li> After all this time, I see absolutely no change on my bikini area.  </li>
            <li> I tried removing stubble (it was 3 mmm as suggested) from under my arms, but it only removed a few hairs.  </li>
            <li> It is a total \\&quot;As Seen on TV\\&quot; gimmicky rip off.</li>
            <li> They said that they had exclusive rights to the Pink one</li>
            <li> and you could not get a pink one</li>
            <li> Being extremely curious as to why they never mentioned the price on the ad, I came here to look at the reviews and to get a price on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> It still did not do as expected.  </li>
            <li> A total waste of money and time.</li>

            <li> This is an out of date model which is a waste of money as it cannot be used for facial hair.</li>

            <li> I feel that I am one of thousands who have spent hundreds of dollars on a bogus product.</li>
            <li> but you have to be careful to use it correctly or you can get burned.</li>
            <li> The commercial tells you to use your no-no a few times a week, i&#x27;ve been using it for over 5months and still don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> but with absolutely no results.</li>

            <li> My friend was curious about it so was my mom.  </li>
            <li> We really wanted it to work, and gave it every oppertunity but no joy.</li>
            <li> At that point I backed out and closed my browser.</li>
            <li> This No-No hair removal product is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I watched the disc and followed the instructions carefully as it is quite tricky to use.</li>
            <li> Not really a questions, but I wanted their response or statement to the numerous complaints about the no-no breaking within weeks or a few months.</li>
            <li> They are charging 300.00 dollars for something that would&#x27;nt be good enough to use as a boat anchor!It burns the skin and the smell of scorched hair is terrible.</li>
            <li> COMPLETE waste!!</li>
            <li> Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> and I just read all of the other reviews and realized I&#x27;ve wasted countless hours thinking it was me.  </li>
            <li> I only used it on a very small section of my face daily or every other day as they recommend.  </li>
            <li> I admittedly have sensitive skin, but this is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time on a small area, because it did not always work and needed multiple swipes to produce any sort of result.  </li>
            <li> The infuriating thing about this is that they were WELL AWARE that the refund had bounced back and were going to keep their mouths shut and pray that I wouldn&#x27;t notice.   </li>
            <li> on sale when Sephora stopped carrying it (maybe that should have been the first clue), but I&#x27;m still annoyed that I wasted any of my money on a product that DOES NOTHING it claims.  </li>
            <li> No hoping that it would work for a number of reasons, but mostly facial hair that is becoming quite annoying.  </li>
            <li> Excuse me, \\&quot;a little burning hair smell\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> You do have to be really careful around curvy areas, especially your knees, and the tops of your shins, or the little wire might catch on your skin and it will hurt a little, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wrong to take advantage of the hopes of people struggling with this very real problem and trick them into buying another pos product.    </li>
            <li> It was by now past their guarantee date (wounds and cuts take time to heal) and I finally phoned their customer help line for advice.</li>
            <li> No no thanks!</li>
            <li> I thought I will try the small areas like upper lip and chin and sides.</li>
            <li> What a total waste of money!</li>
            <li> and I am not really hairy!  </li>
            <li> There should be some way to hold this company accountable for their shady return policy and crooked practices.  </li>
            <li> Got this for Christmas and have been using it on my legs every other day for almost 6 months now.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased this product a year or so ago and was extremely displeased with the results.</li>
            <li> The No NO burned my lip and other areas to the point</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth the time spent on performing the procedure.</li>
            <li> Other problems  were: the instruction disk could not be read on my Mac computer.</li>
            <li> I sent back this useless product within the time limit along with the extra blades, extra bottles of cream and buffers they sent and charged me for.. which I never ordered....</li>
            <li> but, when you compare it to other permanent hair removal</li>
            <li> It DOES cause sharp burning pain and doesn&#x27;t remove any hair!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rather belatedly, I checked other internet sites.  </li>
            <li> I have called twice to attempt to return it due to their 60 day satisfaction guarantee but each time I call they refuse to return it until the 60 days is over.</li>
            <li> My friend never used it was not interested at all.  </li>
            <li> In other words, they had cheated me out of $73.</li>
            <li> Have not tried other areas yet.</li>
            <li> I only have a small areas of hair that still needs treatments, so I decided to try the NoNo.</li>
            <li> longer\\&quot; conveniently past the money back guaranteed date.</li>
            <li> every other day for that time.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be able to use it on my legs but after using it on my upper lip I knew that process would be way too painful and slow.</li>
            <li> and you have to pay the other $45.  </li>
            <li> Hi, I purchased a nono for my wifes&#x27; christmas, she followed the instruction exactly, but unfortunately it did not work for her.</li>
            <li> Hence, my assumption that this company is using your money in other ways (investment, interest, ...?)</li>
            <li> Not for face a small fact you left out.  </li>
            <li> The pink unit is specifically for the body area from the neck down</li>
            <li> BE VERY CAREFUL OF THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> That piece of s**t machinery does NOT live up to the name no pain no hair!!!</li>
            <li> It was impossible to use it smoothly across the contours of my lip.</li>
            <li> Also, I used the nono on my face using the small tip as instructed and I received slight burns across my upper lip.</li>
            <li> It stinks because it tries to burn the hair off and only works on flat surfaces, so forget your upper lip and bikini line (which is why I got it)</li>
            <li> It is really hard to do the upper lip.  </li>
            <li> and I have hardly any hair and stubble was left.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time getting the return label, but two weeks later it came in the mail</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the most stupid way of shaving.</li>
            <li> The no!no! is SOOOOO not worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> at least these bring actual results!</li>
            <li> Not reputable; Avoid this time consuming financial waste.</li>
            <li> I recently bought the nono 8800 and it sucks.</li>
            <li> The product is not worth $20 let alone</li>
            <li> and lately I&#x27;ve been starting to grow a mustache.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s too late to get my money back, as if.     </li>
            <li> After reading everyone&#x27;s reviews I now feel that well at least I&#x27;m not the only one.</li>
            <li> I have really dark hair, and I bought this product to remove it from my arms.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not worth the money, time, and frustration.  </li>
            <li> am not the person for whom this was meant, because laser is said to pick up the dark color.</li>
            <li> It may have thinned out some hairs but is NOT worth the money.</li>
            <li> Should have made my purchase on Amazon, at least then I would have only been billed once.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dark skinned and even after shaving, you can see where the hair is on my legs.</li>
            <li> They will not allow me to return the no-no even after I have called and complained several times.</li>
            <li> this machine as it is not worth £190.  </li>
            <li> I had the over $250.00 that I was sucker enough to pay for this</li>
            <li> Completely not worth the price or stink.  </li>
            <li> I used the nono at least 4 times a week on my chin, upper lip and legs</li>
            <li> If you have really thick course hair, I would move on to the next gadget that is out there.</li>
            <li> NO Is not cheap, is not fast and does NOT WORK.</li>
            <li> What was 8-10 coarse, thick hairs on my chin is now 30-40 thick, coarse hairs!</li>
            <li> (even if you do take your time and go slow, use the proper removal pad after you are finished etc.</li>
            <li> poor customer services to direct people to a premium numbers -</li>
            <li> Ive thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It burns the fuzz down to around 1mm and can&#x27;t go lower.  </li>
            <li> $200+ down the drain.</li>
            <li> I think that I should have saved the money and gone down the laser hair removal path.</li>
            <li> This thing did not work whats so ever, and it broke down after like the 5th time i used it.</li>
            <li> But I was feeling hopeless and the misleading advertising that&#x27;s crammed down your throat got me...</li>
            <li> I suggest you donate your money to a charity if you want to throw it down the drain.</li>
            <li> It is a process, it takes two weeks just to get the technique down, and get settled into a routine.  </li>
            <li> mean to do not get it back</li>
            <li> Very mad, and will make sure this is all over the internet.  </li>
            <li> Then, the other day, I used it on my face and OWWWW!</li>
            <li> What we got is apparently a &amp;#34;knockoff&amp;#34;, or an outdated model that is not suitable for use for facial hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had to deal with such a ridiculous purchase/refund before, even taking into consideration the average person selling on ebay or amazon.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The device is now packed away in a drawer languishing with a few of the other junk items purchased throughout the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After spending 30 minutes trying to remove a small area of hair (and smelling like a burn victim), I re-read the directions.</li>
            <li> This is only for people with very dark, thick hair I presume.</li>
            <li> The company will be receiving pictures and a complaint from me in the event that the veins do not recede in the next few days.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it, waste of money, dose nothing, burnt my skin, left over hair, painfully slow, dose nothing,  </li>
            <li> Less pain after hair is less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that the hairs are SLIGHTLY finer than before.</li>
            <li> about a week and a half again my face and neck was burnt</li>
            <li> If I could give it less than one star I would.  </li>
            <li> And its time consuming I would spend a half an hour just doing my calf.   </li>
            <li> well, I was half asleep, after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was serious about buying in even though 200.00 seemed like alot of money but for hair to not grow back</li>
            <li> This product is no quick fix</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also seeing much less hair under my arms, on my arms, and on my face.  </li>
            <li> They sent the product to the wrong house; I did not get it for several weeks because my neighbor did not know that it was left by a side door.</li>
            <li> Shaving seems much less evasive then what others have described about the product and burning the hair.</li>
            <li> and I explained to him that I haf just callef to order and wantef to cancel my order before its been shipped because the previous guy I spoke to charged my account already after I specifically told him not to</li>
            <li> After being slightly offended I tried it out of curiosity ( and after I realized he dropped 300.00 on it</li>
            <li> I have been using the nono (black) for about two months.  </li>
            <li> My hair did not become thinner or less dense.  </li>
            <li> Hidden clause on shipping refund.</li>
            <li> I did use it, and it literally took me 2 hours for half a leg.</li>
            <li> I was promised it would take less than a week to get the return label.  </li>
            <li> Seems very odd since all the other reviews are staggered over time.</li>
            <li> The shipping is ridiculous seeing it only weighs a little over a pound in weight.  </li>
            <li> Then the small print in all the legally  liable pages say Don&#x27;t use on the face and Not Suggested.  </li>
            <li> Not true.  </li>
            <li> Ad claims that hair stays away for weeks - not true.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the time I&#x27;ve wasted already.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money, not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not good for course hair that is regularly shaved.</li>
            <li> I normally read reviews before I purchase, but this time I failed to do so.  </li>
            <li> I actually bought it directly from no no and paid a lot (so angry!)</li>
            <li> It was impossible for me to direct No!no! to specific areas because of the wounds it was creating.</li>
            <li> When it singes the hairs on the face, it makes some of the light ones get dark at the base</li>
            <li> and it arrived a little under a week.  </li>
            <li> gave me a little panic.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not worth the exorbitant cost!</li>
            <li> I called to return the product and was convinced to hold on to it a little longer.  </li>
            <li> The rash seems to have spread into my scalp a little bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a rich person and this represented a sizeable investment for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth all the hype!</li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> Just about every other reviewer here says it: completely pointless.</li>
            <li> The lady told me that those hairs came off of the little brush that was packed with it.  </li>
            <li> The web site it a little misleading.</li>
            <li> The company is also awful and incompetent and not in any hurry to honor their own money back warranty (no surprises there).  </li>
            <li> My sister went through a tough time as well, getting her credit back.  </li>
            <li> AND I GIVE NONO 5 THUMBS DOWN!</li>
            <li> I have very thick and coarse hair too, so it does work well for that.</li>
            <li> Especially the few tough whiteys on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Especially the few tough whiteys on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks so much to all of the reviewers who took the time to write reviews on this awful product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again to all who took the time to review this disappointing product.</li>
            <li> I understand a time limit for a %100 refund, however, to not be able to return it at all with even a partial refund is a terrible practice in the retail world.</li>
            <li> Says it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> Amazon, you shouldn&#x27;t carry such a poor product.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I found that their pad for rubbing the dead hair off didn&#x27;t seem to work for me.  </li>
            <li> even after you spend a couple of hours, supposedly removing the hair,  it is still not smooth like you would expect after you shave.  </li>
            <li> I used to wax, and had blonde thin hair, now I&#x27;ve been shaving in between the no-no treatments, and hair is darker and thicker....</li>
            <li> waste of money and waste of time.</li>
            <li> The infomercial indicated you could use it on your face because the lady with the heavy sideburns used it.</li>
            <li> Also it smells like burnt hair in my apartment bathroom- and in the dead of winter</li>
            <li> WASTED</li>
            <li> dont waste your money...</li>
            <li> They should have paid me for all the time I wasted using this product.  </li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I tried to use it the second time a post was broken off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it everyday..</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.  </li>
            <li> No system is a fraud and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Keep your money in your wallet, these people are laughing all the way to the bank.&lt;br /&gt;For 400 bucks you can probably get a few laser treatments that will get rid of unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> Just a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I would assume that the few \\&quot;good\\&quot; reviews are plants by the company.</li>
            <li> $270.00 is not cheap.</li>
            <li> The representative turned into a broken record and kept going back to case scenarios within 2-year</li>
            <li> Time and money wasted aside....</li>
            <li> Honestly it is waste of money................</li>
            <li> Complete rip-off!</li>
            <li> I would not advise anybody to waste their money on this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this.  </li>
            <li> I did it everyday.  </li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> I got this a few weeks ago and didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it till just a couple days ago.    </li>
            <li> it workss foor that but has trouble getting through my chin hairs.  </li>
            <li> had to waste your money, but</li>
            <li> It did take a few months and a lot of dedication</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  </li>
            <li> Still yet, it left behind stubble.   </li>
            <li> They sent me an email verifying that they received and told me to wait a few weeks for the return to show up on my credit card statement.  </li>
            <li> Dont waste your money  , after sales service is nil  .  </li>
            <li> I wish I had read this reviews before I wasted $300 on my NONO.</li>
            <li> because I wanted to get rid of the few remaining hairs that the laser treatments couldn&#x27;t and didn&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
            <li> , I have burnt a mole a few times.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any regrowth on my knees at all for a few months.  </li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Not smooth at all.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Even those that tried to return the item had trouble with the company.</li>
            <li> It would pulse a few times and then stop.</li>
            <li> I had gotten it as a way for my husband to shave his arms, chest, etc, without having to stand at the bathroom sink, or deal with messy creams and having to continually buy shaving blades.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Waste of $300.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re money on this even with the one year warranty.</li>
            <li> moisturize ONLY after using the witch hazel and then sparingly, or this will clog your pores and make things worse.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i used the unit for a few times, could not tell a difference at all.</li>
            <li> a few months ago.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money, and I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> So for something guaranteed to not cost a penny if you don&#x27;t like it just to try it, a wasted $45.  </li>
            <li> If you like to waste $$ &amp; lose time &amp; energy dealing with a ripoff, this is the gizmo for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time, The unit barley succeeded removing anything at all.</li>
            <li> WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> AND YOU WILL BE MAKING A VISIT TO THE E.R WITH SECOND DEGREE BURNS AND WORSE BLISTERING AND DAMAGED</li>
            <li> Waste Waste Waste of my money and time.  </li>
            <li> I am going to get an attorney so I can get my money back because there is no other way to do so-they are absolutely impossible to deal with.</li>
            <li> then you \\&quot;buff\\&quot; aka sand down the burnt hair, which is not a sexy smell.</li>
            <li> AND SO MUCH LESS HASSLE!</li>
            <li> My opinion so far is that this is a very poorly made product.  </li>
            <li> Just say Nono to Nono, why did I not believe the other 340 negative reviews?</li>
            <li> THE SMELL OF BURNING FLESH IS WHAT YOU WILL GET PLAIN AND</li>
            <li> I so wanted this item to work, back to the trusty old razor for me :(</li>
            <li> I ordered directly from the website, making the horrible mistake of not checking reviews here first.</li>
            <li> Every few months I do a little touch up with my no!no!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one thing I failed to do was scroll down to look for the \\&quot;submit\\&quot; button before I back tracked to change the order.</li>
            <li> , like most, am so disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I have really dark leg hair and even if I shave in the morning, by late afternoon, I will have stubble on my leg already.</li>
            <li> I was left with either vertical cuts, or worse small missing bleeding chunks of skin where the No!no! had &#x27;jumped&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unless you are prepared to waste an unbelievable amout of time trying to get the Radiencey</li>
            <li> I watched the video several times as I thought I must be doing something wrong to be having such poor results.</li>
            <li> My face feels extra tight and uncomfortable but I cant say it isnt my fault as well.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to slow down the hair re-growth process after a time</li>
            <li> I only wished I had read all the other negative reviews before I ordered this useless product sold by an unreputable company.</li>
            <li> Money is very tight and to con people into buying something that doesn&#x27;t work, well....</li>
            <li> It is also very time consuming, expensive, and irritating.  </li>
            <li> I would, but it is longer lasting and less thick when it grows back....  too bad no eyebrow functioning.    </li>
            <li> I admit, I have thick black hair on my legs.</li>
            <li> (Turns out the little brush comes covered in plastic, hard for hairs to escape)&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> After each session there was very little change in the amount of stubble on my legs, but I stuck with it because it does say that results could take time.  </li>
            <li> A waste of hard earned money.</li>
            <li> I called the customer service number to check on the status of my refund and was told it usually takes 24-48 hours to receive the refund.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I will not be using this product again, and it&#x27;s going back immediately.</li>
            <li> I was thinking when I decided to spend almost a fortune on such a useless product!\\&quot;     </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time or money!  </li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T waste your money!</li>
            <li> please..if you want to waste 192 quid..then send it to me !  </li>
            <li> Definitely a Shady company....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t beleive I wasted my money on this!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money!  </li>
            <li> so i persevered with it past the 60 day return.</li>
            <li> it usually is i will save my money</li>
            <li> x wkly for the past 3 months on two sides of my chin.  </li>
            <li> x a week for the past   </li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> Not a reputable company, and</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I can recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Its small and</li>
            <li> I tried it for about 5 minutes on a small area on my leg.  </li>
            <li> An item this expensive should last longer than 13 months.</li>
            <li> so that 60 day money back guarantee is useless.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive, but if you regularly get waxed, it will end up saving you money.  </li>
            <li> because I never could get it to shave even one small area of my leg.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they are allowed to sell such a useless product.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s going overboard.</li>
            <li> what make the laser work is a small rubber drive band if this band slips off the drive wheel inside it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also having trouble with returning this piece of garbage!</li>
            <li> I really am a lazy</li>
            <li> Or, better, since you wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with the horrible smell of burning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I&#x27; m not sure if the tips are interchangeable.</li>
            <li> They may be but I&#x27;m not sure if they SHOULD be.</li>
            <li> I PROMISE THEY WONT SELL NO MORE NONO,S</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> It is a lot of money to waste!  </li>
            <li> The hair continues to grow as usual.</li>
            <li> It continued to grow as usual.  </li>
            <li> so i still had weird stubbly facial peach fuzz, which still grew just as thick/</li>
            <li> I bought it because traditional razors were getting expensive</li>
            <li> I have sent it back once already because the battery would not charge; and received a \\&quot;new\\&quot; one that&#x27;s power button is extremely difficult to turn off and on.</li>
            <li> So, I have to use the small tip to do my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was the biggest waste of time!</li>
            <li> , I did not check out reviews like I usually do.  </li>
            <li> yah, the triple refund promised isn&#x27;t, if you read the small print.  </li>
            <li> And even got small</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!  </li>
            <li> waste of money!</li>
            <li> There MAY be a very slight improvement in the hair thickness - not as thick -</li>
            <li> I was afraid to try it on the rest of my body after reading the instructions, as it seemed a little daunting in that it required practice on larger flatter areas before it was recommended for areas like the knee.</li>
            <li> given how false the other claims were.</li>
            <li> I have yet to try to return mine, but from all other reviews, it is impossible to get your money back.  </li>
            <li> The burning hair smell wasn&#x27;t as bad as I expected it to be, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really necessary to use air fresheners, etc.</li>
            <li> The burning hair smell wasn&#x27;t as bad as I expected it to be, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really necessary to use air fresheners, etc.</li>
            <li> Here are the 3 main bad points.</li>
            <li> My final email to them was to advise that the system was bought for me as a present from family members so this will be why I do not show on there data base.</li>
            <li> No, I am not going to use the buff on my face, but pulling the dark hairs after they have been singed (burned) is tough.  </li>
            <li> They give other promoters of products that may actually do what they say, a really bad reputation.  </li>
            <li> She bought it, and she was very disappoined.  :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in the product as a whole.</li>
            <li> (Sorry so long)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, let me just break down all the \\&quot;science\\&quot; behind the NoNo.  </li>
            <li> I am not very happy with the customer service of the company and after reading the reviews it sounds like not many people are.</li>
            <li> and i have burns all over my face:((( This is a complete waste of money and should never be put on the internet.</li>
            <li> I am only giving it 4 stars because the smell is disgusting, It does burn your hair, but it does work I use the no no about every two weeks to burn off any new growth hair.</li>
            <li> thick, very stiff and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hard to use&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> By the way, they did not give me a hard time with that all...</li>
            <li> I bought it off the no no site so of course you can&#x27;t review it there no matter how hard you try.</li>
            <li> It was hard to read, but</li>
            <li> Laser treatments hardly put a dent in the knee cap hairs.</li>
            <li> I found out the hard way.</li>
            <li> When I looked closely at the  attachment I noticed that  the little flimsy wire was broken.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even want to think about how badly the old NONO worked.</li>
            <li> but I usually do at least four.</li>
            <li> How could the follicle get destroyed if it is not burned deeper at least to skin level?  </li>
            <li> it will take you at least 6 months to get hair-free,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made for suckers.</li>
            <li> DUH--</li>
            <li> Slow and awkward to operate, it left my armpit rather sore, and with lots of stubles.  </li>
            <li> so when it did arrive a week late</li>
            <li> no effect after going over the skin at least a dozen times.  </li>
            <li> then tell you its to late to return.  </li>
            <li> The customer service rep was rude but said that UPS would be at my home in 5-7 days.</li>
            <li> The product sucks, the customer service sucks.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on the product and wish I had listened to the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> When I complained about the product , I was told to be patient-so I continued for three months.</li>
            <li> He says he has no knowledge of any negative consumer reviews of no-no.</li>
            <li> The reality is, and even the product states when it arrives, you&#x27;ll have to keep using this product for weeks, at least 3 times a week, PLUS shaving to achieve the possibility of no shaving.  </li>
            <li> I could have given this NEGATIVE stars</li>
            <li> it would have been a Negative 10 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought that perhaps the negative reviews were from people who may not be using it correctly -</li>
            <li> I had to click on at least one star in order for   Amazon to allow me to give the review.  </li>
            <li> This product sucks.</li>
            <li> The people on the phone are rude.  </li>
            <li> Couple of hundred negative reviews out</li>
            <li> They will not give me the name of the President of the company for me to write a complaint.</li>
            <li> but it was too late to return it to the company.  </li>
            <li> The resulting burnt hair smell lasts for at least 5 days even after the buffing &amp; cream.</li>
            <li> MY TRIMMER WORKS ALOT BETTER,AND I WILL KEEP USEING MY TRIMMER,AT LEAST IT DOES WORK</li>
            <li> If I could give it negative stars I would.  </li>
            <li> and they told me it was too late for a refund.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely sucks.</li>
            <li> I intended to return it, but I waited too late</li>
            <li> and when I called, they refused to refund my money and were quite rude.</li>
            <li> for at least 45 days before returning it or</li>
            <li> and all the negative reviews tells me all I need to know about this company.</li>
            <li> I received no email confirmation, duh, since I never submit an order.  </li>
            <li> I WAS RUDELY HUNG UP ON THREE TIMES AND TRIED TO GET THROUGH SEVEN OR EIGHT TIMES  </li>
            <li> This sucks.  </li>
            <li> I do have to say though that the hair is growing slowly on my arms, so</li>
            <li> If your hair growth is thick, this product is not for you...trust me.</li>
            <li> , this product is worthless and for him to have it on his program is like he is endorsing it to do what it says which is very misleading.</li>
            <li> i now hace thick hardened skin on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless and dangerous for your face and gentle</li>
            <li> There is a slight burnt hair smell and can be painful for the 30 minutes, but have never developed a rash.</li>
            <li> Seeing as it was quite an expensive little appliance, I was surely no up for that.  </li>
            <li> If it never gets picked up does that mean I will never get my refund?     </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;m not exactly eager to explicitly discuss my unwanted body hair with some random man over the phone.   </li>
            <li> Unbelievable fraud!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to control and extremely picky.</li>
            <li> Customer Service was not willing to give me a refund, they just kept telling me I was using it wrong.</li>
            <li> I hesitated to buy this product for so long, because it is so expensive and working for minimum wage is tough.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t made but one or two attempts to use it since the first time was a real disappointment.  </li>
            <li> (BTW, I&#x27;ve tried the buffing system alone, and it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this did, and my legs itched like CRAZY for about a week afterwards!).</li>
            <li> i have been burned, it is still very uncomfortable, four weeks later.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR $$$. :(</li>
            <li> You said the company is very shady.</li>
            <li> Had to run an air cleaner in the room and seriously thought the smoke alarm might go off.  </li>
            <li> This is not only one the worst products I have ever bought but dealing with the company to get a refund on not only the product I bought but the one they sent me that I did not order.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, Just go get lazer hair removal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews but after using this product for about 6 months, I find it rather useless.</li>
            <li> I was always afraid to try anything else on my face because it might grow back worse</li>
            <li> It is impossible to get your money back from this company.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this thing is a POS.  </li>
            <li> Seriously????  </li>
            <li> I am a chronically ill person and I was looking for something to make my life a little easier.</li>
            <li> Expensive little bugger, too.</li>
            <li> Once is bad enough.</li>
            <li> This thing made me bleed after pinching my skin so badly that it was all red for hours afterward.</li>
            <li> An expensive waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product was a bitter disappointment.</li>
            <li> I got tired of having to shave every day, so I ordered this product hoping I could at least decrease how often I had to shave.  </li>
            <li> does no good cannot reccomend this company to anyone.</li>
            <li> NO Good is what I can say about this garbage.  </li>
            <li> THEY ARE NO GOOD</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering why they would do that, unless they were afraid they couldn&#x27;t get their hands on itany other way?  </li>
            <li> imagine my disappointment when after suffering years of unwanted hair i wasted my hard earned money on a no no people dont do it</li>
            <li> I learned that the hard way!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t want you to tweeze them off, but my face looks like a badly plucked chicken with half the feathers left in.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and am a little disappointed that I can still feel slight stubble after use.  </li>
            <li> , I can go at least two days without having to re shave my legs!</li>
            <li> You will be disappointed big time!</li>
            <li> and then so disappointed, I am sending it back.</li>
            <li> It sucks!</li>
            <li> It really is an unbelievable scam, and an expensive loss at that.</li>
            <li> It sucks!</li>
            <li> I was 7 days too late to get a refund!  </li>
            <li> Argumentative and rude responses from Cust Service rep Joe on 44th trial day!</li>
            <li> So I am left with a useless and very, very expensive</li>
            <li> Worst product I&#x27;ve ever purchased and the price was outrageous for such a huge failure.</li>
            <li> No seems to be very slowly knocking them out.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> This product is terrible, not only it didn&#x27;t work, the heat wire component burned my skin and I had little scabs all over my legs.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I learned the hard way.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this useless expensive junk.</li>
            <li> only noticeable result was an awful smell of burnt hair, skin irritation and a waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;Try and get a refund.  </li>
            <li> Shared one with my sister, it is a rip-off.  </li>
            <li> This was worse.</li>
            <li> so I bought a replacement no!no! devices which I thought was broken as well.  </li>
            <li> even worse, it does cause pain and injury.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of crap in my years, but this is the most expensive piece of crap I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> so it looks even worse.  </li>
            <li> The product is well below a one star status, and the customer service ineffective and shamefully worse.  </li>
            <li> the Month of May 2011 because I got tired of waxing the hairs off of my lip, legs and bikini area and have not seen any hair regrowth since.  </li>
            <li> What does this tell you about the character behind this company?</li>
            <li> Took a lot of time to produce poor results&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, somehow I ended up with an auto reorder for supplies which I will never use.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the out come</li>
            <li> I am rating it a four star because they did stand behind their product and did give me a refund.</li>
            <li> According to him, all negative reviewers had unrealistic expectations of the no-no because they didn&#x27;t see immediate results after the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve concluded that Radiancy does not fully stand behind the quality of their products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the hair will begin to thin.</li>
            <li> I am not happy.  </li>
            <li> I got one for every person that I hate and just sat back and waited for the complaints.</li>
            <li> It arrived broken it seems.  </li>
            <li> and they claim that it shouldn&#x27;t have broken   so soon.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my legs which have REALLY THIN INVISIBLE HAIR,   </li>
            <li> company does not stand behind 60 days guarantee.</li>
            <li> This product does do what it says,it is too soon to tell how the hair regrowth will thin out.</li>
            <li> but this has to be probably the worse product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> So, actually, it&#x27;s worse than shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a rip-off.</li>
            <li> I am so confused.</li>
            <li> I purchased the NO NO Hair Removal System and was not happy with it.</li>
            <li> After trying this product with poor results, I returned it.</li>
            <li> I thought that it could have been a coincidence because I had a poorly knee  </li>
            <li> This was the worse product i have ever bought.</li>
            <li> All it does is to use a thin, heated wire to burn off the hair.</li>
            <li> but she had even worse results than I did.</li>
            <li> CS rep was rude and tried to make me feel stupid/ guilty.</li>
            <li> im just not happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> Well they claim it takes time to work so this patently false.</li>
            <li> Someone should report this company for false advertising and peddling a faulty product.</li>
            <li> False advertising!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe this company has committed fraud and has placed a false advertisement.</li>
            <li> You know what I mean, no no! is a no good!...  </li>
            <li> Seriously don&#x27;t even bother wasting your time with this, the blade burned my skin AND didn&#x27;t even get the hair at all!</li>
            <li> I was seriously considering purchasing this product until I discovered this review page!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inconvenient to use, hard to hold and tends to \\&quot;stutter\\&quot; over my skin, missing hairs and causing me to have to go over and over the same area, with terrible results.</li>
            <li> I have been using it diligently since the end of January, and I have seen dramatic results.  </li>
            <li> I think it is a dangerous product and a waste of time and too expensive.  </li>
            <li> No good results at all!  </li>
            <li> The No No, however is no good!</li>
            <li> I bought it directly from the Radiancy company, and their customer service has been horrible.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the WORST product i have ever used.</li>
            <li> This looks particularly bad since I also happen to have pale skin.  </li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d done my due diligence before buying this worthless piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> This stupid product broke down after 4/5 months anyways and the hair on my face still grows just as it always has.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed as it simply did not remove hair.  </li>
            <li> very disappointed TV Commercial showed one thing instructions said another.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, especially since its so expensive.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all, not effective hair removal,  the result looked like a bad shave.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my daughter bought it for herself.  </li>
            <li> At approximately 30 days I contacted No!No!</li>
            <li> as I had noticed no improvement and was told I must be doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> But, it was completely useless in terms of removing all hair at once.</li>
            <li> As it turns out, it wasn&#x27;t that both my no!no! devices were broken but that both no!no!</li>
            <li> Failed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a class-action suit to be initiated in the future regarding this pathetic gadget.</li>
            <li> Return process was difficult</li>
            <li> It was completely useless in terms of removing all hair at once.</li>
            <li> The worst part of all of this is that I feel like the NoNo company is preying on people like myself that are embarrassed of their facial hair and NoNon</li>
            <li> Laser hair removal is expensive and it hurts</li>
            <li> It was mechanically flawed and furthermore it never even powered up and if it had it couldn&#x27;t have reached any hair.  </li>
            <li> Wish they had zero star rating, because that is just what I would give this useless product.</li>
            <li> Take my advice and do not buy this useless product.</li>
            <li> I told my mother how poorly the nono performed and it was then that she told me she had paid about $300 for it!</li>
            <li> A rip-off and a scam!</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong..</li>
            <li> The product is painful to use, the regimen is time demanding, not effective, and creates a stinky burning smell that stays on you even after you wash your skin.  </li>
            <li> I have terrible facial hair from PCOS, and the no!no! has removed all of it.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> It is horribly expensive as well.  </li>
            <li> I cannot express how unsatisfacted i am with this expensive product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s ridiculously expensive for the end result of nothing.  </li>
            <li> Talking to customer service is useless.  </li>
            <li> It was expensive</li>
            <li> They want you to continue to use a product that is useless.</li>
            <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t check online reviews before I bought it.  </li>
            <li> but this thing is fairly expensive.</li>
            <li> And the stupid lady (Kelly) told me that I have to keep paying this piece of shit,</li>
            <li> unless you have largge areas of thin haair or fuzz   save yr money!  </li>
            <li> Am sorry those of you who bought this lousy product</li>
            <li> Sorry,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the lowest I can rate this item is 1 star.</li>
            <li> The No No hair removal is completely useless and ineffective piece of nothing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they can advertise this and sell this useless thing.</li>
            <li> To my sad dissapointment it burned the heZzel out of my face.</li>
            <li> They are pathetic, non customer-service oriented and just want to take your money and not give it back if you are dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> This piece of junk is useless.</li>
            <li> But by the time I realized that it was expensive garbage, my money-back guarantee had expired.  </li>
            <li> WISH I HAD READ REVIEWS BEFORE I PURCHASED AN EXPENSIVE ITEM THAT DOES NOTHING.</li>
            <li> So needless to say</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a seriously expensive mistake to make.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SSSOOOOO NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sorry this has not worked for&lt;br /&gt;me</li>
            <li> This product is so terrible that after just one use I lost my entire leg.</li>
            <li> I should know by now, if its advertised on TV it is useless.</li>
            <li> Did have a couple random hairs burn here and there.  </li>
            <li> i paid $300.00 and boy am i sorry.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews before wasting my $300 on this useless gadget.</li>
            <li> I am about to throw this useless product in the trash bin where it belongs.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use and not painless.</li>
            <li> leaves weird burn lines.</li>
            <li> The worst part is, the product doesn&#x27;t even work well at removing hair in the first place :(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not work at all for me.</li>
            <li> the return process, I was nervous that something would go wrong -</li>
            <li> This is possibly the worst product I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Expensive gift.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to begin with</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> Customer service line difficult to get through.</li>
            <li> The product is completely useless.</li>
            <li> It is difficult and time consuming to use</li>
            <li> and so expensive.</li>
            <li> 3 call Kurtis to have them investigated and put on the news for false advertisement amd fraud!</li>
            <li> I\\&quot;m not happy with it but was unable to return because of reduced refund!</li>
            <li> If you have ever spent the money on laser hair removal you will be slightly disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> or I would have wasted my money on this obviously BAD product!</li>
            <li> Now the hair that wasnt that bad is worse</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now the negative bad and ugly.</li>
            <li> I felt so stupid that I spent $30 on a stupid piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> now they are saying I am going to be given over to bad debt collectors fro not paying the last two instalments what a terrible and inconsiderate company!</li>
            <li> and Save your hard earned money!!!</li>
            <li> The little hair that it does take off SMELLS TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> I have a blister on my armpit that leaves me doing the chicken wing all day.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Customer Service has been infuriating - I could go on and on.  </li>
            <li> It stinks.</li>
            <li> It does remove some hair, but it is time consuming, stinks (literally) and does not remove the hair in a uniform way, so you still must shave.    </li>
            <li> Should I have to replace the cutting units?  </li>
            <li> It will remove peach fuzz and I&#x27;m afraid as to what that will return looking like.</li>
            <li> Item is disappointing  </li>
            <li> This is undoubtedly the worst product I have ever wasted money on.</li>
            <li> it is dangerous to use.</li>
            <li> I am afraid to use it on my face.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T waste your money on this crap!!!  </li>
            <li> Was totally unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> It is saving me some money as I was waxing once a month, and that is painful and expensive.  </li>
            <li> so disappointing.</li>
            <li> Terrible product, waste of money.</li>
            <li> Learn from an unhappy customer.</li>
            <li> A disappointment, a piece of junk, and a deceptive return policy.</li>
            <li> As you can imagine I was desperate to get started as I was like a cave woman.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m mad about it.  </li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> i wasnt even mad...............</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the NO!NO! did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I did not continue!  </li>
            <li> Product useless!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything its advertised to do, and was expensive to boot!  </li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> Worst money waste ever!</li>
            <li> product just burns your hear, producing unpleasant smell..</li>
            <li> I tried using the product on my legs and the amount of heat generated was very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> NONO SUCKS ITS THE WORST THING</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s Very expensive</li>
            <li> Very expensive mistake.</li>
            <li> but it was nearly impossible to get anyone to answer their customer service phone.</li>
            <li> Customer service is impossible.  </li>
            <li> When it burns the hair it smells so bad.</li>
            <li> Words cannot say just how bad this product is.</li>
            <li> millions of customers is not that bad.</li>
            <li> wow,what a bad idea that would have been.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells bad at the time (you get use to it)&lt;br /&gt;Under</li>
            <li> It was so bad....</li>
            <li> Bad form NoNo.</li>
            <li> smells so bad nobody would want that smell in their home or on their body.</li>
            <li> It is incredibly painfully time consuming however.  </li>
            <li> It was as time consuming as waxing or depilating though it wasn&#x27;t painful.</li>
            <li> The rest were too painful.  </li>
            <li> It was painful.</li>
            <li> The gizmo burns hair off and makes a horrible smell that lingers in carpet, upholstery and curtains (no good!).</li>
            <li> What a bad product this is, its downright dangerous!</li>
            <li> P. T. Barnum Said, &#x27;There&#x27;s a sucker born every minute!!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I won&#x27;t end up disappointed like everyone else on here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m thoroughly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this product.     </li>
            <li> This is so disappointing!</li>
            <li> Here what I read on  a web site : [..]    </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been this disappointed with a product since \\&quot;shrinky Dinks\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> What an expensive piece of crap!</li>
            <li> am so disappointed for falling for this scam.  </li>
            <li> Awful awful waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> boy was I wrong!!  </li>
            <li> I bought the stupid thing</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be stupid.</li>
            <li> They grill you like a cheese sandwich about why you&#x27;re returning it, implying that you are just too stupid to use it.  </li>
            <li> It truly is perfectly worthless.  </li>
            <li> It seems that the skin tightens around the base of the signed hairs.  </li>
            <li> I guess this thing is a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> and it does not do crap.</li>
            <li> just to remove the \\&quot;crystallized\\&quot; hair particles is annoying.    </li>
            <li> This is a piece of crap and did not remove one piece of hair.</li>
            <li> they said \\&quot;we can not find you on our data base</li>
            <li> I hate this thing with a vengence!!Would</li>
            <li> just beware as their return policy is crap if it does not work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am always buying into this As Seen On TV crap.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this crap.</li>
            <li> What moron would continue to use a product that is damaging their body?  </li>
            <li> I used this piece of crap for over a year and nothing but discolored skin.</li>
            <li> This was a very expensive lesson!  </li>
            <li> But what it does is burning your hair no lower than a 1 mm which is about the length of a 2-days man&#x27;s beard which chaffs and is very unpleasant to touch.  </li>
            <li> I searched around and couldn&#x27;t find anything except bad reviews, so guess where that flyer went!  </li>
            <li> I was shocked!</li>
            <li> My husband HATED it</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t use the polisher thing that they send or the lotion that is supposed to retard hair growth.</li>
            <li> Completely disappointed and as for the people who are giving this product 5 stars I have to say, use the product before you review it!</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  </li>

            <li> I got the NO NO and was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> So therefore I was very disappointed in product it did not do what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> WRONG!!!  </li>
            <li> broke!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s crap and don&#x27;t buy it!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Unfortunately, my daughter bought it for herself.  Says it was a waste of money.  She loaned it to me and I concur.  This DOES NOT remove hair.  The only thing that works is the advertisement convincing you that the product is worth $300.00.</li>
            <li> I got my no!no! a few months ago but really just started using it a lot recently since it&#x27;s summer time. I have really dark leg hair and even if I shave in the morning, by late afternoon, I will have stubble on my leg already. I used no!no! a lot when I first got it, but wasn&#x27;t disciplined in using it as much as I should, so I was disappointed with the results. I have noticed now though, I can go at least two days without having to re shave my legs! It takes a while and you&#x27;re supposed to go over the same area about 3 times but I usually do at least four. I honestly just use this on my legs when I&#x27;m on the computer or watching tv. Keep trying and you&#x27;ll probably be happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I used the No-No for 1 1/2 years and really never did see much if any permanent hair loss--although I kept hoping!When my battery stopped working properly, as lithium batteries tend to do eventually, the company informed me that they have a no new battery policy.  They will only take the No-No back and refurbish it.  The refurb battery had an even shorter life than the original did and after the second request to go through what would have only been a battery replacement again, the company informed me that I would have to purchase a new No-No \\&quot;at a discounted rate.\\&quot;  Seeing as it was quite an expensive little appliance, I was surely no up for that.  When I asked to speak with a manager, still trying to  get a new battery, I was put on hold for 10 more minutes and then, surprise--disconnected.  This company is&lt;br /&gt;seedy. The marketing campaign is good but  I would definitely steer clear of purchasing anything from them as I feel it was a big rip-off.</li>
            <li> It appears to be a pretty cool product.  Newer technology that is intriguing and will see how it works out long term.  The seller was fine and I had no issues.  Bill to and ship to and delivered to were all as expected without any issues.  Thank you Seller!</li>
            <li> I bought this product and, to be honest was very cautious about trying it on my face, but finally did. Immediately the contact &#x27;jumped&#x27; on my skin and I felt a burning sensation at those spots. I was left with either vertical cuts, or worse small missing bleeding chunks of skin where the No!no! had &#x27;jumped&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it must be something about my technique and (once my face had healed and I felt brave enough) I tried again. While holding the skin taut, I tried slower, waited some weeks for my new wounds to heal, then I tried faster (more cuts and missing skin). In their adverts the movement appears relaxed and gliding with the user smiling - I&#x27;m a pretty confident person, but I could never be smiling and relaxed when using No!no!! It was impossible for me to direct No!no! to specific areas because of the wounds it was creating. It was by now past their guarantee date (wounds and cuts take time to heal) and I finally phoned their customer help line for advice. The representative &#x27;knew what I meant&#x27; and she said I had to use the product quickly and firmly - and so I tried that again - more wounds. She had no interest in investigating whether my particular model was faulty - it was all my fault. So I am left with a useless and very, very expensive product.&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this, be prepared for no support from the organization if you have problems. Absolutely no interest at all in investigating why I was being harmed by their product or sending a replacement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 59 years old today! I bought the stupid thing so I wouldn&#x27;t look like an Amish Grandmother! Now I look like Scarface! If I wanted to be tazered... i would have committed a crime! It is NOT PAINLESS!! All you smell is burning hair and flesh! I never had to recharge it .. cuz Both tazers broke!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s crap and don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin stubbly at best, the smell of burnt hair is overwhelming, and it stings like a mamma jamma. It gave me a second degree burn. I have a blister on my armpit that leaves me doing the chicken wing all day. I didnt give it the time to see if it keeps hair away longer than shaving. The hair wasnt even gone to begin with! No no thanks!</li>
            <li> Just say Nono to Nono, why did I not believe the other 340 negative reviews? Nothing but hassle and did not work. Say NoNo!</li>
            <li> it looks like it is going to work but i have been using it for a month now and i cannot see much of a difference, we will see how it ends..</li>
            <li> Got the unit quickly.  Haven&#x27;t had a lot of time to work with it yet, but am working on it.  I agree with everyone about the smell, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me much.  This item is quite easy to use and am looking forward to the results.</li>
            <li> I ordered the No!No! on the 60day trial on Sept. 20.  At approximately 30 days I contacted No!No! as I had noticed no improvement and was told I must be doing it wrong. It was suggested I review the online video instructions again which I did (and yes I was using the buffer, the blue light remained steadily on and it seems I was doing everything right; it did say the product does not work well on really fine hair nor on really coarse hair which leaves a narrow group the product MIGHT potentially work for - some of my hair issues fell into the correct range so I just concentrated on that area).  As of today I there is no!no! improvement and have asked to return the product.  Note that when I phoned nowhere in their phone system do they offer \\&quot;returns\\&quot; as an option which seems ominous. When I reached customer service I was offered 25% off to continue trying out the product which I refused. However, I was told it would take 7-14 days for UPS to pick it up (was not given a tracking#) and was told there would be no confirmation given for my cancellation request.  By the time UPS will be picking it up my 60 day guarantee will have expired so I am really nervous that this is just a ploy to get out of paying my refund.  I will update this review once I receive a refund (and will also report if I don&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> Thanks so much to all of the reviewers who took the time to write reviews on this awful product.  You saved me a lot of time, money and energy. And, the energy part for me, is the most important part. I am a chronically ill person and I was looking for something to make my life a little easier. Thanks for stopping me!!!!</li>
            <li> If I could only go back in time and NOT buy this product.  Your first red flag should be the fact that a d-list soap opera actress is hawking this product.  It is true that it is painelss-physically that is.  It is incredibly painfully time consuming however.  Try 2.5 hours for only bottom of a leg.  I must say that it is a great product if you are simply using it to remove unwanted facial hair but not $260 great.  The shipping is ridiculous seeing it only weighs a little over a pound in weight.  And yes, let&#x27;s talk about whether you need to return the product because yes, I did.  I shipped it back via UPS and it arrived a little under a week.  I checked if it had been signed for and it had.  I called the customer service number to check on the status of my refund and was told it usually takes 24-48 hours to receive the refund.  I called again a few hours later with the proof of shipping with the tracking number and was told it could take 30 days to get my money back.  If you have really fine thin hair, maybe this is the gadget for you.  If you have really thick course hair, I would move on to the next gadget that is out there.</li>
            <li> After the wonderful reviews and the fake infermerical I deceided to give the No No a try.  After the first time I used it I sent it back to make sure I received my close to $400.00 refund as soon as possible.   The smell of burnt hair was just not for me.  Now I am reading all the negative reviews from Amazon,,,,, I am so glad I sent it back.  I say \\&quot;NO NO to the No No........  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t smart enough to read the reviews first.  I just got super excited by the infomercial and jump on the phone and order it.  My no-no is the last model which supposedly is applicable on the face.  However, the instruction insert tells otherwise - DO NOT use on the face.  I bought it mostly for my daughter who believes that has to remove the fuzz on her upper lip.  I used it on her upper lip and still using it for already 45 days but no-no des not do the job. It burns the fuzz down to around 1mm and can&#x27;t go lower.  My daughter lip looks like she shaved 2 days ago and has to shave again.  That&#x27;s why we have to use the tweezers after the no-no. I used it on my legs where I do not have who knows how much hair as I waxed and used Burn&#x27;s (German company) extraction machine all my life.  My legs hair is very thin and rare from constant extraction during all these years.  Plus, when it grows, it grows soft and doesn&#x27;t poke like a hair that was shaved as shaving is cutting the hair and has flat surface and grows evenly together but extracted one has pointy ends and every different hair grows at its own time and is not chaffing when touch.   I thought no-no would completely rid off my hair. But what it does is burning your hair no lower than a 1 mm which is about the length of a 2-days man&#x27;s beard which chaffs and is very unpleasant to touch.  The infomercial claims that no-no destroys the follicle of the hair root and thus you can see 70% hair reduction in 30 to 50 days.  How could the follicle get destroyed if it is not burned deeper at least to skin level?  My daughter and I are using it already 45 days and do not have any improvement.  I have been told that have a 60-days free trial and my account was charged on the 22nd day with the first payment of $90 (3 pmts all together plus S+H).  When I called I was told that I have been placed on a 30-days payment program without my knowledge and without my OK.  I wanted to return the product right away and costumer servicesaid OK but then you will not get a refund because you committed to a 60-day trial and are breaching the agreement.  I had to give them a chance to prove that no-no is working.  So, I am using it and waiting to return it.  No good results at all!  I&#x27;ll let you know how the return went.  But meanwhile, DO NOT DEAL with these crooks!  All the negative reviews are true! I experienced it on my own sucker&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li> product was used when I received it , I returned it but again received another used product returned it again received another used product . On the third time I just requested a refund. I am assuming amazon is selling refurbish product.</li>
            <li> Two days after my first (and only) use of the no! no!, I still have prominent blue veins apparent on my shins, veins that surfaced only after my use of the no!no!     I admittedly have sensitive skin, but this is ridiculous. The company will be receiving pictures and a complaint from me in the event that the veins do not recede in the next few days. Needless to say I will not be using this product again, and it&#x27;s going back immediately. Beware!</li>
            <li> I bought the No!No! hair removal from HSN when they had their \\&quot;special deal\\&quot; on it.  It came with 2 buffer pads (1 large and 1 small) as well as 3 tip attachments, and 2 different types of cream.  I originally bought it to use on my legs, however, it did not work on my legs at all.  It removed absolutely no hair, so I tried it on my arms.  It worked on my arms to a point.  Meaning, it completely removed the hair in some spots, but not in others.  So I figured this is what the buffer pads were for, they really didn&#x27;t buff much of anything no matter how many times I went over the spot or in different \\&quot;buffing\\&quot; motions (circular, rubbing).  So my arms ended up with bald patches, and short stubby little hairs.  I do have to say though that the hair is growing slowly on my arms, so I guess that is a plus.  I wasn&#x27;t brave enough to try it on any portion of my face, I&#x27;ve had really good luck with the Bellabe Facial Hair Remover so I&#x27;m going to stick with that.  I eventually ended up returning it to HSN, for what it was advertised to do, and what it actually did certainly wasn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li> I wish that I had read these reviews BEFORE I bought one.  I recently received mine (July 2011) and have already burned my upper lip.  I have tried it on my legs, bikini line and under arms (3 times week).  The first time I used it on my legs it did okay, but it seems like you would have to have a new buffer for each use........because it didn&#x27;t do anything at all after the first time.  I have tried letting the hair grow out, and still nothing.  I feel like Sasquatch and I&#x27;m mad about it.  Oh, and the smell......Sasquatch with a stink.......real attractive.  I will send it back and hope that I don&#x27;t get the run around like so many of you have.  I could just kick myself for not reading Amazon reviews first, but I let my excitement for something new get the best of me.</li>
            <li> Do not even think about buying this NoNo hair removal device.  You will be disappointed big time! And you will be wondering \\&quot;What I was thinking when I decided to spend almost a fortune on such a useless product!\\&quot;     It will be long time before I will be tempted to buy anything featured on Infomercial TV program.</li>
            <li> I bought because it was for $100 on an a TV offer. I paid $104 and noticed another TRY NONO debt in my cc for $89.94. Called and they said there will be another $89.94 debt!  This is a scam! Used sometimes and it does not work. They say you have to use 60 days...maybe so that you lose the returning period and they can go ahead with the scam. I don&#x27;t know how to use and nobody should trust people who lie on their advertisement. Save yourself a headache: DON&#x27;T TRY NONO</li>
            <li> SCAM!!!!!!!!!  No matter what they say it does not work and you will not get your money back. Check the facebook page and all you will see are a few raves like &#x27;just got it and it works great&#x27;.  Well they claim it takes time to work so this patently false. When you write an actual review they delete it.   I used the system for the time required, they insisted that if I used it correctly it should have worked.  It did not! Please do not waste your time or your money. You will not get your money back! When you call for the return the operators insist that either the product was not used correctly or more time is needed. No refund. If I could I would give it 0 stars.</li>
            <li> No!No! Hair removal doesn&#x27;t remove hair at all! Please don&#x27;t waste your money on it. It will only aggravate you in the end!!! It&#x27;s not even worth rating 1/2 a star!!!</li>
            <li> I have done professional laser hair removal before and so I can tell this is doing the same thing at a MUCH slower pace. If you are not dedicated and consistent this is not the product for you. I actually schedule this in my calendar to do it 3 times a week for the first 6 weeks, then 2 times a week, following the recommended usage in the instructions. I have no problem adhering to this because I know that at the lower level that you just have to use this more often. I have already seen a reduction in hair and I know that if I stay on schedule this will eventually work. Not a quick fix at all, but at a fraction of the price of professional laser hair removal it is worth it!</li>
            <li> Shared one with my sister, it is a rip-off.  Better to wax than waste money on this.  Amazon, you shouldn&#x27;t carry such a poor product.  My sister went through a tough time as well, getting her credit back.  Turned it over to American express.  Stay clear.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair, so my hair growth is NOT heavy. I used this product for three weeks on my chin hairs. Not once was I ever without the hair. I was so upset, because they tell you to stick with it and the hair will eventually be gone. When? Next year?! I couldn&#x27;t send this product back fast enough. What a disappointment.I can&#x27;t believe who some of the women are that represent No No. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase anything they represent. And I also think they all started with waxed skin and then used No No. It &#x27;s the only way I would see it working.</li>
            <li> I am in skin care and was expecting a product that had some similarity in results to that of laser or waxing. WRONG! This product literally just singes the top layer of hair then you \\&quot;buff\\&quot; aka sand down the burnt hair, which is not a sexy smell. On the legs this literally takes hours to do and then you have stubble the very next day. I am not waiting for them to pull any more money out of my account I am closing it and will work with Amazon to get the remainder, and also contact the BBB. The only reason they want you to try it for the full 45-60 days is because then they have all your payments. Laser may be more expensive but it WORKS and waxing is cheap and fast and it WORKS. NO NO Is not cheap, is not fast and does NOT WORK. What a shame!</li>
            <li> I got the NoNo and was expecting great results from everything I&#x27;d heard. I should have known it wasn&#x27;t going to work when it hurt (think burning) to use on my chin even with the attachment for the face. But I kept up in spite of the pain hoping to have a chin with reduced hair. To my shock, the product did produce results. MORE HAIR! What was 8-10 coarse, thick hairs on my chin is now 30-40 thick, coarse hairs! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I got it in Peru and was my favorite hair removal since then. I never tried it on my face, just to think about it gave me a little panic. I tried on my legs following the instructions and works perfectly. I stopped using it when I could not find the replacement blade in America. Now I know where to get it. I am totally happy with no no! just be patient cuz takes a lot of your time, after while you will just need a retouch in each leg.&lt;br /&gt;BTW I used to have a loy hair...horrible, I could not wear skirts or shorts..a nightmare...but after using nono! I was so proud of my legs and ready for a swimming suit.&lt;br /&gt;4 stars cuz its very expansive and takes a lot time to do its job but you will be reward.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.- I have the no no classic.</li>
            <li> This was a rip off, I have used it almost every day for the last six months... It does not work...</li>
            <li> I was sucked in by the tv ad one night when i could not sleep.  i had never bought anything from a tv ad before, but it seemed soooo wonderful that i went online to look for a better price and ordered.  boy do i wish i had taken time to read the reviews online before making that purchase!  this thing does none of the wonderful things the ad says but it does do every horrible thing the consumer reviews i have read say!  i have more hair than ever and burns to go along with the extra hair!  i kept on trying to perfect my technique (not the issue, the issue is that it is impossible to use on your upper lip or chin due to facial contours) and waiting for the results promised, so the 60 day trial period ran out.  don&#x27;t waste your time or money!  i wish there was a 0 star rating....</li>
            <li> I bought a No! No! in August of 2011, I have used it religiously 6-7 times a week for 8 months and can say without a doubt this product is a joke.  It \\&quot;sort of\\&quot; seems to work if you are using is every day, then you only need to shave maybe once a week, but if you skip a day or 2 the hair grows back just as vigorously as if you had never done a thing to it.  The lady in the promo video that says she hadn&#x27;t shaved her bikini area in 4 months is an outright liar.  Even daily use on this area never made it the least bit smooth, still needed to be shaved several times a week.</li>
            <li> This product does not work.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  My wife was fooled by the infomercial and customer testimonials.  Don&#x27;t be fooled.  If it sounds too good to be true, it is!  She bought it, and she was very disappoined.  :(</li>
            <li> I bought the No No after a recommendation from my cousin. I have done laser, but stopped....and the first rule in laser is to not use any other hair removal technique. Laser gave me great results. But after I stopped (I moved from India to USA and its much more expensive here!) I had to do something. No No seemed like an option.     But, it was completely useless in terms of removing all hair at once. so you never really have a clean hair free skin. I gave up on my legs in the second go, because it did nothing. I thought I will try the small areas like upper lip and chin and sides. This was worse. It burned my face (even when I was using its face attachment)and didnt do the job of removing hair very well.    Finally I called to return the product, which was achieved after much trouble and hassle, even though the product is apparently under a \\&quot;money back\\&quot; guarantee. after all the hassle of sending this back, i still have to receive my money back!    If your hair growth is thick, this product is not for you...trust me.</li>
            <li> The name says everything about the product. Mexico never really cared about the Chevy \\&quot;NOVA,\\&quot; because NO VA means no go in Spanish, although it may have been a good car, the name was less represent able.  Like \\&quot;No NO,\\&quot; I am more or less biased, never having tried the product, reading the related reviews only propounded my personal logic on not purchasing the product. My favorite comment, \\&quot;was I smelled burnt hair for two hours,\\&quot; personally I would not want to smell like burnt hair, neither try solving the personal problem of removing an already impending situation; dealing with what the family GENEs giveth, body hair.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this and then so disappointed, I am sending it back. I get smoother results with a razor. It was as time consuming as waxing or depilating though it wasn&#x27;t painful. I&#x27;d rather suck it up, epilate be done with it for the month and remind myself no pain no gain. If you really want a smooth finish that actually last this isn&#x27;t the product for you. However if you have an hour to spare and don&#x27;t mind a sand paper finish with no pain involved go for it!</li>
            <li> Well I have been working steady at it for 5 days a week for a month and a half, without any results(I have light fine hair naturally.  It does say three months so maby it will surprise me, but it&#x27;s looking like a $100 scam.</li>
            <li> Luckily I bought my no!no! on sale when Sephora stopped carrying it (maybe that should have been the first clue), but I&#x27;m still annoyed that I wasted any of my money on a product that DOES NOTHING it claims.  It claims that you will have less hair growing back over time - isn&#x27;t a year and a half a long time?  I used the product for 1 1/2 years and always struggled to find a retailer that carried the replacement blades (why would I pay $10 in shipping for a product that costs $20?) and despite the fact that I had light and fairly fine hair to begin with, I STILL have the same amount of hair  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> I have had my no no for going on two years, I have the older model not the newer one, and only paid 75.00 for the entire system when Dillard&#x27;s stopped carrying it. I am only giving it 4 stars because the smell is disgusting, It does burn your hair, but it does work I use the no no about every two weeks to burn off any new growth hair. After a while of using it, it does make the hair not grow back as much, my doctor recommended me to use it with vanqia a prescription for unwanted facial hair. I don&#x27;t use the vanqia as i should, so it has to be the no no doing it, but you have to use it right, and you have to understand that it is burning your hair, so it does work after burning your hair so many times you root will finally die. Just think about burn victims, where they got burnt there is no hair, that is what the no no does over time, and yes it works contrary to what the others are saying, maybe they just didn&#x27;t like the smell, the smell is really gross! I would recommend!</li>
            <li> I was using the Braun epilator for a year when I saw the television ad for this and found it looked so easy.  Well I bought it, and tried it for 2 months and found my hair was growing back in thicker and courser than with the epilator.  I found that their pad for rubbing the dead hair off didn&#x27;t seem to work for me.  The unit seemed to work as it was supposed to, it just didn&#x27;t seem to remove the hair.  I ended up shaving after using it to remove the hair.  Anyway, after 2 months I went back to the epilator and find that works much better!  I shouldn&#x27;t have made the impulsive choice of purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> I helped my wife use this worse-than-worthless device.  The first time we used the narrow tip for her chin / jaw area.  It cut her face in many places and so I looked at the terminals under a microscope and took pictures to send to Radiancy.  The terminals are like claws protruding much farther than the wire, and the wire is ten times farther back.  So the claw terminals hit your face first and cut it, while the hot wire is farther away.  They sent me another tip and it was the same.  The wide tip&#x27;s terminals looked smoother with the wire and terminals well below the tip&#x27;s surface.  That one didn&#x27;t work either, and burned her face.  Customer Service has been infuriating - I could go on and on.  How do they manage to sell a product like this and probably make money on it?</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this product and used the no!no! religiously for 8 months to no avail.  It simply didn&#x27;t work.  At first I thought my device was broken so I bought a replacement no!no! devices which I thought was broken as well.  As it turns out, it wasn&#x27;t that both my no!no! devices were broken but that both no!no! devises simply did not do what it promised.     The No!No! technology will not remove your hair. Not even close.  This devise is a glorified shaver, the most it does is to shave your unwanted hair, make your skin feel hot, and have your room smell like burnt hair.     Save your money and invest in a Silk&#x27;n SensEpil at home laser hair removal system (the first at home laser to be FDA approved).  It&#x27;s a bit pricey at $400,  but you will start to see results immediately.  The only downside is that it takes awhile (6mo-1yr) to see long lasting results.  But trust me, you will love your smooth silky arms and legs. So far, my underarm hair is 100% gone while my leg and arm hair are 50% gone.</li>
            <li> What a complete waste of good money.  I wish so much that I would have read Amazon reviews prior to making my purchase.  I would have given it zero stars had that been an option.  It does nothing.  The unit does not have enough power to burn away any hair.  It truly is perfectly worthless.  Please do not waste your money.  Spend the same money on electrolysis and see some results.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing! I should have paid attention to the reviews here but I didn&#x27;t. I was fine with it not being permanent, i just wanted it to remove hair and for it to remain gone for a couple of weeks. It does not even do that! What a total waste of money!</li>
            <li> People,  Did anyone else notice that even the 4 &amp; 5 star reviews only say they&#x27;re trying it and have not seen much?  This does not work at all and even worse, it does cause pain and injury.  The TV shopping network shows it being used on the face.  Do not do this!!  Yikes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of crap in my years, but this is the most expensive piece of crap I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> I like this product although it isn&#x27;t as effective as I had expected.   I continue to use it with modest satisfaction.   All in all, I&#x27;m glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li> This product may work for people with peach fuzz, fine hair but not on coarse hair.  Perhaps it is a good product if you want to spend a couple of hours each time to remove hair from your legs...and then do that the recommended 3 times a week.  I have better ways to spend my time...and to top it all off...even after you spend a couple of hours, supposedly removing the hair,  it is still not smooth like you would expect after you shave.  Simply said...If you want to be hair-free by the summer...you better start the process in September...it will take you at least 6 months to get hair-free, IF THAT EVEN WORKS!  Consumers beware of this product.  We have much more important things to spend our time and money on!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it, waste of money, dose nothing, burnt my skin, left over hair, painfully slow, dose nothing,  Returning is a big hurdle, they try every mean to do not get it back, when I returned it my credit card reimbursed but only in one day my credit card was charged with unrecognizable transaction, I am following up with credit card company, could not prove it was because of NONO return but it was my only over the phone purchase almost for a year, I do not use that card for over the internet purchases.  Amazon do not let me file this without rating, this thing do not deserve any star.</li>
            <li> I just bought my No No a few days ago. I&#x27;m on my 2nd day of using it and I really like it so far. I&#x27;ve read most of the reviews on here and most people seem to have had a bad time with it but I can&#x27;t really say one way or the other right now. Hopefully I won&#x27;t end up disappointed like everyone else on here is but I also didn&#x27;t pay as much as everyone else did.</li>
            <li> I\\&quot;m not happy with it but was unable to return because of reduced refund! I ordered the new model and received the old one had to open box to see item, I tried it and it work somewhat but not altogether. dissatified and was unaware it was the older model before I used it I have been bed ridden since 12-1-2010 and my spouse opened it and gave it to me to use .</li>
            <li> The TV ad for no!no!is really great... sounds almost too good to be true, but not quite so much that women aren&#x27;t willing to give it a try. Expensive little bugger, too. Easy enough to use, but I have a life to live and do not wish to invest the time they say it will take to get results. It takes four times longer than just shaving, hours a week, actually... and then they want you to let the hair it didn&#x27;t get to grow back to a certain length so you can go over the area again... and again... and AGAIN! And, the results are not consistent from one area to the next. The no!no! is SOOOOO not worth the price tag. And hey, gals, listen up: they say you can easily return it for a full refund. Sounds good. But they don&#x27;t really WANT you to return it - so they&#x27;ve made it a real hassel to get said refund. Buyer Beware. Get a good men&#x27;s 5 blade razor and some shave cream instead.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002LBK5QU No!no! Hair Removal Unit, Pink]]    I didn&#x27;t see any permanent hair removal on my legs at all. In fact, it wouldn&#x27;t even remove the hair on my legs...or under my arms! It did remove some hair around my bikini area, but my skin swelled up and was bright red. My chin and upper lip hurt the most and I felt sun-burned and stinging, plus my chin was cut and bleeding. I exfoliated afterwards but the burnt hair just clung to my face. So my skin is already on fire and I have to sandpaper it some more with their exfoliating paper! Ouch! And I had to exfoliate again the next day to finally be able to remove it all. Good thing I wasn&#x27;t going out that night!    They say that the only really PERMANENT solution to unwanted hair is electrolysis...done by licensed practitioners who do NOT practice laser. Most laser/electrolysis combo salons are lazy and inexperienced in electrolysis which is very time consuming. Do your research...not everyone is good. I went for 2 years and didn&#x27;t have the results I wanted. However, I have friends who are completely hairless so I&#x27;m going back. Also, the latest newest technology in electrolysis is so much better than 12 years ago when I first tried it...and it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as the No!No!...in fact I fell asleep during my latest session! And they have a special wand to take out the redness now...so no burning, cuts or pain! Yes, it&#x27;s more expensive in the long run...but I don&#x27;t want to risk the side effects of the No!No! which hasn&#x27;t been around as long as electrolysis! and I really don&#x27;t want that blue light around my eyes!</li>
            <li> It is the best machine for removing my unwanted hear  But it needs time to finish all your body</li>
            <li> What a terrible, terrible item.  Purchased this primarily for 12-20 stubborn dark chin hairs on my fair headed self.  Other facial hair, at 54, is medium peach fuzz that shaving 1 or 2 times of year takes care of.  Also have medium to heavy amount of very light hair on my arms and thought I would just give this a thorough workout during the trial.  It&#x27;s been about 10 days, but it is going back.  I have some very mild burns on my face (followed instructions meticulously), it doesn&#x27;t even do a good thorough job on the peach fuzz. When it singes the hairs on the face, it makes some of the light ones get dark at the base so it looks even worse.  No, I am not going to use the buff on my face, but pulling the dark hairs after they have been singed (burned) is tough.  It seems that the skin tightens around the base of the signed hairs.  It ends up that it looked worse after than before leaving some of the burned off hairs with a dark, burned top just at skin level.  It is really hard to do the upper lip.  The ladies (shysters, crooks) in the demo must not have the unit on when they are doing this on their upper lips.  The instructions are explicit, \\&quot;do not go over an area more than 3 times and do not allow it to come in contact with the lips.  This makes it impossible to get most of the upper lip area.  And, it is the same as elsewhere, hit and miss, with some (a lot) of the treated hairs looking darker.  Even if you shaved after using this, there would be some blackened hair bases showing, yuck.  Speaking of yuck, if you got a house full of guests and you want to clear them out, try this!  Excuse me, \\&quot;a little burning hair smell\\&quot;.  It stinks. If you don&#x27;t shower and scrub right after, the smell stays on your skin and you&#x27;ll notice it when you rub it.  Had to run an air cleaner in the room and seriously thought the smoke alarm might go off.  All this, and I am not really hairy!  On my legs, what did come off was not as good as a clean shave with one of the new multiple blade razors, I tend to like the razor with the battery that vibrates the blade, clean shave with rarely a nick.  Failed and then some on every application.[[ASIN:B002AUC48Y No!No! Hair Removal Unit, Black and Red]]</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be scammed into buying this.  You never get a smooth leg/arm whatever.  It does not work...waste of money.  The infommercial makes it seem like it&#x27;s going to make you smooth and soft....big bunch of bull....you still have to shave/wax.  My hair growth has increased.  I used to wax, and had blonde thin hair, now I&#x27;ve been shaving in between the no-no treatments, and hair is darker and thicker....so upset about this.  save your $</li>
            <li> is there a way to give it zero stars?    got it for wifey and she used it. waste of money and waste of time. it does not work well. wish i could return it.    oh, well. you live and learn.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with facial hair; and like many women, I jump for joy every time a new product comes out that promises to remove it.  The hair on my face (upper lip and a very noticeable patch on my chin) is very dark and coarse; as is the hair on my legs.  I tried the no-no, and in short, it just didn&#x27;t work like I wanted it to.  I want something that is close like shaving, and the product still left a good bit of stubble where I used it; legs and face.  I read good reviews for fine hair, but if you are olive toned and beastly hairy, like me, this product will not make you happy.</li>
            <li> The infomercial indicated you could use it on your face because the lady with the heavy sideburns used it. The instructions say not to use it on your face.  My problem is my chin.</li>
            <li> Thank all of you who took the time to post your reviews.  It has saved myself and I am sure numerous other women the money, frustration, and apparently facial burns.  Some of them that stood out was something I was wondering about and that is it actually ends up creating more hairgrowth coming back than before for some women.  There should be some way to hold this company accountable for their shady return policy and crooked practices.  They give other promoters of products that may actually do what they say, a really bad reputation.  This ends up hurting everyone, not just the victims that ordered from this company.  Glad I was able to dodge the bullet, than to you for making these reports.</li>
            <li> rec&#x27;d the unit in June 2013 and I returned it to Precision Fulfillment in Bolton, Ontario Canada as per instructions.  Their LA, USA office say it was never rec&#x27;d and at this point I am out $317.00 and have nothing to show for it.  Customer service is next to NIL and they have no control on packages rec&#x27;d. obviously.  Package disappeared along with my money.  This product DOES NOT WORK despite what the reviews are.  They are ripping off the consumer.  NO NO  to NONOa</li>
            <li> Wish I read reviews before I bought item. It sucks! I called to return it and was told to wait the 60 days to get all my money back. Of course I let too much time go and kept it. Once in a while I bring it out, but it takes so much time to do a small area, you might as well shave. DON&#x27;T waste your money!</li>
            <li> No Return on Opened Items . . . read it again: NO RETURN ON OPEN ITEMS!&lt;br /&gt;Buy this piece of junk, open it, and you&#x27;re flat out of luck if you don&#x27;t like it. Would you buy a car if it stated no return if you open the door? Don&#x27;t be stupid. Skip this garbage at all costs. It&#x27;s made for suckers.</li>
            <li> This thing is a waste of money   it breaks so easy pls. don&#x27;t buy this thing   they don&#x27;t fix it, you can&#x27;t refund it and there no warranty   noh....NONO for me...</li>
            <li> I honestly have never been motivated enough about a product purchase to actually write a review, but I feel this is warranted:  I received the No!No! Hair removal system as a birthday gift from my mother last month (she bought it from the actual infomercial).  I finally used it today, and instead of looking like I shaved my bikini area 7 days ago, it looks like I shaved it 5 days ago.  Not only does it appear that my mom wasted her money (luckily there is a reimbursement on returned items), I wasted a perfectly good shower on not shaving my bikini area.  Also it smells like burnt hair in my apartment bathroom- and in the dead of winter I can&#x27;t open a window.  Long story short: this is a small handheld device with a giant empty promise.  Ladies: just shave or wax- at least these bring actual results!</li>
            <li> This product is an absolute waste of money. If I could give it zero stars, I would. It doesn&#x27;t work well at all. It takes several applications over the skin to remove hair and even then, it doesn&#x27;t get all of the hair. The smell is overpoweringly gross and I still have to shave my legs afterwards. Absolutely not worth the exorbitant cost! It&#x27;s inconvenient to use, hard to hold and tends to \\&quot;stutter\\&quot; over my skin, missing hairs and causing me to have to go over and over the same area, with terrible results. I&#x27;m sending it back today and am going back to waxing! Oh, and a word to the wise -- don&#x27;t try to send it back before the minimum 45 day trial period is up, or you have to cover the cost of shipping it back yourself. I learned that the hard way!</li>
            <li> BOUGHT A NO  NO  HAIR REMOVAL---ABOUT A YEAR AGO--AND IT HAS NEVER REMOVED HAIR ON MY ARMS OR FACE--AND DEFINITELY NOT THE LEGS---CALLED SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT THE PRODUCT AND ALL I GET IS THE RUN AROUND--THAT I AM NOT USING IT RIGHT---DUH--THERES ONLY ONE WAY TO USE IT--HAS NEVER WORKED WASTED OVER 200.00--DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing commercials &amp; really wanted to buy this product. I almost did, just decided to do a little research first.  I find it very Fishy how most of the 5 star reviews are all on same day. January 26 &amp; 27 2011! Seems very odd since all the other reviews are staggered over time. You can tell that it&#x27;s their marketing people doing it! Guess what no!no!, people are not that stupid!!!!!  Also the reviews from those dates are careful to point out at least one flaw so that it looks real. Sometimes they point out flaws that have already been fixed (like cordless models etc..) in an effort to upsell people even more.   The language used in those reviews is similar &amp; another similarity is the way  the paragraphs are spaced out in the same way &amp; you can tell it&#x27;s a marketing person writing it. I also must say that all the other positive reviews that could be real were written by people who have only used it a few weeks. According to them it takes months to see real progress so those reviews shouldn&#x27;t even be counted.    I&#x27;m disappointed cause  I really wanted to buy this &amp; it looked like a cool concept but after further research I would never get one. Everyone who has tried to return it seems to have had major issues. So based on my research it&#x27;s a big NO for the No! No! BUYER BEWARE &amp; marketing folks c&#x27;mon people see right through you!</li>
            <li> This product does not work and I can&#x27;t get a refund for 60 days! The customer service rep informed me it takes about 6-8 weeks to see the results.  I never would have considered buying this product if I had known that. I should have read the reviews first.</li>
            <li> I am NO LONGER \\&quot;a happy lady\\&quot; after purchasing this product!  Unless you are prepared to waste an unbelievable amout of time trying to get the Radiencey No No Co. to STOP charging your credit card even 1 1/2 months AFTER you have returned the unsatisfactory item, this is a product and company that you should stay very far away from.  Fortunately I charged this to my Amex card, and Amex is now battling the Radiency Co., on my behalf, to get them  to cease charging me $89.94 a month, for an item I returned long ago.   Mine is NOT the first horror story.  I only wished I had read all the other negative reviews before I ordered this useless product sold by an unreputable company.</li>
            <li> The product is well below a one star status, and the customer service ineffective and shamefully worse.  Not reputable; Avoid this time consuming financial waste.</li>
            <li> Scientifically it make no sense. I use the tria laser. It works at higher settings. The tria laser hurts wear there is lots of hair. Less pain after hair is less.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money...please..if you want to waste 192 quid..then send it to me !  And customer service is rubbish. It states on the web page that tel lines are available from 9 - 5.30. They close the line at 5 - probably too many complaint calls. I have sent 5 emails since 4th feb for my return. Not so much as a courtesy fob off call. DONT BE SUCKED IN. THE PRODUCT DOES NOT GET RID OF HAIR- well i&#x27;m still shaving and enjoying a cheap and cheerful relationship with my new best and trusted friend bic !!!</li>
            <li> This is one time I am glad I didn&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews.    I used the No! No! the Month of May 2011 because I got tired of waxing the hairs off of my lip, legs and bikini area and have not seen any hair regrowth since.  It has been 7 months since I used it and am so very happy that I still don&#x27;t have any hair in those areas.  It seems like it is a permanent hair removal tool to me since there hasn&#x27;t been any regrowth since using it that long ago.  I used it more aggressively than the instructions stated, daily and went over each area at least 20 times each since I am Italian and had some hairs that were really thick and dark.  I am sooo very happy with my results and have sent many blessings to the maker and distributors of this product. I highy recommend the No! No!</li>
            <li> Just so you folks know, even Clinical Laser Treatment isn&#x27;t permanent (even though advertised) As speaking from experience from the last 10 years of doing so/paying for it. Sometimes I get a new tech that doesn&#x27;t read my chart and see I have been coming since 2003 and getting my back, shoulders, upper arms and neck and chest. They try be detective and figure out why it just isn&#x27;t \\&quot;permanent?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I came to the conclusion about 3 years into it that I am willing to put up with it and call it temporary hair removal. Since it does go away for about 2 months but then starts to come back. That being said - I see gimmicks like these and think, hmmm would people go through all this if something was that simple such as \\&quot;No No\\&quot; is advertised? Not even close.&lt;br /&gt;By the way...some referred to Laser Treatment as LASIK!? Umm that is for Laser Eye Surgery. LOL</li>
            <li> Very disapointing product.  Slow and awkward to operate, it left my armpit rather sore, and with lots of stubles.  After 3 weeks, I am still awaiting the &#x27;promised&#x27; refund...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do it. No matter how tempting it sounds. I recently bought the nono 8800 and it sucks. It only removes my arm hair which is super fine. Forget underarms, legs which are normal thickness and ladies, don&#x27;t even hope for bikini or Brazilian.  It does not remove hair and the hair doesn&#x27;t burn off. Funny coz it smells like burning hair but there&#x27;s no results.   I was so excited and hopeful when I bought this product and now I&#x27;m thoroughly disappointed. I saw the reviews and thought I&#x27;d try it anyway just in case it works. Nope, it doesn&#x27;t. Back to the razor.</li>
            <li> Thank you!!! I will definitely NOT be using this product!!!!  I guess telling customers that you can BURN your hair off is out of the question. The word Crystallize is the same?????????  Definitely a Shady company.... I don&#x27;t like that..... Looks like a fun product on tv but I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t like falling for late night infomercials ha ha ha ((( exception the set it and forget it rotisserie that is the best product EVER!!!))).  :P  PS.... To the makers of NONO......  NO ONE LIKES THE SMELL OF BURNT HAIR!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Got this for Christmas and have been using it on my legs every other day for almost 6 months now.  (And have the burn scars to prove it.)  It does not work.  I see maybe a 10% reduction in hair growth.  Big deal.  Who&#x27;s going to the beach with 90% hairy legs?  Since it just burns the hair, there is always stubble left.  It only works on smooth surfaces, so shins and knees are impossible to do.  It takes an hour to do both full legs because you have to go over each leg at least 4 times to get all the hair.  After all this time, I see absolutely no change on my bikini area.  They should have paid me for all the time I wasted using this product.  If it&#x27;s so good, why isn&#x27;t it advertised for mens&#x27; beards?  Because it doesn&#x27;t work, that&#x27;s why.  If you are still set on buying one after reading this, save your receipt, you will be sending it back.</li>
            <li> Anyone else notice all the \\&quot;independent\\&quot; Blogs, etc...say \\&quot;Yeah, it&#x27;s made for the face!\\&quot;.  Then the small print in all the legally  liable pages say Don&#x27;t use on the face and Not Suggested.  What does this tell you about the character behind this company?</li>
            <li> I have not ordered product yet but my sister n I were both looking very much fwd to it.... But after reading the comments here....... Well I think we will both pass. Thank you for stopping 2 single mothers from getting scammed....</li>
            <li> I got this shaver for Christmas about 6 months ago and have been using several times a week with minimal results. It takes quite a long time for one treatment, so I have been working only on removing the hairs on my stomach. I&#x27;ve noticed that the hairs are SLIGHTLY finer than before. It doesn&#x27;t work on underarm hair. If your willing to put the time in and spend the money, it&#x27;s worth it for working on small areas. You can get it on-line for $100 at an outside website, though, so be sure to make your purchase there instead of here.</li>
            <li> If you want fast hair removal this product is not for you!  I tried removing stubble (it was 3 mmm as suggested) from under my arms, but it only removed a few hairs.  I work out daily and I need fast hair removal so this product was not for me.    The company specifically told me that they would cover the S&amp;H if I was to return the product, but of course that wasn&#x27;t the case.  I somehow had a feeling that was going to happen.  They get you to buy their product promising they won&#x27;t charge you and THEY WILL PAY FOR S&amp;H, but that wasn&#x27;t the case!  I had to pay the S&amp;H.  I marked RETURN TO SENDER for Canada Post, otherwise I would have had to pay a further charge to return the product.  BUYER BEWARE in this case!  Companies will do anything to try to get you to buy their products.  They are liars!!!! It&#x27;s my own fault for trusting them.  One of the reasons I did purchase it was that there would be NO FEE to me should I return it, but that wasn&#x27;t the case at all!  Please make absolutely sure you want this product before you purchase it!</li>
            <li> As a man trying to remove unwanted chest hair it does not seem to work and it is very time consuming. I have burned myself numerous trying to go over the same spot to remove the hair. I would much rather prefer shaving and deal with razor burns vs dealing with the time consuming hassel with the NO NO. I have only used it for a week and am very dissastisifed with the product.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible gadget. Fortunately I bought it on the trial basis &amp; my card was never charged but it was nearly impossible to get anyone to answer their customer service phone. After a few days of trying someone finally answered &amp; I was able to return it. I did have to pay for the return shipping. It burned my skin every time I used it. It would cut on &amp; off &amp; I thought at the time that it might have been my fault or a defective device but after having read some of the reviews here, I see I am not the only one. I am having some of the same &#x27;side-effects&#x27; as others here: black dots, increased hair; in addition, they are now ingrown &amp; I have to wait longer for the hairs to emerge in order to pull them. The worst thing I ever bought. I&#x27;m looking for a class-action suit to be initiated in the future regarding this pathetic gadget.</li>
            <li> It does not remove any hair at the root level. It is an incredible waster of money...DO not buy it</li>
            <li> This product might have done the job except it broke after almost 3 weeks of using it.  I called the company, the guy was nice, he gave me a return number and I sent it back, no problems right?.....WRONG!!!  I called back several times over the next month after sending it back and got run around in circles!  I never got my new No!No! and better yet b/c it was more than 30 days after the charge on my credit card, I still had to pay for the thing.  So I\\&quot;m out $270 for something I don&#x27;t have and didn&#x27;t work when I had it. Their guaranteed 60 day no risk is a BIG fraud!  Don&#x27;t buy.  No I know why Sephora dropped their product!</li>
            <li> This was the first time I bought something because of a TV commercial. It looked so simple, easy and convincing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this product is nothing like it claims.  First of all, it is finicky to use and often did nothing (you can tell because the light was not flashing).  When I got the light flashing it was extremely time consuming. I spent a lot of time on a small area, because it did not always work and needed multiple swipes to produce any sort of result.  To treat a large area you would need to spend hours on it.  It can manage only light and fine hair that almost invisible anyway.  The product claims that it will not grow back over time, but the hair does grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the product on a special discount using a promo on the TV commercial.  I was worried about getting my money back given how false the other claims were. It took some aggressive screaming over the phone to get them to give me a refund, but they never refunded the cost of shipping the No!no! unit back even though in their advertising they promise it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DID NOT LIKE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Hard to use&lt;br /&gt;2) Did not work on all hair&lt;br /&gt;3) Took a lot of time to produce poor results&lt;br /&gt;4) Hair grew back&lt;br /&gt;5) Return process was difficult&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LIKED:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Commercial. Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO! NO! DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything except burn off the hair at the surface.  It gets the same results as shaving except with more expense, a terrible smell, and taking more time.  I returned mine.</li>
            <li> I actually bought it directly from no no and paid a lot (so angry!) and I remember reading that you can return it anytime but NOT the first 2 months. WELL now they say you can only return it in 60 days!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I should report them.</li>
            <li> This product does not work.  I bought it directly from the Radiancy company, and their customer service has been horrible.  It took me six long calls over 2 months just to get the RMA in order to ship this back to the company for free (which they claimed was part of my purchase agreement).  Now that they have my nono, I still have not received a refund (2 months after sending the item back).  Very mad, and will make sure this is all over the internet.  Do not buy nono.  It is a total \\&quot;As Seen on TV\\&quot; gimmicky rip off.</li>
            <li> I bought the No No after watching it on a home shopping network.  They said that they had exclusive rights to the Pink one and you could not get a pink one any where else.  Not true.  First, it does not work.  All it does is burn hair and the burnt hair stays on your face regardless.   I used it for under my arms every day for an hour, I used this thing.  I saw no reduction in the amount of hair.     It was completely useless in terms of removing all hair at once. so you never really have a clean hair free skin.  It burned my face (even when I was using its face attachment)and didn&#x27;t do the job of removing hair very well.     I returned it.</li>
            <li> my daughter has polysistic ovaries and has a problem with facial hair.  After buying and trying the no no she is now hair free, has much more confidence and she thinks it is brilliant.  You have to use it regularly, but after trying epilation, waxing etc., this is the only thing that works and is pain free.  A fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I used my no no once. When I tried to use it the second time a post was broken off. I called the company to try to exchange it but was told since I bought  it from hsn they couldn&#x27;t help me. Hsn was out of the product so they said they will refund my money. I am not very happy with the customer service of the company and after reading the reviews it sounds like not many people are.</li>
            <li> I just came across the ad on TV for the No! No! Hair Removal System. Being extremely curious as to why they never mentioned the price on the ad, I came here to look at the reviews and to get a price on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow. I guess this thing is a piece of crap. Most reviews are one-star or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The internet is great for some things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been watching the infomercials for a while, and I&#x27;ve been wanting to find that magic solution to smoother legs (aren&#x27;t we all, ladies?).  Judging by the reviews, I&#x27;ll just change the channel and stick with my razors!</li>
            <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t work.  My mom ordered it for me because the commercial made it sound miraculous.  I have had problems with dark facial hair since I was a teenager.  So I was excited to try it.  The thing just singes the hair off.  You are still left with a stubble/5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  I used the buffer pad, which hurt.  My skin felt like it was sunburned after I used the nono.  I applied the cream that comes with it, which set my skin on FIRE! I immediately washed it off and applied some aloe vera gel.  When I called to return the thing, the customer service person gave me the run around for 15 minutes.  I was told that I would get a return shipping label via email in 4 to 7 days.  I&#x27;ll wait and see...I will probably have to call them again.  The worst part of all of this is that I feel like the NoNo company is preying on people like myself that are embarrassed of their facial hair and NoNon is trying to make a buck off of my insecurities with a product that is JUNK!</li>
            <li> This product has a lot of negative reviews, but if you go into things with reasonable expectations I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed. I&#x27;ve had mine for about three years, and only used it sporadically, but still see results. I still shave, but repeated use of the no no has left me much smoother much longer. The process is totally painless, relatively speedy, and as easy as can be. It&#x27;s no magic bullet (like newer, more expensive products might be), but I think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> The blades don&#x27;t have any effect for very long and when you try to buy some new ones No No Hair have upgraded to a new one so you can&#x27;t buy the blades you need any more. In other words this product doesn&#x27;t last long. An expensive waste of money.</li>
            <li> No! No! Noooooo! First, it takes forever to use, then it scorches the skin, then you have to shave over the area in any case because it just singes the hair so your legs are still stubbly (oh, and it gave me spider veins where the heat burst some tiny capillaries), then you try to return the product and that is where the fun really begins. I called to ask about refund procedure and they tried to persuade me at great length from a script, to keep the product (like how fabulous it really is if only I&#x27;d give it another try). More burned skin and the house smelling like a sulphur factory? No thanks. Subsequently it toook three months of phone calls (each time I was assured the refund was in progress) and finally the threat of legal action to FINALLY get a refund. All I can say is those actresses who &#x27;endorse&#x27; the product on TV have either never used it and/or are getting paid a huge amount of money to exaggerate. AH, no wonder they use ACTRESSES. Ok, I&#x27;m off to shave my legs now.</li>
            <li> The product is not worth $20 let alone the $200 plus they try to charge for it. The money back guarantee is a hoax and a hassle. Please learn from my mistake and don&#x27;t buy this product!</li>
            <li> First off i will start by saying i only ordered cause it say good for black women  I ordered the Hair NO NO from the infomerial for the 200 bucks and was sitting on he edge of my seat waiting for it to arrive to my house,  so when it did arrive a week late i wasnt even mad...............first use did absolutely nothing to my hair i used it on my face and neck and legs nothing barely and hair was gone my face was burnt and my neck was burnt....so i gave it another go after about a week and a half again my face and neck was burnt Laser hair removal is expensive and it hurts but i will just stick with the laser hair no no SUCKS</li>
            <li> This product was a bitter disappointment. It is NOTHING like the advertisements. It is not easy, it hurts and it does not remove the hair easily.  It takes MANY painful passes before it is off.  My face hurt for a long time after.  I am going to try it again but I am dreading it.</li>
            <li> I am currently getting laser hair removal through Ideal Image. I absolutely love the results but not the price I had to pay. I go every 10 weeks for a 30 minute treatment over a period of 18 months. I chose this route since I always get ingrown hairs under my arms and in my bikini line. No ingrow hairs now! There is a slight burnt hair smell and can be painful for the 30 minutes, but have never developed a rash. I was considering NO-NO to use on my legs but after these reviews I will not buy it. I will continue the professional service that has already given me great results. I would recommend Ideal Image to anyone and October is when they run there best sales :)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not what was expected. Thought it was the NO No for the body including face but it is only to be used on the legs. No wonder it was $100 cheaper.</li>
            <li> Giving it one star only because there&#x27;s no lower rating.  I ordered one of these from Home Shopping Network, my furst purchase from them in 20 years, and my last forever.  The first one didn&#x27;t work, the head was a half inch below the place where it could even reach the skin.  They sent another one - same problem.  It was mechanically flawed and furthermore it never even powered up and if it had it couldn&#x27;t have reached any hair.  They grill you like a cheese sandwich about why you&#x27;re returning it, implying that you are just too stupid to use it.  Removing money from your wallet is not the same as removing hair from your body!</li>
            <li> This is not only one the worst products I have ever bought but dealing with the company to get a refund on not only the product I bought but the one they sent me that I did not order.  How they did that and got my credit card twice I still don&#x27;t know.  The no no burns your hair and does not stop the growth!  It is a lie and the cream burned my skin after I used the no no.  Customer service is impossible.  I bought it in May and it is now September and I still have not received my refund.  I will never buy anything from TV again!  Save your money and your time and don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> I have a huge problem with chin hair and lately I&#x27;ve been starting to grow a mustache. So I decided to try no no because I can&#x27;t afford laser and I don&#x27;t have time to get regular waxes (I&#x27;m a pre-med student, so I really don&#x27;t have spare time). The no no DID hurt, and left multiple burn marks on my chin. This was over a week ago, and my chin still mildly hurts, and even with the soothing cream provided, moisturizers, lotions, and petroleum jelly, my skin is STILL peeling and flaking and dry. I used the buffer provided, but the next day my skin is just as dry and scaly, and I don&#x27;t have a problem with dry skin normally. My upper lip area has also been very dry and flaky. The only place the no no actually worked was in the middle of my eyebrows. The rest were too painful.  I tried using the larger blades on my legs, and there was no effect. Same with my bikini area- no effect after going over the skin at least a dozen times.  I&#x27;m disappointed in the product as a whole.</li>
            <li> I called to return the product and was convinced to hold on to it a little longer.  It still did not do as expected.  I called back a second time to return it and was told now it&#x27;s to late. I was then told I would be called back in two days after review by their accounting dept.  Of course two days went by without a call.  I called back a third time and was told I would get a call back in 10 days so they could review the original phone call to do the return to see If I was missled.  I don&#x27;t suggest buying this product as I followed all the instructions, used it for a few weeks a few times a week without any good results.  I since switched to a cream for removal which works fine.  I would say if the customer service was better try it yourself as your results may be different from mine, but the company seems to try to get you to hang on to it then tell you its to late to return.  Very deceiving practices.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for nearly a year, and it does absolutely NOTHING it claims. No, not even with time or effort. Not only does it NOT stop hair growth, but it actually stimulates dormant hair follicles. After professional hair removal, I bought this product as a safety measure and upkeep. Wouldn&#x27;t you know, all my fine hairs are back and there&#x27;s no getting rid of them, especially in the facial/ chin area. Sure, it may slow down hair regrowth, but trust me, it all COMES BACK, and more! It is also incredibly time-consuming and the gadget itself conks out whenever it wants to. It stops and starts on whim, and refuses to light up even though I am following instructions and pushing it against the skin and hair shaft as instructed. It really is an unbelievable scam, and an expensive loss at that. Now it&#x27;s too late to get my money back, as if.     As much as you&#x27;re tempted by the ads or their slick website, don&#x27;t buy into it. Save your money on a professional laser removal appt.  Someone should report this company for false advertising and peddling a faulty product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product.  It did not work, and then the item actually stopped functioning.  I returned it to their facility on November 30, 2010.  Today is December 27th, and I still have no refund.  I tried emailing (got an automated response) and calling (the line disconnected on me after informing me that they have received my product and I will get my refund).  This is completely unprofessional and lacks any semblance of customer service.</li>
            <li> Wish they had zero star rating, because that is just what I would give this useless product. My wife has been using it for seven months and nothing just a burned upper lip, and the hair is still there. A total waste of money and time. Take my advice and do not buy this useless product.</li>
            <li> I received the nono as a gift in August. It is supposed to slow down the hair re-growth process after a time (I think it was about 60 days), so I did as instructed for 45 days (since that was how long the paperwork said the trial was). I used the nono on one leg and a standard razor on the other leg during that time. At the end of the 45 days, there was no change in the speed of regrowth on the leg that I used the nono on compared to the leg that I used the razor on.  Also, I used the nono on my face using the small tip as instructed and I received slight burns across my upper lip. It was impossible to use it smoothly across the contours of my lip. I looked pretty funny with burn stripes on my mouth that looked like wrinkles at first glance. It was very embarrassing.  I told my mother how poorly the nono performed and it was then that she told me she had paid about $300 for it! I was shocked! That is way too much to pay for it even if it DID work, but under the circumstances, it was just plain robbery!</li>
            <li> it probably is! I can&#x27;t beleive I wasted my money on this! Would not recommend to anyone!    It just doesn&#x27;t work. It does remove some hair, but it is time consuming, stinks (literally) and does not remove the hair in a uniform way, so you still must shave.    And - I bought it from the company with the 60 day \\&quot;risk free\\&quot; guarentee... only now they refuse to refund my money.    A rip-off and a scam!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work.  I tried it for three weeks without results.  I returned the product to the company per their instructions (over 2 months ago) and I am still waiting on the refund they promised.  After 32 min on hold I finally got a real person and was told to wait another 7-10 days for my refund.  This company makes lots of promises but has no follow through.  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT, unless you want to throw money away.   As of 4 Jan 2011 I am still waiting for my refund even though the company agrees that I returned the product and met all their requirements for a full refund.</li>
            <li> Worst product I ever used. You&#x27;ll smell like burnt hair and lots of red marks.    Just try returning this piece of garbage.  You get the runaround continually.  It&#x27;s been over 2 months and now they are saying I didn&#x27;t pay in full.  No number for corporate office, just a p.o. box. which is P.O. Box 630400, SImi Valley, CAS  93063</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have coarse stray dark hairs on my chin that I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of for years.     This product is a glorified razor, it does nothing to remove the hair at the root, and you have to have really really long hairs for them to even make contact with the \\&quot;hotblade\\&quot; which is just a piece of wire that heats up and burns the hair. Picture a wire cheese cutter with a current of electricity running through it to heat it up.  That&#x27;s all this is.     I am so disappointed in this product.     I cant believe the level of deception that&#x27;s being advertised here, it should not be legal to falsify the results of a product as much as is done for the New NONO. I don&#x27;t even want to think about how badly the old NONO worked. It&#x27;s wrong to take advantage of the hopes of people struggling with this very real problem and trick them into buying another pos product.    It doesn&#x27;t even work as well as a 2 dollar razor. Do not waste your money if you have dark coarse hairs that you want to get rid of.     Seriously, Just go get lazer hair removal. 1 treatment costs as much as this set and will actually work.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the NONO and used it according to the product instructions and IT DOES NOT WORK! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I wasn&#x27;t to upset because it had a money back guarantee. Buyer beware! The customer service rep was rude but said that UPS would be at my home in 5-7 days. Two weeks later and nothing so I called back. She had never submitted the request. Here we go again. I requested the pick up... Lets see how long it takes them this time. They will not send you a refund until it gets picked up. If it never gets picked up does that mean I will never get my refund?     The product sucks, the customer service sucks. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money!  If I could give it less than one star I would.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Let me know your experience with the NoNO. Follow me on twitter at @NONOSucks</li>
            <li> I bought No No 880 from Hsn..I thought wow, I don&#x27;t have to tweez my facial hair..Boy was I wrong..I used it like the instructions said ..but I am not getting the results, that the company promise.It does not cyrstalize hair below the surface..The very next day I have stubble..I&#x27;m using it everyday..it is time consuming.It is a shame to say that you are a board certified dermatologist and you endorse this...This only works in my opinion on fine hair on arms..No No can&#x27;t handle my facial hair..why would i use it for under arm hair? The buffer wore out quik..The thermo tips don&#x27;t last...I just had to get a refill pack almost $35. In my opinion stick to shaving or wax strips.</li>
            <li> I too fell for the infomercial.  Thank goodness I read the reviews first.  Thank you everyone for  your comments.  You saved me $$$</li>
            <li> This product is a complete waste of money and time.  I have medium brown fine hair with medium skin tone.  I am considered the optimum candidate.  It was a complete joke! I started with TRIA laser hair removal and had astonishing results in just three weeks.</li>
            <li> Okay, I admit up front that it is not me that is using this No-No product, but the person who I purchased it as a gift for is, or should I say....was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She tells me that it is pretty much a product that burns off the hairs, stinking up the house and leaving her with a lasting burning sensation when she was finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has since gone back to her previous methods of hair control after a trial period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is now packed away in a drawer languishing with a few of the other junk items purchased throughout the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t be at all concerned, had it not been for the fact that it was not an inexpensive item........apparently I bought junk.</li>
            <li> The product is painful to use, the regimen is time demanding, not effective, and creates a stinky burning smell that stays on you even after you wash your skin.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.  I switched to another product, called the Silk&#x27;n Sense Epil.  This was about $500 but honestly has given me amazing results (hair free underarms, legs, and arms!).  The No No, however is no good!</li>
            <li> Seriously don&#x27;t even bother wasting your time with this, the blade burned my skin AND didn&#x27;t even get the hair at all! And its time consuming I would spend a half an hour just doing my calf.   COMPLETE waste!!</li>
            <li> If I would have read the reviews here before I bought the nono, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it, but this is one of those rare times where I&#x27;m actually glad I didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve given the product 4 stars for now since I just used it for the first time today, so we&#x27;ll see how my skin reacts after the treatment before I give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am the first to admit that I&#x27;m a sucker for infomercials, and have bought any and all hair removal systems that have come out in the last 20-25 years. I have to say, this is the FIRST time where they say \\&quot;pain free hair removal\\&quot; where it was actually TRUE! You do have to be really careful around curvy areas, especially your knees, and the tops of your shins, or the little wire might catch on your skin and it will hurt a little, but definitely no where NEAR the pain of an epilator or those so-called \\&quot;pain free\\&quot; sugaring systems!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me about 45-60 minutes to complete both legs. I have light to medium coarse hair on my legs, and while it did not remove all of the hair (you can feel stubble), once you use the buffer pad, it was as smooth as if I had shaved. (BTW, I&#x27;ve tried the buffing system alone, and it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this did, and my legs itched like CRAZY for about a week afterwards!). The after-treatment lotion that came in the kit has kind of a depilatory cream after-smell, and they really don&#x27;t give you much, but I&#x27;m not sure how effective it will be vs. just purchasing some hair reduction lotion at WalMart, or how my skin will react to it...I&#x27;ll update my review after I&#x27;ve used it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have to go over a few areas more than once, and because I have such sensitive skin, I only used the first treatment level. I think the next time I use it, I&#x27;ll try the next level...maybe I won&#x27;t have to go over the same area as much (about 3 or 4 times on 1st level).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, will the hair get thinner and more sparse as time goes on? Probably not...but I have a really tiny stall shower, and this is WAY more convenient for me than trying to shave sitting on the toilet since I can use it while watching TV, etc. The burning hair smell wasn&#x27;t as bad as I expected it to be, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really necessary to use air fresheners, etc. like the manufacturer recommends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually had some laser hair removal to compare this to, and that hurts WAY more than this does! Not only that, but I spent $400 on getting JUST my upper lip done, and after 5 sessions, the hair is still growing back in my biggest areas of concern (corners of upper lip), so what good did that do me? After that experience, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m about to spend another $1500 to get my legs done, only to have to shave anyway...I&#x27;d rather spend $240 in 3 payments to use this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tip status still shows 3 full bars after doing my legs, so not yet sure how long they will last, but I&#x27;ll update this review after I&#x27;ve spent more time with my nono. I usually rely very heavily on the reviews here before I make almost any purchase, and they&#x27;re usually 95% accurate, but not this time. Maybe it just depends on the coarseness of the hair, or maybe people aren&#x27;t using it correctly, but in any case, so far so good and I think I probably won&#x27;t have to keep the box to return it like I expected to.convenient for me than trying to shave sitting on the toilet since I can use it while watching TV, etc. The burning hair smell wasn&#x27;t as bad as I expected it to be, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really necessary to use air fresheners, etc. like the manufacturer recommends.

            <li> I brought this product in hopes of receiving the great benefits they endorse. I reluctantly kept the device longer then the 60 days money back guarantee period (even though the product wasn&#x27;t really producing said results). I figured because I was a Black American and had coarse hair that it would take longer for hair removal. I have use this products with no proven results for over 6 months and it&#x27;s seems that my hair grows back faster and in new places. I do not recommend this product for anyone and believes they should not sale anymore. No No system is a fraud and a waste of money. I feel dooped!</li>
            <li> Heard nothing but amazing things about the no no so i ordered it...come to find out its a hunk of junk just like everything else out there. $200+ down the drain. The little hair that it does take off SMELLS TERRIBLE! Like you lit yourself on fire....i do not recommend it. Keep on keeping on shaving/waxing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the NO!NO! did not work for me. After more than two months of consistent use (5x per week), my hair growth has not diminshed.</li>
            <li> This item did not perform as stated and when I tried to return it I was told that the 30 day return policy starts from the date you \\&quot;ordered it\\&quot; as opposed to the date I \\&quot;receive it\\&quot; and they would NOT take it back.    I am very disappointed in the product and the company! ! !</li>
            <li> Here is my story:  Well back in the spring I purchased the nono.  I used it EVERYWHERE!  My husband HATED it; (it smells your house up of burning hair ...eeeeeeewwwwwww)!!!  I used it, and used it....and used it.  I had the one that came for body with the face attachment (I used on only one side of my face to see if it was really doing anything).  It burned my chin every time I tried to use it there.  The story goes on about my frustration...but I&#x27;ll cut this part short.  I felt like it was not doing anything much (other than pissing off my husband, and consuming my precious time).  So, I called the company and returned it. By the way, they did not give me a hard time with that all...they even paid for the return postage!    Here it is now about three months later, and I&#x27;m riding down the road in the car with my husband.  The sun is shining brightly in the window and I look up into the mirror.  (In the spring when I was using the nono I had only used it on the \\&quot;sideburns\\&quot; on one side of my face, in fear of what would happen if it made the hair grow thicker)...well, I&#x27;m looking in the mirror and notice that the hair on the side of my face that I had used the nono on was the lightest, finest blond.  Why, oh why did I do that?  I could have blond hair on both sides of my face right now....ahhhhhhhh.  Oh well, maybe I&#x27;ll buy again, and only use on my face...but NOT chin...EVER.    So, my recommendation is this:  if you have a problem with your sideburns, but have NO occasional chin hairs that you care about...and it is worth the money to you, to get rid of said sideburns; then go ahead and buy.  But, it will take a lot of patience...and nose plugs.  Oh, also, it really did make my leg hair grow in thinner, but not lighter.  Good luck!  I hope I helped in some way...</li>
            <li> This product is terrible, not only it didn&#x27;t work, the heat wire component burned my skin and I had little scabs all over my legs.  It was painful. Luckily it went away without any lasting damages or scarring after I stop using it.  The company is also awful and incompetent and not in any hurry to honor their own money back warranty (no surprises there).  Save your money.  Don&#x27;t buy this!!</li>
            <li> The item looks used to me. The one I ordered from the site should have been a new item. I asked for a replacement, i was sent a different color one, but I liked the pink one.</li>
            <li> It sucks! I was excited about it &amp; it did nothing but hair came back. I wish i would have look over the reviews then spending money on a product that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I thought it was just me that the No No didn&#x27;t work on. After reading everyone&#x27;s reviews I now feel that well at least I&#x27;m not the only one. I finally felt like I could get rid of the hair on my legs. I have been using it on my lower legs and really I don&#x27;t think there has been any change in the 2 years I have been using it. It takes a long time and I really don&#x27;t have time to do it 2-3 times a week. I am quite hairy and spend most the year in pants because I also have eczema and get in grown hairs a lot. I had hoped that finally I could wear skirts and dresses. Well I can if I spend an hour doing my legs. I wanted to start using it on my 11 year old daughter&#x27;s legs because I thought it was better than shaving. Now I&#x27;m not so sure. I think it might work better on hair that&#x27;s never been shaved. Now after reading some of these reviews I am not so sure if I want to use this on her at all. Anyway - thanks to all those who have taken the time to write a review. I think that I should have saved the money and gone down the laser hair removal path. I might have had more success.</li>
            <li> I received a flyer in large stores catalogue mail outs, and it was for nono hair removal.  I saw that there was a site online for it, so googled it and found no such site.  I searched around and couldn&#x27;t find anything except bad reviews, so guess where that flyer went!  Please read all reviews as this product looks like it certainly doesn&#x27;t work for anyone.</li>
            <li> Before I wanted to spend a fortune on this device, my friend offered me to take hers home with me and try it out.&lt;br /&gt;So I did, I kept it for a few months, but found out very quickly that this does absolutely nothing for me.&lt;br /&gt;Never did I have smooth legs or anything else smooth for that matter. Keep your money in your wallet, these people are laughing all the way to the bank.&lt;br /&gt;For 400 bucks you can probably get a few laser treatments that will get rid of unwanted hair. Good ole fashioned waxing on a regular basis works a hundred times better. The nono is a piece of junk and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it even for 10 bucks. Big thumb down.</li>
            <li> Kind of pissed because I bought this when it was priced at $300.  I read the reviews on the product and wish I had listened to the negative reviews.  To all those who wrote positive reviews on this product, they are very misleading.  I just want to do the right thing and post a real and true review.  I am very experienced in hair removal, and wish I had not bought it.  JUNK!! JUNK!! JUNK!! (even if you do take your time and go slow, use the proper removal pad after you are finished etc. etc.  ) Just a waste of money.  Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product a year or so ago and was extremely displeased with the results. As it turns out, I wasn&#x27;t using the no!no! properly.you really have to move as slowly as you can over an area (without the light turning red of course) and then you have to buff the area REALLY WELL. Thats the key, in my opinion. I have terrible facial hair from PCOS, and the no!no! has removed all of it. It looks just as if I had gotten waxed! I have very thick and coarse hair too, so it does work well for that.I cant speak for permanent hair removal in the long run, but for the time being, I am VERY happy with my impeccably smooth results. Pain free, and easy to use. An absolute godsend for anybody struggling with polycystic ovaries.</li>
            <li> After carefully reading the instructions, I tried the device.  With the initial attempt I received an electric shock.  Needless to say, I did not continue!  I returned the unit to AMAZON -- they e-mailed me when they received it and sent another message that my account had been credited.  The return process could not have been simpler or more efficient -- thank-you!</li>
            <li> I used this product correctly as per manufacturers instructions and for almost two months.  It did not work at all.  I am very disappointed.  Was also unsuccessful at getting my money back despite the 60 day warranty although they were willing to sell me more tips.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this useless expensive junk.</li>
            <li> i bought this online, and all i can say i spent hours using it trying to take off back hair and it does not do crap.</li>
            <li> This is so disappointing! I dont understand howthey are allowed to get away with this. I have had this for six months and it really does absolutely nothing except burn your hairs.  I don&#x27;t have coarse hair and it takes an hour to do both legs. Three times a week for 6 months! And for what? I have to shave every time if I want my legs smooth...and it most definitely does not slow down the growth. Shame on Kassie DePaiva for endorsing this product. what a complete rip off. How do the people that make this sleep at night?</li>
            <li> Ordered and received a Nono with no model number in any of the literature. Looking for a model 8800. What we got is apparently a &amp;#34;knockoff&amp;#34;, or an outdated model that is not suitable for use for facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Liked the product when I first got it.  the burning hair didn&#x27;t bother me.  After a while it didn&#x27;t preform like it did at first.  Should I have to replace the cutting units?  I like this concept as I can not reach all of the parts of my legs.  If I have to reorder the blades please let me know how and where I can do this.  Mine looks larger than the ones on TV, they are free from cords.  Aren&#x27;t these units made the same?  Mine also did not come with a travel case nor the creme that you advertise.  Aren&#x27;t they all made the same?</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me.  I have coarse hair and the product does not remove to the root.  It is also very time consuming, expensive, and irritating.  I&#x27;d rather just keep shaving.</li>
            <li> If any of you ladies out there are buying this item for facial hair, don&#x27;t do it! The first warning on instructions is &amp;#34;don&#x27;t use on face!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002LBK5RO No!no! Hair Removal Unit, Black]]I bought this after deliberating for sometime over the price and if it would work. i watched the company promotional video and when ahead. what a costly mistake, it simply does not work. I thought at first that it may have been me so i persevered with it past the 60 day return. However, despite the smell of burning hair it never, as claimed burnt the root and in turn the follicle. It now sits in the back of the cabinet. my advice, do not buy it it is utter rubbish and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> What woman can&#x27;t be caught by the commercial, even though the first red flag is that on the one I taped, no price was given.  Thks to the internet and your posts, I won&#x27;t buy.  I would assume that the few \\&quot;good\\&quot; reviews are plants by the company.</li>
            <li> I can see I&#x27;m not alone in not being impressed with this product.  I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if their claims of good reviews are all garbage.  You have to jump through so many hoops to send it back, and I&#x27;m not confident I&#x27;ll ever see my money back from it.  The box was incredibly damaged upon receiving it, and the instructions are vague and not at all what the product is advertised as.  I&#x27;ve never had to deal with such a ridiculous purchase/refund before, even taking into consideration the average person selling on ebay or amazon.  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS!!!</li>
            <li> does not remove hair as shown on commercials.  The pink unit is specifically for the body area from the neck down and I was more interested in facial hair removal.  The life of the razors are not very long.</li>
            <li> I bought the no!no! because I thought it would be a good alternative to laser or waxing.  I thought it was a handheld laser-type device.  I was wrong.  (I have since returned it.)  What the no!no! is, is a handheld hair burning (or singeing) device.  It uses a heated/electrified wire to burn the hair off, above the skin.  Nothing happens below the skin to the hair root.  (If the hair root is unaffected, you will still have hair growth.)  Enter the buffing pad (essentially this is extremely fine sandpaper).  The instructions say that you MUST use the buffing pad every time you use the no!no!.  The reason for this is because the buffing pad is actually what removes the hair, exfoliates your skin and discourages hair growth in the future.  Example:  consider an overweight person who constantly wears tight jeans that rub on certain parts of the legs.  The hair will not continue to grow on the back of the calves, for instance, because the jeans rub everyday on that part of the skin and the constant rubbing/buffing removes the hair and discourages future hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy hair removal products that are essentially sand paper for just a few dollars at a number of retailers.  In my opinion, the makers of no!no! are simply price-gouging customers (and wasting their time by burning the hair first) in order to sell buffing pads.  Save your money and your time, don&#x27;t buy the no!no!</li>
            <li> This is the best product for your mother in law.&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure that they don&#x27;t use it in your house, or you will smell the stinch of burning hair all over.&lt;br /&gt;I think this device was made in the CIA laboratories for torturing the terrorists.</li>
            <li> This product does not remove hair.  It is a disgraceful money-stealing scam and should be legally challenged in all countries.  Consumer organisations should have the ads removed from television and media.</li>
            <li> Like most people looking for the golden system for home hair removal, I ordered the No No.  It turned out to be a complete waste of my time and money.  The No NO burned my lip and other areas to the point that I had burn marks.  I will remain with waxing and if laser comes down in price, I&#x27;ll elect that procedure.  But No No is what it says it is, a big no no as far a eliminating body hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically write reviews but after using this product for about 6 months, I find it rather useless. There MAY be a very slight improvement in the hair thickness - not as thick - but it&#x27;s not worth the time spent on performing the procedure. I find it useless on leg/bikini hair, and somewhat effective on arm hair. Doesn&#x27;t really decrease anything, just a painless way to remove some hair, not even all of it.</li>
            <li> I have tried the NONO hair removal system for three months. I am very disappointed as it simply did not remove hair.  Other problems  were: the instruction disk could not be read on my Mac computer. ( I was able to go online and view their instruction video.) I was told there was a 60 days free trial but when  I received the product, it was only 30 days. When I complained about the product , I was told to be patient-so I continued for three months. It simply did not remove hair. I faithfully used the buffer. cream and additional \\&quot;heads\\&quot; I also bought with the product. To make matters worse, somehow I ended up with an auto reorder for supplies which I will never use. Their customer service rep was very courteous and cancelled this for me. I have returned to shaving my legs and am loving the difference.</li>
            <li> I love the reviews here, it has helped me prevent being cheated.  The reviews for this product are terrible.  I am so glad to be able to read before trying this.  It is horribly expensive as well.  Thanks</li>
            <li> If it sounds to good to be true... then it probably is a scam. I should have known better, but the infomercial was quite convincing.    People, this is an overpriced piece of junk. Sure, it removes hair, but so does a disposable razor or a Norelco. You must purchase new replacement solutions and buffing pads regularly. The gizmo burns hair off and makes a horrible smell that lingers in carpet, upholstery and curtains (no good!). And, the &#x27;exercises&#x27; you have to go through after using the device... just to remove the \\&quot;crystallized\\&quot; hair particles is annoying.    This \\&quot;miracle from the Twilight Zone\\&quot; sells for as much as 200 bucks on the net too.  Looks cheaply made.    If this item really did all it was supposed to do..... you could buy it in Walgreens or Walmart right! Magic pipe dream wonder products usually end up on TV infomercials..... This little product ranks right up there with the Pet Rock, \\&quot;boil in the bag lettuce\\&quot; and the elastic tape measure.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give the NO NO a try due to the 60 day money back. I was not happy with the out come didn&#x27;t work for me and my problem. I am rating it a four star because they did stand behind their product and did give me a refund. It is not a 5 star because I had to make several calls and do some serious convincing that the product was not for me before they refunded me my money and due to the fact that it did not help my situation . Good luck on your adventure. I am going to stick to lazer treatments, I get the results that I am looking for with that.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking I could use it on my face.  After I open the package then I find the instructions inside that say specifically DO NOT use on your face and other body parts.  and it also says that you can not return this product after it has been opened!  So I am screwed out of $200.  I tried on my legs and it left a rough stubbly feeling.  The advertisements and commercials are very deceiving as are most things like this.  Unfortunately, I learned the hard way.  I hope this will save someone some money!</li>
            <li> This product is a complete waste of money and time. I was doing my self-treatments per instructions for two months and did not notice any signs of reduced hair growth or reduced hair thickness. I stopped using this product altogehter when I developed a rash on both sides of my face in the sideburn area, which is like a ton of tiny pimples. The rash seems to have spread into my scalp a little bit. I have not gone to see a doctor but plan to and have to say I feel embarrasment admiting to my doctor that this rash is self-induced. This is yet another lesson learned that there are no miracle products for hair removal or weight loss. I did use laser hair removal before trying this crappy product and did achieve lasting results with laser. I thought I would save some money by trying this product, but all I have done is create a medical problem and delay my hair reduction progress by stopping my laser treatments. Back to laser I go and good riddence to no no. I returned the product this week and will track to ensure I recieve a full refund. Ladies, do yourself a favor and just say \\&quot;no no\\&quot; to No!no!</li>
            <li> I have really dark hair, and I bought this product to remove it from my arms.  Over a period of a few months it reduced the amount, and what grew back is a lot finer.  I&#x27;m pleased with the results, but I gave the product 4 stars because I had to reorder extra blades. The ones I used seemed to become less effective over time. Also, the device doesn&#x27;t work as well on coarser leg hair.</li>
            <li> TV and google reviews make this sound like the greatest thing since sliced bread. They should rename this item NO NO dont buy! A waste of hard earned money. I so wanted this item to work, back to the trusty old razor for me :(</li>
            <li> thank you ,the customers i reviewed was very un satisfied if it sounds to good to be true it usually is i will save my money</li>
            <li> i bought this a couple of weeks ago, and have been using it ever since. the product does not work as its brand claims. it will not inhibit hair growth. it claims the hair won&#x27;t get thicker, which is also a lie. I cannot express how unsatisfacted i am with this expensive product. Even after watching the tutorial, it did not work as it said it would. if anything, shaving will be as effective than this product, because it works the same way.</li>
            <li> Hope this review can help shed some light for those who are considering in purchasing a no-no. I&#x27;m sure many people are skeptical about the no-no due to the large number of negative reviews, including this one. I wanted to purchase a no-no, but I had several questions (or concerns) that I wanted answers to first before dropping $270.00. I visited their website and filled out the contact form with a barrage of questions...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s are some of the questions I asked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;1. Not really a questions, but I wanted their response or statement to the numerous complaints about the no-no breaking within weeks or a few months. (Is it strategically designed to &#x27;conveniently&#x27; malfunction after the 60-day guarantee expires??)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Is it true that certain models have a higher rate of failure?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Why such a limited warranty? $270.00 is not cheap. If it breaks after the 60-days guarantee, am I left with a $270.00 paperweight?  What will the company do to help its customers?&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One week later and still no reply.  So, taking matters into my own hand, I called their 888 customer service number. I didn&#x27;t catch his name, but his extension# is 39. He didn&#x27;t have clear or concise answers for any of my questions.  Or maybe, he was not allowed to answer them... His answers read like a script.  He tried to dodge the 3rd questions above, because if he had answered, it would have painted a negative picture of their company. He abruptly cut me off and said, \\&quot;thanks for calling, have a good day,\\&quot; and hung up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are more details of the conversation between me and the customer service rep.  In follow-up to the questions above:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;1. He says he has no knowledge of any negative consumer reviews of no-no. (Surprise surprise, right?) According to him, all negative reviewers had unrealistic expectations of the no-no because they didn&#x27;t see immediate results after the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well...that was not my concern at all. I KNOW patience is required to see results. Actually, I believe it will do what it&#x27;s advertised to do.  My concern is the large number of defective no-no&#x27;s being returned or replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As for the 60-days guarantee? He did offer some clarification on this. Yes, there is a 60-days guarantee where you can try no-no for free, and if you don&#x27;t like it, you can send it back, no questions asked. If you purchase the no-no after the 60-days guarantee is over, they now have EXTENDED the warranty to **2 YEARS**. If you get a replacement for a defective device, it does NOT reset the warranty clock. (Although, I&#x27;ve seen a couple of reviews where they&#x27;ve been able to get their warranty got extended because of multiple defective devices and replacements.) I brought this up to the customer service rep, and he says they don&#x27;t do this...so just be aware...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. So, do some models break more than others? One reviewer called customer service for a 3rd no-no replacement. The representative suggested to her to get the black no-no (no-no for men) as those rarely got returned. (hmm...so...is this an indication that there *is* an issue of defective no-no&#x27;s being returned...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I shared this reviewer&#x27;s experience with the representative I was speaking to, and he doesn&#x27;t basically called this reviewer a LIAR. Representatives will not divulge that kind of information. Sure. As for the no-no for men and no-no for women, he said the only difference between the two are the colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Limited warranty... the rep completely went off on a tangent when I brought up this subject. He started reading a script and tried to get me to jump aboard and take advantage of their special promotion...\\&quot;get 1 no-no today, get a second no-no for only $199.99...\\&quot; W-O-W. Ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I kept pressing my questions/concerns about AFTER the 2-year warranty. Customers can get as manyreplacements as needed during the 2-year warranty period, but if they keep receiving defective device that break in a matter of weeks/months, what happens then? Are we just SOL? The representative turned into a broken record and kept going back to case scenarios within 2-year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;My final question to him: \\&quot;If you (the customer service representative) review an account history of a customer, and you see that they have gone through multiple no-no replacements over a 2-year period (let&#x27;s say 5...and that&#x27;s being generous), you would really offer no assistance to the customer once their 2-year warranty expires?\\&quot; He didn&#x27;t reply yes or no, only that they cannot replace no-no&#x27;s after the 2-years are up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Last thing I said to him before he hung up on me: It&#x27;s not that customers give up on your product, it&#x27;s your company that&#x27;s giving up on your customers.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer loyalty?  Doesn&#x27;t exist here.  They don&#x27;t care. They&#x27;ll leave you high and dry...with a $270.00 paperweight...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This doesn&#x27;t feel right at all to me. I&#x27;ve concluded that Radiancy does not fully stand behind the quality of their products. They know it will break over time. In fact, the representative (Mr. Extension #39)  mentioned that there are logged \\&quot;batches\\&quot; of no-no&#x27;s that are known to be defective. Something else to be aware of.  WILL YOU BE ONE OF THE UNLUCKY ONES?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure, given time and patience, no-no will do what is promised in their advertisement. However, it&#x27;s not worth the money, time, and frustration.  Don&#x27;t invest in something that has a track record of breaking over short amount of time. How many replacements will you put up with before calling it quits? Ask yourself these questions before you decide to buy. Think it over...seriously.</li>
            <li> Time and money wasted aside.... the people selling this product area bunch of liars... not only does it take forever to see a difference but it takes forever to complete the process. And trust me when I say you will never see your money again. I sent back this useless product within the time limit along with the extra blades, extra bottles of cream and buffers they sent and charged me for.. which I never ordered.... that was three months ago and still no refund.. You really don&#x27;t want this product its dangerous on your sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t even do what you wanted it to do in the first place. Nono is a big NONO</li>
            <li> I thought I was in an alternate universe.  WHen I first went online to see reviews of the NONO hair removal system, I found only positive endorsements.  This is a joke!  I have been using it 3 x wkly for the past 3 months on two sides of my chin.  I think it took off about 6 hairs.  I am now at the point where nothing is affected except my skin.  I even see smoke coming out of the usage, and still no hair will budge.  I have gone over this one fine hair  1000 times!!!!!!  I am not lying.  90 x a week for the past   12 weeks.  It&#x27;s such a scam and so demoralizing, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything out there that will get rid of this embarrassment.    DON&#x27;T BUY NO NO.  NONONONONONONO!!!</li>
            <li> I tried to charge and use but could never.  I was 7 days too late to get a refund!  The company kept my $269!  And they also have the nonohair removal system which was probably not worth more than $50! And that is too high!  I would never ever tell anyone to shop this company if they have no problem stealing my $269!!!!    Thieves own and run this co.  I have always been able to get a refund from legitimate  businesses!!  Do not buy!  one star is too high a rating!</li>
            <li> IT DOES NOT WORK...DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY! I bought it off the no no site so of course you can&#x27;t review it there no matter how hard you try. I wrote to them twice and they told me to do exactly what I was doing which wasn&#x27;t working and when I asked about returning it even though they gave me 60 days, they insisted 45.Also writing to them and expecting an answer right away is out of the question. I think they know how long you have it and make you squirm before answering you and then you have to call and talk with customer service so they can give you permission to return it and you know how that goes...try it a little longer, you need new heads, etc. I&#x27;ve used it primarily on my face exactly as the instructions stated so the heads and face sander is still new and don&#x27;t need to be replaced, it works the same as when I took it out of the box, it doesn&#x27;t! It will remove peach fuzz and I&#x27;m afraid as to what that will return looking like.That peach fuzz wasn&#x27;t my problem..it was those few stubborn ones above my lip and around my chin. I still continue to use it as it cost me almost $300 and I&#x27;m praying for some kind of miracle and  positive results. My face hair has grown back in  white and extremely coarse and under no circumstances can I even get a pair of tweezers to grasp them for removal, they recommend shaving them off, remember your mother telling you not to shave your legs because the hair would return threefold and I followed their advice. My entire chin is now covered with hair which I did not have before. They don&#x27;t want you to tweeze them off, but my face looks like a badly plucked chicken with half the feathers left in. I have burned my face and scratched it to the point that extra makeup didn&#x27;t even cover the marks and I still had those hairs sticking out all over. My 3 year old grand daughter doesn&#x27;t want me kissing her because I scratch her! DON&#x27;T BE TAKEN IN, DON&#x27;T BUY IT...IT&#x27;S WORTH GOING TO HAVE THE LASER REMOVAL WHICH IS ABOUT $500 AND SO MUCH LESS HASSLE! For the amount of time I&#x27;ve devoted to this thing I could have had most of it removed, now I have so much more to remove.</li>
            <li> Waste Waste Waste of my money and time.  It was even on Dr. Oz, apparently he hasn&#x27;t read the reviews either!  This was a very expensive lesson!  Don&#x27;t purchase this under any circumstances!  This many people cannot be lying!</li>
            <li> Honestly it is waste of money................customer service is horrible, u have horrible reactions like increased growth of ur hair, skin pigmentation etc etc.donot use it[[ASIN:B002LBK5QU No!no! Hair Removal Unit, Pink]]</li>
            <li> The NoNo commercials are very convincing and I thought it would be a good investment.  So, I saved up and bought myself the NoNo.  BIG MISTAKE!!!  Almost no hair removal after a week straight of use!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions tell you to go over a small area 3-4 times and if the area needs more treatment after that to come back to it later after your skin has had time to \\&quot;rest\\&quot;.  After my first session, I figured out it takes an eternity to do just your legs.  So, I decided to just test the NoNo out on my right leg from the knee down.  I worked on it every night for a week, sometimes making as many as 30 passes in one area (with the required rest time in between).  After each session there was very little change in the amount of stubble on my legs, but I stuck with it because it does say that results could take time.  I just expected there to be SOME hair removal each time, and there wasn&#x27;t.  I did notice that some of the hair appeared thinner or shorter, but no hair appeared to have been removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not reccomend this product.  In fact i ANTI-reccomend it.  IF you have fine, light hair, this product might be useful to you.  If not, FORGET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am returning it tonight, but I hear the return process is a huge nightmare.  Wish me luck.</li>
            <li> I got tired of having to shave every day, so I ordered this product hoping I could at least decrease how often I had to shave.  Not even close!  I&#x27;m currently waiting for the postage-paid sticker to arrive so I can send this nightmare back.  The ad says, \\&quot;If you never want to shave again....\\&quot; The reality is, and even the product states when it arrives, you&#x27;ll have to keep using this product for weeks, at least 3 times a week, PLUS shaving to achieve the possibility of no shaving.  Ad claims that hair stays away for weeks - not true.  Like shaving, it returns within a couple of days.  And the smell of burning hair is nauseating!  All it does is create a nasty odour without the promised permanent removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ridiculously expensive for the end result of nothing.  Almost $400 by the time the smoke cleared.  I chose to pay the whole thing at once, but now I regret it!  I&#x27;m hoping the company will honour their promises to completely refund what I paid for this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T SWALLOW THE CLAIMS AND DON&#x27;T BUY THE PRODUCT!  Complete rip-off!</li>
            <li> The NO!NO! commercials are definitely a scam.  It does not work, and the company has NO NO intention of honoring the moneyback garantee.  Talking to customer service is useless.  They want to walk thru the proper way to use: NO!NO!, buff, then shave.  Repeat this process at least three to four times in one session, and after three months or more&lt;br /&gt;the hair will begin to thin. NOT WHAT THE COMMERCIAL said. They would not return my money, and stated that I had paid the thing off. Yet, my credit card was billed again this month.  Not a reputable company, and I would not advise anybody to waste their money on this product.</li>
            <li> I saw this on one of the shopping channels (like that&#x27;s not bad enough) and fell for it. It was expensive but, when you compare it to other permanent hair removal it&#x27;s cheap. I liked the idea of 60 days to return it but, here&#x27;s the thing: it doesn&#x27;t work unless the hair is long enough. So, you go days growing it and looking fuzzy, you use it and the cycle begins again. There is never less hair. It&#x27;s like the most stupid way of shaving. So, you don&#x27;t really know it&#x27;s not working until way after 60 days. keep your $. In fact, if your heart is set on it, I&#x27;ll sell mine for $50.[[ASIN:B00383I8T6 No!no! 8800 Series Hair Removal Device - Pink]]</li>
            <li> I have used many many hair removal products, and aside fron tria laser this one NONO&lt;br /&gt;Works best. Tria only works on dark hair and light skin, but no no works on any hair any skin type.&lt;br /&gt;The trick to this is to buff after using. I had course hair and when I first used the nono&lt;br /&gt;I was disapointed, because the hair was still there after I treated it. After I realized&lt;br /&gt;I needed to buff (which is included) The hair was gone and skin was smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I almost cancelled my order because of the reviews I read. I am glad I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the hair thickness changed over time yet, because I just got it and used it 4 times. I will write more as time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, and I would recommend it for anyone who wants to remove hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Thought I was getting same product as advertized on TV.  NOT.  This product had to be plugged in, so your using options were limited.  Proiduct arrived in excellent and timely manner.  I am a natural blonde, so my skin and hair are too ligjt for it to work.</li>
            <li> Hi, I think there&#x27;s a confusion that could be (at least partialy) responsible for the complaints.    Here what I read on  a web site : [..]    The No No Classic Versus The No No 8800 Series  When the first version of the No No Classic was released a while back, not many people were impressed. Most feedback showed that the device was only half effective in eliminating hair growth plus you couldn&#x27;t use it on the face.    However, Radiancy quickly released a new and vastly improved version called the No No 8800 series. This updated version is COMPLETELY PAINLESS to use and has a much higher percentage of success than the old model.    I did not try it yet, but I still want to.</li>
            <li> This is by FAR the biggest waste of money known to mankind. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I have made!</li>
            <li> I not only gave this thing a fair shake...I returned the first one just be be sure it wasn&#x27;t just a defective unit. THIS THING IS CRAP!!!!!</li>
            <li> I wish I had read these reviews first.  What a waste of money!  It doesn&#x27;t work, and I burned my face. I&#x27;ve seen several reviews that mention it&#x27;s not supposed to be used above the neck.  Interesting..., because when I bought mine, it was being advertised for the face.  In any case, I don&#x27;t use mine anymore.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this.  It&#x27;s total garbage.</li>
            <li> i bought a no no back in january and have been using it as instructed. I bought it as a 60 day trial. In my mind, 60 day trial means use it for 60 days, if it doesnt work, return it. To NO NO Radiancy it means, use it for 45 days and return it before 60 days, or you are stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO NO does NOT work for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when i called to return 65 days after purchasing it, i was told it DOES work and i just have to keep using it, but i already used it 5 days over the limit of when i can return it if i dont see any results.  So now im stuck with this $300 product that is ineffective. Super.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone who doesnt have blonde fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acutally, i would NOT recommend this product to ANYONE. Customer service is a joke.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have read these reviews before I purchased it. This is a piece of crap and did not remove one piece of hair. Instead I have a very burnt face. Customer service was horrible and they do not pay for shipping to return. They want you to continue to use a product that is useless. Please do not waste your money on this mess.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy the no no but I always read reviews before I buy. So glad I did save my money thanks people for taking time.to write reviews</li>
            <li> This product does not work at all. Very disappointed, especially since its so expensive. I tried using both the different blades that came with it and it only trimmed the top of the hair, it did not remove them as indicated.</li>
            <li> First of all I am a guy, I have had the black and silver No! No! for 11 months, for the first 6 months I did it twice a week as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the last 5 months I did it everyday.  In both periods of time all I got used too was the burning smell of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t work at all as directed it&#x27;s JUNK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could have given this NEGATIVE stars it would have been a Negative 10 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend a few more dollars and get a RIO Laser those work.</li>
            <li> This product is awful! It DOES cause sharp burning pain and doesn&#x27;t remove any hair!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t waste your money!! I bought it through Groupon/Chemist 4 u and both these companies are also awful, refusing to refund! I have tried contacting no! no! and had no response. Awful awful waste of money!!</li>
            <li> This product does not do what it says it will do.  Don&#x27;t buy the item.  I am very disappointed and now getting help with the return.  Item is disappointing  but Amazon is helping out.  Will let you know outcome with my return.</li>
            <li> When I bought this product, based on the advertising, I was expecting to use it on my face.  Imagine my surprise when it specifically prohibits that, but a newer more expensive version is what I need. I see 60 day return promises all over the advertising, but when I go to return it, I see I am past a 30 day window for a full refund.  I am not happy.  I may decide to keep it to use on my legs, but I am satisfied with shaving my legs and the heat this unit puts out is uncomfortable.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  Sorry I didn&#x27;t check online reviews before I bought it.  Buyer beware.  I wish I would have bought it through the manufacturer, because then I could get a full refund. (supposedly)</li>
            <li> The No No does not do as it claims. I have had mine for 9 months or more and the hair is as it was when I started. The hair does not grow slower and/or thinner as they say. On my face, it really does not work. If my face was flat it would work. The hair on my legs is apparently to coarse for the no no, it takes FOREVER to do just the bottom of one leg ! UGH Really !?! My buffer that came with the kit actually came apart after the 3rd use. And didn&#x27;t really last all that long any way. The \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; that comes with it is so full of perfume its unwearable. It made my skin red and sting. Lubriderm is the best, unscented for dry skin. So I basically use it for my arms and on a couple hairs on my neck. Now for the replacement thermi whatever tips. They are a bit pricey. But it&#x27;s the shipping that kills me ! 15.00 for shipping ! When it&#x27;s all said and done that&#x27;s 44.00 for 3 tips and a buffer !!!  I know for a fact that stuff will fit in a one price 4.95 box from the post office. I am willing to wait an extra day or two to get it. SOOOOOO, if you REALLY want one. I will sell you mine for $100.00 shipping 4.95 !</li>
            <li> Read the reviews. The consensus is that this product DOES NOT WORK, doesn&#x27;t work as advertised, is cheaply constructed, shoddy, unreliable. Basically it&#x27;s a \\&quot;hair burner\\&quot; -- which will suppress the re-growth of hair follicles, but it also burns skin. Not safe, evidently, to use on the face, and so that&#x27;s a No No for the \\&quot;full Brazilian\\&quot; treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve been looking too at the TriaLazer system. That&#x27;s a no go for me because I have light colored hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting really adept at shaving, make it a time to relax and indulge.</li>
            <li> I could not let this go any longer. I had to review this product. This is undoubtedly the worst product I have ever wasted money on. Not just some money but this thing is fairly expensive. It simply does not work...at all! I received one, used it, thought that it might be defective. So I bought another one. It didn&#x27;t work either - that one I returned. It was too late to return the first one. I kept using it thinking it might work. I thought that perhaps the negative reviews were from people who may not be using it correctly - perhaps I wasn&#x27;t using it correctly. Note the negative reviews vs the positive ones and don&#x27;t waste your money like I did. Just a hunk of junk wrapped in a totally bogus informercial. What a waste.</li>
            <li> If I can give this product no star, I would.  It&#x27;s a TRAP!  They tried to trick you to get this for 60 days and once you passed 60 days, there&#x27;s another $15 fee for returning it!  Yeah, that&#x27;s how they tricked us.  And the stupid lady (Kelly) told me that I have to keep paying this piece of shit, if not, they&#x27;re going to send me to collector agency!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE! DON&#x27;T BUY IT!</li>
            <li> After my No No hair system broke,the fly wheel (band) popped out I contacted the customer service via email,to ask them if it could be repaired or had to be replaced, the reply surprised me as I was expecting a list of recommended companies for fixing the fault or a simple it can not be repaired. Instead they replied to my husband (obviously they had not taken the time to read to the end as i clearly stated my name)and informed that I should direct my query to their 0844 ect ect number if I required an answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed them back advising that this is a premium number and it would cost a considerable amount of money to do so, I also advised that they had replied to my husband when the email was clearly from me. the reply received back from them was again surprising they said \\&quot;we can not find you on our data base so you Must call the 0844 number\\&quot;. I only wanted to know where to get it fixed or if it could be fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very poor customer services to direct people to a premium numbers - My final email to them was to advise that the system was bought for me as a present from family members so this will be why I do not show on there data base. the system worked well before it broke but I do feel that this may be a product fault the system has and many more people will find that their No No&#x27;s do not last as long as anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I therefore believe that training is required for the customer services unless the company policy or vision is to direct all customers to the premium number for some sort of gain.</li>
            <li> This is perhaps the biggest scam in print, on TV, and on the internet. This product does nothing that is advertised. Beware!</li>
            <li> OK, I got sucked in by an off-hours TV ad.  That alone should have alerted me to this SCAM.  But I had heard about this product before and that fact that it also appeared in one of those \\&quot;paid programs\\&quot; seemed co-incidental.  Yeah... well, I was half asleep, after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I didn&#x27;t rush to the phone.  Instead, I waited until morning and went to the internet.  In large bold letter, they advertised the online price as only $89 plus $15 shipping.  Not bad... I can handle that.  But there was a lot of fine print, in light gray on the white background, that only appeared when it came time to charge my credit card.  It was hard to read, but well worth the effort: I was giving them permission to charge my card 3 times!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this was looking even more like a scam... but with a money back guarantee, so I could try it out.  If it worked, it was still worth it, so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it didn&#x27;t work.  I had steaks of burned skin with a hairy stubble wherever I tried to use it.  The \\&quot;revolutionary technology\\&quot; is a hot wire that is supposed to burn the hair away, powered by a rechargable battery.  Uhuh.  That sure doesn&#x27;t cost $300 to produce.  And it sure doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather belatedly, I checked other internet sites.  Some gave it rave reviews.  Some were online \\&quot;newspapers\\&quot; reporting new technology.  ALL SCAMS.  I feel foolish for ignoring my gut feelings to begin with and not doing the research ahead of time.  This product is pure SCAM, falsely advertised, with lots of web sites that the manufacturer has created to legitimize their product. THOSE POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE PROBABLY ALL LIES created by the manufacturer, just like their phoney web sites!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT be so foolish youself.  This a a piece of plastic junk.</li>
            <li> Yes indeed it works but it takes a while to learn to use and to get used to I already need more tips but I can say I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I bought this product knowing that it wouldn&#x27;t work. I got one for every person that I hate and just sat back and waited for the complaints. Like I said, it worked like a charm. My ex-wife called me and told me that she burnt the inner part of her thigh. Her boyfriend asked her if she had been hiding her meth pipe from the cops. I just laughed and laughed. My cousin said that even though it says not to use it on her upper lip, she did it anyway. Now she&#x27;s walking around like she fell asleep with a burning pack of cigarettes in her mouth. My email and phone have been blowing up and it&#x27;s only one day after Christmas! Again, I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s probably the best gag gift I have seen!</li>
            <li> This is only for people with very dark, thick hair I presume. I have light hairs, and elder facial hairs, and it doesn&#x27;t really work on the face. I should have known, because the laser hair removal at the spa does not work for light or graying hair, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine broke 3 months in. The company quickly replaced it, and since it would not be under warranty, I bought another 3 year warranty for $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not the person for whom this was meant, because laser is said to pick up the dark color. I still have to use depilatory on my face, and am only using the No No for my leg hairs. If I had thick masses of dark body hair, it might be ok, albeit I would probably get the laser hair treatment at the spa and touch it up with the No No.</li>
            <li> I bought it after seeing a commercial for it.  They were using it on their faces.  Of course, when you get it, it warns several times that you shouldn&#x27;t use it on your face.  That was the major point.  I haven&#x27;t gotten past the point that you are using it three or four times a week to say whether its really worth it or not.  It also makes this smell, which I showered afterwards so it shouldn&#x27;t have been a big deal, but I could smell that smell off and on the first time I used it.  I&#x27;m not sure I can recommend it.  Its small and the instructions are easy to follow.  It is a little difficult to get a constant green light over knees and ankles.  I go over and over the same area.  Its definitely faster to use a razor, but eventually I shouldn&#x27;t need to be using it as often.  Who knows how long that will take though.</li>
            <li> Thank you, to everyone who wrote about their experience with NoNo.  That many people can&#x27;t be wrong.  When there are a small handful of positive reviews to hundreds of negative ones, it wouldn&#x27;t be very wise on my part to buy it anyway. It&#x27;s shameful these type companies make a fortune selling products that don&#x27;t hold true to their claims.  This is why I find reviews to be important and very helpful.  In this case, it kept me from spending money that would have only been wasted.  Thanks again.</li>
            <li> No No gets so many bad reviews.  I have to tell you not to quit too soon.  Your hair grows in cycles and you need to keep at it but you will see results.  Naturally you will smell the burning of hair.  It is not a laser, it is heat and burns (crystalizes) the hair.  I blow out the tip after each use.  If the bars go down on the display, clean the tips and if that doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s time to change them.  You won&#x27;t be hair free after one use or even one week.  Just keep using it and you&#x27;ll notice spots that are not coming back.</li>
            <li> I got this a few weeks ago and didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it till just a couple days ago.    At first I thought it was defective.  No lights come on or anything when plugged in.  Lights don&#x27;t come on until you actually press NO!no! to your skin.      The ladies at the Reno Sephora, at the Summit mall, were very helpful when I visited the store and asked for assistance with the product.    Finally got to use it!  Very easy.  No pain.  Although it did produce a strong burned hair odor.      Would be really great if a future model was chargeable and did not need to be plugged in while it is being used.    Thanks,  Sandy</li>
            <li> Product useless! Company will harass you once they have your credit card and falsely charge more money! Do not buy product!Nono is a low grade product that sells very expensively only because the company decided it so! During my ordered of the product, I was asked to give my payment information only after I was told what the product cost (does not worth the price). When I refused and ask not to charge my credit card, the company representative refused and hung up on me. The product was force (mailed) upon me. Having tried to return the product with no luck, they had a collection agency contact me for an additional charge that I allegedly owe. Run my friend, please, do not do business with this (nono) company! You know what I mean, no no! is a no good!...  Correct!...the company is a no no \\&quot;good for nothing\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> Amazon should allow for a \\&quot;No Stars\\&quot; option.  I had to click on at least one star in order for   Amazon to allow me to give the review.  I don&#x27;t think this product should be sold period.  It&#x27;s a waste of consumers money and precious time.  I just hope I can get my money refunded.  I  took it out of the box and charged it as instructed.  Once charged I followed the instructions for use.  I tried it for about 5 minutes on a small area on my leg.  I didn&#x27;t see anything happening to the hair.  When I looked closely at the  attachment I noticed that  the little flimsy wire was broken. It arrived broken it seems.  So I looked at the smaller attachment, the wire was fine.  I tried using this to remove hair and it broke with in seconds.  I called the company and they claim that it shouldn&#x27;t have broken   so soon. They will send me another.   My opinion so far is that this is a very poorly made product.  Not worth the time I&#x27;ve wasted already.</li>
            <li> I ordered this without checking price.  not from amazon either.  oops!       So HERE IS HOW IT WORKS:  not that well. It has so far removed only facial skin...I must have a later model as it has no warning about face.  I have expperimeented with other areas with some limited results  (note  you have to shave first......)    I am 50 aand getting that white fuzz on my  face...it workss foor that but has trouble getting through my chin hairs.  If I can stretch my skin out right it does ok with my upper lip.   If I could get my money back I would, but it is longer lasting and less thick when it grows back....  too bad no eyebrow functioning.    Did nothing for my legs which have REALLY THIN INVISIBLE HAIR,   so beware!      unless you have largge areas of thin haair or fuzz   save yr money!  it is worth about 30 to 50 bucks at most in my view.</li>
            <li> I can identify with all of you who have tried multiple means of hair removal and had hopes for the NoNo.  You&#x27;ve saved me time, effort, frustration and money as I will not be purchasing one.  When I was browsing the various sites for the NoNo hair removal products, I noted that most of them were associated with the company.  That big, red flag sent me searching for reviews and boy, did I find them.  Thanks everyone!</li>
            <li> I saw this item on the HSN network the other night and was so excited to see them selling it because I was under the impression they sold good products so I almost purchased what I thought would be the holy grail of hair removal.  Less eager to part with so much money I decided to check the reviews expecting to see accolades.  I&#x27;m sorry for those having so much trouble getting their money back, and those actually injured, but thank you all so much for reviewing this product...I have avoided being burned, in more ways than one it seems.</li>
            <li> Interesting that there are no good reviews on this item.  And understandably so.... what a piece of junk!  It doesn&#x27;t do anything its advertised to do, and was expensive to boot!  I could kick myself for wasting my time and money!</li>
            <li> I record Dr Oz while at work and catch up when am able. Last night I watched the program he had talking about the no no, had a woman on who was singing the praises of this system and Dr Oz tried it on his arm too. Removed hair with \\&quot;some smell of burning hair\\&quot; but all in all the product sounded so good I was serious about buying in even though 200.00 seemed like alot of money but for hair to not grow back would be alot cheaper then lazer. I never buy anything until I check out reviews and boy am I glad I did!!!    Am sorry those of you who bought this lousy product had to waste your money, but sure thank you for helping others like me keep from doing the same!! Its amazing how many people will do and believe anything Dr Oz says or products he has on his programs, this product is worthless and for him to have it on his program is like he is endorsing it to do what it says which is very misleading. Hopefully this was just a judgement error.....</li>
            <li> I bought this product through their web site.  What a joke.  It does nothing except burn your surface hair.  Sorry, but it&#x27;s another deal where they sing its praises, rake in the money...and laugh all the way to the bank.</li>
            <li> I just NOW saw all these horrible reviews. And I JUST bought the NONO last week. It should be delivered at my house by this Tuesday...Any advise on how I should return it? I DO NOT want to take a chance and burn my face!!! Theres not even CLOSE to a good review on here!!</li>
            <li> I brought this a year ago, I&#x27;ve only used it occasionally. Today it just stopped working, of course it is just over the warranty timeline.  An item this expensive should last longer than 13 months.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and the no-no is a very temporary solution for me. It may have thinned out some hairs but is NOT worth the money. Also... It takes longer than 60 days to \\&quot;try it out\\&quot; so that 60 day money back guarantee is useless.</li>
            <li> Ladies, I have had real laser hair removal, and there is absolutely no reason why this product would work the way it says it does.  There is absolutely no comparison of how REAL laser hair removal works and burning your hair to root.  A good laser hair removal clinic will give you quite an education on what they&#x27;re doing, why they&#x27;re doing it, and whether or not your hair and skin are a good match for the procedure.  Yes, it is expensive, but if you regularly get waxed, it will end up saving you money.  Do be warned, if you have very light hair, or very dark skin laser hair removal may not be advanced enough at this point to treat you.  I am not going to advertise who did the great job on me, because that&#x27;s not what this review is about. It&#x27;s about them trying to sell you a product as if it works like home laser treatments.  It doesn&#x27;t.  This is just 21st century sugar water.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the lowest I can rate this item is 1 star. A complete waste of money. I ordered mine and have been using it as advised by the radiancy customer service team for about 7 weeks now. I have called twice to attempt to return it due to their 60 day satisfaction guarantee but each time I call they refuse to return it until the 60 days is over. I had to replace the thermicon tip after 2 weeks of use and my buffer is completely worn out, my legs are dry and scaly and I have no less hair than when I started using it. Completely disappointed and as for the people who are giving this product 5 stars I have to say, use the product before you review it!</li>
            <li> I tried nono and it doesn&#x27;t work. But it gave me a very nasty burn on the edge of my lip. It&#x27;s been over a month since I got burned and it still hasn&#x27;t healed. The company that sells this product are scam artist. They have lied to me several times and refuse to honor their 60 day trial offer. I am seeing an attorney this week about my burn. Right now I am waiting to see what my attorney have to say. Please don&#x27;t buy this product it is dangerous to use. Save your money!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a scam!  A complete waste of time and money.  I have been using this in one tiny area on my tummy for two months.  It takes forever to get it to take ANYTHING OFF.  And then it grows back immediately.  DO NOT SPEND your money and time on this product.  SCAM!</li>
            <li> I got the no!no! Hair remover a couple of years ago from Sephora... It took time and patience but I no longer have to shave my legs!  It did take a few months and a lot of dedication but I was thrilled with the results.  Every few months I do a little touch up with my no!no! and I am done for a while.      I later bought the one for your face and bikini line.  It is a bit tricky to move on your bikini line but it got rid of all the peach fuzz on my face!  I was always afraid to try anything else on my face because it might grow back worse but now there is nothing at all on my face.</li>
            <li> WORST purchase ever. It does not do ANYTHING! I used it for a long time hoping it would eventually see results. Nope. It&#x27;s cheaply made. When it burns the hair it smells so bad. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Save your money. Don&#x27;t buy no no. It burned my skin and did not remove hair. Ive thick coarse hair. After i burned my arm, i did not try it on my face. I&#x27;m returning it back. This product sucks. I&#x27;m never buying anything from TV again.</li>
            <li> DO NOT buy a No No hair removal from the on line site as advertised on TV, they will double bill you. Those guys are scammers. Should have made my purchase on Amazon, at least then I would have only been billed once.</li>
            <li> Purchased the No No Hair removal system as a Christmas gift for a friend.  My friend never used it was not interested at all.  Called and recieved a return Auth# sent the item back and as of June recieved no refund calling does no good cannot reccomend this company to anyone.</li>
            <li> Words cannot say just how bad this product is. The people on the phone are rude.  I called about the product and was hung up on.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter. It stopped working after 2 goes!!  Called customer service. What a shenanigan!!!! Cannot reolve it.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  You have been warned!!!</li>
            <li> does not work. company does not stand behind 60 days guarantee. tonya at company offered no help or suggestions for returning product.</li>
            <li> I am always trying new products to find the best in new ways for hair removal. As a cosmetologist I have tried many of the current ways to remove unwanted hair. I bought this item thinking it sounded great and found myself very disappointed. I used it on my legs on found that it took forever to use on the entire thing, the smell of burning hair filled my house, not all hair was removed on the first few tries. My hair thinned out after time and now grows in really patchy, this by far being the strangest thing I&#x27;ve ever encountered. I ended up with strange red spot on the skin that come and go. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product does do what it says,it is too soon to tell how the hair regrowth will thin out. I have found that the stubble head does not get the leg hair it seems that the heated element is set too deep to actually get at it. I&#x27;m most happy with the results on my arms and can easily be done just before your shower. You must always be prepared to take a shower after using the NoNo or you will smell like burnt hair all day.This product is no quick fix you must be prepared to use it often.</li>
            <li> This product is a piece of garbage. I ordered directly from the website, making the horrible mistake of not checking reviews here first. The first time I tried the Nono, it actually worked pretty well. After that first time, I could never get it to duplicate the results. It simply glided over most of the hair without doing anything. I had to go over the hairs numerous times to get them to burn off even a little bit. Still yet, it left behind stubble.   The only thing that actually works is the small buffing pad they include. This is what actually removes the hair. Basically, you&#x27;re paying all that money for a nice buffer. You can get an even better buffer that comes with replacement pads at Wal-mart for seven bucks (the Smooth Away kit, which isn&#x27;t perfect but at least it&#x27;s cheap).   What angered me the most about this product (even more than the fact that it didn&#x27;t work), was the shoddy way the company deals with returns. When I called the number to tell them I was returning it (a required step, in order to get your \\&quot;return number\\&quot;), I was interrogated by a male operator who asked for uncomfortably intimate details on exactly where and how I used my Nono, how often I used it, what the results were, etc. He may as well have asked for photos. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;m not exactly eager to explicitly discuss my unwanted body hair with some random man over the phone.   Once that was over, I mailed back my Nono. As I usually do with returns that cost more than a few dollars, I sent it by certified mail that required their signature, so that I would have proof that they received it. Considering how shady this company is, I&#x27;m glad I did. They sent me an email verifying that they received and told me to wait a few weeks for the return to show up on my credit card statement.  When the return did eventually show up, I noticed that they had refunded only TWO, out of the THREE payments they charged. In other words, they had cheated me out of $73. When I called them to straighten this out, they informed me that the third installment of the refund had \\&quot;bounced back\\&quot; because the bank/credit card had seen it as a duplicate. The infuriating thing about this is that they were WELL AWARE that the refund had bounced back and were going to keep their mouths shut and pray that I wouldn&#x27;t notice.   If you bought this product and decide to return it, prepare for a lengthy battle to get your money back. Check your statements carefully. God only knows how many people they&#x27;ve ripped off this way simply because those people don&#x27;t keep a tight watch on their statements (I didn&#x27;t even notice the problem with the refund until a few weeks after it happened).   This product is a joke. Shame on you, Nono. SHAME!</li>
            <li> This item was a huge disappointment because the unit would not stay attached to it&#x27;s required power cord...that being said, one needs to keep the unit level inorder to obtain consistant results, which is very difficult to do when it is continiously losing power...thank you for your time, have a wonderful life!  [[ASIN:B002LBK5QU No!no! Hair Removal Unit, Pink]]</li>
            <li> I tried using the product on my legs and the amount of heat generated was very uncomfortable. I am afraid to use it on my face. I am also affraid that the hair on my face will come back darker and more prominant than before. I expected the product to remove the hair from the roots rather than burn it. I also did not like the smell of burning hair. If this is not the case, please let me know to return the item because it could be deffective and a hazard to use. Thanks,</li>
            <li> I am so glad I took the time to look at reviews on Amazon before I bought this product! I googled NoNo reviews and found several pages with glowing reviews...all worded almost exactly the same and all with a link to the company website, which miraculously is only offering the \\&quot;special introductory trial\\&quot; through midnight tonight [yeah, right].  After reading 10+ pages of reviews on this site I found only 4 or 5 positive experiences.  If it actually did work for those few, great for them.  I will not be wasting my money or worse yet risking damage to my skin thanks to the honest reviews given by all of you that did unfortunately waste your money only to have no results and burnt skin.  THANK YOU AMAZON CUSTOMERS!!!!</li>
            <li> My mother-in-law gave me this device after claiming it worked but she just didn&#x27;t have the time or commitment to use it. After reading the instructions and watching the video, I assumed it would work like a razor and eventually reduce hair growth. So I gave it a shot since I had a stubble on my legs anyway and attempted to rid them of hair. The device is a pain to use. If you don&#x27;t hold it just right then it goes off and you have to manuever it back to the correct position. In some areas, it burns you (like the underarms)even on the lowest setting. The smell of burnt hair didn&#x27;t really bother me, but the fact that it didn&#x27;t even take off one piece of hair did! The instructions said not to go over one area more than three times so you really have to watch that you remember what areas you already went over. Just attempting one leg took forever and the instructions recommend doing this 2-3 times a week. I&#x27;m dark skinned and even after shaving, you can see where the hair is on my legs. I was hoping this would be the solution to my problem, but after reading other reviews and conducting my own trial, this is definitely not it. I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not the one who paid the money for this! This might work for people who do not have a hair problem, but for the rest of us who would love to have lasik but can&#x27;t afford it, then no. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> This product does NOT work! After going over the same spot several times because it was not removing my hair, it started shorting out. I had to keep turning it back on only to have it short out after only one swipe. Very frustrating. After spending 30 minutes trying to remove a small area of hair (and smelling like a burn victim), I re-read the directions. They said, \\&quot;No! no! may not remove ALL of your hair. You may still need to go over it with a regular shaver.\\&quot; Who wants to go around with half-hairy legs or shave their legs twice? Once is bad enough. I went back to my regular shaver which I decided was much faster, easier, and efficient. I returned the No! no! because I never could get it to shave even one small area of my leg. I don&#x27;t know how they are allowed to sell such a useless product. Just say NO! to No! no!</li>
            <li> This is an out of date model which is a waste of money as it cannot be used for facial hair. I have had to buy a new version from NO NO! which is cordless can be used just about anywhere on the body. This old model incorporates a blade which cuts the skin if not very carefully used. Makes me not want to buy through Amazon again.</li>
            <li> If you really think about it, most people that write product reviews have negative experience. People that are satisfied with a product usually do not get on the internet to bitch, they just go on using whatever it they are using. I know that&#x27;s what I do. Couple of hundred negative reviews out millions of customers is not that bad. I bought the NONO and so far I like it. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give a true review, but so far it has worked great on my face and arms, and did an OK job on my legs. We will see if I get better results on my legs with time. Have not tried other areas yet. It is totally painless and I can&#x27;t figure out how people burn themselves with this thing, I couldn&#x27;t burn myself with it if I tried. What bothers me about some of these responses to the positive reviews is people accusing others and calling them liars....that&#x27;s going overboard.</li>
            <li> Well, I must admit, I DID all of the research before purchasing this product &amp; I felt some of them were strictly that the individuals didn&#x27;t pay attention to detail.  BUT . . . now after using the product for 4 months, this is MY finding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO find that this product DOES work FAMOUSLY on FINE little hairs.  BUT . . . if you have COARSE hair?  FORGET IT ! ! !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did absolutely NOTHING for ANY of the coarser hair that I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I AM recommending this product, IF, you are looking for something that will handle \\&quot;FINE\\&quot; hair, such as the hair on your face . . . WHICH, is one of the MAIN reasons for ME purchasing the unit.  It also DOES handle the fine hairs on the TOP of my upper thighs, but the coarser hair under my upper thigh?  NOPE . . . doesn&#x27;t work there.  It also DOES seem to work under my arms, but then again, \\&quot;I\\&quot; do NOT have coarse hair there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there is MY review in a nutshell . . . hope this helps</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money  , after sales service is nil  .  You out lay a fair amount of money for the product&lt;br /&gt;and what make the laser work is a small rubber drive band if this band slips off the drive wheel inside it&lt;br /&gt;will not work and all  that nono offers is a second hand machine with 3 months warranty for $120.00 + postage&lt;br /&gt;the drive band will not last ,the nono can&#x27;t be fixed and no one at head office gives a toss&lt;br /&gt;This is not a long term product  DONT BUY THIS it is not value for money.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read this reviews before I wasted $300 on my NONO. It does NOT work. I tried to send it back in the first 45 days because I saw zero results, and they convinced me that I needed to try it for 30 more days to see better results. I did, no results. I tried to send it back- no go. They refused to refund me my money because I kept it beyond the first 45 days, even though it was at their request.  I used this daily and never saw the first result. I had friends use it that had darker hair...no results. It does not even cut the hair, so how in the world is it supposed to crystalize the roots? This is a scam. Don&#x27;t waste your money! Please, trust me on this.</li>
            <li> I would give this 0 stars if that was an option.  How do products like this even get on the market?</li>
            <li> This product did nothing that it says its supposed to and I used it exactly how the video told me. The green light was on and all it did was burn the top part of the hair off and left my skin itchy and still had to shave. My skin had a rash kind of like sun burn or something. I&#x27;m also having trouble with returning this piece of garbage!</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know how scams like this are allowed to continue.  I bought No No hoping that it would work for a number of reasons, but mostly facial hair that is becoming quite annoying.  You get to use it for 60 days but you aren&#x27;t supposed to see results for 6 to 8 weeks.  By that time your return guarantee is over and you are stuck with it.  The only thing this thing does well is stink up the room.  Please SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!</li>
            <li> I got the No No hair and skin (for acne/breakouts). First a little bit of the positive: the No No Skin seems to be effective in preventing or at least alleviating a full blown pimple if you apply it enough. I use mine multiple times though the instructions say only two pulses at a time when I am breaking out or have a full blown pimple. An ok investment for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the negative bad and ugly. The No No hair removal is completely useless and ineffective piece of nothing. Literally there is no spot on my body that it works. I have problems with bodily and armpit hair not face and I used the No No on legs armpits toes back of neck stomach etc and while you smell hair burning you don&#x27;t see any hair disappear! Unbelievable fraud! Also on the armpits it will burn your skin bc it&#x27;s a sensitive area don&#x27;t go there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a fraud this company is and a complete letdown and waste of my hardearned money.</li>
            <li> First off, I didn&#x27;t buy this product through Amazon. I bought it directly from the No No company. Also, I had laser hair removal before buying this product. I bought No No because I wanted to get rid of the few remaining hairs that the laser treatments couldn&#x27;t and didn&#x27;t get rid of. (Laser treatments do not work on blonde and white hairs.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me it seems to work. I don&#x27;t even do it regularly. I do it on a \\&quot;when I feel like it\\&quot; basis. Some of the stubborn white hairs on my chin are gone (laser treatments are not effective on white hairs) since I started using No No. This is exactly what I bought the device for, and it&#x27;s doing exactly what I had hoped it would. It&#x27;s getting rid of the white hairs that the laser treatments couldn&#x27;t get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I have burnt a mole a few times. Yes, there is the smell of hair. That&#x27;s how I know it&#x27;s working. It&#x27;s no big deal to me. That mole is going to be removed by a dermatologist soon, anyhow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t use the polisher thing that they send or the lotion that is supposed to retard hair growth. I want the hairs to grow back quickly so I can shoot them down again. I just sit in bed and roll the unit over the places that need hair removal. I&#x27;m still working on the knee caps. Those hairs are very stubborn. Laser treatments hardly put a dent in the knee cap hairs. No No seems to be very slowly knocking them out. Maybe if I were more faithful about using the unit, they&#x27;d be gone by now. I really am a lazy No No user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to mention that No No seems to have gotten rid of the hairs that the laser treatments didn&#x27;t get rid of in the underarm area. Just a few left, but I haven&#x27;t seen them since my last No No treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any questions, please feel free to write. I&#x27;ve been working at getting rid of hairs for years. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing -- I often pluck out the facial hairs after I treat them with No No. I think that helps too. Especially the few tough whiteys on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not paid to write this. You can see my other reviews of various other products. I write straight up what I think about a product -- good or bad.Especially the few tough whiteys on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not paid to write this.

            <li> I ordered the NO NO several months ago and use it as the directions stated. Luckily I just used it on my chin and legs, if I&#x27;d used it on my face I would have to shave every day. On the legs it didn&#x27;t even remove hair &amp; I gave up trying, on the chin it seems to remove it if you keep going over the same place enough to get a rash on the face where you are using it. However the hair grows right back....thick, very stiff and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I did not send mine back, it was either keep trying it or start shaving. Like I said luckily I didn&#x27;t do my whole face, if I  had I would have a full beard. I&#x27;ve never had much luck with things sold on TV but this has to be probably the worse product I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I don&#x27;t know how they can advertise this and sell this useless thing. Perhaps they do give a refund, I don&#x27;t know how they could guarantee this product that does not work at all.[[ASIN:B002LBK5QU No!no! Hair Removal Unit, Pink]][[ASIN:B004HJ6TAA Radiancy no!no! Hair 8800, Silver]]</li>
            <li> It burned my skin, which felt sensitive &amp; looked red for days and the hair grew sooner than the product claims.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when i got the product and was really looking forward to be hair free on my upper lip n chin. To my sad dissapointment it burned the heZzel out of my face. My face feels extra tight and uncomfortable but I cant say it isnt my fault as well. i went in both directions and went over the area many times.. these r both things they specifically told me not to do. You really cant over do it. I did get hair removal on my face but not on my underarm. Between all the problem i definetly WOULD NOT recommen this to a friend. Its just a hassel and is causing more stress than helping.. i I hope this burns dont scar..</li>
            <li> The No No does not work as it says. The hair grows back just as fast as if shaving.  I tried using as it said and it&#x27;s been a year and I actually have thicker hair in the place that I was using it. I was waxing before using the No No and the hair appeared to be thinner then than what it is now After using the No No. I am back to waxing that area.  I do not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> I used this twice a week for several months per the instructions and I got NO results! I wasted countless hours on using this product (not to mention money too!) It does not work!!</li>
            <li> After having every hair removal process, I found that only real laser treatments work the best for me. I only have a small areas of hair that still needs treatments, so I decided to try the NoNo. That was a big mistake. My mistake was not sending it back on time to get my money back. Instead they said mine was not working right, and  sent me a replacement. Stay away from this product. It makes me wonder how it got such good reviews in the first place.</li>
            <li> The unit burns the hair, sure, but it takes several SUPER SLOW strokes over the same spot to leave the skin hair free but with black dots corresponding the singed hair. The wires/blades kink and break very easily and rapidly with normal use. Overall I did not notice any change in hair texture or growth. I will not invest in replacement blades. This was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> First, the product didn&#x27;t work and although I was promised a double my money back guarantee they made me keep it and charged my credit card for the full price before I was allowed to return it.  Then when I returned it they sent me to a collection agency that has called on a regular basis even though I talked with No! No! and with the agency.  So not only did I not get double my money back, they are trying to collect on the refund they did give me.  Apparently it&#x27;s double my money back to them!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  It took over 30 minutes for me to use it on my legs and I have hardly any hair and stubble was left.  It burned my face.  I think it is a dangerous product and a waste of time and too expensive.  Stay away from this product.  Diane[[ASIN:B002LBK5QU No!no! Hair Removal Unit, Pink]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had extremely good results with the No!No!.  It states in the literature that it works best for dark, coarse hair and this is what I have.  I&#x27;ve used it consistently every other day for about 6 months and have seen a huge decrease in the hair growth on my legs.  I haven&#x27;t had any regrowth on my knees at all for a few months.  I&#x27;m also seeing much less hair under my arms, on my arms, and on my face.  This isn&#x27;t a product that removes hair like a razor or epilator.  You can&#x27;t use it and expect to be hairless immediately.  I mostly use an epilator (shave occasionally) and use the No!No! in between for maintenance and long term treatment.  It&#x27;s not a miracle product and definitely didn&#x27;t zap the hair away in a minute but with consistent use it IS working for me.  I&#x27;m very happy with it and think it&#x27;s well worth the money spent. keep your expectations realistic, don&#x27;t expect magic or a miracle and you may be surprised.</li>
            <li> I admit, I have thick black hair on my legs. This looks particularly bad since I also happen to have pale skin.  Based on its advertising, and recommendations from the folks at Sephora, I thought No! No! would be a great solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t work at all.  The way the product is designed, there&#x27;s basically a sort of thin electric wire that just burns off the top of the hair.  The hair grows right back.  The infomercials and various sellers advertise it as a product that uses electricity to crystalize the hair or some such.  Well, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to get all the way down to the follicle.  Not even close.  It doesn&#x27;t even burn off the entire top of the hair.  You have to \\&quot;buff\\&quot; the lower bit off.  So, actually, it&#x27;s worse than shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since had laser hair removal, so I now know how hot something has to get for a follicle to die.  I also know what a \\&quot;killed\\&quot; follicle looks like and let me tell you, the NoNo has never even came close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;d seen good reviews on this product too though, so I actually tried it for a few months.  The result?  No reduction in hair growth, no real thinning of the hair.  The hair looks thinner to a certain extent because you&#x27;re not getting shaving stubble, but you&#x27;d get the same result from waxing.  Or, better, since you wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with the horrible smell of burning hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those people who say they&#x27;ve seen \\&quot;reduction.\\&quot;  Your probably the ones using the NoNo ALL THE TIME.  You&#x27;re causing your hair growing cycles to stagger, like when I get patchy hair growth after frequent waxing/shaving.  Don&#x27;t believe me?  Try it.  It should turn out fine if the NoNo does what it says it does and has permanently removed your hair, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, let me just break down all the \\&quot;science\\&quot; behind the NoNo.  Thermicon &#x3D; heat.  Thermal energy transfer &#x3D; It gets hot.  Thermal wire &#x3D; Hot wire.  Crystalize &#x3D; It burns up, and turns crispy.  Based on this, NoNo advertises itself as\\&quot;technically and scientifically sound.\\&quot;  Notice, they don&#x27;t say it&#x27;s scientifically proven, BECAUSE THEY CAN&#x27;T.  They only say the theory on which the technology operates is scientifically POSSIBLE.  And, yes, it is possible to heat up a hair follicle and kill it.  It&#x27;s even theoretically possible to use hair to conduct enough heat down to the follicle causing it to die.  Actually possible?  Not so much.  Hair is a very poor heat conductor, that&#x27;s why it keeps your head warm/cool.  That&#x27;s why all your hair doesn&#x27;t fall out every time you use a curling iron.</li>
            <li> This is the worst company I have ever dealt with-EVER! They will not allow me to return the no-no even after I have called and complained several times. They will not give me the name of the President of the company for me to write a complaint. They sent the product to the wrong house; I did not get it for several weeks because my neighbor did not know that it was left by a side door. They misspelled our name too so when I called to find out about the order, the no-no \\&quot;customer service\\&quot; person could not even find my account. They have no problem getting the credit card number right but not our name or address. I am so disgusted. I am going to get an attorney so I can get my money back because there is no other way to do so-they are absolutely impossible to deal with. They asked me to give them numbers I have called from to track that I actually did call. They are pathetic, non customer-service oriented and just want to take your money and not give it back if you are dissatisfied. I do not recommend their product nor do I recommend that you do business with them.</li>
            <li> This piece of junk is useless. They are charging 300.00 dollars for something that would&#x27;nt be good enough to use as a boat anchor!It burns the skin and the smell of scorched hair is terrible. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOLKS MY WIFE AND I GIVE NONO 5 THUMBS DOWN!</li>
            <li> I bought the no no hair removal . The company is telling people lies .The machine does not do what they say .It does not remove hair as they say it will. It is impossible to get your money back from this company. They said the deposit money I paid would go straight back into my account when they received the &#x27;No No&#x27; machine but I never received anything. They even sent an email saying they had received the &#x27;No No&#x27; but still no money went into my account. I would advise people not to&lt;br /&gt;buy this machine as it is not worth £190.  It is a rip-off.</li>
            <li> I think anyone selling this product is bordering on extortion. How can they see the multitude of reviews like mine and have the arrogance to keep selling it? It removes fine hair, but does nothing on anything more coarse. But no matter what sort of hair, IT ALWAYS GROWS BACK! I gave it every chance to be successful. I followed all instructions exactly. But by the time I realized that it was expensive garbage, my money-back guarantee had expired.  I&#x27;m so upset. I&#x27;m not a rich person and this represented a sizeable investment for me.  If you haven&#x27;t already bought one then DON&#x27;T!!! If you have, send it straight back. And think about the companies selling it ... they&#x27;re not stupid. They&#x27;re seeing the reviews. Yet they&#x27;re happy to take your money and keep selling it.</li>
            <li> It took me a long time and the hair is still there! It&#x27;s a complete waste of money! You&#x27;ll regret it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product 6 months ago.  It doesn&#x27;t work.  I followed their directions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot;. Made my hair grow in thicker and darker.  I used it twice a week plus applied the cream afterwards.  They kept in contact with me via email for 3 months then nothing after that. So don&#x27;t waste your money. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. I have gray/whitish hair.</li>
            <li> NO NO Good is what I can say about this garbage.  Not only did I do exactly what I was supposed to do but it was too late to return it to the company.  I have not only more hair, but I am cut up and burnt all the time.  This is the greatest marketing of the worst product ever....UGGH...Do Not Buy This Product......</li>
            <li> Received the Nono as a present. Please do not waste any money on this product, I will be returning it a.s.a.p. The thing will not run for more than two seconds at a time just keeps clicking on &amp; off. To get even the smallest area done requires the patience of a saint. The resulting burnt hair smell lasts for at least 5 days even after the buffing &amp; cream. The buffing, which I must have overdone, left my skin feeling sore for over a week, even so the prickly legs were back within a couple of days. I hate this thing with a vengence!!Would have given it minus stars if possible.</li>
            <li> This is by far the WORST product i have ever used. I tried it for 6 weeks with absolutely zero results. I then contacted their customer service department and was informed for courser hair it \\&quot;may take longer\\&quot; conveniently past the money back guaranteed date. no wonder sephora took it off its shelves. amazon and nordstrom should do the same. i would only recommend this product if you love your facial hair and are in to getting your skin burned. and yes, i used the product correctly .</li>
            <li> First, the product simply does not work. I couldn&#x27;t tell you whether it offers long term removal because it did not remove the hair to begin with. I tried it on my fingers to test it out and it removed some of the (very fine) hairs, but not all. That said, the worst part of ordering this product was the customer services. I ended up with two units because I placed my order on a day where they apparantly had issues with their website and so I never received a confirmation page after I provided my credit card info. I also never received a confirmation email. To this day I have not received confirmation of an order. But what I did get was an email offer the next day to purchase the product with free shipping because it seemed that while I had browsed the site, I did not make a purchase. So I called customer service and placed the order ( I also did not see the charge on my credit card). Long story short, I ended up with two and I was charged for two. I had a hard time getting the return label, but two weeks later it came in the mail (I requested it to be emailed). I sent the more expensive one (without the discounts) back. A few weeks later I was refunded for the discounted one, and then two weeks later, they added the charge back on... So, now I have to call them again to straighten this out, but judging by the fact that they have not done anything right so far, I dont anticipate this being an easy process. I would advise anyone considering doing business with this company to save themselves the headache. Spring for laser removal and avoid the hassle of dealing with these people.</li>
            <li> I am so confused. I have bought 2 different hair removal products on Amazon&#x27;s website that are labeled &amp;#34;No NO&amp;#34; &amp; they are not alike. They both seem to remove hair with a heated wire &amp; that&#x27;s the end of the similarities,really. I&#x27; m not sure if the tips are interchangeable.They may be but I&#x27;m not sure if they SHOULD be. This NO NO says not to use on the face &amp; has a &amp;#34;long hair&amp;#34; tip &amp; &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; tip. The other lists the face as ok &amp; has &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; tips.&lt;br /&gt;This 1 is not battery powered. The other has a battery to be charged up.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found positive &amp; negatives for both so far. I don&#x27;t know which I&#x27;ll keep. I&#x27;m still only a few weeks into this experience &amp; expect time will tell.  I would like to know about the wide disparities between the 2, both labeled as &amp;#34;NO NO&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This Product does not work. At All. Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be left with stubble.  I have yet to try to return mine, but from all other reviews, it is impossible to get your money back.  DON&#x27;T BE FOOLED LIKE WE WERE.</li>
            <li> I bought it to remove hair from the face and found after I got it it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted.  It is only good for the legs and chest and considering I don&#x27;t have hair on my chest and very little on my legs, it will probably sit in the closet until I toss it out.</li>
            <li> I received my NoNo as a birthday gift.  I have given it time and used it faithfully.  It does not work. I have very thick coarse facial hair (the reason for the NoNo) and it WILL NOT deliver a smooth skin surface as promised.  I had a TRIPLE money back guarantee which is NOT being honored. They said the delivery date was on Feb 20 2013 and today being April 26th I am outside my 60 days to return.  It was a gift, I did not receive this gift until the 29th of Feb.  So now I have a device that does not work and the person that purchased it for me is out 220.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I am in the 7% of people this thing will not work on, oh well.... just beware as their return policy is crap if it does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have been warned!!!</li>
            <li> I used this after reading the instructions 4 times.  It&#x27;s like giving the hair on my legs a haircut.  Not smooth at all.  Felt like 3 days of razor stubble were left after each use.  I thought I would see some improvement after 5 weeks, but did not.  Very disappointing.  I&#x27;m returning it.  For this kind of money, I thought I would have better results.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> NONO SUCKS ITS THE WORST THING I HAVE EVER BOUGHT, DONT BUY A NONO THEY ARE NO GOOD MY TRIMMER WORKS ALOT BETTER,AND I WILL KEEP USEING MY TRIMMER,AT LEAST IT DOES WORK AND IT ONLY COST ME 30.00 DOLLARS, I PAYED 260.00 DOLLARS FOR THE NONO AND I WILL SEND IT BACK TO GET MY MONEY BACK..... I TELL YOU WHAT PAY ME TO GO ON TV I PROMISE THEY WONT SELL NO MORE NONO,S</li>
            <li> I bought the no! no! more than a year ago, thought there was something wrong sent it back &amp; bought an other one. Both of these products did not work anywhere near what the promos lead u to believe. I watched the video several times as I thought I must be doing something wrong to be having such poor results. After several times, nothing happened!!!! I was so digusted I put it away &amp; tried again, by this time my 60 days return time was done, so I was stuck w/ it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my many trys I now have ingrown hairs that turned into sores &amp; now I have noticeable scars, I truly can tell you this not only does not do what it is said to do, but I now have bumps under my chin area thanks to NO! NO!, no no is the best word to describe this fraud, no no don&#x27;t use it!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had the over $250.00 that I was sucker enough to pay for this, shame on you NO! NO! Should be taken off the market. There r more complaints then compliments for this, wonder why?. Hope you have the nerve to print this review. Jane</li>
            <li> I purchased the NO NO Hair Removal System and was not happy with it. I called to get the return address, and the woman I spoke to but me through an interrogation, asking me all sorts of persona questions about the product, where I used it, how I used it etc etc.  I told her I just wanted to send it back. I told her on TV and the website, it said return for a full refund plus shipping and handling. Again, she kept talking. She said, you can&#x27;t return it without an authorization code.  She continued asking me questions and more questions. I demanded to speak to a supervisor and she kept talking like she was reading from a script.&lt;br /&gt;I will put a dispute charges through my bank, but lesson learned NEVER NEVER buy anything from a TV 800#</li>
            <li> I bought to No No Hair Removal Unit in January 2013.  I have had laser hair removal over 20 times, and it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I researched the No No and thought I would give it a try.  I will admit that I didn&#x27;t have high expectations of it, because I thought if laser didn&#x27;t work this probably wouldn&#x27;t either.  I have very dark, coarse hair, so I am the perfect candidate for laser.  I have dealt with excess hair for years, and it is the one thing that really bothers me.  You have to have patience with the No No, but they do state that in their information.  You definitely won&#x27;t get instant results, but if you continue to use it as the directions state it DOES work!  I have been using it diligently since the end of January, and I have seen dramatic results.  My hair is growing back much slower than it used to.  I do still have to shave, but I expect that.  I just like the fact that my hair isn&#x27;t as noticeable now.  I will definitely write another review after using it for a year, but seeing results as fast as I did I don&#x27;t have any doubt that the No No will do exactly what it says.  It is absolutely pain free (unlike the torture I put myself through with laser).  The one thing to expect when using it is the smell of burning hair, but that I can handle to get rid of it!  I highly recommend the No No, but you have to remember to be patient!</li>
            <li> NO STARS FOR NO NO. WISH I HAD READ REVIEWS BEFORE I PURCHASED AN EXPENSIVE ITEM THAT DOES NOTHING. ALTHOUGH MY HAIR IS VERY FINE, I COULD USE NO NO FOR 20 MINUTES A DAY {OR MORE}  FOR MONTHS- RESULT NO BURNS, NO  RASH AND NO HAIR REMOVAL. WHEN YOU BUY NO NO YOU ARE LEFT WITH ZERO DOLLARS AND ALL THE HAIR YOU STARTED WITH. DUPED BUYERS SHOULD UNITE. WE DESERVE REFUNDS AND THE COMPANY SHOULD BE  PUT OUT OF BUSINESS.</li>
            <li> Against my better judgement, I ordered through the official website on a trial 60-day money back TRIPLE Guarantee, which meant I supposedly would not pay postage coming in or going out for this device. WRONG! Not only does this device not remove hair adequately, but it also creates ingrown hairs, and does not work on tan skin. Their official website does not honor paying postage to return it unless you keep it for 45 days, which their website said nothing to that fact upon ordering. SAVE YOUR MONEY! DO NOT ORDER this device. No matter how much time you give it, it does not remove any better than a high end electric or disposable razor.  Also, hair grows back no matter the system, so go with a more reasonable priced, better result device! Say \\&quot;NO\\&quot; to No No Hair! and Save your hard earned money!!!</li>
            <li> I went online to order this product &amp; started reading some of the Amazon reviews &amp; boy, was I glad I did.  I did not order the NO NO &amp; from the sounds of it saved myself a lot of pain &amp; stress (from trying to get a refund).  Thanks again to all who took the time to review this disappointing product.</li>
            <li> used the no no for one week, on the third day of using it, i became irritated and i had to stop. the next day my face was awollen and very red.  i now hace thick hardened skin on my cheeks. i have been burned, it is still very uncomfortable, four weeks later.  BE VERY CAREFUL OF THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for writing the reviews. I am actually atching the comercial and got so excited, I came on to Amazon thinking I would but it right now. Instead of getting burned i think the hair on my face will have to stay. Thank goodness I read these comments!! Thanks guys!</li>
            <li> The device is a pain in the ass to use.  It takes the hair off with a lot of effort.  Completely not worth the price or stink.  My cheap electric razor does a much better job; usually right after trying to use the no no shaver.</li>
            <li> I suppose I cannot really rate the no no. Hair above upper lip has always been a problem.  After reading reviews, I will not buy it. Shaving seems much less evasive then what others have described about the product and burning the hair.</li>
            <li> After trying this product with poor results, I returned it. The worst part is the smell of burnt hair - yuck! Disgusting! Don&#x27;t waste your money! It&#x27;s not worth all the hype!</li>
            <li> This is a RIP OFF and I will Never purchase anything from Amazon, unless they do the right thing and credit my card back. It is NOT the one that is advertised on TV.It has a cord that has to be attached to operate. It doesn&#x27;t operate the way its shown on TV.I found another one and it works great, from the Nono company. I sent the one from Amazon back with in days and have not heard from them since, or my money.I hope you do the right thing for future business.</li>
            <li> I ordered No!No! About twoo weeks ago. I wish I had read these reviews before that! As soon as I called to order it and the guy on the phone told me the first payment, which was $104.00, I told him I would have to call back the next day because I didn&#x27;t have enough in my account to cover it until my direct deposit came in the next day, and he promised it wouldnt be charged until the next two days anyway, so I went ahead and told him if that was the case, then ok. When I hung up the phone after ordering, I checked my bank account, and was very upset to see an authorized hold already charged on my account which, in my bank, once that is done, it already takes that amount and deducts it from my available balance, which if I don&#x27;t habe the funds available, it will go through, but will charge me an overdraft fee for it. As soon as I saw this, I called right back and got another guy and I explained to him that I haf just callef to order and wantef to cancel my order before its been shipped because the previous guy I spoke to charged my account already after I specifically told him not to and I wanted it cancelled! I was told I had to call another number to cancel. When I called the number they gave me to cancel the order, they told me to call back in three hours because it wasn&#x27;t showing up in their system yet. I asked them,  \\&quot;how could it not be in your system yet, but you have lready charged me?\\&quot; They told me they dont know but its not in the system yet and to try to call back in another three hours. And when I did, it was closed. First thing in the morning, the next day, which by now was the third day, I called first thing in the morning around 7am. This time it was finally in the system, and of course, now it&#x27;s as already been shipped out! So needless to say, I had to wait until its been received in order to call them to get a return label to send them. I just received it three days ago and have not opened it. I was thinking about giving it the 60 day trial since I already paid my first payment, but after reading these reviews, im going to write REFUSED on it and send it back so I don&#x27;t have to pay to ship it back, go to my bank and dispute the charge, and have my $ refunded and if I have to, change my credit card info, so they don&#x27;t try charging my card again.&lt;br /&gt;This company and it&#x27;s customer service reps are professional liars and should be reviewed! Im even thinking about calling channel 3 call Kurtis to have them investigated and put on the news for false advertisement amd fraud!</li>
            <li> Do Not Buy this product! It doesn&#x27;t work it&#x27;s Very expensive and you&#x27;ll never get your money back, it&#x27;s a seriously expensive mistake to make.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t get blindsided by the media magic.  Nono is an instrument of torture, and does nothing that it says it will.  I wish I&#x27;d done my due diligence before buying this worthless piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> So glad I read the customer reviews before ordering. Even those that tried to return the item had trouble with the company. Decided not to throw my money away.</li>
            <li> I ordered the no! no! back in August thinking it would save me time and money from threading...boy was I wrong!!  When I got it, I first used it on my legs and not only would it burn the hair, it wouldn&#x27;t even move smoothly!!!! It would pulse a few times and then stop. I made sure it was fully charged, but it would still move like this. Then, the other day, I used it on my face and OWWWW! It freakin&#x27; sliced me!!!!! I now have a cut on my chin from where the wire got me!! No pain my ass!!!! That piece of s**t machinery does NOT live up to the name no pain no hair!!! It&#x27;s very painful and it doesn&#x27;t even work!!!!!!  DON&#x27;T waste your money on this crap!!!  It&#x27;s SSSOOOOO NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not worth it! It is time consuming and burns your skin. I been using it for six months and no results, I finally gave up and went back to the razor.</li>
            <li> Ok so my husband purchased the pink no! no! For me as a Christmas present. After being slightly offended I tried it out of curiosity ( and after I realized he dropped 300.00 on it) I thought it was clever marketing that they say it &amp;#34;crystallized&amp;#34; the hair when in fact the head has a small wire down the center that heats up and burns the hair off your skin. It doesn&#x27;t hurt if you use it properly and once you get past the smell its way more convenient than shaving and much nicer than waxing. If you have ever spent the money on laser hair removal you will be slightly disappointed! After all this is an at home treatment! It&#x27;s like the difference of getting your hair professionally colored and doing a box dye job at home... The pros always do it a little better! But with that said I&#x27;m not about to spend that much money on laser since most of my body hair is baby fine and blonde.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help with the hair on my legs. It does not work. I contacted the seller. I used it exactly how they instructed but it does not work. My daughter tried it as well. It is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was really psyched about finally getting rid of my mustache.  And get rid of it, it did--Sort-of--mostly.  I tried it several times and at different speeds and strengths.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER! So far every time I&#x27;ve used it it has burned my skin no matter how fast or slow I go under my chin, jaw and my upper lip. I&#x27;m so sorry this has not worked for&lt;br /&gt;me as I was really hoping to get rid of my facial hair but I don&#x27;t want scars on my face too. So I guess I&#x27;ve thrown away nearly $300. Like a woman on disability can afford&lt;br /&gt;that! Guess it&#x27;s like P. T. Barnum Said, &#x27;There&#x27;s a sucker born every minute!!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> This product is so terrible that after just one use I lost my entire leg. I thought that it could have been a coincidence because I had a poorly knee  but I then used it on my scrotum. After losing my ball bag I tried to get refund but this company said it was my own fault for having not used the right amount of cream.&lt;br /&gt;I doubt i&#x27;ll ever use a No No ever again</li>
            <li> NO NO DON&#x27;T WORK AT ALL. I try it for about 3 weeks, NO NO NO NO DON&#x27;t WORK  !! not even  1 star !!waisting of time and money!!</li>
            <li> If you feel the need to try it-make sure you purchase it when it offers a 60 guaranteed return.  That they pay for and send you the shipping label that allows to choose either to  return with either UPS or the US Post Office-with the same label an the same box it came in!  I keep mine for 60 days to give it every chance and it just did not even remove the hair like an electric razor would!  Please do not get your hopes up, but if you must try it like I really wanted to believe the advertisement-make sure you return it.  It is a lot of money to waste!  This is the only thing they made easy-the return of the item free of charge.  I have just to receive my credit, but feel they will honor their guarantee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish I could give it no stars!</li>
            <li> I came on this site to see what people had to say about NoNo before I bought one and I am so glad I did. I had planned to use it in the bikini area; wow,what a bad idea that would have been. I am glad I didn&#x27;t waste my time or money on the product for once. I am always buying into this As Seen On TV crap.At least I had the foresight to check this product out first.</li>
            <li> I got the NO NO and was very disappointed.  It only got some of the hair and that came back with the same texture.  I can&#x27;t believe shows like Dr. Oz and the View indorse this product.  Shame on them!  All I can say is that it&#x27;s a lot of hype.  Don&#x27;t let them fool you.</li>
            <li> I was just about to order the No No hair removal. After reading your reviews I have decided to save my money and not order his product. Thank you all who took the time to write their views on the No No hair removal.</li>
            <li> The unit was portrayed on TV and the Net as being cordless, but it had a power cord, and was required to use it to operate.  The technology was also portrayed as being very quick and easy to use, but it was not. I had gotten it as a way for my husband to shave his arms, chest, etc, without having to stand at the bathroom sink, or deal with messy creams and having to continually buy shaving blades. The unit burned his skin, and the stench of burning hair was so strong, I had to open my windows in February to clear the air. Was totally unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> I was about to purchase this item.... So grateful that Amazon has a place where consumers can voice their complaints about a product. i&#x27;ll start looking for something else. I hope more people read these reviews so the company can stop selling it. Thanks again for warning.</li>
            <li> Thank you everyone who took the time to review the NoNo Hair Removal System. It saved me a lot of time, frustration and money!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these a few years ago and want to warn anyone interested in getting it - Don&#x27;t do it!  It basically just burns the hair off... which would be one thing if you were smooth and \\&quot;hairfree\\&quot; at the end.  But it&#x27;s just gross.  I have more coarse hair, so I can&#x27;t speak for finer haired results, but it took for me to do it and at the end it was super rough and wasn&#x27;t all gone anyway.  And forget it being gone for weeks!  If your hair grows back quickly with shaving it will grow back just as quickly with this.  I can&#x27;t believe they can even still sell this thing and that the company can even still exist. Oh, and it is NOT painfree. It causes a pinching sensation that is far from Painless.</li>
            <li> I have been using the nono (black) for about two months.  I have not had any problems with the product burning my skin, even when used on the highest setting.  Those with burning skin problems must be using it improperly.  I use it on my face and am a little disappointed that I can still feel slight stubble after use.  It does a great job on &#x27;peach fuzz&#x27; however.  It is saving me some money as I was waxing once a month, and that is painful and expensive.  I will stick with it to see if I get any long-term benefits.  I feel that some reviewers perhaps received bogus knock-offs and not the actual nono product as the reviews seem really severe in the negative direction.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since January 2013 and now we are almost to June 2013 and the product HAS NOT WORKED AT ALL.  All it did WAS MAKE THE HAIR MORE THICK AND BLACKER, LIKE A MAN&#x27;S BIERD. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> If I could give it negative stars I would.  Do not waste your money.  I have blonde, fine hair, this product sucks.  I should know by now, if its advertised on TV it is useless.</li>
            <li> My mother in law bought this for over $250 online for facial hair.  It didn&#x27;t work the way she wanted so she gave it to me instead of returning it for a refund.  I had never heard of the No No before, so I went into using this with no knowledge of ratings or opinions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, like most, am so disappointed!  Set up and used as directed.  Went over several areas with no luck.  Did have a couple random hairs burn here and there.  Got the burnt hair smell they tell you means its working, but no visible hair was removed.  What a complete waste of time for me and money for my mother in law.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR $$$. :(</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I couldn&#x27;t use this product on my face, so I decided to return it. I was afraid to try it on the rest of my body after reading the instructions, as it seemed a little daunting in that it required practice on larger flatter areas before it was recommended for areas like the knee.</li>
            <li> Awful, awful awful. I&#x27;ve spent so much time trying to get this thing to work for me and I just read all of the other reviews and realized I&#x27;ve wasted countless hours thinking it was me.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money, not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been patient for two months using No! No! every other day for that time. The unit has not altered the amount or coarseness of hair at all. I feel that I am one of thousands who have spent hundreds of dollars on a bogus product.</li>
            <li> This was the worse product i have ever bought. I purchased it over the phone straight from the company. i paid $300.00 and boy am i sorry. the first time i tried it was on my face, it burned. so then i decided maybe try it on my arms. This thing did not work whats so ever, and it broke down after like the 5th time i used it. I called customer service for the \\&quot;money back guaranteed\\&quot; it was all a joke. they said they never received it, and i got it back in the mail 3 weeks later. it was the same one i just sent back. I called them again and they told me it was too late for a refund. I hesitated to buy this product for so long, because it is so expensive and working for minimum wage is tough. I just cannot believe they would do such things to make money. so disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have ever purchased. Thank goodness I could return it right to Bed Bath and Beyond. This product works slightly better then rubbing your legs with plain paper. Do not ever buy this product.</li>
            <li> overpriced piece of garbage, do not buy!&lt;br /&gt;this product just burns your hear, producing unpleasant smell.. it would be much easier to shave the hair with a shaver.. same result, also painless and no smell, and much cheaper</li>
            <li> Works really good. You can feel it zapping your hair on your upper lip and smell the hair burning. That is the only place there is a slight discomfort but no matter better than waxing and threading. I can pull it out when ever I want zap my hair. Don&#x27;t have to go to the Mall for threading in front of everyone walking the Mall.</li>
            <li> Not good for course hair that is regularly shaved. Invest in something that does what it advertises! Another TV scam!</li>
            <li> False advertising!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ads suggest facial hair around mouth can be safely removed.  Instructions say &amp;#34;No No&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s the truth?  Please help us!</li>
            <li> Shelved for a year because quite frankly I found unwieldy then decided to try one more time to find that the no!no! did not work despite charging overnight.  I called the company and was told that they would be happy to replace if I paid for an extended warranty, i.e., give us even more money.  I blame myself for not researching the product before buying and even more for not returning within the first month when I may have had the chance to recoup my monies although I am sure Radiance would have tried to talk me into keeping.  Anyway, for those who are thinking of purchasing, don&#x27;t buy as it really does not work and customer service is interested only in extracting more money.  Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this thing is a POS.  Do not buy it.  All it does is make the air around you stinky with the smell of burnt hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing basically burns your hair off with a wire.  Yes, the wire has safety guides to keep you from hurting yoursef but because of those guides you can&#x27;t get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like it and tried it over and over but it never got a close enough shave and always left tons of hair behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the buffer pad is where the real hair removal happens but they wear out quickly and need replacing after going over HALF a leg.  So you have to replace those buffer pads all the time and there&#x27;s more $$ down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention the \\&quot;thermocon tips?\\&quot;  Those are the things with the wire that burns your hair off.  They wear out and need to be replaced regularly--so there&#x27;s more $$ down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had read the product reviews before spending $250 bucks on a POS this weekend on HSN.</li>
            <li> I was seriously considering purchasing this product until I discovered this review page! Thank god I did or I would have wasted my money on this obviously BAD product! Sorry to everyone who got ripped off, but thanks for taking the time to put up a review to save others from the same fate! Kassie DePaiva should have to refund everyone&#x27;s money herself, she should be ashamed to continue to represent such an obvious crappy product.</li>
            <li> I got the nono for bakini. It does not work. You have to go over the same very small area many times just to get a little hair gone and not even that much looked gone. It took 15 min to do that. It took an hour to remove just 4 inch patch. I kept going over it for 30 days and still did not get results. Don&#x27;t waist your money</li>
            <li> WOW.. I haven&#x27;t been this disappointed with a product since \\&quot;shrinky Dinks\\&quot;... DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT unless you want major epidermis discomfort and damage.. and want to then BUFF your skin raw with a piece of glorified SAND PAPER to remove the STUBBLE it LEAVES AFTER BURNING OFF A TINY BIT OF HAIR!  This company needs to be put out of business.  I wish I read the customer reviews first! But I was feeling hopeless and the misleading advertising that&#x27;s crammed down your throat got me... Shame on me.  It won&#x27;t happen again!</li>
            <li> I used this about an hour a day around my penis. Well, not only did it not work on the hair, it also shrank my penis by about an inch somehow!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know until I had actually opened the package that this model was not to be used on the face. It also has to be plugged into the wall instead of battery operated. I should have known that there was a reason it was so much cheaper than the model advertised on T.V. That being said, it works fine but you have to be careful to use it correctly or you can get burned. You can&#x27;t just glide it around without looking like they do on the infomercial.</li>
            <li> You said the company is very shady. That was an understatement. When attempting to buy on line yesterday, I mistakenly clicked on one of the many extras they offer. After rejecting all the other page long extras, at the bottom of the page it says \\&quot;next\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Well, \\&quot;next\\&quot; isn&#x27;t next at all. It should say submit! When I hit next, instead of the expected grand total of $104.00, it was nearly $400.00.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I failed to do was scroll down to look for the \\&quot;submit\\&quot; button before I back tracked to change the order. Upon redoing the order, the preferred price became evident. BUT WAIT!!  Now all of a sudden on the submit page it says my $104.00 payment is the first of THREE!!! Oh Hell No!&lt;br /&gt;Nowhere on the entire web site does it even hint that the $104 is just one of 3 payments.&lt;br /&gt;So now, like a dummy I sit here waiting for my money (nearly $500) to be put back into my account though I called them immediately to cancel both orders. At least I talked to a real person and got names instead of some robot.&lt;br /&gt;Say no-no to No-No.</li>
            <li> It removes hair about 20% after 100 applications, not 3-4 like it promised on TV!!! A lot of pain and huge eritation which last for 3 days! Never will use it again!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe what a rip off this is!!!!! It would take you all day long to do one leg and it feels like you shaved it with an electric razor...It stinks because it tries to burn the hair off and only works on flat surfaces, so forget your upper lip and bikini line (which is why I got it) I will be sending this back and only hope I don&#x27;t continue to be charged for the next 2 months since I did payments in 3 months. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It was hard to get used to the sound, but it works.  It sounds like  a cattle prod when you use it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. All it does is to use a thin, heated wire to burn off the hair. This leaves a lot of stubble that you essentially sand off with the buffing pad. It is very easy to get burned, especially on curved surfaces. The hair continues to grow as usual. Be warned. No No is a no!</li>
            <li> Terrible product, waste of money. Fiddly to get the head onto the unit, indicative of short cuts in development. Doesn&#x27;t really work and got stuck &#x27;on&#x27; after about 10 times using it which I reckon is not safe at all. Too late to get my money back, really wish I&#x27;d never bought it. Very expensive mistake.</li>
            <li> Was given this by a friend for Christmas, and It does not do the Job for me. I have used it several times and it does not remove the hair on my legs, She (my friend) bought it in Oct.16,2012 because she gave them plenty of time to get it before Christmas, and now they will not reimburse her,$315.00 that she paid. They said that it was more than 60 days.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.  I have had mine for over a year with no results.  It burns my skin and the hair is still there.  Wish I had sent it back before the warranty ran out.  Will never advise anyone to buy this.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work.  I followed all directions.  This product burned my face and underarms after using as directed in the video and instructions.  I continued to use the No NO on my legs for 6 weeks, using as directed on a regular basis.  My hair did not become thinner or less dense.  It continued to grow as usual.  I have found better results with a cheap shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I feel truly duped.  All the claims were bogus.&lt;br /&gt;The only noticeable result was an awful smell of burnt hair, skin irritation and a waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;Try and get a refund.  NOT.&lt;br /&gt;They really have an ingenious system of fraud.</li>
            <li> This product is a scam! I did my research or so i thought, the product burns your skin and does not remove the hair.The commercial tells you to use your no-no a few times a week, i&#x27;ve been using it for over 5months and still don&#x27;t see a difference.This product absolutely sucks. Waste of $300. Try calling to get your money back, good luck. Money back guarantee...I don&#x27;t think so! Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> I ordered the nono system about two years ago...for surprisingly a total of $400. When i received the shipment, watched the dvd, and tried the product...guess what? It did NOT reduce ANY hair on my body even when i went over the same spot about 10 times. I just thought i should warn you all because i keep seeing it on the infomercials. It barely worked on my facial peach fuzz but thats even when i went over it over and over again. This stupid product broke down after 4/5 months anyways and the hair on my face still grows just as it always has. Oh, and it didn&#x27;t burn the hair down very far so i still had weird stubbly facial peach fuzz, which still grew just as thick/long as it ever has before.&lt;br /&gt;Please! Do not buy this crap. Learn from an unhappy customer.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews before wasting my $300 on this useless gadget. Here are the 3 main bad points. 1-takes forever to do one part of body. 2-doesn&#x27;t give a close shave. 3-hair grows back the next day. I have used it for several months to see if there was less hair growing but, same amount of hair as before use of no no hair. Go to a salon and get laser treatments that will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> This device burnt my skin! It did not remove hair on my face at all! I called before the free trial was up to get an RDA number so I could return it on their dime because they said they would pay the return postage if you didn&#x27;t like it. First of all it was very difficult to talk to a live person. I had to call 5 times before I got a live person. I was told someone would call me back with an RDA number but of course no one ever called me back. I finally had to ship it back on my dime. The company that sells it does a con job on everyone! The NO NO is horrible! I would never recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> NO! NO! IS RIGHT IT SHOULD BE STA MENGHIA ....STA MENGHIA WOULD DO BETTER TO GET RID OF MY FACIAL HAIR</li>
            <li> I would have scored a zero if possible.  This item burns my face and causes a rash without removing the hair.  The cost is enormous. I normally read reviews before I purchase, but this time I failed to do so.  Please take heed and save your money.  I intended to return it, but I waited too late and when I called, they refused to refund my money and were quite rude. I believe this company has committed fraud and has placed a false advertisement.</li>
            <li> I was just sitting down to order this product, when suddenly I decided to check reviews thank you all for the info. I was really sold on the product You have saved me and probably millions of people lots of money I will always check this site for now on about a product It is hard to believe it got a good review from the program view. no no for them.</li>
            <li> At first I was really excited about this product, then I became discouraged because I expected more drastic results sooner. I put it away. Then recently I pulled it back out to give it another try. I realized that it had worked. I had large areas that were hair free. My family didn&#x27;t like the burning hair smell. I have to work around that. Don&#x27;t give up. Keep at it 2X a week and you will see results.</li>
            <li> I bought NO NO over six months ago and have been using it diligently since then but with absolutely no results. I suggest you donate your money to a charity if you want to throw it down the drain. I am about to throw this useless product in the trash bin where it belongs. People save your valuable dollars on something else rather than a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and paid full price for it......a Christmas present to myself.  It turned out not to work at all!!!  I am now in the process of returning it and trying to get my money back!!!  BUYER BEWARE!!!!  DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!</li>
            <li> I had my unit for about 2 months and it died...as in won&#x27;t charge...won&#x27;t work...won&#x27;t anything... I think that is why is called No No.</li>
            <li> Not living up uo rxptectations. Difficult to use and not painless. I wonder of the shaving is actually being done by the blades</li>
            <li> I bought the No!no! for my mother and now I wished someone would have told me \\&quot;No! No!\\&quot; when I did so. I charged the battery and followed all the directions, used the right tip and it didn&#x27;t work. At all. I tried it on myself and it did not work. I believe the whole thing is a scam. They do offer a 60 day money back guarantee but you have to wait until the 45th day you&#x27;ve owned it to claim it; they do this in the hopes that there will be so little time left that you won&#x27;t be able to pack it and ship it in the fifteen days allotted. A disappointment, a piece of junk, and a deceptive return policy. I would never suggest this product to anyone - stay away from it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product last week. Initially I didn&#x27;t expect the burning smell, but it washes off in the shower and you can open a window to get rid of it quickly enough. I bought it because traditional razors were getting expensive and I was getting a rash of my legs from the shaving process. Yes it is quite costly but once you watch the video and practice a bit you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s quite easy to use. My first go on the thigh area left me with a tingly rash - it cleared over night and I&#x27;ve not had it since - you need to go easy for the first couple of days - I gave my self two days off and then used it again over a two day period. My legs have never been so smooth. I would recommend this product if you have a little patience at the start - I&#x27;m in it for the long haul and think this is a very useful product. I bought the classic no no but the instructions say you cannot use it on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: clear DVD instructions - you must watch every section first&lt;br /&gt;Very smooth legs&lt;br /&gt;No stubble rash/wet shaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: pricey&lt;br /&gt;Smells bad at the time (you get use to it)&lt;br /&gt;Under arms/knees a bit harder to do - you need to practise first!</li>
            <li> First off, beware the return shipping policy...they want you to do the full trial.  Therefore, if you start to develop boil-like eruptions on your skin from this product like I did, they expect you to continue using it for the full trial period before they will pay the return shipping.  The commercial is deceiving.  What moron would continue to use a product that is damaging their body?  Also make sure if you change any information when ordering, go back and start from the beginning.  I deleted my option for a second one before I put in my credit card information and they sent it anyway.  It took 2 weeks for the return shipping label to arrive.  Just another unwanted hassle.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it does not glide smoothly over your skin, and they don&#x27;t tell you that the heads need replacement.  Mine burnt out after two weeks.  When I called to return it, they assured me it was defective and sent me another.  But at the cost of this tiny piece of equipment, I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the fact that I would have to continually buy replacement parts at high prices that cost them pennies to make.&lt;br /&gt;Also, are there any studies of the long term effects of this product, or are we the guinea pigs?&lt;br /&gt;To the no-no, I say NO!</li>
            <li> Just about every other reviewer here says it: completely pointless. I had used this thing for about half a year (over twice the 3-month guarantee period) at full power without a SINGLE stitch of progress other than MAYBE my forearms. Anywhere else though (stomach, chest, legs, etc.), it&#x27;s COMPLETELY ineffective. And considering the amount of time it takes to complete a full-body treatment, not to mention having to do it every other day, it would just make far more sense to simply shave once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is it does give my face a closer shave if I use it as a pretreatment before actually shaving (I use an electric razor).</li>
            <li> It was so bad....doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I&#x27;m surprised my favorite stars from the soaps would endorse this.  Money is very tight and to con people into buying something that doesn&#x27;t work, well....they should be ashamed of themselves.  NO NO is a big fat NO NO! I wish I didn&#x27;t have to give it even one star.</li>
            <li> Note to self. If something bears the name No!No! don&#x27;t say Yes Yes.&lt;br /&gt;Awful. Buyer beware. Burns skin. leaves weird burn lines. and permanent red marks even when used only on the lowest level. Forget it. Don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the NoNo Hair Removal Unit.  When I received it I read the product booklet.  I was surprised to see one of the first things it said was NOT to use it on your face.  I was sure that the product advertisement showed a woman shaving her mustache area (which I have seen the ad since then, and it does).  Anyway, I also found that the smell of burning hair was nausiating and so for the price that I paid for it, back it went.</li>
            <li> Save your money.  No!No! does not work.  I tried using it for about 4 months and it did not work at all!!!!</li>
            <li> What an expensive piece of crap! I will take a razor over no no any day. You don&#x27;t have to smell burning hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re money on this even with the one year warranty. Every time you have a problem with this product, you have to pay for the shipping back; it cost me $10. I have sent it back once already because the battery would not charge; and received a \\&quot;new\\&quot; one that&#x27;s power button is extremely difficult to turn off and on. When talking to customer service, they stated that they were aware of the problem, yet I would still have to pay for the shipping to have it fixed a second time. If I would have known in advance that this company knew of the technical problems and would still charge me to have it repaired, I would never have invested. The worst part is, the product doesn&#x27;t even work well at removing hair in the first place :(</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after much consideration of the possible pros and cons. I was enticed by the company&#x27;s offer of a triple money back guarantee (*see note below*), but I was worried that they wouldn&#x27;t follow through with their promise if the product didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived within the time frame it was promised and I immediately charged it so I could try it. Unfortunately, this product did not work at all for me. It&#x27;s difficult to control and extremely picky. Over the next few weeks I tried it on different lengths of stubble, all to no avail. I went back to the website to see about returning the product and found the \\&quot;fine print\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*You must keep and use your No!No! for at least 45 days before returning it or they will not pay the return shipping. You must also return the No!No! BEFORE 60 days or your money back guarantee is void. Thank goodness I was only on day 24(ish) - I made sure to mark my calendar and set an alert for Day 45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the return process, I was nervous that something would go wrong - either they would claim to not have received my return, or they would take forever in crediting my bank account, or they would keep taking money from me. I was proved wrong (so far): They credited me less than a week after my item  had been confirmed as delivered (it was only 1 payment of 2, but they quickly remedied that issue when I emailed them - I have been fully refunded as of today). They have not yet taken another \\&quot;payment\\&quot; out of my account, but I will be watching for the next few months to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while it didn&#x27;t work for me, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re thinking about it. Just be sure to read ALL the fine print before you hand over your information.</li>
            <li> A scammer from ebay used my name &amp; address to buy one of these units and somehow had it sent to her...in canada. I live in Alabama and out of the blue, I get a letter from a collection agency saying I owe $150-195 or something.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently she paid for part of it, then resold them on ebay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should not allow people to bill 3rd parties. I told the company &amp; I told ebay and I think they eventually kicked her off ebay. Her username was boutiquecrocs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That and all the negative reviews tells me all I need to know about this company.</li>
            <li> 1.  Any hair removal is a very time consuming process, I don&#x27;t care what method you use.  Be aware it will take a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  It is a process, it takes two weeks just to get the technique down, and get settled into a routine.  I suggest starting out in a small area first while you are learning.  I used my no no every three days to give my skin a break from the irritation.  Follow the directions!  They are put there for a reason.  Zap the long hair, buff.  Zap the short hair, buff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It takes awhile for you to train the hairs, so there is a great potential for ingrown hairs.  This looks like pimples or white heads.  Do not use your no no until this rash clears up.  What worked for me is a cotton ball soaked in witch hazel over the area after every use, and every day there after. ( this closes the pores.)  Once you get better with the technique and how to use your no no properly, this problem will disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been working on just my face for the first two weeks.  Chin, upper lip and side burn area.  I am using it every three days and the ingrown hairs rash is gone.  I believe waiting three days is allowing the next batch of hair to grow to the perfect length for removal, so its easier in my skin too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be disheartened, muscle thru it just as described above.  It is going to take months for the hair to start growing in more softly and thinner.  I had very course chin hair, and my chin felt like sandpaper when I ran my hand over my chin area for about two weeks.  moisturize ONLY after using the witch hazel and then sparingly, or this will clog your pores and make things worse.  Follow the directions, wach the video, be patient.  Don&#x27;t over use it, that isnt good for your skin and wont speed up the process.</li>
            <li> The most disappointing item I ever bought, it did not work from day one. I&#x27;m only sorry I did not return it right away, it is not worth the money, I believe that it&#x27;s a scam. I don&#x27;t care what they say about everyone loving it that is false advertisement and according to the reviews I read ( all of them) they all feel the same way I feel. We should start a law suit and get our money back. As one of the reviewers stated ( No No DON&#x27;T WORK, don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
            <li> This is possibly the worst product I have purchased. I thought that with all the positive advertisement that it was receiving that it was going to be a great product.  NOT!  It does not remove any hair at all!  I would not buy this product.  Customer Service was not willing to give me a refund, they just kept telling me I was using it wrong. It isn&#x27;t rocket science, I read the directions.  DIDN\\&quot;T WORK!</li>
            <li> I bought the NoNo thinking it was only about $100.00 and I was getting it for $80.00, so I decided to try it.  My friend was curious about it so was my mom.  They first sent me one that looked used and had little burnt hairs on it. The lady told me that those hairs came off of the little brush that was packed with it.  I should have took the hint there that this was a scam. (Turns out the little brush comes covered in plastic, hard for hairs to escape)&lt;br /&gt;But, I said I would give them the benefit of the doubt and let them send me another one. I only used it on a very small section of my face daily or every other day as they recommend.  As someone else said, it just burned off the hair from the top of the skin and there was still stubble there that you rub away with the little round sand paper thing.  The next day you can feel the stubble as if you had done nothing.  I figured, for $89.00 I may just keep it and let my mom have it but then I saw my credit card had been charged again, so I called them to find out it wasn&#x27;t $89.00 but $89.00 three times! Only I was lucky and I got a discount so I only paid $219.00!!!!  What a rip off!&lt;br /&gt;I am so disappointed for falling for this scam.  They are slick, hide the true price in the fine print. But it was my fault for falling for it.  It does not work.  Please do yourself a favor, do not buy it!</li>
            <li> I tried to leave a review on the actual website but they don&#x27;t give that option. This thing made me bleed after pinching my skin so badly that it was all red for hours afterward. I thought I would be able to use it on my legs but after using it on my upper lip I knew that process would be way too painful and slow. I ended up throwing in the garbage a week after I bought it. I felt so stupid that I spent $30 on a stupid piece of plastic. Do not buy one!</li>
            <li> I wanted what I saw on TV, the facial product, I got one that was only good for legs.  Kind of deceptive advertising.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have ever bought the thing. Highly disappointed! Not only do you spend a tremendous amount of time doing it, it doesn&#x27;t even give results. On top of that, it quit working 6 months after purchase. Save your money!!!</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and packaged nicely, however, I didn&#x27;t realize it burns your unwanted hair off, leaving the smell of burned hair with you. I gave it to my sister and she loves it.  Expensive gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using \\&quot;No-No\\&quot; almost every day since March. It is now May 2nd and I have NOT noticed any results. For the amount of time I spend using the No-No, it is quicker to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, whenever I used the larger tip, the red light always came and the No-No stopped no matter how I angled it. So, I have to use the small tip to do my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to return the No-No when the trial period is up and order a Tria Laser instead.</li>
            <li> Just bought this for hair removal from my face.  First negative..hair needs to be 1-3mm.  I am in a Professional office.  Cannot allow my facial hair to get that long...yuck!  Did give it a try over the weekend....area on my chin has been red and swollen for over 3 days.  Followed the instructions exactly.  Also....if you get drawn in by the $100 Gift Card....FORGET IT!!!  Example.....Appleby&#x27;s $50 gift cards....sound good, but oh, wait, theres more.  You only get to use $5 off of their gift card and you have to pay the other $45.  Seriously????  I would have rather had the free ginzu knives : )</li>
            <li> Everyone should be contacting the better business bureau and whoever else may help about all their problems with the product and the company that sells it being so shady. If radiancy is not being helpful with the return do a charge-back on your credit card and tell them you will be.</li>
            <li> Hi, I purchased a nono for my wifes&#x27; christmas, she followed the instruction exactly, but unfortunately it did not work for her. It got rid of the hair but did not stop the stubble.We really wanted it to work, and gave it every oppertunity but no joy. If you are thinking of trying it give it a go, it may work for you. I contacted nono for a full refund, and received it within 3 days.Full marks to nono, pity it did not work.&lt;br /&gt;  Mike</li>
            <li> I was looking to order one for my girlfriend. I visited the \\&quot;trynono.com\\&quot; website.  They make you enter your information in order to review the products. I noticed it was only $108 advertised on the front page. I got to the billing info after entering my AMX card and noticed in fine print that I would be charged 2 additional payments.  At that point I backed out and closed my browser.I never finished submitting the order!!!!! Two weeks later the NoNo showed up on my doorstep. It was not even packed in a shipping box.  A label was smacked right on the outside of the NoNo box, which was trashed by the time it got to me! I contacted the company by email and their customer service.  I have not heard back.  I DID NOT EVEN SUBMIT MY ORDER!!  I received no email confirmation, duh, since I never submit an order.  Their website saves all your information and they send you the NoNo and bill you. They even sent me a NoNo for men and was planning on ordering for my girlfriend.  I contacted American Express to start a fraud claim.  Do yourself a favor and do not order anything from Radiancy.  There are a lot of websites claiming they are unbiased reviews, but have links to the \\&quot;trynono.com\\&quot; website.  If all the reviews on any website are positive, be leary, because it is paid for by NoNo.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to make the claim that it doesn&#x27;t do as advertised, just that it doesn&#x27;t do it for me.  I haven&#x27;t made but one or two attempts to use it since the first time was a real disappointment.  I couldn&#x27;t tell that it removed a single hair.</li>
            <li> This really does NOT work , but forget that - the company itself is a SCAM company so EVEN if it was working - I&#x27;d still say DON&#x27;T BUY !&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s not... so DOUBLE don&#x27;t buy !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st sign of SCAM was that their Advertisement on TV didn&#x27;t really say the price...&lt;br /&gt;2nd sign of SCAM was that their Web Site did not say the price... it hides it in the bottom... saying $99... then adds - and another $99 next month... and then another...&lt;br /&gt;So whatever. I bought it from a friend who didn&#x27;t want it. But the SIGNS WERE THERE !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless - the product is a SCAM as well. It does NOT work.&lt;br /&gt;The reason no other company invented a hair removal that works on HEAT is that it&#x27;s NOT working...&lt;br /&gt;Heat is NOT laser. It doesn&#x27;t do anything... it doesn&#x27;t kill the root. It&#x27;s useless and dangerous for your face and gentle areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more of a Gimmick than anything else but why waste so much money on a Gimmick that doesn&#x27;t really do its job ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say NO to NoNO ! and I think they chose that name on Purpose...&lt;br /&gt;I paid only $50 for it - but my garbage would probably prefer the $50... that&#x27;s where it is right now ! that&#x27;s where it belongs...</li>
            <li> Please save yourself $200.00!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS a complete SCAM, SCAM, SCAM!&lt;br /&gt;IT DOES NOT WORK&lt;br /&gt;i used the unit for a few times, could not tell a difference at all. the unit finally stopped working and i could not get a refund or could not get it looked at for repair by NO NO even though i offered to pay for repair.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT DO THIS- YOU WILL BE SORRY!!!&lt;br /&gt;THIS COMPANY HAS NO SHAME</li>
            <li> I was given the NO!NO! as a gift and was very excited to get it. I had seen the commercials where you could use it on your face and legs etc...Before I go further I will say that I have baby fine hair, not coarse. I do not think this made a difference as I let a friend of mine try it on her coarse hair and still the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was the smell they warn you about, I could even see hair burning. But even after several weeks of use, following the instructions, I have never gotten a smooth spot on my legs and all it did on my face was burn. The hair was still there. At first the hair was just singed, so I thought maybe I needed to go over it a few more times as the instructions said. I did...and got burned on my legs too. The hair was still there,all beit singed. I kept it up, I am lucky to have very light hair so only noticeable when the sun hits it just right. lol But after several weeks I still have not had anywhere near good results. My boyfriend even got offended thinking I had not used the gift his mom gave me. That was embarrassing. I would not recommend this product to anyone. My friend with the coarse hair only tried a couple of times before she gave up but she had even worse results than I did.</li>
            <li> This No-No hair removal product is a total waste of money. It did not remove any of my hair like the infomercial and website claimed it would. In the infomercial, they don&#x27;t really show anyone up close as they&#x27;re using the product, just from farther away, so there is no visual proof that it works before buying it. I guess I was fooled though, and bought their product anyway. All I got out of it was the smell of burned hair, and after using it, I had just as much hair as before using it. I would never purchase any more products from this company again. In my opinion, it&#x27;s all just a scam.</li>
            <li> I had limited results on arms, face and underarms. Zero success on legs! Zipper case broke within 7 days, large tip broke &lt; 14 days, two more large tips broke &lt; 42 days. Argumentative and rude responses from Cust Service rep Joe on 44th trial day! Would not transfer to a manager and gave an incorrect # to reach me within 72hrs. BUYER BE AWARE!</li>
            <li> The product does not do what it advertises.  I have to admit - I was skeptical to begin with but I read various reviews on line and there were enough positive one that I thought I would give it a try.  I tried it for about 3 months and all that resulted was a lovely bouquet of burning hair smell.  I found that immediately after I used it (no matter how many swipes) there was still \\&quot;stubble\\&quot;.  I tried it on my bikini like and I would still have to go shave to feel confident enough to go into public!  It basically clipped off the top bit of hair, leaving behind some stubble near the root and grew back just the same as it had been shaved.  Useless.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in the hopes it would perform even a fraction as well as it does on the informercial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, it doesn&#x27;t.  The product does not take off any hair at all!  I followed all instructions, but it simply doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called asking for the return authorization as promised in their 60 day guarantee.  They tried to tell me to be patient that it takes time for results.  I again informed them that it wasn&#x27;t taking ANY hair off...so it isn&#x27;t about waiting to see if the hair grows back or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered another product: a cream to use after using the NoNO...a $50 value for free. This cream will supposedly open up the follicle to allow the hair to fall out.  I said no thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was then told that I would have to wait until 45 days had elapsed before I could return the product or else they would not honor the free return shipping.  What an excellent scam!  You have a window of only 15 days (after the 45th day but prior to the 60th day) in order to get the company to honor their promise.  The rep told me this was advertised on their commercials and website.  Funny, I have seen the infomercial many times and that was never prominently mentioned.  It must be in the fine print.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I will set a calandar reminder and will call during the precious time frame of 45-60 days and request my return authorization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I called after the 45 days (but before the 60) and was given a return authorization number.  I was told the email with the return label would arrive in 7-10 business days and that I had only 10 days for the label to be valid.  Really???  10 days to send an email?  My guess is they are hoping you will forget about the email and then by the time you remember, the authorization will have expired!  It has been 4 business days so far and no email.</li>
            <li> imagine my disappointment when after suffering years of unwanted hair i wasted my hard earned money on a no no people dont do it</li>
            <li> I bought a no!no! a few months ago. After a couple weeks of sporadic uses, I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in my hair thickness/darkness, but the condition of the device itself. It started getting a lot quieter and weaker. It does (or did, rather) remove the hair immediately, but it grew back. The smell of burning hair didn&#x27;t bother me too much, but i found that it only worked on decently long hair-no leg stubble. I also had a huge issue with the actual purchase. Some deal advertised on their website caught my eye and lead me to buying the no!no!. But, it turns out that I still have to pay the initial amount, which I would NOT have done if I had known. So, before you drop $300 on this bi-polar machine, I suggest you only do so if you have that money to blow.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times since I purchased it. The hair on my legs and arms are thinning and growing less coarse. The smell of burning hair the first time I used it concerned me, but the appliance itself does not burn the skin.</li>
            <li> Yeah, yeah, yeah....you have to use it daily in order to get it to work, but it really does not work.  The smell of burning hair, and all the effort it takes...why not just shave.  So much easier.  This was a waste of money, and I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I got the no no as a gift. I&#x27;d been begging for one for 6 months. While I was waiting for it to arrive I started reading customer reviews. I got a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach after seeing more than 90% of the reviews were negative. My boyfriend calls me an informercial impulse buyer... So you know darn well I wasn&#x27;t going to share the horrible reviews with him. I opened the box with trembling hands and decided to follow the instructions to the letter because I refused to be duped again by &amp;#34;an amazing, too good to be true&amp;#34; television product. To my surprise no no was on point. I am a very hairy African American woman who had a full 5&#x27;o clock shadow by noon, when I waxed or tweezed. I first tried a patch on my forearm just to get the feel of the product. Then I went on with my more than peach fuzzy face. WOW!!! It worked. Sure it took more than the recommended two to three passes over each spot. But with some sincere determination and nothing but time on my hands... I watched the dark patches of hair give way to smooth hair free skin. I am a believer after one use. I feel that it may take several weeks to achieve that clean look for a long term, BUT I&#x27;m sold and very satisfied with my no no.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk!! Stay away!! On top of that they charged my extra 100 dollars after a month. That a piece of crap! Worst money waste ever!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Problems with getting promised refund on shipping. Hidden clause on shipping refund. Must have kept product for 45 days to qualify for shipping refund. Customer service line difficult to get through. CS rep was rude and tried to make me feel stupid/ guilty. Lost $20 bucks in shipping costs. Bottom line if it doesn&#x27;t remove your hair on the first go, how will you ever get to the point of having little or no hair to remove....??</li>
            <li> This product does not work AND they lie about the return policy. You WILL lose money, there IS NO risk free trial, as it is a scam. I found out the hard way.</li>
            <li> This was the biggest waste of time! I have PCOS which is a hormonal issue that causes the extra hair. I used the NO No for the full 60 days and no results what so ever. Now the hair that wasnt that bad is worse so I have financed laser treatments to get rid of it  once and for all. The only good thing about the NO No was that it was very easy to get a refund</li>
            <li> I had slight facial hair like most women.  I thought NoNo would eliminate it as claimed.  Not only does it NOT remove hair, it just burns it down to a stubble. Getting the hair around the lips (which is what most women are after) is impossible.  Now I am contending with a white peach fuzz-type of stubble all over my face. It&#x27;s short, it sticks straight out, it is VERY noticeable, and when my hair touches my face it STICKS TO MY FACE.  Worst product I&#x27;ve ever purchased and the price was outrageous for such a huge failure. I CANNOT believe for one minute that the endorsements they claim they have are true. I have no clue how this product is still on the market. Do not waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> im just not happy with this product.  It doesnt remove hair like commercial.  Wondering if there is different models?  The smell when using it is awful</li>
            <li> I am so disgusted by this product, I don&#x27;t know where to start...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I&#x27;m going to say is that NoNo does NOT work. It does not do what it is advertised to do. I did use it, and it literally took me 2 hours for half a leg. PLUS, the end result is that it crystallize (burnt) the tips of the hair, while leaving the hair as is (visible)!!! What&#x27;s the point of having hair witch crystallized tips. It&#x27;s an absolute scam. IN ADDITION, you cannot return the product within 45 days of purchasing it. It needs to be returned between 45 and 60 day. Hence, my assumption that this company is using your money in other ways (investment, interest, ...?) during that period of time and making a profit out of it even if you ultimately return the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an absolute scam and I wish someone would stop them.</li>
            <li> SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;1- The product is completely useless. do not waste your time or money.&lt;br /&gt;2- They take your money in a split second, but promise return in 28 days, which doesn&#x27;t happen that way.</li>
            <li> My chin hair is gone! I bought the nono about six weeks ago and am 100% satisfied with the results. I used the nono at least 4 times a week on my chin, upper lip and legs and I no longer have hair in any of these places. I suggest that you follow the directions and make sure you buff after each nono use, since that really seemed to help get rid of those stubborn hairs.  I have spent most of my adult life trying everything on my face to get rid of the stubborn chin and upper lip growth and this is the only product that has worked for me.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bought this device about a year ago and used it as directed for about 3 months. It is difficult and time consuming to use but, I persisted hoping to get results. It worked to remove the hair on my arms but did not work at all on my legs where I have coarser hair. As far as their claims about less hair coming back and eventually stopping, they are absolutely untrue. The same amount of hair remains on my arms. The product is also poorly made and can easily cause burns. The device stopped working completely in about 8 weeks and I had to send it back for replacement. They made me pay for shipping their defective product back to them. The one I received in return was refurbished and they said that the warranty would not be extended to year from the replacement date and the original date of purchase still determined to end of the one year warranty. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> If there was a way to rate something 0 stars, I would rate this no stars.  I was so excited to finally order the no!no! hair removal system, I did not check out reviews like I usually do.  A BIG MKSTAKE!!  I obtained it beginning of May, only a few days after ordering it, to my amazement that they managed their orders so quickly &amp; efficiently.  More on that later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After carefully reading all instructions carefully, I couldn&#x27;t figure out why I could smell the burnt hair of the very fine hairs of my face but it was not removing any of the coarse hairs on my upper lip or the ones in hard to get at places under my chin that started growing after menopause.  Reread everything I could find, &amp; followed instructions until I called them middle of June about the problems I was having.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Oh, NOone has any of those problems unless they aren&#x27;t doing it right,\\&quot; the customer rep assured me, &amp; she reiterated everything I had already read.  I agreed to try it another month, but explained I wasn&#x27;t too keen on trying to remove specific hair for 2-3X/week for 6 months to see if it worked or not, I explained after she repeated that it also \\&quot;took time for it to work.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After it not working or burning my face if I did more than the recommended 2 swipes, I called them July  3 to cancel the order of any more cream &amp; return the no!no!.  I was promised it would take less than a week to get the return label.  After calling them weekly to tell them it hadn&#x27;t arrived, (due to their mistake), I finally obtained it July 27, &amp; returned the package the same day I finally had obtained the code &amp; return label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AFTER I had returned the no!no!, a month AFTER I had canceled it, they still took an additional $90 I had not budgeted for out of my account on the last day of July, a week in advance of the scheduled withdrawal. It cost me another $30 for being overdrawn.  I&#x27;m wondering why they would do that, unless they were afraid they couldn&#x27;t get their hands on itany other way?  I just can&#x27;t figure it out--they can manage an order &amp; withdrawal instantly but it takes WEEKS/possibly months to cancel an order &amp; get your money back?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yah, the triple refund promised isn&#x27;t, if you read the small print.  Anything they ship to you AFTER you cancel something is charged a $15 *restocking* charge, even if you send it in the same package back like I did.  So for something guaranteed to not cost a penny if you don&#x27;t like it just to try it, a wasted $45.  If you like to waste $$ &amp; lose time &amp; energy dealing with a ripoff, this is the gizmo for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, it&#x27;s Aug. 8 &amp; I have not obtained the refund promised in 3-4 day like the customer rep promised.  I also found print in a related site stating it takes 1-2 billing cycles to get your refund.  How long is one of their billing cycles, I&#x27;m wondering now.  (Sorry so long)</li>
            <li> What a bad product this is, its downright dangerous! and so expensive. NoNo refused to allow me to send it back after it burned my skin because it was after 60 days now they are saying I am going to be given over to bad debt collectors fro not paying the last two instalments what a terrible and inconsiderate company! Bad form NoNo.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time, The unit barley succeeded removing anything at all. And even got small burns.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: Man experience.</li>
            <li> very disappointed TV Commercial showed one thing instructions said another. So therefore I was very disappointed in product it did not do what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> I used this piece of crap for over a year and nothing but discolored skin. So then I moved on to the more expensive laser hair removal which actually worked really well. Do yourself a favor and invest the extra money in professional laser hair removal. This garbage is a joke.</li>
            <li> I purchased the no no(the name fits) 1. It burned my chin 2. The hairs returned, and the no no did not remove it, burned my chin trying to remove it. Save your money and pay a professional.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on the 13th of November but didn&#x27;t recieve it untill the 3rd December.  As you can imagine I was desperate to get started as I was like a cave woman.  BOY WAS I DISSAPOINTED! I watched the disc and followed the instructions carefully as it is quite tricky to use. It didnt burn the hair down to the skin as seen on AD, but left about 2mm stubble.  I used the buffer &#x27;wet &amp; dry sandpaper really&#x27; provided to remove it, nothing happened.  So i&#x27;m going back to waxing. £69 I paid for it which was&#x27;nt full price as I had a voucher. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY. NO NO don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> This products is grossly over priced and the web site missadvertises the price, They said it would be 110 but each month following the original purchace date they charged and additional hundred. Three hundred dollars later, the No No the most overpriced hair removal machine on the market! The lady who spoke to me regaurding the return offored no grace period on the sixty day trial; so if your husband is a procrastinator too you will be stuck with it like it or not.The name ironically carries new meaning for me now as a fleece down for my dollars by a foreign con artists hiding behind a website to pretending to be legitimate!In canada if the customer is unsatisfied with the product and has the original reciept we believe its the customers right to return it.</li>
            <li> Please Please,, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt; if you are a female with average to course hair you are in serious trouble if you follow the user guidelines which clearly state how to use the product in a fluid continuous motion.&lt;br /&gt;you will have second degree burns and no hair removal it is nothing more than a shaver with heat and that is it..&lt;br /&gt;IF you are a guy trying to remove course chest hair and arm hair FORGET THIS PRODUCT IT WILL BURN YOUR SKIN AND YOU WILL BE MAKING A VISIT TO THE E.R WITH SECOND DEGREE BURNS AND WORSE BLISTERING AND DAMAGED SKIN,&lt;br /&gt; THE SMELL OF BURNING FLESH IS WHAT YOU WILL GET PLAIN AND SIMPLE.&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT IS A RIP OFF A SCAM IN THE WORST DEGREE AND TRUST ME YOU WILL NEVER GET A REFUND NOT EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  customer service DON&#x27;T MAKE ME LAUGH I WAS RUDELY HUNG UP ON THREE TIMES AND TRIED TO GET THROUGH SEVEN OR EIGHT TIMES  I WAS ON HOLD FOR ONE HOUR AND FORTY FIVE MINUTES TRYING TO GET A REFUND I BELIEVE ITS NOT POSSIBLE SO I THREW THE THING IN THE GARBAGE AND LOST OVER TWO HUNDRED BUCKS.  I WILL SAY no no don&#x27;t buy this product</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY DISSS PRODUCT! i used it on the lowest setting and i have burns all over my face:((( This is a complete waste of money and should never be put on the internet. Instead of paying for this product, they should be paying you to use it. If you want to smell like your face caught on fire then this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking of buying this to try it, I would reconsider.  Mine was purchased as a gift and the guarantee starts the day you receive it. I contacted them on day 60, they didn&#x27;t get back to me.  So I called them a couple days later and they wouldn&#x27;t issue a RMA because it was now beyond the 60 days.  They said they&#x27;d escalate my request to corporate and I&#x27;d hear back in 5-7 days.  Ten days went by with no contact so I called again and my request was denied.  So they don&#x27;t get back to me and now it&#x27;s my fault.  Now they refuse to issue me a RMA to return it because its after 60 days.  I don&#x27;t know what to do, I can&#x27;t afford to loose this kind of money.  I felt I did everything I was suppose to ... now what?!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a NONO since Christmas and I love it so I ordered one for my daughter&#x27;s birthday.  Hope she loves it too!</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!  This sucks.  First off, if you use it on you face, you will most likely burn yourself.  If you want to use it on your legs, plan on hanging out for a while and then plan on shaving your legs after, because it takes forever for it to remove anything and when it does, there is still is stubble remaining.  Do not buy this product!</li>
            <li> I know for a fact Bed Bath and Beyond offers this product for around $250..not to mention you can use a coupon on it..which makes it even cheaper. This price should be significantly lower.</li>
            <li> Not for face a small fact you left out.  I thought I was buying an older model to save some money.  Of course I had it  opened up before I could see the notice.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all, not effective hair removal,  the result looked like a bad shave.  Save your money avoid</li>
            <li> I am embarrassed that I bought this product and didn&#x27;t return it. I thought if I used it more I would get results. didn&#x27;t happen. smells so bad nobody would want that smell in their home or on their body. It did nothing to the hair on my legs. removed most hair from face but had a rash and the hair just grew back as usual. waste of money!</li>
            <li> Please know that if you buy this product and pay in full, you CANNOT return it, after 60 days, for even a partial refund. I tried to give the unit an opportunity to work, I gave it longer than 60 days because I wanted to make sure that I was using it properly, but when I still had to razor shave I decided to return it. The web site it a little misleading. I thought if I did the partial payments, I had only 60 days. Not so. They will not take it back at all. I understand a time limit for a %100 refund, however, to not be able to return it at all with even a partial refund is a terrible practice in the retail world. Buyer beware!!!</li>
