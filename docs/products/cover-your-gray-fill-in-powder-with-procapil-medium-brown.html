    <ol>
            <li>Which is awesome because that&#x27;s what I bought it for!</li>
            <li>The brush that came with it was the best thing about it.</li>
            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>I picked the shade medium brown and it&#x27;s a perfect match.</li>
            <li>and it covers excellently!</li>
            <li>Color match is not the best,  however,  does a great job for in between colorings.  </li>
            <li>This product does not cover gray, but it does a great job of making a widening part blend in and not look neon.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried sprays, the lipstick waxy stuff, and the mascara kind for hair, and this is (in my opinion) the best.  </li>
            <li>brush is a great size for coverage and blending.</li>
            <li>Came with great brush.  </li>
            <li>very nice</li>
            <li>not as good as &amp;#34;Joan Rivers Have a Great Hair Day&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Good results and saved a ton of money.</li>
            <li>When I wash my hair I rub and massage my scalp really good</li>
            <li>If I use this brush on, I can delay a dye for 2 months or more!</li>
            <li>It Covers your scalp really nice</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know for sure; however, I tried it on my eyebrows and</li>
            <li>I have to apply it many times in order to get coverage, and it doesn&#x27;t stick to the scalp at all like the fill-in powder does.  </li>
            <li>Have another product that does a better job.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product!  </li>
            <li>I will try one more time and order a darker color.</li>
            <li>Toppik brand works better.</li>
            <li>Tried to save money, and the price is good, but if you want quick and easy coverage, don&#x27;t buy this one.  </li>
            <li>Best fill in powder than any other product.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I&#x27;m using of this kind</li>
            <li>Product I ordered was 3 of light brown-blond.</li>
            <li>I got the medium brown and it has a hint of red to it, which is also a good thing as I have some auburn tint in my salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>My favorite and much cheaper than the store.</li>
            <li>a result, I will be returning them for full refund.</li>
            <li>A few more color choices would be nice.</li>
            <li>The powder seemed promising and I loved the brush for dabbing the powder and then applying it to just the part -- the only PROBLEM IS THE POWDER DOESN&#x27;T stick to your scalp at all</li>
            <li>This was a huge disappointment because the way it&#x27;s applied is so perfect.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not awful, just not anything terrific.</li>
            <li>first time buying</li>
            <li>First off.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this so much on my scalp -</li>
            <li>I pretty much have the exact issue that is shown on the box - the &#x27;too white&#x27; part that draws attention to my thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>wow, that really works well.</li>
            <li>Gives me new confidence in my appearance.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and covers the grey.  </li>

            <li> Takes way too long to apply.  </li>
            <li> Then once my hair is dry I apply the stuff again.</li>
            <li> Makes hair flat &amp; weighted down.</li>
            <li> but when I put my hair up I don&#x27;t mind it as much, all I need is the whiteness of my scalp not to shine through that badly and this powder does that job really well.</li>
            <li> arr&#x27;d crushed.]</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I want but will keep it since 2-tone hair color is the rave now.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t make comparisons to other brands .</li>
            <li> However the consistency of the product was extremely powdery and did not apply to roots,scalp, and hair with any amount  of coverage.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I thought I ordered dark brown.  </li>
            <li> The dark brown is dark (almost black)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to blend it out on your skin</li>
            <li> I have used Joan Rivers&#x27; Fill-In powder in the past, and this is not nearly as good.  </li>
            <li> Colors are weak.  </li>
            <li> Still not happy about exorbitnt shipping charge either.</li>
            <li> Comes with a little brush which I hate  because it sheds like crazy, but I&#x27;m still using it!</li>

            <li> This product does not cover gray, but it does a great job of making a widening part blend in and not look neon. Which is awesome because that&#x27;s what I bought it for! A few more color choices would be nice. I got the medium brown and it has a hint of red to it, which is also a good thing as I have some auburn tint in my salt and pepper. Bought this product because of it&#x27;s cheaper price, and it paid off! Good results and saved a ton of money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this so much on my scalp - maybe has something in it I&#x27;m allergic to, I don&#x27;t know for sure; however, I tried it on my eyebrows and wow, that really works well.</li>
            <li> I have used Joan Rivers&#x27; Fill-In powder in the past, and this is not nearly as good.  I have to apply it many times in order to get coverage, and it doesn&#x27;t stick to the scalp at all like the fill-in powder does.  Tried to save money, and the price is good, but if you want quick and easy coverage, don&#x27;t buy this one.  Also tried the Claudia Stevens one and gave it 3 stars only because there are 2 colors instead of 1 in this one.</li>
            <li> I the powder was completely crushed in the case, so I sent back. I won&#x27;t be ordering anything like that again. I&#x27;ll buy off the shelf from now on.</li>
            <li> I could have bought brown eye shadow and used it. The brush that came with it was the best thing about it. It&#x27;s not awful, just not anything terrific.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover as well as I hoped. Have another product that does a better job. Still not happy about exorbitnt shipping charge either. Beware the &#x27;1-click&#x27; purchase option!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Not waxy, stays on til you shampoo it out.  The brush comes with it and it&#x27;s A GREAT PRODUCT. I&#x27;ve tried sprays, the lipstick waxy stuff, and the mascara kind for hair, and this is (in my opinion) the best.  The dark brown is dark (almost black) so I did the medium brown.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all...I pretty much have the exact issue that is shown on the box - the &#x27;too white&#x27; part that draws attention to my thinning hair.  The powder seemed promising and I loved the brush for dabbing the powder and then applying it to just the part -- the only PROBLEM IS THE POWDER DOESN&#x27;T stick to your scalp at all so I have no clue where the powder goes!  This was a huge disappointment because the way it&#x27;s applied is so perfect.  I think if it had some moisture in it, just a teeny bit, it might work...but it doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> My favorite and much cheaper than the store.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product!  Gives me new confidence in my appearance.</li>
            <li> not as good as &amp;#34;Joan Rivers Have a Great Hair Day&amp;#34;.  Colors are weak.  I will try one more time and order a darker color.</li>
            <li> I thought I ordered dark brown.  What I got was medium brown.  Not exactly what I want but will keep it since 2-tone hair color is the rave now.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that I&#x27;m using of this kind so I can&#x27;t make comparisons to other brands . It Covers your scalp really nice but it&#x27;s hard to blend it out on your skin, often it looks blotchy on mine but when I put my hair up I don&#x27;t mind it as much, all I need is the whiteness of my scalp not to shine through that badly and this powder does that job really well. Comes with a little brush which I hate  because it sheds like crazy, but I&#x27;m still using it! The actual formula is powdery, similar to eyeshadows. It lasts for months because as the description says it&#x27;s water and sweat proof. I work out every day and let me tell you, the product stays put. When I wash my hair I rub and massage my scalp really good, that&#x27;s the only way to remove the powder. Then once my hair is dry I apply the stuff again. This means 2 applications per week for me as I&#x27;m washing my hair twice. I picked the shade medium brown and it&#x27;s a perfect match. This stuff is giving me the confidence I need while I&#x27;m figuring out why my hair is thinning, I never miss applying it, I wouldn&#x27;t even go outside without this.</li>
            <li> very nice and it covers excellently! first time buying and I will definitely buy again. brush is a great size for coverage and blending.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t work on my hair &amp; I don&#x27;t know why. [Also pkg. arr&#x27;d crushed.]</li>
            <li> Best fill in powder than any other product.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and covers the grey.  Came with great brush.  I am not a fan of dying my hair every month.  If I use this brush on, I can delay a dye for 2 months or more!</li>
            <li> Color match is not the best,  however,  does a great job for in between colorings.  I have repurchased this product.</li>
            <li> Not returning, but I would not buy again. This is like eye shadow for the scalp, and it doesn&#x27;t even cover that. Makes hair flat &amp; weighted down. Takes time to apply &amp; did not like results.</li>
            <li> I have darker hair. This medium brown can&#x27;t fully cover my gray hair. Need to get the darker shade next time.</li>
            <li> Color did not match description.</li>
            <li> First off. Product I ordered was 3 of light brown-blond. They arrived in a timely manner. However the consistency of the product was extremely powdery and did not apply to roots,scalp, and hair with any amount  of coverage.&lt;br /&gt;As a result, I will be returning them for full refund.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product.  Takes way too long to apply.  Toppik brand works better.</li>
