            <li>Before I begin I need to say that I was able to try a free sample of this product.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this as part of a bzz agent campaign and wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d like a gel antiperspirant....</li>
            <li>Best of all, no matter how careful I am with putting on deodorant, it always seems to happen once or twice a week...</li>
            <li>I loved the scent and found it smelled very feminine.  </li>
            <li>The antiperspirant really works to keep me smelling good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any marks which is great when i&#x27;m changing from work to gym, but it still keeps me feeling dry and smelling great even after an intense workout!</li>
            <li>Other times, one click is perfect.</li>
            <li>I tried other deodorants, and I wasn&#x27;t happy!  </li>
            <li>TOTALLY TRUE!</li>
            <li>I love the Completely Clean scent and</li>
            <li>I love the clean scent, it is not too strong or purfumey.</li>
            <li>and the gel is so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I would give this 5 stars if it were a softer fragrance or had more of the &#x27;clean linen&#x27; smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and received a free sample and so far, really great.</li>
            <li>As for the completely clean scent, this is my favorite scent out of any deodorant.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too strong.  </li>
            <li>If someone is senstivity to strong smells, I might suggest not to get because the scent is strong but if not affected by sensitivity isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>Its not to strong and over powering.</li>
            <li>I work all day and exercise in the evenings and I&#x27;m still hold strong.</li>
            <li>The only brand I use and it always works, smells nice, and never stains your clothes, value pack is a good deal</li>
            <li>Firstly, the scent was amazing.  </li>
            <li>I was able to go a  full day without reapplying because my deodorant didn&#x27;t feel like it was doing the trick.</li>
            <li>I really love that it feels cool when it goes on</li>
            <li>It feels cool and refreshing going on</li>
            <li>This is, hands down, one of the best deodorants I have used.</li>
            <li>The Completely Clean fragrance smells very clean as it suggests.</li>
            <li>Bzzagent sent a free sample to me to try so far it has a great smell and no white marks, not so great for the all day smell blocker</li>
            <li>The gel dries incredibly fast--in fact, it was dry before I even had my outfit for the day assembled.</li>
            <li>The dial on the bottom clicks over easily but securely allowing customizable portions for personalized applications.</li>
            <li>However, it is invisible which is nice for dark clothes and it does give great odor protection.</li>
            <li>Clean smelling, dries fast and keeps you swear free and smelling good for 48hrs.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly, has a great scent and keeps me dry all day!</li>
            <li>It smells so good and keeps me nice and dry.</li>
            <li>The gel goes on smooth, and dries quickly!  </li>
            <li>Because of that my day can get a little sweaty, but I thought this deodorant was a perfect defense against odor and wetness.  </li>
            <li>I tried this because I got it free through a company to rate the product.</li>
            <li>I was not a fan of gel, but I figured that for free, I&#x27;d give it a week to try it out.</li>
            <li>i received the product free from clearlybetterchallenge.com  as a member of one2one network.</li>

            <li>The applicator was smooth and application was effortless.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product after receiving it for free.  </li>
            <li>I must admit, I was hopeful but nothing prepared me for how amazing this antiperspirant really worked.</li>

            <li>I got this product free from BzzAgent to review so this is a #sponsored post.  </li>
            <li>and I got to try it for free.</li>
            <li>It works really good so far.  </li>
            <li>When I opened it i was surprised it had a mellow fragrance that smelled good.  </li>
            <li>Nor have I had any problem with skin irritation, which is a plus for me since I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t always have a good reaction to all products.  </li>
            <li>loved the way the clear gel went on.</li>
            <li>I also have tried the Clinical Strenght but it really is pricey compared to this one that works well, may be better and is cheap!</li>
            <li>One of the best things about it is that it dries so fast and leaves no white marks!</li>
            <li>the first time i used it i thought it was pretty good.</li>
            <li>the reliability and so far so good....</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this scent which was a bit too sweet for me but also had a strong alcohol component to it</li>
            <li>I got to try this product as part of a promotion from the brand and THANKS BzzAgent!!!</li>
            <li>Very fresh smelling and not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li>nice and clean thanks</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I actually went and bought my own full size!</li>
            <li>The scents are a nice fragrance without being too strong, and it truly lasts through your busy day!  </li>
            <li>It promises you 48 hour odor protection, which I found out to be so true as it kept me dry and wonderfully smelling thru the whole day!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say, closer to 30-36ish, but to be fair, I was hiking, running, jumping and generally playing (although no lake or anything like that!).  </li>
            <li>I have found my new favorite deodorant!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t purchased a gel deodorant or changed my brand of deodorant in years but after receiving this product I have a new favorite!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try something new and better!</li>
            <li>, I was really excited.  </li>
            <li>One hundred percent worth it!</li>
            <li>The gel lasts long and smells great.  </li>
            <li>;-) I have to purchase more for the scent alone.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this from BzzAgent to try out and review.</li>
            <li>and I still smelled fresh!</li>
            <li>It always caked onto my clothes and when I would store it in a drawer on its side, it would leak (mostly when it was hot out).</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who lives in a hot climate for sure.</li>
            <li>Once I brought it out of the package and without opening the deodorant itself, I smelled the fresh fragrance; though not overbearing but just right!!  </li>
            <li>Great smell, actually does go on clear like it says and leaves you feeling fresh all day!!!</li>
            <li>The scent smells great and lasts so long that my tops smell pleasant the next day!</li>
            <li>Clean and fresh scent will Outlast You!</li>
            <li>I am actually loving this new deodorant.</li>
            <li>No odor whatsoever, just a hint of clean perfume-y scent.</li>
            <li>an unscented version!&lt;br /&gt;The gel is a great idea, but if it dried faster, it&#x27;d be even better.</li>
            <li>This deodorant goes on smooth and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I did not think it was going to work, I&#x27;ve been wearing different kinds and types of deodorant for over 30 years and this is the BEST so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hooked on the always clean smell even after wearing it all day at my stressful work.</li>
            <li>BUT I didn&#x27;t care for the Completely Clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It has a clean scent, so it reduces the sweat for 48 hours and no odor.</li>
            <li>- Completely Clean.</li>
            <li>this Completely Clean Scent keeps you feeling clean:</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant but not overpowering scent, I&#x27;ve had no break-through sweat or odor (and in central Texas, that&#x27;s saying something), and the product doesn&#x27;t mark my clothing.</li>
            <li>, I still smelled fresh (not like a man&#x27;s gym locker lol), and no ugly embarrassing white marks on my shirt either.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and does not leave marks on my clothing which I love!  </li>
            <li>After years of using Suave deodorant,  I wanted to try a clear gel &amp; have to admit I love it!  </li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t bothered by a little wetness at first than this product will probably work great for you!</li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding deodorant and this worked awesome on me.  </li>
            <li>From the time I was in high school I have suffered with strong perspiration in the armpit area!</li>
            <li>It goes on clear, dries fast and clear, smells great and lasts!  </li>
            <li>Love that it dries fast</li>
            <li>To be honest, I was a bit speculative about the clear gel.  </li>
            <li>I even smell good the next morning!</li>
            <li>Double pack makes it a good price point.</li>
            <li>It was so cool to get this from BzzAgent to try out and review.</li>
            <li>The scent is light &amp;amp; fresh, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It was really cool that Halloween landed on a Friday this year, but we all work too, so didn&#x27;t always have a chance to go home and prepare before the festivities started.</li>
            <li>Even though I got it as part of a promotion, my review is true and something I would put even if I didn&#x27;t get it as a promotion.</li>
            <li>Light smelling and fresh.</li>
            <li>Not bad, I thought.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to be part of this bzzagent campaign because it had been so long since using a gel, I figured I would be a good candidate.  </li>
            <li>Want a deodorant that will leave you clean and fresh for a full 48 hours?</li>
            <li>First off,this deodorant has a pleasant clean scent with a very tiny hint of coconut.</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li>It has kept me clean and fresh even in 110 degree weather.</li>
            <li>then some for us super moms who don&#x27;t get time to take a shower every day.</li>
            <li>There is no burn, it dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave marks.</li>
            <li>Gel dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Since I am allergic to most perfumes, oftentimes, my deodorant is the only scent I&#x27;m able to wear.  </li>
            <li>I would love to find out if there are any other scents because i would love to try those as well!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant.</li>
            <li>but it definitely left me feeling fresh for a good day.  </li>
            <li>I know I will be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>Because it dries so quickly, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about clothing stains or streaks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I remember why I have been a loyal Dove user all these years:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>I know I will be a loyal customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also dries quickly after applying so</li>
            <li>Okay, so I had a Halloween party last night and most of us dressed up.</li>
            <li>and we all shared it, taking quick swipes with TP between armpits for those who got grossed out by the prospect of sharing something</li>
            <li>It did go on clear and the scent wasn&#x27;t very strong.  </li>
            <li>I love this deodorant and highly recommend it any one.  </li>
            <li>It has been a very hot summer</li>
            <li>about 3hrs into my shift my armpits were more sweaty than normal and there was a bit of an odor.</li>
            <li>It holds up on those very hot days, too.</li>
            <li>it is very hot and humid</li>
            <li>so it can get very hot.  </li>
            <li>Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel to try for free!</li>
            <li>The scent is very mild, which I like because I can be sensitive to strong scents.  </li>
            <li>The Completely Clean smell is fresh, strong enough to enjoy, but not overwhelming and generally a great scent!</li>
            <li>I Love my new #secretoutlast #cleancleargel #freesample #Bzzagent</li>
            <li>I have a new favorite brand.  </li>
            <li>Just be aware that if you&#x27;re looking solely at the picture or solely at the words, make sure that you read the reviews and see that you&#x27;re getting what you really wanted...</li>
            <li>And the scent is awesome and long lasting but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and actually smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>When this runs out shortly I will buy some more as soon as I can!</li>
            <li>I have tried this product for the first time today!</li>
            <li>DEORDANT&#x27;S. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li>overall I am pleased with this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been enjoying this product so far!</li>
            <li>This goes on really smooth and dries super fast.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth (not gloppy) &amp;amp; dries super fast.</li>
            <li>it smelled great and stayed smelling fresh all day long (yes, i just did a smell check 14 hours later - just now :) ).</li>
            <li>The fragrance is crisp and clean without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very pleasant and long lasting.</li>
            <li>First off, there&#x27;s the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a chance to try this before I was pregnant, and right now that I am pregnant, so</li>
            <li>I received a free sample and decided to really test it as the reason I stopped using product was because it seemed to lose its impact.  </li>
            <li>I am very thankful I received the product free of charge from BuzzAgent to sample</li>
            <li>It is amazing no white marks up to 48 hrs of protection</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m generally a solid stick kind of girl</li>
            <li>I have tried 3 or 4 gel deodorants and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast Gel works great!</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast really is an excellent product..</li>
            <li>I was very happy to have been sent Secret Outlast lavender deodorant.  </li>
            <li>After a run, going to the pool, and out to dinner, I was still feeling and smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>well and have a fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>I think that Secret Outlast is an awesome deodorant!</li>
            <li>and I was amazed at how fresh I was after two hectic days of running kids to activities and working out.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find out that this deodorant is everything it claims to be and much much more.</li>
            <li>ITEM IS AS DESCRIBED ON LINE AND IS WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li>This has kept me smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>Great product, loves that it&#x27;s a clear gel and won&#x27;t leave white spots on my clothing</li>
            <li>and I have been warm enough I would have known.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used this before heading into the gym, and I can say that Secret Outlast has given me the best odor and wetness protection of all the brands I have tried before.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly SURPRISED to find out that this deodorant is EVERYTHING it claims to be and MORE.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is worth buying.</li>
            <li>No problem with this one at all.. it stays just as fresh smelling all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved the ease of application, the scent, the fact that it didn&#x27;t leave white marks, and that it really, truly worked---&#x3D;-even when I tested out its claim to work for 48 hours</li>
            <li>I got this free from BzzAgent and will definitely be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I do not like Powder Fresh scents</li>
            <li>My favorite part of this product is that it&#x27;s white mark free.  </li>
            <li>and I’m pleased to report clear gel deodorant</li>
            <li>I promise no disappointment.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used clear gels in many years.</li>
            <li>I like powder fresh or baby powder scents.</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T laugh.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job at keeping me dry and confident during my long days at school and when I&#x27;m up all night running around at work.</li>
            <li>The gel was nice, went on easily, felt cool and dried pretty quick</li>
            <li>but it dries pretty quickly - you still have to stand there for a minute or two &amp;#34;fanning&amp;#34; yourself before it dries</li>
            <li>Dries pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>Even though I am pretty brand loyal to Dove (and have been for awhile)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stain clothing, clear gel goes on easily and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It is easy to dispense and easy to apply and dries instantly.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of your outlast completely clean clear gel</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do well with strong perfume smelling deodorants and have finally found a great deodorant with a great scent thanks to Secret!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m overall, happy and pleasantly surprised with how much I like this deodorant!</li>
            <li>Who does, right?</li>
            <li>I put this on right out of the shower</li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about marks on my clothes and can get dressed right away.</li>
            <li>I usually apply an antiperspirant at night and then use regular deodorant in the morning, and this stuff fits the bill perfectly for a &amp;#34;regular deodorant.&amp;#34; It has a great fresh scent, goes on clear, and dries quickly with no white marks.</li>
            <li>It smells so amazing that i feel fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overwhelming to where it will take over your perfume, it&#x27;s just pleasant and clean.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever used a gel deodorant too and so far really pleased with it</li>
            <li>One to one and a half click is all you need and you&#x27;re good for the whole day!!</li>
            <li>Next, it is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I normally haven&#x27;t liked to many of Secrets deodorants, but this one really kept me dry and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>It also had a nice clean scent that won&#x27;t overpower your perfume or other scents.  </li>
            <li>The gel is clear, goes on smooth, and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>the only thing that kept me from giving it a perfect score is that i was a bit wet yesterday under my arms - but it was a much warmer day</li>
            <li>I never had problems with wetness/odor control with my other deodorant, it was pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It not only smelled great but it actually left my skin feeling soft not dry and didn&#x27;t bother it at all allergy wise.</li>
            <li>and when I woke up the next morning I was still smelling as lovely as I had the morning before when I had first applied it!</li>
            <li>I feel better knowing that Secret Outlast deodorant will keep me smelling at my best on all the hot summer walks that me and my boyfriend do daily with our hyper dog.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the product, it really doesn&#x27;t leave any white streaks and that is probably the main reason why I love it so much!</li>
            <li>I will certainly be making the switch!</li>
            <li>The Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel is awesome.</li>
            <li>The gel is quick and easy to apply, worked effectively for at least 24 hours</li>
            <li>It really is clear drying, it really lasts 48 hours or more.</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing, it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks and dries really fast.</li>
            <li>This product was just as good with less clicks of the container.</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast clean clear gel deodorant truly works great!  </li>
            <li>I also love that is fast drying and clear.</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;m not usually a clear gel kind of girl.</li>
            <li>I have no white marks and still smell great even when its over 100 outside!</li>
            <li>Secret Clean Clear Gel has been awesome!  </li>
            <li>Prior to trying this product I was using Mitchum gel antiperspirant because, as the mother of a 7 month old boy, I run around all day and NEED a good order and sweat control</li>
            <li>overall I must say this is a great product if you are looking for a deodorant that keeps you dry and smelling fresh all day ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective, fast to dry after applied, keeps you dry and odor-free all day long, and the best part is - none of my clothes have been ruined by white deodorant marks!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to #getitfree and try this new deodorant from #bzzagent.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone from teenagers to acrobats ;).</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;d like to try an unscented before rating it higher.</li>
            <li>Plus I love that this deodorant never leaves white streaks on my clothes!</li>
            <li>The claim is 48 hours, and on a recent camping trip, I was able to test that out.  </li>
            <li>It dries fast!</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I do not like the feeling of gel when it is first applied and even though it doesn&#x27;t leave marks</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my shirt and blouses.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent and the fact that it last through out the day.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The gel form dries quickly, which was my main concern.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t get whiffs of it during the day, because I find that kinda gross.  </li>
            <li>Great product, and long lasting</li>
            <li>Get effective protection without feeling sticky or wet.</li>
            <li>I can go on and on but the simple fact is I love this product and DEF</li>
            <li>Would for sure purchase in the future.</li>
            <li>After receiving a free sample of this from Secret, I can say this deodorant works way better than most.</li>
            <li>so I am glad I have finally found one that works.</li>
            <li>Which is better than having your solid clump up!</li>
            <li>First off it says 48 hours protection.  </li>
            <li>I was outside on the family farm ALL day in the heat picking Cherries from a Cherry Tree in the orchard, I had on a colored tank top.</li>
            <li>so well I was able to wear the SAME shirt to go out that night to meet up with friends.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t my first time trying a gel deodorant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky like most gel deodorants and doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue on your clothes.</li>
            <li>Native American in me :).  </li>
            <li>It was a hot and humid day today</li>
            <li>No sweaty shirts at the end of the day in a hot, stuffy classroom.  </li>
            <li>Outlast is exactly what this did.</li>
            <li>and I will for sure be purchasing this again in the future!!</li>
            <li>My favorite thing is that it doesn&#x27;t leave any unsightly white marks on your clothing.</li>
            <li>Would for sure purchase in the future.</li>
            <li>This product is even better than most clinical strength brands I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li>It comes in many forms and different scents.</li>
            <li>I received this deodorant from BZZAGENT as a free trial and I love it hands down.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is amazing.</li>
            <li>No white stains on my shirt, long lasting protection, and it smells great!</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with the long lasting nature of the product and felt that it lasted well into the next day after use.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant 2.7 oz</li>
            <li>I do notice the Completely Clean fragrance whenever I lift my arms (which is frequently, between lifting children, doing the hokey pokey, and playing airplanes).</li>
            <li>I love the clear coverage this offers, but it doesn&#x27;t make up for the burn when applying after shaving.  </li>
            <li>The scent on this one is pretty strong and I was not a big fan of it, so when I purchased another one I went with the unscented.</li>
            <li>No weird white creases, and it dries really quickly when applied, and isn&#x27;t sticky at all!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually use gel deodorant, but I applied this in the morning and it dried quickly and smelled great!</li>
            <li>I put on a little more to get through the day, and when I showered that night, still no bad odor.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying this - it is now my favorite antiperspirant/deodorant and I highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase the full product and recommend to friends!</li>
            <li>Although I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the completely clean scent (I prefer Power fresh scents), once it&#x27;s dried</li>
            <li>It works great on dark clothes no  white marks.  </li>
            <li>I have not noticed any white marks; it dries very quickly,  </li>
            <li>Goes on clear, dries quickly and protects all day.  </li>
            <li>The smell of this one is a bit strong which is my only reason for the 4 star review.</li>
            <li>I usually go for the powder fresh or cocoa butter scents, but this one is nice and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I was so very excited to receive free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent.</li>
            <li>I stayed dried all day and plus, the scent wasn&#x27;t overwhelming!  </li>
            <li>I hope they can make it in a few more scents though!</li>
            <li>As a new mom, i have a pretty consistent morning time &amp;#34;new mommy&amp;#34; stink.</li>
            <li>However I was looking for a new form of deodorant because I am not quite satisfied with my current one.</li>
            <li>I got even more excited when I got to test the new Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel for free for my BzzAgent campaign</li>
            <li>Thanks to One2OneNetwork, I received a free sample of the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear  Gel for my honest review.</li>
            <li>Chasing a toddler around the house all day long (especially in this warm autumn weather we have) calls for me to make sure I&#x27;m extra protected in the odor area.  </li>
            <li>I feel confident it will keep me dry and odor free for the entire day.</li>
            <li>The gel dried super fast, and the deodorant works better than any I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>The gel dried super fast, and the deodorant works better than any I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>the scent is a little strong at first, but it is pleasant and not a huge problem.  </li>
            <li>I can tell it lives up to it&#x27;s promises and it still smells great after a long active day.</li>
            <li>There is a learning curve when it comes to knowing how much to use.</li>
            <li>I even worked up a sweat today to really test it out-</li>
            <li>now it dries almost as fast as you apply it and it lasts all day and</li>
            <li>I have never been a fan of gel deodorant, but I really do like this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I think Secret makes great products</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it held up very well</li>
            <li>(Thanks to BzzAgent)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m free from odor and wetness and white marks on my clothes...</li>
            <li>but it dries fast.</li>
            <li>I did however notice that it comes out fast</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast gel is a great concept, but I think there are some improvements that could be made and</li>
            <li>it really</li>
            <li>I really like this deodorant.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Having said all of that, I want to talk about what really sells me - 48 hour protection.  </li>
            <li>I get up every day at 5 am and race to get myself ready so that I can be ready when my kids get up for school.  </li>
            <li>So much so that I keep one at work.</li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to test out this deodorant from bzzagent.com free of charge and I will definitely be buying it from now on.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.  </li>
            <li>And the important feature for me, is the no white marks on your shirts.  </li>
            <li>I was given this to try thanks to BzzAgent</li>
            <li>If you prefer a more fun, specialty scent this will probably be boring to you, but I found it perfectly acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very picky about my deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I got this free from BzzAgent definitely will be stocking up on this deodorant!</li>
            <li>Thanks to Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li>I am really digging this gel formula.  </li>
            <li>Confident that I won&#x27;t have marks or wet spots</li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent</li>
            <li>I then tried the secret clinical and thought that was great.  </li>
            <li>I have a tendency to get too much.  </li>
            <li>It really does the job all day with no worries Q</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Lastly, it&#x27;s much easier to wash off when I need to.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes this deodorant.</li>
            <li>Great Secret product, stands up to the advertising.</li>
            <li>I actually really like this scent too.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really smell anything.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the results.</li>
            <li>It delivers real results for people like you and me.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes the 48 hour protection.</li>
            <li>I DO FEEL MUCH CLEANER</li>
            <li>This product saves me from those wet armpit days during summer :)</li>
            <li>but I like that this is totally clear and smells fresh.</li>
            <li>When I opened the cover to the Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel, I was pleasant surprised by the fresh scent of the gel.  </li>
            <li>I alway really liked knowing that there were no white lines on my clothing, or clumped in my armpits after exercising, which can happen with an invisible solid.  </li>
            <li>I liked that it dried on contact</li>
            <li>I did get to try it for free through a campaign through BzzAgent, and Secret Outlast deodorant, but all of these are my own views.</li>
            <li>It seemed kind of messy.  </li>
            <li>None and I am pretty sure I touched my under arm to the black t-shirt</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bzzagent for Secret Outlast Clean Clear Gel and was able to try this for free.</li>
            <li>From playing soccer outside, to getting dinner ready, I still feel fresh at night before my shower!</li>
            <li>No white residue and leaves you feeling fresh and confident whole day long.</li>
            <li>I have found that this product smells fresh and clean and is super long lasting.</li>
            <li>I was so anxious to receive this free sample from (Bzz Agent)!!</li>
            <li>She tried other deodorants on top, body sprays and perfume, and her odor still came through.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly impressed and will be sad and upset if this ever leaves the market!</li>
            <li>and now she knows the secret (lol, get it) of not sweating in high heat</li>
            <li>My only issue is the clean sent smells like I showered in laundry detergent.</li>
            <li>scent, which was a refreshing change from my usual power fresh sent.  </li>
            <li>When i tore back the seal, I got an overpowering whiff of the &amp;#34;completely clean scent&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of a long lasting deodorant</li>
            <li>To my surprise it went on easy(dries quick too), lasted a long hot day without leaving grody looking stains on my shirt</li>
            <li>Most days it worked really well, if i was working outside doing manual labor it did not last through the day.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant lives up to the hype of lasting a full 48 hours.</li>
            <li>No white streaks on my black tops, lasted all day as someone with frequent hot flashes that is as important as the completely clean part!</li>
            <li>I would never have tried Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel if this wasn&#x27;t sent to me, and I love it!</li>
            <li>It does dry pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Though don&#x27;t expect to miracles on staying dry if it is super hot out--life happens.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found my new deoderant!  </li>
            <li>In fact, I was pleasantly surprised how long it lasted, loved that I got to use ALL the product , and was pleased that I didn&#x27;t have to deal with a broken or crumbly stick.  </li>
            <li>It kept me odor free all day and dry all day...</li>
            <li>This deodorant promises to keep you dry and odor free for 48 hours after applying.</li>
            <li>I love secret products and I recieved this product for free from bzzagent.  </li>
            <li>Its lightweight, dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothes.  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample from Secret through BzzAgent and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that I have gotten another sample from them as well because you can not have too much of this Secret Outlast!</li>
            <li>but I guess that is okay because you dont have to worry about those embarrassing deodorant stains that the white solid gives you.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to see that Secret Outlast held up - greatly reduced sweat, odor, staining.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;d definitely recommend it overall, but I&#x27;d suggest pairing it with an antiperspirant if you tend to sweat a lot :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this was a decent product, in the 3 weeks</li>
            <li>I really am amazed at how fast it dries without leaving clothing all marked up.</li>
            <li>However this particular product is not for me.  </li>
            <li>i got mild white marks.</li>
            <li>work in a very busy hospital that can also be very stressful at times.  </li>
            <li>The smell was good and didn&#x27;t make my pits sticky but didn&#x27;t last as long as the invisible solid does.</li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the slippery wet feeling of the gel, but it dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>So I had high expectations for this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this deodorant at first thinking it was pretty much like every Secret product.  </li>
            <li>I was curious to try it since I&#x27;ve been a loyal user of Secret deodorant for years and have always had great experiences with their products, but hadn&#x27;t tried this particular product.  </li>
            <li>It kept my odor free as well as dry!</li>
            <li>Of course, for most people this isn&#x27;t a big deal, but I am super impatient, so it gets frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t necessarily completely prevent sweating, but it certainly helps and prevents you from stinking if you do sweat.</li>
            <li>The clear gel does not stain at all!!</li>
            <li>I was surprised this deodorant WORKS!!</li>
            <li>As a teacher, this time of year is always a little challenging when it comes to knowing how to dress.  </li>
            <li>I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean deodorant as a promotion from the company to try how well it performs,well I wasn&#x27;t let down with its great protection.</li>
            <li>gave this product four stars, however, because I really don&#x27;t enjoy the sticky, wet feeling immediately after applying it.  </li>
            <li>It is COMPLETELY clear, and dries relatively fast.  </li>
            <li>and I am surprised at how fast the gel dries.  </li>
            <li>I felt fresh for the entire day, morning to night.</li>
            <li>I smell fresh by the next day, and this is supposed to be a 48 hour antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>Have tried others, but will always go back to Secret, it&#x27;s simply the best.</li>
            <li>The best part about Secret Outlast is that I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting white marks on my clothes like solid kinds of deodorant will give you.</li>
            <li>This is worth the buy and switch to this brand and gets a solid 5 stars from me!</li>
            <li>It is suppose to  leave no white marks, and keep you fresh for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>I normally go to the gym on my lunch break</li>
            <li>but this didn&#x27;t work for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>I was sceptical as to its claims to be a 48 hour protection, leave no white marks, and keep you fresh for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t normal for me.  </li>
            <li>I put it on in the morning and went about my normal day of chores and chasing my kids.</li>
            <li>I normally pick &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;baby powder/baby fresh&amp;#34; anyway as those are my go to scents.  </li>
            <li>It dried pretty quickly and left me with a clean feeling, not sticky at all, which I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I can go 24 hours in the Texas heat and still smell good when I use Secret Outlast.</li>
            <li>I love Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel Deodorant!</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using this deodorant because it was pretty legit to see how well it did not leave white streaks on my black shirts underneath the arm areas.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this because it is fresh and really works at keeping me dry.</li>
            <li>I experimented with it, and it takes the same amount of time to dry, whether or not your pits are smooth shaven or looking like &#x27;Squatch!</li>
            <li>and I have to admit I sometimes get interrupted during my workouts and need to come back up to the office right away and inhave to skip the shower.</li>
            <li>I put it on right out of the shower and can say I have no problems about freshness for hte next 48 hours.</li>
            <li>It lived up to the great experiences I&#x27;ve always had with secret and kept me fresh even while being active.</li>
            <li>When I received the free sample of Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel (THANK YOU, BZZAGENT!!!)</li>
            <li>As a stay at home mom, the first few hours of the day are the most crucial for me when it comes to deodorant!</li>
            <li>Great product, no more white marks!works same as it says it will.</li>
            <li>I live in the Philippines but order this from the States.</li>
            <li>However, this is my new go to deodorant.</li>
            <li>But not with this new product - I even intentionally put it on clothing to &amp;#34;test&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>you want to try a new deodorant I would recommend this.  </li>
            <li>The random whiffs of the deodorant are a friendly reminder that you are still fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>The best part is no more white lines on my black shirts!</li>
            <li>I loved Secret Outlast Clear Gel&#x27;s scent.  </li>
            <li>It is very important to me to have dry pits, ALL DAY LONG!</li>
            <li>It keeps me dry all day long and at the end of the day I&#x27;m also odor free!</li>
            <li>This dries very quickly, it isn&#x27;t at all sticky and it definitely lasts as long as I need it.  </li>
            <li>Not with this one, it was absolutely clear!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still surprised!</li>
            <li>even when I got a streak of it on my tshirt, it disappeared completely!</li>
            <li>I even got some on the front of my sweater and it came completely off, no mark!  </li>
            <li>But this just happens to be the first gel deodorant that actually works.</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;ve sure needed it in the past...</li>
            <li>I am now hooked and I plan to replace my old deodorant with it!</li>
            <li>I am hoping they have this same Completely Clean scent in a solid!!</li>
            <li>I received a free Secret Completely Clean as a BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>I was given Secret Outlast Completely Clean to try for free</li>
            <li>The gel was very quick to dry and didn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothing.</li>
            <li>Overall I love the no mess, great smelling, long lasting new Secret!</li>
            <li>The Secret gel is much better then the solid white in my opinion! :]</li>
            <li>i love this deodorant i have tried many different ones, but for some reason i keep going back to secret brand.</li>
            <li>I have always been reluctant to try new deodorants and was pleasantly surprised by this one.  </li>
            <li>Recommend this deodorant to anyone who live a busy on the go lifestyle.</li>
            <li>I struggled for a long time trying to get just the right deo.</li>
            <li>I was given this Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel for free by Scecret.</li>
            <li>so I got to try the Secret Outlast completely clean clear gel for free.  </li>
            <li>It keeps me feeling fresh and dry.</li>
            <li>It dried very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It did keep my dry throughout the day and kept me fresh smelling, but I don&#x27;t think that I will be switching to gel anytime soon.</li>
            <li>But it kept me dry and fresh, so I kept using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really does go on clear and is super long lasting.</li>
            <li>In other words, I didn&#x27;t expect anything special.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to everyone who wants to be sweat odor fre and fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>tried this, and it really does dry fast.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t make the same mistake as I did and order this quickly without reading the entire product description!  </li>
            <li>The deodorant worked very well and dried quickly.  </li>
            <li>The fact that this product does not leave no white marks  was a winner for me and that alone  enough to make me a loyal user.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel to review as being a BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to use Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, dries fast, long lasting and never leaves white marks on your clothing.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin on my underarms and this product really helps; my skin doesn&#x27;t feel itchy or red.  </li>
            <li>This gel went on very wet and felt cool on my underarms for hours.</li>
            <li>still fresh and dry!</li>
            <li>Long lasting, feels and stays fresh, clean, and dry!</li>
            <li>I was given a little trial size sample for free to try out.</li>
            <li>I am a Bzz Agent and received a full size sample of Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel Deodorant and coupons to share with friends and family.</li>
            <li>This is so quick drying and doesn&#x27;t leave underarm residue from my clothing like other gels.</li>
            <li>It is clear so it doesn&#x27;t leave marks.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m a deodorant / anti-perspirant snob, so i appreciated that this product went on clear, so i didn&#x27;t have to worry about white marks on my clothing.</li>
            <li>Clear  </li>
            <li>Clear  Gel over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I did not get the clear gel.  </li>
            <li>I was given a stick deodorant when my order clearly says clear gel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear gel</li>
            <li>It goes on clear.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear like it says,  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that i goes on clear and stays that way.</li>
            <li>The gel is clear and dries fast, so no white marks on my clothes!</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it goes in clear and does not stain my clothes.</li>
            <li>but its coming closer to the conclusion with outlast clear gel it stays on</li>
            <li>I like that it is clear</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t get this product again unless it was completely scent</li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This product though has me completely hooked.  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s not just my sensitive pregnancy nose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s early and I am often working on autopilot.  </li>
            <li>I musst say I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>, I was surprised a gel deodorant worked so well.</li>
            <li>(it has thus far)</li>
            <li>As far as protection goes, it&#x27;s about a 3.5.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it as an adult.</li>
            <li>It dries fast and It don&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothes.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and completely stays that way, no clumps, even after working out.</li>
            <li>This deodorant really stands up to the test, and is something that I will purchase in the future.</li>
            <li>Not messy since clear, and really did last up to 48 hours!</li>
            <li>As far as whiteness protection-</li>
            <li>You get way too much on the outsides and almost nothing in the middle.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at how this performed and will buy again.</li>
            <li>I  have a natural tan</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I had this opportunity because I never really liked gel deodorants.</li>
            <li>, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>, i don&#x27;t have to reapply until early in the afternoon</li>
            <li>With my old deodorant, I would apply it by 7:00 a.m. and notice odor by around noon.</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel goes on clear and keeps me free from white marks on my shirts.  </li>
            <li>Recently had the chance to try Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel deodorant for free to review</li>
            <li>Be careful about using right after shaving or it may sting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The secret clear gel goes on smooth and dries very fast.</li>
            <li>It took a few tries to get used to how many &#x27;clicks&#x27; to use, as there seems to be a bit of &#x27;settling&#x27; of product from day to day and one click doesn&#x27;t seem to be enough gel on the first underarm, but is plenty on the second.&lt;br /&gt;The verdict?</li>
            <li>I am familiar with other Secret deodorants, but Secret Outlast is awesome!</li>
            <li>It was an additional bonus that it was quick to dry without leaving a sticky feeling and that I was odorless the entire day!!!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to find a decent replacement in all of Asia (even though Secret also sells here).</li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to try Secret Outlast gel via BzzAgent and, overall, am pretty pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I typically use men&#x27;s clear solid for dryness and odor protection (I don&#x27;t love the scent, but it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that keeps me dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received the outlast active fresh deodorant</li>
            <li>This is why I normally steer clear of personal products with scents or dyes in them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got it for free to try out, because I would have stuck with the same old deodorant I&#x27;ve been using forever that has only been working on a mediocre level.</li>
            <li>I have never really liked clear gel deodorant but was surprised the Secret outlast was better then most.</li>
            <li>Gel deodorant has certainly come a long way.  </li>
            <li>I recently tried Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel and was surprised how smoothly it glided on my skin and NO white marks!!</li>
            <li>Really like the new Secret Outlast Clean Clear Gel.</li>
            <li>Not only does Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel provide longer lasting odor protection, it also dries quickly without leaving any marks!</li>
            <li>I am a high school biology teacher, and spend several hours each day on my feet in front of my students and in the lab.</li>
            <li>Prior to starting this campaign, with my free sample as a Bzz Agent, I was using a regular white deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Also, I loved the fact that a little goes a long away so one tube of this deodorant will last for a long awhile!</li>
            <li>This Secret Outlast deodorant has become my new favorite.</li>
            <li>I already love using Secret and the new Secret Outlast is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>I usually buy the the Secret Outlast solid and was pleasantly surprised that I liked this better than the solid form.</li>
            <li>I like heavy scents, this one was not overly strong, but was just enough that I knew it was there.  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product (thanks to Secret) and immediately switched from my old deodorant to this one.</li>
            <li>I just call that a bonus for this sort of product any way since I know how to launder my clothes well enough that it isn&#x27;t normally a problem either way.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel kept me dry all day long.  </li>
            <li>I normally use solid or spray antiperspirant/deodorant</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t really like was when I first began to perspire, my underarms felt a bit sticky, which i think is typical of gels.  </li>
            <li>I did have to figure how not to extract too  much gel out of the bottle because otherwise it sticks to the top of the cap and is a big waste of product but other than that I am sticking to this brand!</li>
            <li>It works really well at keeping my pits dry and the BO smell at bay.</li>
            <li>It dries fast and keeps me dry as well.</li>
            <li>Also, unlike a solid, I know how much product is actually going on my arm pits.</li>
            <li>It was my first experience with gel deodorant and thought it worked really well, the only concern i would have is how long the stick will last compared to a solid stick.  </li>
            <li>I am well pleased with this Secret clear gel.  </li>
            <li>I think Secret Outlast clear gel is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Generally gel deodorants leave my armpits feeling &amp;#34;wet and sticky&amp;#34;, not this!</li>
            <li>The clear gel goes on clear and stay on clear and it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and really does last all day long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not completely offensive by any means, but I hate nothing more than sitting at work and catching a whiff of my antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li>As a member of one2one network, I received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from the clearlybetterchallenge site.</li>
            <li>a member of One2OneNetwork, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s New Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com</li>
            <li>As a member of one2one network, i received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li>The scent is light, it dries super fast, leaves no sticky feeling , no white marks even on your black clothing , and keeps you completly dry , and odorless no matter how hard you are working or playing.  </li>
            <li>I was also excited to try the clear gel, as I usually use the invisible solid.  </li>
            <li>It keeps me smelling pleasant all day, but unfortunately does not keep me dry in the sweltering FL heat.  </li>
            <li>Even on hot, sticky days I have confidence that Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel is still working.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, BzzAgent for the opportunity to try Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel.</li>
            <li>I have been using a full-size sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel given to me for free by BzzAgent for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li>I was excited about trying the new Secret Clear Gel Outlast 48 hour odor protection deodorant.</li>
            <li>Having used clear gel deodorant in the past I was hesitant to give it a try as most clear gel deodorants leave you feeling a little soggy under the arms.</li>
            <li>The smell is also very clean and not overpowering in the least!</li>
            <li>and I generally don&#x27;t like the smell of deodorant.  </li>
            <li>The clear gel is also a plus,not having any white marks on my shirts...</li>
            <li>The clear gel leaves no white marks on my clothing.</li>
            <li>When I purchased my next antiperspirant, I purchased this product which says a lot as I usually go for the cheapest product available.  </li>
            <li>I usually use the basic clinical strength deodorant, but was given a chance to try this for free through a program on Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li>And also its really affordable and long lasting.</li>
            <li>second thing I need is for the product to not bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so be careful I really dislike being wasteful.</li>
            <li>Also I have sensitive skin and sometimes deodorant burns upon application, especially just after I have shaved.</li>
            <li>Thanks but no thanks</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I am going back to my old brands, ever.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised that this one dries almost instantly!</li>
            <li>As far as the lasting power goes, I can say it lasted me all through the day</li>
            <li>(Kids gotta eat, apparently.)</li>
            <li>Only thing i didn&#x27;t like was how the deodorant feels wet for a bit til it dries upon first application.</li>
            <li>What surprised me more is that later that evening I went for my Zumba class and as I was changing from my work clothes, I can still smell the freshness of Secret Outlast that&#x27;s after about 10 hours of application.  </li>
            <li>I love secret.  </li>
            <li>I received the Secret Outlast Deodorant to test and review for the clearly better challenge.</li>
            <li>Secret is my favorite</li>
            <li>but I must say that I am in love with secret outlast .</li>
            <li>Love this secret.</li>
            <li>When I went inside my house and looked down and had no sweat marks at all under my arms, I still smelled fresh and no white marks on my shirt either.</li>
            <li>Gel and I was completely blown away by the fresh scent, though like I previously said, it&#x27;s not overbearing for those who don&#x27;t like fragrance!!  </li>
            <li>It definitely does the job and does it well for keeping a person dry, especially in the summer when it&#x27;s hot out</li>
            <li>I have always used a solid deodorant and learned to live with the white marks.</li>
            <li>I felt pretty dry all day long and didn&#x27;t notice any odor to speak of.  </li>
            <li>When I applied the deodorant it went on wet feeling because of being a gel but dried very quickly.</li>
            <li>Another thing I love, is that unlike the solid this one does not stain black clothes which I wear a lot of black to work.</li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent, I recently tried out Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Deodorant.</li>
            <li>first is for it to work for an entire day regardless of how active I am or what the weather is like.</li>
            <li>Not cool, since it&#x27;s another 5 hours before the first parent arrives, and I don&#x27;t have the luxury of re-applying deodorant around the lunch hour.</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel offers 48 hour protection, I do not feel like I need to re-apply my deodorant during those long, busy days.</li>
            <li>Being 5 months pregnant in the middle of a hot humid summer is difficult but this stuff really keeps me dry.</li>
            <li>I live in Miami and work outside, so I personally need a Deodorant that actually lasts.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the products ability to live up to being a clear gel, as it did not leave white marks on my black work shirt.</li>
            <li>got it free to test and review thanks to Secret and BzzAgent!</li>
            <li>I received Secret Outlast® Clear Gel completely free in a Bzzagent kit.</li>
            <li>However, I was VERY pleasantly surprised at how FAST this product dried once applied......and poof.....</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant in a BuzzAgent kit.  </li>
            <li>so I figured I&#x27;d try this because I am known to wear black clothing a few, OK, several, times a week.  </li>
            <li>final thing I look for in these types of products is no scent or very little scent, at the very least I don&#x27;t want a product that will attractive insects, I get enough bug bites as it is.</li>
            <li>so applying the gel first took a little getting used to</li>
            <li>While I knew the Secret Brand, I was looking forward to trying a new scent, Completely Clean, since I&#x27;ve usually used Powder Fresh.  </li>
            <li>Well until Secret outlast completely clean clear gel deodorant came into my life!  </li>
            <li>I am a busy mom on the go and keep extra deodorant in my car because on hot busy days I have to reapply at least once.</li>
            <li>I got a sample of secret outlast completely clean gel deodorant from bzzagent!</li>
            <li>Try Secret Outlast Completely Clean to kick pit odor to the curb!</li>
            <li>For everyday, I still prefer a solid deodorant because it feels dry and clean to apply.  </li>
            <li>Secret’s Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant is a unique product in my opinion.</li>
            <li>However, within a matter of moments, the gel had dried and it was like I hadn&#x27;t applied anything at all to my underarm, which is exactly what you want.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so Im not entirely confident in saying that it gives you 48 hours worth of protection</li>
            <li>No transfer to my clothes or gross white buildup that&#x27;s difficult to wash off; just a nice scent and sweat protection.</li>
            <li>I would definitely use Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel again!  </li>
            <li>The scent is light and feminine yet subtle enough not to give you a headache.  </li>
            <li>I was given this Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel to try.</li>
            <li>grabbed the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel that I received from BzzAgent</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel is a fast acting antiperspirant that holds up to both stressful situations and an active lifestyle.</li>
            <li>I got a sample of the secret outlast completely clean clear gel as a part of a bzz campaign from bzzagent.</li>
            <li>I am a BzzAgent and that I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll be making the switch to Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel.</li>
            <li>it kept me dry and dried quickly after I applied it.</li>
            <li>I feel dry through the day, no dampness making me feel self conscious (even if my audience is a class of 5 year olds).</li>
            <li>Lastly, I appreciate how it goes on clear, stays clear and doesn&#x27;t take long to dry.  </li>
            <li>I use Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel as soon as I step out of the shower for 48-hour odor protection with no white marks.</li>
            <li>The outlasting power of Secret outlast completely clean clear gel definitely outlasts all others!</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel and make the switch.</li>
            <li>Also, super slow at shipping so don&#x27;t expect this to show up on two day Amazon prime shipping if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>The gel formula takes a little getting used to if you normally use a solid, but it&#x27;s clear and leaves no white marks.</li>
            <li>(not that she gets to experience that very often in Seattle area) to no sweating in all those little female crevices.</li>
            <li>I had high hope for Secret Outlast Clear Gel, and after receiving it in a FREE BzzKit, was anxious to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I try to live an active lifestyle, walking to work, taking bar classes, and using the stairs at work whenever possible.  </li>
            <li>I dont like how the clear gel goes on wet feeling</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any marks which is great when i&#x27;m changing from work to gym, but it still keeps me feeling dry and smelling great even after an intense workout!</li>
            <li> Other times, one click is perfect.</li>
            <li> I tried other deodorants, and I wasn&#x27;t happy!  </li>
            <li> TOTALLY TRUE!</li>
            <li> I love the Completely Clean scent and</li>
            <li> I love the clean scent, it is not too strong or purfumey.</li>
            <li> and the gel is so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I would give this 5 stars if it were a softer fragrance or had more of the &#x27;clean linen&#x27; smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and received a free sample and so far, really great.</li>
            <li> As for the completely clean scent, this is my favorite scent out of any deodorant.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too strong.  </li>
            <li> If someone is senstivity to strong smells, I might suggest not to get because the scent is strong but if not affected by sensitivity isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> Its not to strong and over powering.</li>
            <li> I work all day and exercise in the evenings and I&#x27;m still hold strong.</li>
            <li> The only brand I use and it always works, smells nice, and never stains your clothes, value pack is a good deal</li>
            <li> Firstly, the scent was amazing.  </li>
            <li> I was able to go a  full day without reapplying because my deodorant didn&#x27;t feel like it was doing the trick.</li>
            <li> I really love that it feels cool when it goes on</li>
            <li> It feels cool and refreshing going on</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, one of the best deodorants I have used.</li>
            <li> The Completely Clean fragrance smells very clean as it suggests.</li>
            <li> Bzzagent sent a free sample to me to try so far it has a great smell and no white marks, not so great for the all day smell blocker</li>
            <li> The gel dries incredibly fast--in fact, it was dry before I even had my outfit for the day assembled.</li>
            <li> The dial on the bottom clicks over easily but securely allowing customizable portions for personalized applications.</li>
            <li> However, it is invisible which is nice for dark clothes and it does give great odor protection.</li>
            <li> Clean smelling, dries fast and keeps you swear free and smelling good for 48hrs.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly, has a great scent and keeps me dry all day!</li>
            <li> It smells so good and keeps me nice and dry.</li>
            <li> The gel goes on smooth, and dries quickly!  </li>
            <li> Because of that my day can get a little sweaty, but I thought this deodorant was a perfect defense against odor and wetness.  </li>
            <li> I tried this because I got it free through a company to rate the product.</li>

            <li> I got this product free from BzzAgent to review so this is a #sponsored post.  </li>
            <li> and I got to try it for free.</li>
            <li> It works really good so far.  </li>
            <li> When I opened it i was surprised it had a mellow fragrance that smelled good.  </li>
            <li> Nor have I had any problem with skin irritation, which is a plus for me since I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t always have a good reaction to all products.  </li>
            <li> loved the way the clear gel went on.</li>
            <li> I also have tried the Clinical Strenght but it really is pricey compared to this one that works well, may be better and is cheap!</li>
            <li> One of the best things about it is that it dries so fast and leaves no white marks!</li>
            <li> the first time i used it i thought it was pretty good.</li>
            <li> the reliability and so far so good....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this scent which was a bit too sweet for me but also had a strong alcohol component to it</li>
            <li> I got to try this product as part of a promotion from the brand and THANKS BzzAgent!!!</li>
            <li> Very fresh smelling and not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li> nice and clean thanks</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I actually went and bought my own full size!</li>
            <li> The scents are a nice fragrance without being too strong, and it truly lasts through your busy day!  </li>
            <li> It promises you 48 hour odor protection, which I found out to be so true as it kept me dry and wonderfully smelling thru the whole day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say, closer to 30-36ish, but to be fair, I was hiking, running, jumping and generally playing (although no lake or anything like that!).  </li>
            <li> I have found my new favorite deodorant!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased a gel deodorant or changed my brand of deodorant in years but after receiving this product I have a new favorite!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try something new and better!</li>
            <li> , I was really excited.  </li>
            <li> One hundred percent worth it!</li>
            <li> The gel lasts long and smells great.  </li>
            <li> ;-) I have to purchase more for the scent alone.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this from BzzAgent to try out and review.</li>
            <li> and I still smelled fresh!</li>
            <li> It always caked onto my clothes and when I would store it in a drawer on its side, it would leak (mostly when it was hot out).</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who lives in a hot climate for sure.</li>
            <li> Once I brought it out of the package and without opening the deodorant itself, I smelled the fresh fragrance; though not overbearing but just right!!  </li>
            <li> Great smell, actually does go on clear like it says and leaves you feeling fresh all day!!!</li>
            <li> The scent smells great and lasts so long that my tops smell pleasant the next day!</li>
            <li> Clean and fresh scent will Outlast You!</li>
            <li> I am actually loving this new deodorant.</li>
            <li> No odor whatsoever, just a hint of clean perfume-y scent.</li>
            <li> an unscented version!&lt;br /&gt;The gel is a great idea, but if it dried faster, it&#x27;d be even better.</li>
            <li> This deodorant goes on smooth and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I did not think it was going to work, I&#x27;ve been wearing different kinds and types of deodorant for over 30 years and this is the BEST so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on the always clean smell even after wearing it all day at my stressful work.</li>
            <li> BUT I didn&#x27;t care for the Completely Clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It has a clean scent, so it reduces the sweat for 48 hours and no odor.</li>
            <li> - Completely Clean.</li>
            <li> this Completely Clean Scent keeps you feeling clean:</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant but not overpowering scent, I&#x27;ve had no break-through sweat or odor (and in central Texas, that&#x27;s saying something), and the product doesn&#x27;t mark my clothing.</li>
            <li> , I still smelled fresh (not like a man&#x27;s gym locker lol), and no ugly embarrassing white marks on my shirt either.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear and does not leave marks on my clothing which I love!  </li>
            <li> After years of using Suave deodorant,  I wanted to try a clear gel &amp; have to admit I love it!  </li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t bothered by a little wetness at first than this product will probably work great for you!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding deodorant and this worked awesome on me.  </li>
            <li> From the time I was in high school I have suffered with strong perspiration in the armpit area!</li>
            <li> It goes on clear, dries fast and clear, smells great and lasts!  </li>
            <li> Love that it dries fast</li>
            <li> To be honest, I was a bit speculative about the clear gel.  </li>
            <li> I even smell good the next morning!</li>
            <li> Double pack makes it a good price point.</li>
            <li> It was so cool to get this from BzzAgent to try out and review.</li>
            <li> The scent is light &amp;amp; fresh, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It was really cool that Halloween landed on a Friday this year, but we all work too, so didn&#x27;t always have a chance to go home and prepare before the festivities started.</li>
            <li> Even though I got it as part of a promotion, my review is true and something I would put even if I didn&#x27;t get it as a promotion.</li>
            <li> Light smelling and fresh.</li>
            <li> Not bad, I thought.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to be part of this bzzagent campaign because it had been so long since using a gel, I figured I would be a good candidate.  </li>
            <li> Want a deodorant that will leave you clean and fresh for a full 48 hours?</li>
            <li> First off,this deodorant has a pleasant clean scent with a very tiny hint of coconut.</li>
            <li> Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li> It has kept me clean and fresh even in 110 degree weather.</li>
            <li> then some for us super moms who don&#x27;t get time to take a shower every day.</li>
            <li> There is no burn, it dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave marks.</li>
            <li> Gel dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Since I am allergic to most perfumes, oftentimes, my deodorant is the only scent I&#x27;m able to wear.  </li>
            <li> I would love to find out if there are any other scents because i would love to try those as well!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant.</li>
            <li> but it definitely left me feeling fresh for a good day.  </li>
            <li> I know I will be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> Because it dries so quickly, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about clothing stains or streaks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I remember why I have been a loyal Dove user all these years:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I know I will be a loyal customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also dries quickly after applying so</li>
            <li> Okay, so I had a Halloween party last night and most of us dressed up.</li>
            <li> and we all shared it, taking quick swipes with TP between armpits for those who got grossed out by the prospect of sharing something</li>
            <li> It did go on clear and the scent wasn&#x27;t very strong.  </li>
            <li> I love this deodorant and highly recommend it any one.  </li>
            <li> It has been a very hot summer</li>
            <li> about 3hrs into my shift my armpits were more sweaty than normal and there was a bit of an odor.</li>
            <li> It holds up on those very hot days, too.</li>
            <li> it is very hot and humid</li>
            <li> so it can get very hot.  </li>
            <li> Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel to try for free!</li>
            <li> The scent is very mild, which I like because I can be sensitive to strong scents.  </li>
            <li> The Completely Clean smell is fresh, strong enough to enjoy, but not overwhelming and generally a great scent!</li>
            <li> I Love my new #secretoutlast #cleancleargel #freesample #Bzzagent</li>
            <li> I have a new favorite brand.  </li>
            <li> Just be aware that if you&#x27;re looking solely at the picture or solely at the words, make sure that you read the reviews and see that you&#x27;re getting what you really wanted...</li>
            <li> And the scent is awesome and long lasting but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and actually smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> When this runs out shortly I will buy some more as soon as I can!</li>
            <li> I have tried this product for the first time today!</li>
            <li> DEORDANT&#x27;S. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> overall I am pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been enjoying this product so far!</li>
            <li> This goes on really smooth and dries super fast.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth (not gloppy) &amp;amp; dries super fast.</li>
            <li> it smelled great and stayed smelling fresh all day long (yes, i just did a smell check 14 hours later - just now :) ).</li>
            <li> The fragrance is crisp and clean without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very pleasant and long lasting.</li>
            <li> First off, there&#x27;s the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a chance to try this before I was pregnant, and right now that I am pregnant, so</li>
            <li> I received a free sample and decided to really test it as the reason I stopped using product was because it seemed to lose its impact.  </li>
            <li> I am very thankful I received the product free of charge from BuzzAgent to sample</li>
            <li> It is amazing no white marks up to 48 hrs of protection</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally a solid stick kind of girl</li>
            <li> I have tried 3 or 4 gel deodorants and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Gel works great!</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast really is an excellent product..</li>
            <li> I was very happy to have been sent Secret Outlast lavender deodorant.  </li>
            <li> After a run, going to the pool, and out to dinner, I was still feeling and smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> well and have a fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> I think that Secret Outlast is an awesome deodorant!</li>
            <li> and I was amazed at how fresh I was after two hectic days of running kids to activities and working out.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find out that this deodorant is everything it claims to be and much much more.</li>
            <li> ITEM IS AS DESCRIBED ON LINE AND IS WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> This has kept me smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> Great product, loves that it&#x27;s a clear gel and won&#x27;t leave white spots on my clothing</li>
            <li> and I have been warm enough I would have known.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used this before heading into the gym, and I can say that Secret Outlast has given me the best odor and wetness protection of all the brands I have tried before.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly SURPRISED to find out that this deodorant is EVERYTHING it claims to be and MORE.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is worth buying.</li>
            <li> No problem with this one at all.. it stays just as fresh smelling all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved the ease of application, the scent, the fact that it didn&#x27;t leave white marks, and that it really, truly worked---&#x3D;-even when I tested out its claim to work for 48 hours</li>
            <li> I got this free from BzzAgent and will definitely be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I do not like Powder Fresh scents</li>
            <li> My favorite part of this product is that it&#x27;s white mark free.  </li>
            <li> and I’m pleased to report clear gel deodorant</li>
            <li> I promise no disappointment.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used clear gels in many years.</li>
            <li> I like powder fresh or baby powder scents.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T laugh.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job at keeping me dry and confident during my long days at school and when I&#x27;m up all night running around at work.</li>
            <li> The gel was nice, went on easily, felt cool and dried pretty quick</li>
            <li> but it dries pretty quickly - you still have to stand there for a minute or two &amp;#34;fanning&amp;#34; yourself before it dries</li>
            <li> Dries pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> Even though I am pretty brand loyal to Dove (and have been for awhile)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stain clothing, clear gel goes on easily and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It is easy to dispense and easy to apply and dries instantly.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of your outlast completely clean clear gel</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do well with strong perfume smelling deodorants and have finally found a great deodorant with a great scent thanks to Secret!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m overall, happy and pleasantly surprised with how much I like this deodorant!</li>
            <li> Who does, right?</li>
            <li> I put this on right out of the shower</li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about marks on my clothes and can get dressed right away.</li>
            <li> I usually apply an antiperspirant at night and then use regular deodorant in the morning, and this stuff fits the bill perfectly for a &amp;#34;regular deodorant.&amp;#34; It has a great fresh scent, goes on clear, and dries quickly with no white marks.</li>
            <li> It smells so amazing that i feel fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming to where it will take over your perfume, it&#x27;s just pleasant and clean.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used a gel deodorant too and so far really pleased with it</li>
            <li> One to one and a half click is all you need and you&#x27;re good for the whole day!!</li>
            <li> Next, it is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I normally haven&#x27;t liked to many of Secrets deodorants, but this one really kept me dry and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li> It also had a nice clean scent that won&#x27;t overpower your perfume or other scents.  </li>
            <li> The gel is clear, goes on smooth, and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> the only thing that kept me from giving it a perfect score is that i was a bit wet yesterday under my arms - but it was a much warmer day</li>
            <li> I never had problems with wetness/odor control with my other deodorant, it was pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It not only smelled great but it actually left my skin feeling soft not dry and didn&#x27;t bother it at all allergy wise.</li>
            <li> and when I woke up the next morning I was still smelling as lovely as I had the morning before when I had first applied it!</li>
            <li> I feel better knowing that Secret Outlast deodorant will keep me smelling at my best on all the hot summer walks that me and my boyfriend do daily with our hyper dog.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the product, it really doesn&#x27;t leave any white streaks and that is probably the main reason why I love it so much!</li>
            <li> I will certainly be making the switch!</li>
            <li> The Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel is awesome.</li>
            <li> The gel is quick and easy to apply, worked effectively for at least 24 hours</li>
            <li> It really is clear drying, it really lasts 48 hours or more.</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing, it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks and dries really fast.</li>
            <li> This product was just as good with less clicks of the container.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast clean clear gel deodorant truly works great!  </li>
            <li> I also love that is fast drying and clear.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m not usually a clear gel kind of girl.</li>
            <li> I have no white marks and still smell great even when its over 100 outside!</li>
            <li> Secret Clean Clear Gel has been awesome!  </li>
            <li> Prior to trying this product I was using Mitchum gel antiperspirant because, as the mother of a 7 month old boy, I run around all day and NEED a good order and sweat control</li>
            <li> overall I must say this is a great product if you are looking for a deodorant that keeps you dry and smelling fresh all day ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very effective, fast to dry after applied, keeps you dry and odor-free all day long, and the best part is - none of my clothes have been ruined by white deodorant marks!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to #getitfree and try this new deodorant from #bzzagent.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone from teenagers to acrobats ;).</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;d like to try an unscented before rating it higher.</li>
            <li> Plus I love that this deodorant never leaves white streaks on my clothes!</li>
            <li> The claim is 48 hours, and on a recent camping trip, I was able to test that out.  </li>
            <li> It dries fast!</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I do not like the feeling of gel when it is first applied and even though it doesn&#x27;t leave marks</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my shirt and blouses.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent and the fact that it last through out the day.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The gel form dries quickly, which was my main concern.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t get whiffs of it during the day, because I find that kinda gross.  </li>
            <li> Great product, and long lasting</li>
            <li> Get effective protection without feeling sticky or wet.</li>
            <li> I can go on and on but the simple fact is I love this product and DEF</li>
            <li> Would for sure purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> After receiving a free sample of this from Secret, I can say this deodorant works way better than most.</li>
            <li> so I am glad I have finally found one that works.</li>
            <li> Which is better than having your solid clump up!</li>
            <li> First off it says 48 hours protection.  </li>
            <li> I was outside on the family farm ALL day in the heat picking Cherries from a Cherry Tree in the orchard, I had on a colored tank top.</li>
            <li> so well I was able to wear the SAME shirt to go out that night to meet up with friends.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my first time trying a gel deodorant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky like most gel deodorants and doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue on your clothes.</li>
            <li> Native American in me :).  </li>
            <li> It was a hot and humid day today</li>
            <li> No sweaty shirts at the end of the day in a hot, stuffy classroom.  </li>
            <li> Outlast is exactly what this did.</li>
            <li> and I will for sure be purchasing this again in the future!!</li>
            <li> My favorite thing is that it doesn&#x27;t leave any unsightly white marks on your clothing.</li>
            <li> Would for sure purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> This product is even better than most clinical strength brands I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> It comes in many forms and different scents.</li>
            <li> I received this deodorant from BZZAGENT as a free trial and I love it hands down.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is amazing.</li>
            <li> No white stains on my shirt, long lasting protection, and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the long lasting nature of the product and felt that it lasted well into the next day after use.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant 2.7 oz</li>
            <li> I do notice the Completely Clean fragrance whenever I lift my arms (which is frequently, between lifting children, doing the hokey pokey, and playing airplanes).</li>
            <li> I love the clear coverage this offers, but it doesn&#x27;t make up for the burn when applying after shaving.  </li>
            <li> The scent on this one is pretty strong and I was not a big fan of it, so when I purchased another one I went with the unscented.</li>
            <li> No weird white creases, and it dries really quickly when applied, and isn&#x27;t sticky at all!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use gel deodorant, but I applied this in the morning and it dried quickly and smelled great!</li>
            <li> I put on a little more to get through the day, and when I showered that night, still no bad odor.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying this - it is now my favorite antiperspirant/deodorant and I highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase the full product and recommend to friends!</li>
            <li> Although I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the completely clean scent (I prefer Power fresh scents), once it&#x27;s dried</li>
            <li> It works great on dark clothes no  white marks.  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed any white marks; it dries very quickly,  </li>
            <li> Goes on clear, dries quickly and protects all day.  </li>
            <li> The smell of this one is a bit strong which is my only reason for the 4 star review.</li>
            <li> I usually go for the powder fresh or cocoa butter scents, but this one is nice and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I was so very excited to receive free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent.</li>
            <li> I stayed dried all day and plus, the scent wasn&#x27;t overwhelming!  </li>
            <li> I hope they can make it in a few more scents though!</li>
            <li> As a new mom, i have a pretty consistent morning time &amp;#34;new mommy&amp;#34; stink.</li>
            <li> However I was looking for a new form of deodorant because I am not quite satisfied with my current one.</li>
            <li> I got even more excited when I got to test the new Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel for free for my BzzAgent campaign</li>
            <li> Thanks to One2OneNetwork, I received a free sample of the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear  Gel for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Chasing a toddler around the house all day long (especially in this warm autumn weather we have) calls for me to make sure I&#x27;m extra protected in the odor area.  </li>
            <li> I feel confident it will keep me dry and odor free for the entire day.</li>
            <li> The gel dried super fast, and the deodorant works better than any I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> The gel dried super fast, and the deodorant works better than any I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> the scent is a little strong at first, but it is pleasant and not a huge problem.  </li>
            <li> I can tell it lives up to it&#x27;s promises and it still smells great after a long active day.</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve when it comes to knowing how much to use.</li>
            <li> I even worked up a sweat today to really test it out-</li>
            <li> now it dries almost as fast as you apply it and it lasts all day and</li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of gel deodorant, but I really do like this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I think Secret makes great products</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it held up very well</li>
            <li> (Thanks to BzzAgent)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m free from odor and wetness and white marks on my clothes...</li>
            <li> but it dries fast.</li>
            <li> I did however notice that it comes out fast</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast gel is a great concept, but I think there are some improvements that could be made and</li>
            <li> it really</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> Having said all of that, I want to talk about what really sells me - 48 hour protection.  </li>
            <li> I get up every day at 5 am and race to get myself ready so that I can be ready when my kids get up for school.  </li>
            <li> So much so that I keep one at work.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to test out this deodorant from bzzagent.com free of charge and I will definitely be buying it from now on.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  </li>
            <li> And the important feature for me, is the no white marks on your shirts.  </li>
            <li> I was given this to try thanks to BzzAgent</li>
            <li> If you prefer a more fun, specialty scent this will probably be boring to you, but I found it perfectly acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I got this free from BzzAgent definitely will be stocking up on this deodorant!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li> I am really digging this gel formula.  </li>
            <li> Confident that I won&#x27;t have marks or wet spots</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent</li>
            <li> I then tried the secret clinical and thought that was great.  </li>
            <li> I have a tendency to get too much.  </li>
            <li> It really does the job all day with no worries Q</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Lastly, it&#x27;s much easier to wash off when I need to.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Great Secret product, stands up to the advertising.</li>
            <li> I actually really like this scent too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really smell anything.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the results.</li>
            <li> It delivers real results for people like you and me.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes the 48 hour protection.</li>
            <li> I DO FEEL MUCH CLEANER</li>
            <li> This product saves me from those wet armpit days during summer :)</li>
            <li> but I like that this is totally clear and smells fresh.</li>
            <li> When I opened the cover to the Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel, I was pleasant surprised by the fresh scent of the gel.  </li>
            <li> I alway really liked knowing that there were no white lines on my clothing, or clumped in my armpits after exercising, which can happen with an invisible solid.  </li>
            <li> I liked that it dried on contact</li>
            <li> I did get to try it for free through a campaign through BzzAgent, and Secret Outlast deodorant, but all of these are my own views.</li>
            <li> It seemed kind of messy.  </li>
            <li> None and I am pretty sure I touched my under arm to the black t-shirt</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bzzagent for Secret Outlast Clean Clear Gel and was able to try this for free.</li>
            <li> From playing soccer outside, to getting dinner ready, I still feel fresh at night before my shower!</li>
            <li> No white residue and leaves you feeling fresh and confident whole day long.</li>
            <li> I have found that this product smells fresh and clean and is super long lasting.</li>
            <li> I was so anxious to receive this free sample from (Bzz Agent)!!</li>
            <li> She tried other deodorants on top, body sprays and perfume, and her odor still came through.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly impressed and will be sad and upset if this ever leaves the market!</li>
            <li> and now she knows the secret (lol, get it) of not sweating in high heat</li>
            <li> My only issue is the clean sent smells like I showered in laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> scent, which was a refreshing change from my usual power fresh sent.  </li>
            <li> When i tore back the seal, I got an overpowering whiff of the &amp;#34;completely clean scent&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of a long lasting deodorant</li>
            <li> To my surprise it went on easy(dries quick too), lasted a long hot day without leaving grody looking stains on my shirt</li>
            <li> Most days it worked really well, if i was working outside doing manual labor it did not last through the day.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant lives up to the hype of lasting a full 48 hours.</li>
            <li> No white streaks on my black tops, lasted all day as someone with frequent hot flashes that is as important as the completely clean part!</li>
            <li> I would never have tried Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel if this wasn&#x27;t sent to me, and I love it!</li>
            <li> It does dry pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Though don&#x27;t expect to miracles on staying dry if it is super hot out--life happens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found my new deoderant!  </li>
            <li> In fact, I was pleasantly surprised how long it lasted, loved that I got to use ALL the product , and was pleased that I didn&#x27;t have to deal with a broken or crumbly stick.  </li>
            <li> It kept me odor free all day and dry all day...</li>
            <li> This deodorant promises to keep you dry and odor free for 48 hours after applying.</li>
            <li> I love secret products and I recieved this product for free from bzzagent.  </li>
            <li> Its lightweight, dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> I received a free sample from Secret through BzzAgent and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that I have gotten another sample from them as well because you can not have too much of this Secret Outlast!</li>
            <li> but I guess that is okay because you dont have to worry about those embarrassing deodorant stains that the white solid gives you.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see that Secret Outlast held up - greatly reduced sweat, odor, staining.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d definitely recommend it overall, but I&#x27;d suggest pairing it with an antiperspirant if you tend to sweat a lot :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this was a decent product, in the 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I really am amazed at how fast it dries without leaving clothing all marked up.</li>
            <li> However this particular product is not for me.  </li>
            <li> i got mild white marks.</li>
            <li> work in a very busy hospital that can also be very stressful at times.  </li>
            <li> The smell was good and didn&#x27;t make my pits sticky but didn&#x27;t last as long as the invisible solid does.</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the slippery wet feeling of the gel, but it dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> So I had high expectations for this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this deodorant at first thinking it was pretty much like every Secret product.  </li>
            <li> I was curious to try it since I&#x27;ve been a loyal user of Secret deodorant for years and have always had great experiences with their products, but hadn&#x27;t tried this particular product.  </li>
            <li> It kept my odor free as well as dry!</li>
            <li> Of course, for most people this isn&#x27;t a big deal, but I am super impatient, so it gets frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t necessarily completely prevent sweating, but it certainly helps and prevents you from stinking if you do sweat.</li>
            <li> The clear gel does not stain at all!!</li>
            <li> I was surprised this deodorant WORKS!!</li>
            <li> As a teacher, this time of year is always a little challenging when it comes to knowing how to dress.  </li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean deodorant as a promotion from the company to try how well it performs,well I wasn&#x27;t let down with its great protection.</li>
            <li> gave this product four stars, however, because I really don&#x27;t enjoy the sticky, wet feeling immediately after applying it.  </li>
            <li> It is COMPLETELY clear, and dries relatively fast.  </li>
            <li> and I am surprised at how fast the gel dries.  </li>
            <li> I felt fresh for the entire day, morning to night.</li>
            <li> I smell fresh by the next day, and this is supposed to be a 48 hour antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Have tried others, but will always go back to Secret, it&#x27;s simply the best.</li>
            <li> The best part about Secret Outlast is that I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting white marks on my clothes like solid kinds of deodorant will give you.</li>
            <li> This is worth the buy and switch to this brand and gets a solid 5 stars from me!</li>
            <li> It is suppose to  leave no white marks, and keep you fresh for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> I normally go to the gym on my lunch break</li>
            <li> but this didn&#x27;t work for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical as to its claims to be a 48 hour protection, leave no white marks, and keep you fresh for an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t normal for me.  </li>
            <li> I put it on in the morning and went about my normal day of chores and chasing my kids.</li>
            <li> I normally pick &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;baby powder/baby fresh&amp;#34; anyway as those are my go to scents.  </li>
            <li> It dried pretty quickly and left me with a clean feeling, not sticky at all, which I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I can go 24 hours in the Texas heat and still smell good when I use Secret Outlast.</li>
            <li> I love Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel Deodorant!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this deodorant because it was pretty legit to see how well it did not leave white streaks on my black shirts underneath the arm areas.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this because it is fresh and really works at keeping me dry.</li>
            <li> I experimented with it, and it takes the same amount of time to dry, whether or not your pits are smooth shaven or looking like &#x27;Squatch!</li>
            <li> and I have to admit I sometimes get interrupted during my workouts and need to come back up to the office right away and inhave to skip the shower.</li>
            <li> I put it on right out of the shower and can say I have no problems about freshness for hte next 48 hours.</li>
            <li> It lived up to the great experiences I&#x27;ve always had with secret and kept me fresh even while being active.</li>
            <li> When I received the free sample of Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel (THANK YOU, BZZAGENT!!!)</li>
            <li> As a stay at home mom, the first few hours of the day are the most crucial for me when it comes to deodorant!</li>
            <li> Great product, no more white marks!works same as it says it will.</li>
            <li> I live in the Philippines but order this from the States.</li>
            <li> However, this is my new go to deodorant.</li>
            <li> But not with this new product - I even intentionally put it on clothing to &amp;#34;test&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> you want to try a new deodorant I would recommend this.  </li>
            <li> The random whiffs of the deodorant are a friendly reminder that you are still fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> The best part is no more white lines on my black shirts!</li>
            <li> I loved Secret Outlast Clear Gel&#x27;s scent.  </li>
            <li> It is very important to me to have dry pits, ALL DAY LONG!</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry all day long and at the end of the day I&#x27;m also odor free!</li>
            <li> This dries very quickly, it isn&#x27;t at all sticky and it definitely lasts as long as I need it.  </li>
            <li> Not with this one, it was absolutely clear!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still surprised!</li>
            <li> even when I got a streak of it on my tshirt, it disappeared completely!</li>
            <li> I even got some on the front of my sweater and it came completely off, no mark!  </li>
            <li> But this just happens to be the first gel deodorant that actually works.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ve sure needed it in the past...</li>
            <li> I am now hooked and I plan to replace my old deodorant with it!</li>
            <li> I am hoping they have this same Completely Clean scent in a solid!!</li>
            <li> I received a free Secret Completely Clean as a BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> I was given Secret Outlast Completely Clean to try for free</li>
            <li> The gel was very quick to dry and didn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothing.</li>
            <li> Overall I love the no mess, great smelling, long lasting new Secret!</li>
            <li> The Secret gel is much better then the solid white in my opinion! :]</li>
            <li> i love this deodorant i have tried many different ones, but for some reason i keep going back to secret brand.</li>
            <li> I have always been reluctant to try new deodorants and was pleasantly surprised by this one.  </li>
            <li> Recommend this deodorant to anyone who live a busy on the go lifestyle.</li>
            <li> I struggled for a long time trying to get just the right deo.</li>
            <li> I was given this Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel for free by Scecret.</li>
            <li> so I got to try the Secret Outlast completely clean clear gel for free.  </li>
            <li> It keeps me feeling fresh and dry.</li>
            <li> It dried very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It did keep my dry throughout the day and kept me fresh smelling, but I don&#x27;t think that I will be switching to gel anytime soon.</li>
            <li> But it kept me dry and fresh, so I kept using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really does go on clear and is super long lasting.</li>
            <li> In other words, I didn&#x27;t expect anything special.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to everyone who wants to be sweat odor fre and fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> tried this, and it really does dry fast.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make the same mistake as I did and order this quickly without reading the entire product description!  </li>
            <li> The deodorant worked very well and dried quickly.  </li>
            <li> The fact that this product does not leave no white marks  was a winner for me and that alone  enough to make me a loyal user.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel to review as being a BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to use Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, dries fast, long lasting and never leaves white marks on your clothing.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my underarms and this product really helps; my skin doesn&#x27;t feel itchy or red.  </li>
            <li> This gel went on very wet and felt cool on my underarms for hours.</li>
            <li> still fresh and dry!</li>
            <li> Long lasting, feels and stays fresh, clean, and dry!</li>
            <li> I was given a little trial size sample for free to try out.</li>
            <li> I am a Bzz Agent and received a full size sample of Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel Deodorant and coupons to share with friends and family.</li>
            <li> This is so quick drying and doesn&#x27;t leave underarm residue from my clothing like other gels.</li>
            <li> It is clear so it doesn&#x27;t leave marks.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a deodorant / anti-perspirant snob, so i appreciated that this product went on clear, so i didn&#x27;t have to worry about white marks on my clothing.</li>
            <li> Clear  </li>
            <li> Clear  Gel over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I did not get the clear gel.  </li>
            <li> I was given a stick deodorant when my order clearly says clear gel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear gel</li>
            <li> It goes on clear.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear like it says,  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that i goes on clear and stays that way.</li>
            <li> The gel is clear and dries fast, so no white marks on my clothes!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it goes in clear and does not stain my clothes.</li>
            <li> but its coming closer to the conclusion with outlast clear gel it stays on</li>
            <li> I like that it is clear</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t get this product again unless it was completely scent</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This product though has me completely hooked.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not just my sensitive pregnancy nose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s early and I am often working on autopilot.  </li>
            <li> I musst say I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> , I was surprised a gel deodorant worked so well.</li>
            <li> (it has thus far)</li>
            <li> As far as protection goes, it&#x27;s about a 3.5.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it as an adult.</li>
            <li> It dries fast and It don&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothes.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear and completely stays that way, no clumps, even after working out.</li>
            <li> This deodorant really stands up to the test, and is something that I will purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> Not messy since clear, and really did last up to 48 hours!</li>
            <li> As far as whiteness protection-</li>
            <li> You get way too much on the outsides and almost nothing in the middle.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at how this performed and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I  have a natural tan</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I had this opportunity because I never really liked gel deodorants.</li>
            <li> , I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> , i don&#x27;t have to reapply until early in the afternoon</li>
            <li> With my old deodorant, I would apply it by 7:00 a.m. and notice odor by around noon.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel goes on clear and keeps me free from white marks on my shirts.  </li>
            <li> Recently had the chance to try Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel deodorant for free to review</li>
            <li> Be careful about using right after shaving or it may sting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The secret clear gel goes on smooth and dries very fast.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get used to how many &#x27;clicks&#x27; to use, as there seems to be a bit of &#x27;settling&#x27; of product from day to day and one click doesn&#x27;t seem to be enough gel on the first underarm, but is plenty on the second.&lt;br /&gt;The verdict?</li>
            <li> I am familiar with other Secret deodorants, but Secret Outlast is awesome!</li>
            <li> It was an additional bonus that it was quick to dry without leaving a sticky feeling and that I was odorless the entire day!!!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to find a decent replacement in all of Asia (even though Secret also sells here).</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try Secret Outlast gel via BzzAgent and, overall, am pretty pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I typically use men&#x27;s clear solid for dryness and odor protection (I don&#x27;t love the scent, but it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that keeps me dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received the outlast active fresh deodorant</li>
            <li> This is why I normally steer clear of personal products with scents or dyes in them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got it for free to try out, because I would have stuck with the same old deodorant I&#x27;ve been using forever that has only been working on a mediocre level.</li>
            <li> I have never really liked clear gel deodorant but was surprised the Secret outlast was better then most.</li>
            <li> Gel deodorant has certainly come a long way.  </li>
            <li> I recently tried Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel and was surprised how smoothly it glided on my skin and NO white marks!!</li>
            <li> Really like the new Secret Outlast Clean Clear Gel.</li>
            <li> Not only does Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel provide longer lasting odor protection, it also dries quickly without leaving any marks!</li>
            <li> I am a high school biology teacher, and spend several hours each day on my feet in front of my students and in the lab.</li>
            <li> Prior to starting this campaign, with my free sample as a Bzz Agent, I was using a regular white deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Also, I loved the fact that a little goes a long away so one tube of this deodorant will last for a long awhile!</li>
            <li> This Secret Outlast deodorant has become my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I already love using Secret and the new Secret Outlast is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the the Secret Outlast solid and was pleasantly surprised that I liked this better than the solid form.</li>
            <li> I like heavy scents, this one was not overly strong, but was just enough that I knew it was there.  </li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product (thanks to Secret) and immediately switched from my old deodorant to this one.</li>
            <li> I just call that a bonus for this sort of product any way since I know how to launder my clothes well enough that it isn&#x27;t normally a problem either way.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel kept me dry all day long.  </li>
            <li> I normally use solid or spray antiperspirant/deodorant</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t really like was when I first began to perspire, my underarms felt a bit sticky, which i think is typical of gels.  </li>
            <li> I did have to figure how not to extract too  much gel out of the bottle because otherwise it sticks to the top of the cap and is a big waste of product but other than that I am sticking to this brand!</li>
            <li> It works really well at keeping my pits dry and the BO smell at bay.</li>
            <li> It dries fast and keeps me dry as well.</li>
            <li> Also, unlike a solid, I know how much product is actually going on my arm pits.</li>
            <li> It was my first experience with gel deodorant and thought it worked really well, the only concern i would have is how long the stick will last compared to a solid stick.  </li>
            <li> I am well pleased with this Secret clear gel.  </li>
            <li> I think Secret Outlast clear gel is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Generally gel deodorants leave my armpits feeling &amp;#34;wet and sticky&amp;#34;, not this!</li>
            <li> The clear gel goes on clear and stay on clear and it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear and really does last all day long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not completely offensive by any means, but I hate nothing more than sitting at work and catching a whiff of my antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> As a member of one2one network, I received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from the clearlybetterchallenge site.</li>
            <li> a member of One2OneNetwork, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s New Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com</li>
            <li> As a member of one2one network, i received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> The scent is light, it dries super fast, leaves no sticky feeling , no white marks even on your black clothing , and keeps you completly dry , and odorless no matter how hard you are working or playing.  </li>
            <li> I was also excited to try the clear gel, as I usually use the invisible solid.  </li>
            <li> It keeps me smelling pleasant all day, but unfortunately does not keep me dry in the sweltering FL heat.  </li>
            <li> Even on hot, sticky days I have confidence that Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel is still working.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, BzzAgent for the opportunity to try Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel.</li>
            <li> I have been using a full-size sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel given to me for free by BzzAgent for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I was excited about trying the new Secret Clear Gel Outlast 48 hour odor protection deodorant.</li>
            <li> Having used clear gel deodorant in the past I was hesitant to give it a try as most clear gel deodorants leave you feeling a little soggy under the arms.</li>
            <li> The smell is also very clean and not overpowering in the least!</li>
            <li> and I generally don&#x27;t like the smell of deodorant.  </li>
            <li> The clear gel is also a plus,not having any white marks on my shirts...</li>
            <li> The clear gel leaves no white marks on my clothing.</li>
            <li> When I purchased my next antiperspirant, I purchased this product which says a lot as I usually go for the cheapest product available.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the basic clinical strength deodorant, but was given a chance to try this for free through a program on Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li> And also its really affordable and long lasting.</li>
            <li> second thing I need is for the product to not bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so be careful I really dislike being wasteful.</li>
            <li> Also I have sensitive skin and sometimes deodorant burns upon application, especially just after I have shaved.</li>
            <li> Thanks but no thanks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I am going back to my old brands, ever.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised that this one dries almost instantly!</li>
            <li> As far as the lasting power goes, I can say it lasted me all through the day</li>
            <li> (Kids gotta eat, apparently.)</li>
            <li> Only thing i didn&#x27;t like was how the deodorant feels wet for a bit til it dries upon first application.</li>
            <li> What surprised me more is that later that evening I went for my Zumba class and as I was changing from my work clothes, I can still smell the freshness of Secret Outlast that&#x27;s after about 10 hours of application.  </li>
            <li> I love secret.  </li>
            <li> I received the Secret Outlast Deodorant to test and review for the clearly better challenge.</li>
            <li> Secret is my favorite</li>
            <li> but I must say that I am in love with secret outlast .</li>
            <li> Love this secret.</li>
            <li> When I went inside my house and looked down and had no sweat marks at all under my arms, I still smelled fresh and no white marks on my shirt either.</li>
            <li> Gel and I was completely blown away by the fresh scent, though like I previously said, it&#x27;s not overbearing for those who don&#x27;t like fragrance!!  </li>
            <li> It definitely does the job and does it well for keeping a person dry, especially in the summer when it&#x27;s hot out</li>
            <li> I have always used a solid deodorant and learned to live with the white marks.</li>
            <li> I felt pretty dry all day long and didn&#x27;t notice any odor to speak of.  </li>
            <li> When I applied the deodorant it went on wet feeling because of being a gel but dried very quickly.</li>
            <li> Another thing I love, is that unlike the solid this one does not stain black clothes which I wear a lot of black to work.</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I recently tried out Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Deodorant.</li>
            <li> first is for it to work for an entire day regardless of how active I am or what the weather is like.</li>
            <li> Not cool, since it&#x27;s another 5 hours before the first parent arrives, and I don&#x27;t have the luxury of re-applying deodorant around the lunch hour.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel offers 48 hour protection, I do not feel like I need to re-apply my deodorant during those long, busy days.</li>
            <li> Being 5 months pregnant in the middle of a hot humid summer is difficult but this stuff really keeps me dry.</li>
            <li> I live in Miami and work outside, so I personally need a Deodorant that actually lasts.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the products ability to live up to being a clear gel, as it did not leave white marks on my black work shirt.</li>
            <li> got it free to test and review thanks to Secret and BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast® Clear Gel completely free in a Bzzagent kit.</li>
            <li> However, I was VERY pleasantly surprised at how FAST this product dried once applied......and poof.....</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant in a BuzzAgent kit.  </li>
            <li> so I figured I&#x27;d try this because I am known to wear black clothing a few, OK, several, times a week.  </li>
            <li> final thing I look for in these types of products is no scent or very little scent, at the very least I don&#x27;t want a product that will attractive insects, I get enough bug bites as it is.</li>
            <li> so applying the gel first took a little getting used to</li>
            <li> While I knew the Secret Brand, I was looking forward to trying a new scent, Completely Clean, since I&#x27;ve usually used Powder Fresh.  </li>
            <li> Well until Secret outlast completely clean clear gel deodorant came into my life!  </li>
            <li> I am a busy mom on the go and keep extra deodorant in my car because on hot busy days I have to reapply at least once.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of secret outlast completely clean gel deodorant from bzzagent!</li>
            <li> Try Secret Outlast Completely Clean to kick pit odor to the curb!</li>
            <li> For everyday, I still prefer a solid deodorant because it feels dry and clean to apply.  </li>
            <li> Secret’s Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant is a unique product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> However, within a matter of moments, the gel had dried and it was like I hadn&#x27;t applied anything at all to my underarm, which is exactly what you want.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so Im not entirely confident in saying that it gives you 48 hours worth of protection</li>
            <li> No transfer to my clothes or gross white buildup that&#x27;s difficult to wash off; just a nice scent and sweat protection.</li>
            <li> I would definitely use Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel again!  </li>
            <li> The scent is light and feminine yet subtle enough not to give you a headache.  </li>
            <li> I was given this Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel to try.</li>
            <li> grabbed the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel that I received from BzzAgent</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel is a fast acting antiperspirant that holds up to both stressful situations and an active lifestyle.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of the secret outlast completely clean clear gel as a part of a bzz campaign from bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent and that I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll be making the switch to Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel.</li>
            <li> it kept me dry and dried quickly after I applied it.</li>
            <li> I feel dry through the day, no dampness making me feel self conscious (even if my audience is a class of 5 year olds).</li>
            <li> Lastly, I appreciate how it goes on clear, stays clear and doesn&#x27;t take long to dry.  </li>
            <li> I use Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel as soon as I step out of the shower for 48-hour odor protection with no white marks.</li>
            <li> The outlasting power of Secret outlast completely clean clear gel definitely outlasts all others!</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel and make the switch.</li>
            <li> Also, super slow at shipping so don&#x27;t expect this to show up on two day Amazon prime shipping if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> The gel formula takes a little getting used to if you normally use a solid, but it&#x27;s clear and leaves no white marks.</li>
            <li> (not that she gets to experience that very often in Seattle area) to no sweating in all those little female crevices.</li>
            <li> I had high hope for Secret Outlast Clear Gel, and after receiving it in a FREE BzzKit, was anxious to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I try to live an active lifestyle, walking to work, taking bar classes, and using the stairs at work whenever possible.  </li>
            <li> I dont like how the clear gel goes on wet feeling</li>
            <li> This new Secret Outlast really does outlast the others!  </li>
            <li> it does exactly what it says it does, it kept me dry all day, it dried within seconds</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last all day, other secret products are better</li>
            <li> Received a free sample of secret outlast clean sent gel deodorant to try from Secret.  </li>
            <li> When Bzz Agent sent me this product to review, I expected to like it as much as I did any other antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> Loving Secret outlast no more awful white residue, has great smell and lasts forever!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried other Secret deodorants and wasn&#x27;t too pleased with them</li>
            <li> The next morning after my shower, I applied the Secret Outlast Completely Clean</li>
            <li> I used to use the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Invisible Solid</li>
            <li> I was recently sent a sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Gel Antiperspirant  because I am a Bzz Agent</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it a try and see if it could measure up to other clear gels out there.</li>
            <li> It is a clear gel deodorant, but it is not like any other that I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I have tried other gel type deodorants in the past that left me feeling like I did not smell as fresh, this one can truly last ALL day with no extra applications.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and dries quickly especially when I am running late, not like other brands!</li>
            <li> have been a long time user of secret and this product is another fabulous deodorant to add to their product list.  </li>
            <li> I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent from BzzAgent for my review - my opinions are mine and honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t test it beyond that length of time), and was absolutely invisible (as opposed to the chalkier, grainy appearance of the &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; solid I usually use).  </li>
            <li> Tried the Secret Outlast Completely Clean through BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a &#x27;sweater&#x27; in general, but now that I&#x27;ve been running I found that my current deodorant wasn&#x27;t keeping up as well as I would like.  </li>
            <li> I have used the same solid deodorant for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of gel as its wet going on - however this dried quickly and keeps me dry for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using the invisible solid for a very long time and just recently recieved the gel form through a promotion.</li>
            <li> The one thing I did have a problem with is my &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; deodorant never was really clear, all my black tops got white marks.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I got no white marks on my clothes &amp; also No white dry residue under my arms.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not a huge fan of gel antiperspirants, but this one dried quickly and didn&#x27;t leave residue under my arms.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it looks like this gel just isn&#x27;t strong enough for me.</li>
            <li> It also goes on clear and leaves no marks on dark clothes.</li>
            <li> Not only did it last a really long time, it dried clear and did not leave any white marks on any of my clothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting even while working out.</li>
            <li> Total dryness and no odor on 12-hour long work days.</li>
            <li> has come a long way since I tried it in my younger years!</li>
            <li> , it was sticky and I didn&#x27;t feel like it lasted long enough.  </li>
            <li> I normally have to change deodorants ever few months.  </li>
            <li> It is cool to see the gel pop through the tiny holes on the dispenser before applying it - watch out because a little goes a long way and you don&#x27;t want to waste it!</li>
            <li> The only thing that I must say that is potentially negative is scrubbing it off in the shower, as it does leave a film, but other than that, it does exactly what it promises!</li>
            <li> The only thing i don&#x27;t like about this deodorant is when you barely put it on, it feels wet however, it does dry up.</li>
            <li> Not bad if you like smelling like soap but horrible if you are sensitive to strong fragrances.</li>
            <li> If you have ever been like me and have little deodorant balls under your arms after a day of use, the gel completely gets rid of it!</li>
            <li> If they work, they don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I have been using Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I mowed the yard and ran errands all day in 97 degree weather and stayed dry the entire time!</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to anyone with the patience to wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> It definitely saves off odor well, but doesn&#x27;t keep me as dry as I would like when I use it alone.</li>
            <li> I prefer a dry solid.</li>
            <li> only reason I could get away with this is the trust we share, and when I told them it would dry before they put their costumes on, they took a leap of faith and...</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean to try complimentary of BzzAgent and Secret but all opinions expressed are my own.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am a loyal Secret user, have been for years, and will continue to be.  </li>
            <li> I am lucky I got to try Secret Outlast gel for free through a Bzzagent campaign for Secret!</li>
            <li> My little tip though, don&#x27;t apply right after shaving your underarms, it does sting a bit if you nicked yourself a little. !</li>
            <li> I got this for free from BzzAgent and was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product for use when wearing dark, dressy clothes, as well as sleeveless clothing, because I find that the appearance (or lack thereof) of this product is worth the icky feeling until it dries.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> so my experiences are based on how long it lasts in a 24 hour period.  </li>
            <li> With the solid I always had to be careful not to get in on my shirt.</li>
            <li> b/c I don&#x27;t want to go that long without showering, but</li>
            <li> Although the gel, for me, is still of a &#x27;went&#x27; feeling when I put it on - it did not stay that way for long</li>
            <li> Lasts long.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a sticky wet feeling deodorant that left me feeling sweaty in just a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I have never used a deodorant that lasted so long.</li>
            <li> Compared to other gel deodorants, I will recommend Secret Outlast Completely Clean</li>
            <li> I was particularly skeptical that this would keep me dry and odor-free over two full days, but it actually does.</li>
            <li> and it dries quickly, leaving NO white residue behind on dark clothing.</li>
            <li> This goes on clear, but you do need to let it dry for a few moments before putting on your clothes.  </li>
            <li> I was so relieved at not having to worry about getting white streaks residue on any of my clothes especially my sleeveless black blouses and dresses.  </li>
            <li> Really though for me that is a small inconvenience for the benefits!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clear gels tend to leave less residue on your garments and this one lived up to that trend but not any better or worse than other clear gels I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> It takes too long to dry and by the end of the day I have been having some body odor issues.  </li>
            <li> It took too long to dry</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean does not leave messy white marks on my clothes.</li>
            <li> and there was a little bit of a mark that I just wiped clean with a wet towel, but at the end of the day when I would take my shirt off, underneath the armpits didn&#x27;t have a bunch of white marks, which usually turn into a little bit of a stain.  </li>
            <li> The one drawback for me is I usually use a clear powder stick so the sticky gel feeling after putting it  on took some getting used to!</li>
            <li> The only other comment I want to make is that my stick of this wasn&#x27;t evenly packed.</li>
            <li> Which lasts ALL day long!  </li>
            <li> She said she will repurchase this for a long time!</li>
            <li> Works under stressful situations and hard work in high heat.</li>
            <li> My underarms stayed dry for my shift.  </li>
            <li> , I just apply it when I get out of the shower and allow it to dry while I apply my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I like the way the product goes on and that it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes, but it takes a while to dry and then gets a bit sticky causing any loosening lint from clothing to stick to the area.</li>
            <li> Kept me dry, even during exercise.</li>
            <li> It kept me dry all day during all sorts of activities.</li>
            <li> I did stay dry while I was using it as well.  </li>
            <li> problem I have with the gel, is that it did not keep me dry.</li>
            <li> And it works - dry, no odor issues.  </li>
            <li> I apply after I&#x27;m dressed and this gel is dry by the time I pull my applying hand out from inside my shirt.  </li>
            <li> I had to walk around with my arms overhead to wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used gel in years because it never seemed to dry...</li>
            <li> Nope, it must already be dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always dry.</li>
            <li> We stayed dry, felt cleaner and no costumes were destroyed after applying the deodorant.</li>
            <li> Kept me dry, even during exercise.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like the initial wet feel from applying a wet gel.  </li>
            <li> I was definitely surprised by Secret&#x27;s Outlast Completely Clear deordorant.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because i have not been a fan of Secret due to the strong fragrance.  </li>
            <li> At first, I side-eyed how &#x27;tacky&#x27; my skin felt after application, but the other brand leaves residue, too - usually all over my dark shirts.</li>
            <li> Secret is usually very reasonable in price</li>
            <li> stopped using gel deodorants a few years ago because I was still getting wet/white marks on my clothes and generally just didn&#x27;t feel protected.  </li>
            <li> A single click on each side is plenty to keep me dry all day!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know how they could resolve it, but it bothers me enough to knock this down to four stars from five.</li>
            <li> Trying this clear gel was strange at first, since I wasn&#x27;t used to the cold, wet sensation of the gel.</li>
            <li> The only let down was that it does go on rather wet and takes a minute or so to dry.  </li>
            <li> I was dry and my pits didn&#x27;t stink!  </li>
            <li> This product kept me dry and odor-free all day!</li>
            <li> I actually stay drier with this one than I do with my clinical strength deodorant, so I will likely purchase this when I use my small stockpile of clinical strength deodorants.</li>
            <li> I typically use a solid as my antiperspirant/deodorant</li>
            <li> In fact, in the past I haven&#x27;t been a big fan of gel deodorant, but this one is different.</li>
            <li> Let me just say this first, I&#x27;m a really big fan of Secret deodorants!</li>
            <li> I have had mixed results with other Secret deodorants, but Secret Outlast is fantastic!</li>
            <li> It is a strong smell, it overpowers my perfume and makes it hard not to get nauseated.</li>
            <li> I got this free to try from Bzzagent and was skeptical, since I previously was a devotee of clinical strength deodorants.</li>
            <li> the second day i tested it by putting on a black shirt without being careful how i put the shirt on.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the subscribe and save experience; even with limited mobility, I can shop!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy Secret Outlast Clear Gel deodorant again!</li>
            <li> Starting off, I usually use roll on deodorants because I couldn&#x27;t find any other one that wouldn&#x27;t leave a white mark or stopped working after a couple of hours!</li>
            <li> It goes on somewhat wet since it&#x27;s a gel</li>
            <li> I have never really tried a gel before, I have always used solids.</li>
            <li> I really like Secret products, but I don&#x27;t care for the gel.</li>
            <li> but it already looked like it was almost empty.</li>
            <li> so my husband didn&#x27;t have to search the shelves and come home with something that was not really what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I Remember 10+ years ago wearing gel and feeling like it was so wet under my arms</li>
            <li> I stopped using gel deodorant years ago because it always felt wet under my arms</li>
            <li> I put my shirt on expecting it to get my shirt wet.  </li>
            <li> i had to work harder at my job</li>
            <li> I only had a few streaks and a clump here</li>
            <li> I am used to having that solid deodorant residue left behind by my solid deodorant product.</li>
            <li> It keeps your pits dry!!</li>
            <li> I had given up on Secret antiperspirant/deodorant products a few years ago when I was confronted by an old boss and told that I needed to change my deodorant because I smelled bad, and I have also tried another brand&#x27;s clear gel that did not dry quickly.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried other Secret deodorants that I didn&#x27;t like as much as Dove.</li>
            <li> I am thinking this particular Secret product just doesn&#x27;t work well with my body chemistry.  </li>
            <li> The gel left no marks, even on the little black dress I wore to a formal event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Other clear gels just don&#x27;t hold up as long and you always need to reapply,with Secret you never have to do that.</li>
            <li> Everything I love about salt deodorants and standard anti-antiperspirants in one package, without any of the things I hate like the mess or failures.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about trying Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;d rather have my pits smell pretty than offensive.</li>
            <li> I usually am an invisible solid gal...</li>
            <li> With this deodorant a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I am not sure about it lasting 48 hours,</li>
            <li> This is probably due to #3...&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> It successfully endured my day at work, a dash thru the supermarket and a gruesome workout afterwards!</li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;m a invisible solid girl.</li>
            <li> and I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t clump up like I have seen on other antiperspirants.    </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a wet gel when you put it on; so, your underarms feel wet for a while when you first put it on, which is a little weird.</li>
            <li> It is a little cold when you apply it, but it does dry quickly.  </li>
            <li> I was on the lookout to try a new deoderant when BzzAgent sent me Secret</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it goes on wet</li>
            <li> Many years ago I tried a different brand of gel deodorant and hated it.  </li>
            <li> The only down side of Secret Outlast is that it does burn a bit when applying directly after shaving you armpits, other than that Secret Outlast will be the only deodorant I use from now on!!</li>
            <li> Compared to other clear gels out there Secret has got them beat.</li>
            <li> going on a little wet</li>
            <li> It was a little weird at first to get used to it</li>
            <li> I tend to be very sensitive to fragrances and have had some deodorant scents that have made me sick or given me a headache after wearing for only a short time.</li>
            <li> It seems to dry faster than the other gel deodorant I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I am an average in the sweating department</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent and Secret I #GotItFree!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Secret and Bzz Agent!</li>
            <li> The only negative is that I always get an allergic reaction from the gel deodorant...</li>
            <li> I have now been using Secret Outlast Clear for two weeks and have not encountered any issues.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Secret, you may have just changed me into a gel girl!</li>
            <li> I was asked to try the Secret Clear Gel I thought, why not?</li>
            <li> am a busy mom of five and Secret</li>
            <li> I applied 3 clucks of Outlast after my shower and didn&#x27;t reapply for 48 hours (assuming I&#x27;d be sweaty or stinky before then) and was shocked that I was still fresh and dry.</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast as part of a brand promotion, but I have been a loyal Secret user for years.</li>
            <li> I got in from my harvesting, looked down and had NO sweat marks at ALL under my arms</li>
            <li> My baby sister came down to Texas from Washington state and got hit with feels like 100 degree weather.....  </li>
            <li> As a long time user of Secret solid I am always skeptical of new brands or formulas!  </li>
            <li> I jog 7 miles several times a week, and usually I&#x27;m a sweaty, stinky mess!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it this past week and it kept me dry all day.</li>
            <li> I was using previously</li>
            <li> Wearing a lot of black prompted me to seek out this product.</li>
            <li> I typically work an 8hr day.</li>
            <li> With my previous deodorant, I would sometimes need to reapply mid-day.</li>
            <li> She had a wedding she needed to attend and was reapplying part of the day while wearing a black dress</li>
            <li> and it did despite the fact that I was very active.</li>
            <li> The gel was cold when I applied it, and I was not used to the feeling of gel at first.  </li>
            <li> I switched to a clinical strength deodorant, which worked well except for the mess.</li>
            <li> First time it feels little bit cold but not sticky at all.  </li>
            <li> so applying the gel took a little getting used to since it&#x27;s a bit cold at first, but I no longer even notice that</li>
            <li> All the girls crowded into my bathroom to do costumes and makeup, and without fail, we wanted to freshen up before changing, which included applying new deodorant.</li>
            <li> I had tried Secret in the past but wasn&#x27;t completely sold.  </li>
            <li> It was a little sample stick</li>
            <li> Its not sticky are gooey like other gel deodorants I have tried In the past.</li>
            <li> i could smell myself a little at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I like how there&#x27;s no residue left behind</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve attached a photo to show how unevenly it came</li>
            <li> I have been giving Secret Outlast a try for about a month after I ran out of my solid deodorant.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-No oozy, messy application&lt;br /&gt;-Odor</li>
            <li> However, the sticky feeling went away in a few minutes and was not noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It withstood the exercise test in regards to scent and heavy perspiration.  </li>
            <li> I religiously use Secret</li>
            <li> The deodorant pictured appears to be the regular Secret Outlast (not the gel deodorant as described).</li>
            <li> Normally hate gel deodorant, but since it was free thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> so you have to wait a few seconds before you put on your shirt.</li>
            <li> Well i always put deodrant on everyday so that doesn&#x27;t matter to me.  </li>
            <li> Uneven application.</li>
            <li> Then you spend a few minutes trying to smush it around your armpit and hope for an even application.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t review the claim of it working 48 hours because I had to wash my armpits out after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I showered one morning, applied Secret Outlast, went through my day and then on to bed, woke up the next morning</li>
            <li> Since I started using Secret Outlast I only need to apply my deodorant once a day.</li>
            <li> but after a few minutes it dries and you don&#x27;t feel it.  </li>
            <li> Normally hate gel deodorant, but since it was free thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> If I hated it, I could just simply switch back to my old standby.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally avoid gels because I hate the way they go on wet and take forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> I got a sample from bzz agent and I was disappointed with it, The smell was over powering and it really didn&#x27;t keep me dry.</li>
            <li> Got the two pack for less than the price of one!</li>
            <li> Those tell tale lines that are usually sitting at the bottom of your black shirt and even though you try to wipe them off, you never get it all off until you wash it.</li>
            <li> In the past, I never liked using a gel deodorant because it made me feel messy and wet, but I can now say that I have found a gel deodorant that I like.</li>
            <li> always felt tacky, and that residue would get into the fibers of my clothes and change the color of my clothes under my arms, even getting stiff and holding in odor even after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this deodorant to any hard working hard sweating woman!</li>
            <li> I typically buy the Secret clinical strength but tried this after not really liking the consistency of the clinical strength</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to wait for armpits to dry to finish dressing; I have had no sweating or odor issues while using this Secret,  </li>
            <li> Secret keeps it promise because I stay dry all day.</li>
            <li> I usually hate clear gels but this one actually works!</li>
            <li> I have not had a single deodorant failure, yet!</li>
            <li> Actually I usually use Secret invisible dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small criticism</li>
            <li> im not sure it lasts 24 hours</li>
            <li> Smells great/clean, but not overwhelming so it won&#x27;t overpower your perfume.  </li>
            <li> Just like all deodorants it created a weird skin smell very shortly after.</li>
            <li> (and i&#x27;m not a sweaty person), and the fact it&#x27;s a gell trying to get thru the small holes.  </li>
            <li> Having used and not been a fan of gels in the past, I was leery of the claim that it dries within seconds of application.</li>
            <li> Not sure what sort of voodoo they put in this stuff, but it works like it says it does.</li>
            <li> My usual brand was Dove, but I found that in the summer months, I would still sweat and have that &amp;#34;hot deodorant&amp;#34; smell that I couldn&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li> Nothing worse than your clothes sticking to wet armpits!  </li>
            <li> I like Secret Outlast and plan to replace my regular Secret with this version</li>
            <li> I have always had a hard time finding an antiperspirant/deodorant that works.</li>
            <li> my armpits were very dry and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It also does not leave a thick residue that is noticeable on the skin or hard to wash off in the shower.</li>
            <li> At least people knew I tried to put deodorant under my arms...</li>
            <li> I did not experience any negative effects from the product, no itching or rashes.</li>
            <li> I have a 6 month old baby and since the birth of this last one my hormones have been insane and in my world, that means I&#x27;ve been sweating A LOT!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore, and at the end of the day I don&#x27;t feel moist, icky, or stinky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wetness protection is not amazing</li>
            <li> But, when my stick of Secret went missing (the handi-work of a toddler)</li>
            <li> but I was never able to get what I wanted from them until now!</li>
            <li> I mean I can put on a shirt and in 2 minutes I will have pit stains.</li>
            <li> The bad part, you gotta let it dry for a few minutes before getting dressed</li>
            <li> Now I do not notice any unpleasant odor all day, or even the next morning when I hit the shower.</li>
            <li> I WAS HAVING SERIOUS ODOR ISSUES WITH MY MOMMY HORMONES AFTER HAVING MY SON AND THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> i give hats off to secret about this new advance technology that is coming closer to hiding up the uncomfortable odor that women are sometimes afraid to admit.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but surprisingly I no longer even notice that.</li>
            <li> I had those cold, tacky underams and a wet shirt by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Not a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I was however, a bit disappointed in the lasting effects.</li>
            <li> I was incredibly skeptical to use a gel deodorant because I&#x27;ve had stain issues in the past and because I am a chef.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the scent of my other deodorants would smell funky by the end of the day.. not a BO smell, but the scent of the product just morphs into something unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I hated the wet feeling and that it stuck around for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product from Secret as part of their #ClearlyBetter campaign</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast as part of a promotion from the brand</li>
            <li> That all changed when Secret Outlast came along.</li>
            <li> I like to put my antiperspirant on before my clothes, to avoid marks, and I have to wait quite a while to get dressed to avoid Secret from rubbing off on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I got a Secret Outlast gel deodorant as part of a promotion, so I got to try it and see what I thought about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate to admit it, but yes, it does last 48 hours!</li>
            <li> Have used Secret for years.</li>
            <li> and I hate having white armpits.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s a secret you won&#x27;t want to miss:</li>
            <li> The premise behind the Outlast deodorant is that you get 48 hours of protection.  </li>
            <li> when I was a teenager I was a faithful Secret deodorant user.</li>
            <li> Despite the Secret Outlast label, it did not outlast for me.</li>
            <li> worse then if I would have not worn any deodorant at all.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the gel, and I associate the issues I had with Secret outlast to the Gel.</li>
            <li> I received a trial sample of this as part of a promotion from the Secret Brand.</li>
            <li> I was suffering from armpit sweat but after using secret Outlast It&#x27;s gone.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Secret for years.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample size to try from Secret</li>
            <li> I used to use Secret products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a dedicated secret buyer until I tried the degree motion</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of the secret brand</li>
            <li> I like Secret products and the Secret Outlast has both positives and negatives for me.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Secret Outlast from buzzagent.</li>
            <li> ; It really confused me this morning because I didn&#x27;t realize it was the deodorant.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample from of this deodorant to try (thank you Secret)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve alway been a Secret user, but have preferred the solids.  </li>
            <li> I use it under arm, under boob and secretly - twixt the thighs.  </li>
            <li> I received a delux sample of this deodorant as part of a promotion from Secret.</li>
            <li> Before I received this I was a faithful Secret invisible sold user.</li>
            <li> I tend to switch between Suave, Dove, and Secret</li>
            <li> and I got this sample of Secret Outlast deodorant called Secret Outlast: The Secret to 48 Hour Odor Protection.</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast from Bzzagent to try and I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical to use a gel deodorant again, as I have tried them in the past and hated the wet feeling.</li>
            <li> But with Secret Outlast I can go all day and still come home to my 3 kiddos under 4 and not a problem!</li>
            <li> I received a sample size of this deodorant from Secret for review purposes and I am so thankful that I did!</li>
            <li> I have tried clinical strength deodorants (which can be expensive).</li>
            <li> Thank you Secret Outlast!</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> and I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> and it always made me uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> When I turned the dial to push up the deodorant I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> this makes me sad.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any type of uncomfortable film on my skin or mark my clothes.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to any woman suffering from pit stains or excessive sweating you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> BOY WAS I WRONG!</li>
            <li> It was also nearly impossible to wash off when I wanted to shave.</li>
            <li> and it stayed for almost 40 hours with no stains and bad odor.</li>
            <li> One thing I have a bad habit of forgetting to do is put on my deodorant.  </li>
            <li> and I would rather stink than deal with a bad headache.</li>
            <li> WooHoo for Secret!!!</li>
            <li> the gel is AWFUL!  </li>
            <li> Now I sweat HORRIBLY!!</li>
            <li> stress sweat is the worst!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the worst that could happen?  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this brand and with the price I couldn&#x27;t pass up buying them.  Got the two pack for less than the price of one!</li>
            <li> This is a good product. I used it in fall season and it stayed for almost 40 hours with no stains and bad odor. I still need to test it in summer. the only thing that makes me rethink about it is the fragrance. I like more of flowery fragrance which I did not find in it.</li>
            <li> I have never been a gel fan until now. The Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel is awesome. I no longer have to worry about sweating embarrassment!! (I received the product as part of a promotion for the company)</li>
            <li> I teach 6th grade. I am constantly on the move. I found myself reapplying deodorant throughout the day. But with Secret Outlast I can go all day and still come home to my 3 kiddos under 4 and not a problem! From playing soccer outside, to getting dinner ready, I still feel fresh at night before my shower! Never had that before! Love secret outlast!  There is a learning curve when it comes to knowing how much to use. A single click on each side is plenty to keep me dry all day! So glad I was choosen as part of the bzzagent campaign!</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant and highly recommend it any one.  It goes on smooth, dries fast, long lasting and never leaves white marks on your clothing. I usually buy the the Secret Outlast solid and was pleasantly surprised that I liked this better than the solid form. I received for review from Bzzagent and I so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I Love my new #secretoutlast #cleancleargel #freesample #Bzzagent it does exactly what it says it does, it kept me dry all day, it dried within seconds &amp; I got no white marks on my clothes &amp; also No white dry residue under my arms. I was very happy with the results of this Deodorant &amp; would highly recommend it..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally a solid stick kind of girl and I always stuck to my favorite brand (Dove) but Outlast actually works! I&#x27;m still surprised! I never would have switched to a gel and I&#x27;ve tried other Secret deodorants that I didn&#x27;t like as much as Dove. I applied 3 clucks of Outlast after my shower and didn&#x27;t reapply for 48 hours (assuming I&#x27;d be sweaty or stinky before then) and was shocked that I was still fresh and dry. I even worked up a sweat today to really test it out- still fresh and dry! I&#x27;m so glad I got to try this out for free as a Bzzagent, otherwise, I may have never tried it.</li>
            <li> I would have never of tried this on my own. I am normally a solid deodorant type of gal. I never could get over the gooey gel feeling of a gel deodorant. I recently became a buzz agent and received this to try and review. I have used it for close to a month now it dries almost as fast as you apply it and it lasts all day and then some for us super moms who don&#x27;t get time to take a shower every day. It is clear so it doesn&#x27;t leave marks. I would recommend this for anyone from teenagers to acrobats ;). It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. I really enjoyed using this deodorant because it was pretty legit to see how well it did not leave white streaks on my black shirts underneath the arm areas. I worked double jobs almost daily so I was really pleased to say that I did not smell for one minute so it kept me feeling clean and smell real good! Also, I loved the fact that a little goes a long away so one tube of this deodorant will last for a long awhile!</li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of gel deodorant, but I really do like this. There is no burn, it dries quickly, and doesn&#x27;t leave marks. the scent is a little strong at first, but it is pleasant and not a huge problem.  I have tried 3 or 4 gel deodorants and this is by far my favorite. I tried this because I got it free through a company to rate the product.</li>
            <li> Received a free sample of secret outlast clean sent gel deodorant to try from Secret.  It&#x27;s a pretty good product. It works really well at keeping my pits dry and the BO smell at bay. I put it to the test and it held up nice after a 3 mile hike. My only issue is the clean sent smells like I showered in laundry detergent. Not bad if you like smelling like soap but horrible if you are sensitive to strong fragrances. I think I&#x27;d like to try an unscented before rating it higher.</li>
            <li> I live in the Philippines but order this from the States. They don&#x27;t make them as well here. This stuff works great. Haven&#x27;t been able to find a decent replacement in all of Asia (even though Secret also sells here).</li>
            <li> I like how it dries almost instantly and I absolutely love the smell!  It works really good so far.  I like how there&#x27;s no residue left behind and it&#x27;s a great value!  I got it as part of the Bzz kit to try out from Bzz Jono.  I like to try before I buy, I must admit that I&#x27;ll be buying this one!</li>
            <li> Great smell, actually does go on clear like it says and leaves you feeling fresh all day!!!</li>
            <li> I love secret products and I recieved this product for free from bzzagent.  It works great on dark clothes no  white marks.  If you like a gel it works great and smells good but for me I prefer the stick.</li>
            <li> Feeling a bit damp? This deodorant&#x27;s got your back! I&#x27;m a kindergarten teacher who is always on the move. Maybe it&#x27;s my age, maybe it&#x27;s the temperature setting in my classroom...but either way, I had noticed a bit of an embarrassing problem- dampness in my armpits! I was on the lookout to try a new deoderant when BzzAgent sent me Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel to try for free! I was not a fan of gel, but I figured that for free, I&#x27;d give it a week to try it out. At first, I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the slippery wet feeling of the gel, but it dries fairly quickly. It took a few tries to get used to how many &#x27;clicks&#x27; to use, as there seems to be a bit of &#x27;settling&#x27; of product from day to day and one click doesn&#x27;t seem to be enough gel on the first underarm, but is plenty on the second.&lt;br /&gt;The verdict? I feel dry through the day, no dampness making me feel self conscious (even if my audience is a class of 5 year olds). No odor whatsoever, just a hint of clean perfume-y scent. No transfer to my clothes, even when I got a streak of it on my tshirt, it disappeared completely! Sounds like a winner to me!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased when I received a sample of the antiperspirant complimentary from BzzAgent for reviewing purposes. I was pleasantly surprised by the products ability to live up to being a clear gel, as it did not leave white marks on my black work shirt. I also enjoyed the scent and durability- I felt fresh for the entire day, morning to night.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try Secret Outlast gel via BzzAgent and, overall, am pretty pleased with it. It has a pleasant but not overpowering scent, I&#x27;ve had no break-through sweat or odor (and in central Texas, that&#x27;s saying something), and the product doesn&#x27;t mark my clothing. My only issue is the gel doesn&#x27;t always dispense evenly. Sometimes, I click it once and almost no product comes out. Other times, one click is perfect. It&#x27;s a small criticism and I don&#x27;t know how they could resolve it, but it bothers me enough to knock this down to four stars from five. If that&#x27;s not the sort of thing that bothers you, you&#x27;ll probably be very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product free from bzzagent.  It did go on clear and the scent wasn&#x27;t very strong.  I am a nurse and move a lot while at work.  My underarms stayed dry for my shift.  Only thing i didn&#x27;t like was how the deodorant feels wet for a bit til it dries upon first application.</li>
            <li> Love that it dries fast but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last all day for me.</li>
            <li> I was excited about trying the new Secret Clear Gel Outlast 48 hour odor protection deodorant.I wanted to give it a try and see if it could measure up to other clear gels out there.First off,this deodorant has a pleasant clean scent with a very tiny hint of coconut.I enjoyed the scent and when I put it on, the scent lasted like a perfume.When I applied the deodorant it went on wet feeling because of being a gel but dried very quickly.I put this deodorant to the test by going for a run.After I was finished running I didn&#x27;t notice any stinkiness under my arms,the deodorant had done it&#x27;s job! No need to reapply.Compared to other clear gels out there Secret has got them beat.Other clear gels just don&#x27;t hold up as long and you always need to reapply,with Secret you never have to do that.Plus I love that this deodorant never leaves white streaks on my clothes! I highly recommend this product! #ClearlyBetter&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for purpose of review,all claims and views are 100 percent my own.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Gel works great! I was able to received the product free from clearlybetterchallenge.com and I love it. It keeps me feeling fresh and dry. I think Secret makes great products and this is another great one! I would recommend this because it is fresh and really works at keeping me dry.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a deodorant / anti-perspirant snob, so i appreciated that this product went on clear, so i didn&#x27;t have to worry about white marks on my clothing. the scent was good, just wish the price point was lower. disclosure:  i received the product free from clearlybetterchallenge.com  as a member of one2one network.</li>
            <li> Thanks to One2OneNetwork, I received a free sample of the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear  Gel for my honest review. Once I brought it out of the package and without opening the deodorant itself, I smelled the fresh fragrance; though not overbearing but just right!!  The next morning after my shower, I applied the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear  Gel and I was completely blown away by the fresh scent, though like I previously said, it&#x27;s not overbearing for those who don&#x27;t like fragrance!!  What surprised me more is that later that evening I went for my Zumba class and as I was changing from my work clothes, I can still smell the freshness of Secret Outlast that&#x27;s after about 10 hours of application.  In my opinion: Pros - Smells amazing for over 8 hours.  Gel dries quickly. Gel doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling after application and sweating. It glides on smoothly and the applicator is perfectly sized and brings out the appropriate amount of product, not too much. Compared to other gel deodorants, I will recommend Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear  Gel over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none that I can think of.</li>
            <li> Disclosure:  As a member of one2one network, I received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a long time user of secret and this product is another fabulous deodorant to add to their product list.  I received the outlast active fresh deodorant and I was immediately impressed by the amount of product in the container.  When I opened the container, I loved the fresh scent.  Since I am allergic to most perfumes, oftentimes, my deodorant is the only scent I&#x27;m able to wear.  I love how fresh this deodorant smells.  It&#x27;s also long lasting.  It lasts all day while i&#x27;m running around the office and keeps protecting into the night.  Lastly, I appreciate how it goes on clear, stays clear and doesn&#x27;t take long to dry.  No streaks on me or my clothes!</li>
            <li> There are three things I need from an antiperspirant and deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first is for it to work for an entire day regardless of how active I am or what the weather is like. Trying this in the spring is perfect because my activity level changes from day to day and so does the weather. This worked as well as the Suave solid I was using previously but I can&#x27;t say that it worked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing I need is for the product to not bother my sensitive skin. This is why I normally steer clear of personal products with scents or dyes in them. This gel went on very wet and felt cool on my underarms for hours. I didn&#x27;t get a rash nor did I get any itchy so that&#x27;s a good thing in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final thing I look for in these types of products is no scent or very little scent, at the very least I don&#x27;t want a product that will attractive insects, I get enough bug bites as it is. I didn&#x27;t like this scent which was a bit too sweet for me but also had a strong alcohol component to it (alcohol is the second ingredient on the label after water). However I didn&#x27;t notice any increased bug bites nor was the scent noticeable to me but I noticed it for hours after I applied it. I wouldn&#x27;t get this product again unless it was completely scent free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clear gels tend to leave less residue on your garments and this one lived up to that trend but not any better or worse than other clear gels I&#x27;ve used in the past. I just call that a bonus for this sort of product any way since I know how to launder my clothes well enough that it isn&#x27;t normally a problem either way. The only other comment I want to make is that my stick of this wasn&#x27;t evenly packed. It took around a dozen clicks to get it started and I&#x27;ve attached a photo to show how unevenly it came out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product from Secret as part of their #ClearlyBetter campaign but I agreed to do an honest review.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I am so thankful for the sample that I received from BzzAgent.  I have always been reluctant to try new deodorants and was pleasantly surprised by this one.  The applicator was smooth and application was effortless.  The gel was nice, went on easily, felt cool and dried pretty quick which was awesome because I am not a fan of wet marks furthermore residue on my clothes.  I loved the scent and found it smelled very feminine.  Unlike a lot of people. I like heavy scents, this one was not overly strong, but was just enough that I knew it was there.  Most importantly, Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel kept me dry all day long.  I have a new favorite brand.  WooHoo for Secret!!!</li>
            <li> Great scents available,  good protection.  I just don&#x27;t like the initial wet feel from applying a wet gel.  It does dry pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent from BzzAgent for my review - my opinions are mine and honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using gel deodorants a few years ago because I was still getting wet/white marks on my clothes and generally just didn&#x27;t feel protected.  Those days are gone.  This new Secret Outlast really does outlast the others!  The claim is 48 hours, and on a recent camping trip, I was able to test that out.  I&#x27;d say, closer to 30-36ish, but to be fair, I was hiking, running, jumping and generally playing (although no lake or anything like that!).  This goes on clear, but you do need to let it dry for a few moments before putting on your clothes.  Not a big deal though, I just apply it when I get out of the shower and allow it to dry while I apply my makeup.  The Completely Clean smell is fresh, strong enough to enjoy, but not overwhelming and generally a great scent!</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast as part of a promotion from the brand but I was not paid for this review and all opinions are completely my own. This is, hands down, one of the best deodorants I have used. Generally gel deodorants leave my armpits feeling &amp;#34;wet and sticky&amp;#34;, not this! It dries fast! The smell is also very clean and not overpowering in the least! I was able to go a  full day without reapplying because my deodorant didn&#x27;t feel like it was doing the trick. Also, with this, there wasn&#x27;t a worry about having any white residue on my clothing.</li>
            <li> I got this for free from BzzAgent and was skeptical. I have used the same solid deodorant for a long time. I have been pleasantly surprised. This is so quick drying and doesn&#x27;t leave underarm residue from my clothing like other gels. It&#x27;s amazing. Also, unlike a solid, I know how much product is actually going on my arm pits. The most important part is the scent though. I&#x27;m a larger woman and I sweat a lot. I do not like BO. Who does, right? I have noticed dryer and way better smelling arm pits with this. It is really awesome. I will be purchasing this with my own money from here on out. I&#x27;m glad I got it for free to try out, because I would have stuck with the same old deodorant I&#x27;ve been using forever that has only been working on a mediocre level.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after receiving it for free.  The fragrance is crisp and clean without being overpowering.  The gel is quick and easy to apply, worked effectively for at least 24 hours (I didn&#x27;t test it beyond that length of time), and was absolutely invisible (as opposed to the chalkier, grainy appearance of the &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; solid I usually use).  The gel left no marks, even on the little black dress I wore to a formal event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product four stars, however, because I really don&#x27;t enjoy the sticky, wet feeling immediately after applying it.  For everyday, I still prefer a solid deodorant because it feels dry and clean to apply.  I will continue to buy this product for use when wearing dark, dressy clothes, as well as sleeveless clothing, because I find that the appearance (or lack thereof) of this product is worth the icky feeling until it dries.</li>
            <li> I have been giving Secret Outlast a try for about a month after I ran out of my solid deodorant. I found the deodorant to be a very good antiperspirant. Here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Clear so there are no white marks&lt;br /&gt;-No oozy, messy application&lt;br /&gt;-Odor protection through all types of activities&lt;br /&gt;-No embarrassing sweat marks&lt;br /&gt;-quick drying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-I do not like the feeling of gel when it is first applied and even though it doesn&#x27;t leave marks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it held up very well and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wearing a lot of black prompted me to seek out this product. I must admit, I was hopeful but nothing prepared me for how amazing this antiperspirant really worked. No white streaks on my black tops, lasted all day as someone with frequent hot flashes that is as important as the completely clean part! Loved the scent as well, fresh and clean. Practically perfect in every way!</li>
            <li> I have been using Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel for a few weeks now (Thanks to BzzAgent) and I am impressed.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my shirt and blouses.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting white marks out of my shirt before work in the mornings.  I feel confident it will keep me dry and odor free for the entire day. My little tip though, don&#x27;t apply right after shaving your underarms, it does sting a bit if you nicked yourself a little. !</li>
            <li> When I received the free sample of Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel (THANK YOU, BZZAGENT!!!), I was really excited.  While I knew the Secret Brand, I was looking forward to trying a new scent, Completely Clean, since I&#x27;ve usually used Powder Fresh.  I was also excited to try the clear gel, as I usually use the invisible solid.  When I opened the cover to the Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel, I was pleasant surprised by the fresh scent of the gel.  It kinda smelled like you just got out of the shower...who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like that?!!  I sure do!!  To be honest, I was a bit speculative about the clear gel.  The gel was cold when I applied it, and I was not used to the feeling of gel at first.  However, within a matter of moments, the gel had dried and it was like I hadn&#x27;t applied anything at all to my underarm, which is exactly what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a 20 -minute jog around the neighborhood, I still smelled nice - the deodorant was still working!  The only thing I didn&#x27;t really like was when I first began to perspire, my underarms felt a bit sticky, which i think is typical of gels.  However, the sticky feeling went away in a few minutes and was not noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final verdict?  Two thumbs up!!  I really liked the &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; scent, which was a refreshing change from my usual power fresh sent.  I alway really liked knowing that there were no white lines on my clothing, or clumped in my armpits after exercising, which can happen with an invisible solid.  It withstood the exercise test in regards to scent and heavy perspiration.  I would definitely use Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel again!  Great product that you can count, day and night!</li>
            <li> I was definitely surprised by Secret&#x27;s Outlast Completely Clear deordorant.  I had tried Secret in the past but wasn&#x27;t completely sold.  This product though has me completely hooked.  Its lightweight, dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my clothes.  I love the scent and the fact that it last through out the day.  I&#x27;m free from odor and wetness and white marks on my clothes...thats all I ever wanted in a deordorant!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have always had a hard time finding an antiperspirant/deodorant that works. If they work, they don&#x27;t last very long. That all changed when Secret Outlast came along. I can go 24 hours in the Texas heat and still smell good when I use Secret Outlast. It dries fast and keeps me dry as well. I received Secret Outlast as part of a brand promotion, but I have been a loyal Secret user for years.</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast Completely Clean deodorant as a promotion from the company to try how well it performs,well I wasn&#x27;t let down with its great protection.Secret Outlast really is an excellent product..It kept me odor free all day and dry all day...The clear gel is also a plus,not having any white marks on my shirts...overall I must say this is a great product if you are looking for a deodorant that keeps you dry and smelling fresh all day ...</li>
            <li> I like the way the product goes on and that it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes, but it takes a while to dry and then gets a bit sticky causing any loosening lint from clothing to stick to the area. I wear a lot of darker colored tanks and  noticed the lint sticking to the area in excess. Which I did not like at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time to &amp;#34;sweat over stuff&amp;#34;. Loving Secret outlast no more awful white residue, has great smell and lasts forever!!!</li>
            <li> I really liked this antiperspirant. It goes on somewhat wet since it&#x27;s a gel but it dries fast. I did however notice that it comes out fast so be careful I really dislike being wasteful. The antiperspirant really works to keep me smelling good. I liked the scent a lot. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from the clearlybetterchallenge site.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of secret outlast completely clean gel deodorant from bzzagent! The scent smells great and lasts so long that my tops smell pleasant the next day! The gel form dries quickly, which was my main concern. Great product!</li>
            <li> I loved Secret Outlast Clear Gel&#x27;s scent.  One of my favorite smells is lavender.  I was very happy to have been sent Secret Outlast lavender deodorant.  The smell isn&#x27;t too strong.  I can smell it as I&#x27;m putting it on and that it.  I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t get whiffs of it during the day, because I find that kinda gross.  I would love to find out if there are any other scents because i would love to try those as well!  I will definitely buy Secret Outlast Clear Gel deodorant again!</li>
            <li> Great product, and long lasting</li>
            <li> i revived this for free from Bzz agent, it smells great im not sure it lasts 24 hours but it worked great when i was in the gym :)</li>
            <li> I love it, does everything it says and more.  Excellent price compare to stores.  I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make the same mistake as I did and order this quickly without reading the entire product description!  I thought I was ordering the invisible solid as shown, but my mistake... the gel is AWFUL!  Guess I learned my lesson on this one!</li>
            <li> As a new mom, i have a pretty consistent morning time &amp;#34;new mommy&amp;#34; stink. I received a sample of this product via bzz agent and have been using it all week. It defenitely works! After a run, going to the pool, and out to dinner, I was still feeling and smelling fresh. I even smell good the next morning! Lives up to its name</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast gel is a great concept, but I think there are some improvements that could be made and it would be the perfect antiperspirant. First off, there&#x27;s the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a chance to try this before I was pregnant, and right now that I am pregnant, so I know it&#x27;s not just my sensitive pregnancy nose. It&#x27;s not completely offensive by any means, but I hate nothing more than sitting at work and catching a whiff of my antiperspirant. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;d rather have my pits smell pretty than offensive. Either ease up on the scent, or start an unscented version!&lt;br /&gt;The gel is a great idea, but if it dried faster, it&#x27;d be even better. I experimented with it, and it takes the same amount of time to dry, whether or not your pits are smooth shaven or looking like &#x27;Squatch! I like to put my antiperspirant on before my clothes, to avoid marks, and I have to wait quite a while to get dressed to avoid Secret from rubbing off on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the performance. It is amazing, I cannot lie. I smell fresh by the next day, and this is supposed to be a 48 hour antiperspirant. It definitely does the job and does it well for keeping a person dry, especially in the summer when it&#x27;s hot out and I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant. In fact, I sweat everywhere but the pits when I wear this! Great stuff. Thankful I could try it courtesy of BzzAgent as well instead of buying it a second time.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product and was blown away by the performance! I don&#x27;t usually use gel deodorant, but I applied this in the morning and it dried quickly and smelled great! I mowed the yard and ran errands all day in 97 degree weather and stayed dry the entire time! This even lasted through my morning work out the next day! I will definitely purchase the full product and recommend to friends!</li>
            <li> The gel formula takes a little getting used to if you normally use a solid, but it&#x27;s clear and leaves no white marks. I love the Completely Clean scent and it really lasts!&lt;br /&gt;I got it free to test and review thanks to Secret and BzzAgent! #gotitfree</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant. It works very well. I have never really tried a gel before, I have always used solids. However I was looking for a new form of deodorant because I am not quite satisfied with my current one. So I decided to give this a try. Secret’s Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant is a unique product in my opinion. It goes on very smoothly, has a great scent and keeps me dry all day! I truly love this product and will continue to use it. **I received a free sample of this product to try in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions expressed are my own.**</li>
            <li> I was so anxious to receive this free sample from (Bzz Agent)!! I absolutely love the product, it really doesn&#x27;t leave any white streaks and that is probably the main reason why I love it so much! I absolutely love deodorant that doesn&#x27;t leave streaks and if your looking for that try this Secret Outlast because you won&#x27;t get streaks!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this deodorant at first thinking it was pretty much like every Secret product.  I received this as part of a Bzzagent promotion so I gave it a go.  I religiously use Secret so I figured I&#x27;d try this because I am known to wear black clothing a few, OK, several, times a week.  Deodorant marks -- Those tell tale lines that are usually sitting at the bottom of your black shirt and even though you try to wipe them off, you never get it all off until you wash it. I see deodorant stains even on clothing that people try on at department stores.  It happens to me, it happens to lots of people. Anyway, I gave this a go and it works wonders for that.  I didn&#x27;t have to hold my shirt out and away from my body fearing the deodorant marks.  None and I am pretty sure I touched my under arm to the black t-shirt I was wearing that day.  It dried very quickly.  Having said all of that, I want to talk about what really sells me - 48 hour protection.  I get up every day at 5 am and race to get myself ready so that I can be ready when my kids get up for school.  It&#x27;s early and I am often working on autopilot.  One thing I have a bad habit of forgetting to do is put on my deodorant.  So much so that I keep one at work. I started to use this and I realized that I was skipping a day and not even thinking about it because it worked and it worked well.  I am an average in the sweating department so I cannot attest to how well it would work the second day for people that sweat a lot but it did the job, even on day two.  I like Secret Outlast and plan to replace my regular Secret with this version</li>
            <li> I got a Secret Outlast gel deodorant as part of a promotion, so I got to try it and see what I thought about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant smells pretty darn good! And it also prevents you from smelling like b.o. mixed with perfume. It seems to mask b.o. well and have a fresh scent.  The best and worst thing about this deodorant is that it is a gel. It is awesome because this deodorant doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks on your clothes like a solid will. The bad part, you gotta let it dry for a few minutes before getting dressed or it will be on your clothes not your pits. Of course, for most people this isn&#x27;t a big deal, but I am super impatient, so it gets frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t necessarily completely prevent sweating, but it certainly helps and prevents you from stinking if you do sweat. Would definitely recommend to anyone with the patience to wait for it to dry. I am hoping they have this same Completely Clean scent in a solid!!</li>
            <li> Great sweat and odor protection! I hate to admit it, but yes, it does last 48 hours! I love the clean scent, it is not too strong or purfumey.</li>
            <li> nice and clean thanks</li>
            <li> A good antiperspirant, and as advertised - lasts 48 hours. Double pack makes it a good price point. Using for about 6 months and pleased with the product. Doesn&#x27;t stain clothing, clear gel goes on easily and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Have used Secret for years. Have tried others, but will always go back to Secret, it&#x27;s simply the best. Great scent, lasts all day/night. I sometimes forget that it doesn&#x27;t leave marks on clothes, and will get worried and check, but it never does.</li>
            <li> Get effective protection without feeling sticky or wet. No white residue and leaves you feeling fresh and confident whole day long. No skin irritations either. Love it.</li>
            <li> The deodorant pictured appears to be the regular Secret Outlast (not the gel deodorant as described). Just be aware that if you&#x27;re looking solely at the picture or solely at the words, make sure that you read the reviews and see that you&#x27;re getting what you really wanted... Otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with something you don&#x27;t want like I did. Also, super slow at shipping so don&#x27;t expect this to show up on two day Amazon prime shipping if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast® Clear Gel completely free in a Bzzagent kit. I musst say I was pleasantly surprised.I really does go on clear and is super long lasting. I am a busy mom on the go and keep extra deodorant in my car because on hot busy days I have to reapply at least once. I have found that this product smells fresh and clean and is super long lasting. Also I have sensitive skin and sometimes deodorant burns upon application, especially just after I have shaved. This deodorant hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all! I can go on and on but the simple fact is I love this product and DEF recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great deal! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> so ive tried this deodorant years ago and it worked great for like 3 months and then just quit working, im trying it again to see how it does...again. Bzzagent sent a free sample to me to try so far it has a great smell and no white marks, not so great for the all day smell blocker and i have to reuse it like a couple times a day. not so great so far. #LifeHack #MomHack</li>
            <li> I tried other deodorants, and I wasn&#x27;t happy!  I tried this and absolutely LOVE this deodorant!  I stayed dried all day and plus, the scent wasn&#x27;t overwhelming!  I would definitely recommend this product to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> I love secret.  it is great to keep you dry and a great price... as a mom of 4 kids I don&#x27;t always have a lot of money to spend on me.</li>
            <li> Amazing deodorant. Got a free sample from Secret to try out. Normally hate gel deodorant, but since it was free thought I would give it a try. The gel dried super fast, and the deodorant works better than any I have ever tried. Kept me dry, even during exercise. The deodorant has a nice scent to it, and kept me odor free. Would for sure purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to test out this deodorant from bzzagent.com free of charge and I will definitely be buying it from now on. Smells great ALL DAY almost like perfume and I did not sweat through it at all. I liked that it dried on contact so I didn&#x27;t have to wait and wait.</li>
            <li> I received a sample size of this product for testing and was blown away! I usually hate clear gels but this one actually works! It doesn&#x27;t leave any marks which is great when i&#x27;m changing from work to gym, but it still keeps me feeling dry and smelling great even after an intense workout! I have found my new favorite deodorant! I hope they can make it in a few more scents though!</li>
            <li> this is very easy to put on and it lasts all freaking day i work out in the garden moving hay filling in pot holes in the driveway and i didnt smell one time im talking about texas heat and not stink</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find this product works great, even in the heat of Afghanistan. Will change from my regular brand.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have been using Degree men&#x27;s deodorant for a while now because it seems to work better for me. However, this is my new go to deodorant. No white stains on my shirt, long lasting protection, and it smells great!</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant. It doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on clothes, and doesn&#x27;t have that chalky weird texture that many deodorants have. It smells pleasant, and stays on me all day.</li>
            <li> This Secret Outlast deodorant has become my new favorite. I received a free sample from Secret through BzzAgent and absolutely love it. Works under stressful situations and hard work in high heat. I am &amp;#34;outlastingly impressed&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Great Product; Great Service</li>
            <li> This antiperspirant/deodorant is fantastic ! The clear gel leaves no white marks on my clothing. It is easy to dispense and easy to apply and dries instantly. It kept me dry all day during all sorts of activities. And the scent is awesome and long lasting but not overpowering. I will definitely be buying this - it is now my favorite antiperspirant/deodorant and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be a TWIN PACK - as in TWO. I only got ONE! &amp;#34;Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant 2.7 oz Twin Pack&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was cheated!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant in a BuzzAgent kit.  I was skeptical at first because i have not been a fan of Secret due to the strong fragrance.  When I opened it i was surprised it had a mellow fragrance that smelled good.  The deodorant worked very well and dried quickly.  I think it would work for 48 hours if you did not exert yourself.  I reapplied every day.  Most days it worked really well, if i was working outside doing manual labor it did not last through the day.  It was my first experience with gel deodorant and thought it worked really well, the only concern i would have is how long the stick will last compared to a solid stick.  I had to put on like 3 clicks per arm every day.  Over all i like it and would buy it in the future.</li>
            <li> I really like Secret products, but I don&#x27;t care for the gel. For not being a fan of the gel it does work well!</li>
            <li> After receiving a free sample of this from Secret, I can say this deodorant works way better than most. I typically buy the Secret clinical strength but tried this after not really liking the consistency of the clinical strength, it&#x27;s too powdery. Being 5 months pregnant in the middle of a hot humid summer is difficult but this stuff really keeps me dry. The completely clean scent is wonderful too.</li>
            <li> I think that Secret Outlast is an awesome deodorant! I was given a little trial size sample for free to try out. I really love that it feels cool when it goes on and the gel is so easy to apply. I love the way it feels and the scent is great and refreshing. The best part about Secret Outlast is that I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting white marks on my clothes like solid kinds of deodorant will give you. I feel better knowing that Secret Outlast deodorant will keep me smelling at my best on all the hot summer walks that me and my boyfriend do daily with our hyper dog. I don&#x27;t have to worry about any underarm sweat stains underneath my shirt either. I love that Secret Outlast has 48 hour odor and wetness protection! I can tell it lives up to it&#x27;s promises and it still smells great after a long active day. When this runs out shortly I will buy some more as soon as I can! I&#x27;m happy that I have gotten another sample from them as well because you can not have too much of this Secret Outlast! I love it. This is worth the buy and switch to this brand and gets a solid 5 stars from me! The Secret gel is much better then the solid white in my opinion! :]</li>
            <li> I already love using Secret and the new Secret Outlast is my new favorite. It keeps me dry all day long and at the end of the day I&#x27;m also odor free! That&#x27;s even when I&#x27;m going for my daily walk! It doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes and dries clear.&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2OneNetwork, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s New Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com</li>
            <li> I did not get the clear gel.  I was given a stick deodorant when my order clearly says clear gel.</li>
            <li> Great product! smells great and lasts all day and then some, I was surprised a gel deodorant worked so well. This will be my deodorant brand for now on!</li>
            <li> I received the Secret Outlast Deodorant to test and review for the clearly better challenge. I really liked this deodorant it kept me dry and dried quickly after I applied it.</li>
            <li> I received a sample size of this deodorant from Secret for review purposes and I am so thankful that I did! This is such an awesome summer deodorant if you are like me and like to wear a lot of maxi dresses. Most of mine are sleeveless and I hate having white armpits. The clear gel goes on clear and stay on clear and it lasts for a long time. I have tried other Secret deodorants and wasn&#x27;t too pleased with them so I am glad I have finally found one that works. Secret is usually very reasonable in price but I was never able to get what I wanted from them until now!</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean to try complimentary of BzzAgent and Secret but all opinions expressed are my own.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love the scent of &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; it is feminine but not overbearing and very refreshing.  I dont like how the clear gel goes on wet feeling but it dries pretty quickly - you still have to stand there for a minute or two &amp;#34;fanning&amp;#34; yourself before it dries but I guess that is okay because you dont have to worry about those embarrassing deodorant stains that the white solid gives you.  It has been a very hot summer so Im not entirely confident in saying that it gives you 48 hours worth of protection but it definitely left me feeling fresh for a good day.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Works good.  Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a great deodorant/antiperspirant. My wife has been using it for some time now and loves it. It works great and smells great. It&#x27;s a clear gel so no white residue on your clothes.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  No odor, no sweat rings.  And the important feature for me, is the no white marks on your shirts.  (No matter how I folded the shirt before putting it on, I would still end up with deodorant on my shirt.)  I use the clinical strength in the summer, but I found with this product, it was not required.</li>
            <li> Want a deodorant that will leave you clean and fresh for a full 48 hours? This deodorant steps up to the task of keeping you sweat free even during the hottest months.&lt;br /&gt;Pros- This deodorant goes on smooth and dries quickly. It smells like you just took a shower! This deodorant lives up to the hype of lasting a full 48 hours. This deodorant is easy to use. It smells as good on day 2 as when you first put it on. It keeps your pits dry!! It won&#x27;t stain your clothing or leave unsightly blotches like many gels out there. It won&#x27;t let you down.&lt;br /&gt;Cons- You have to apply as directed. Be careful about using right after shaving or it may sting.&lt;br /&gt;I am a busy mom of five and Secret has become my #1 defense against smelly and sweaty pits. I was given this to try thanks to BzzAgent and I was amazed at how fresh I was after two hectic days of running kids to activities and working out.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a secret you won&#x27;t want to miss: Try Secret Outlast Completely Clean to kick pit odor to the curb!</li>
            <li> I have received a sample of this deodorant for free from #BzzAgent to sample and review! I have tried this product for the first time today! I am two hours in and thus far I am very pleased! As a stay at home mom, the first few hours of the day are the most crucial for me when it comes to deodorant! I am always on the move! From the time I was in high school I have suffered with strong perspiration in the armpit area! I have tried clinical strength deodorants (which can be expensive). It is very important to me to have dry pits, ALL DAY LONG! If this deodorant continues to hold up it&#x27;s end (it has thus far) I will certainly be making the switch!</li>
            <li> I got a free sample from BuzzAgent to try out this deodorant.  I was curious to try it since I&#x27;ve been a loyal user of Secret deodorant for years and have always had great experiences with their products, but hadn&#x27;t tried this particular product.  The premise behind the Outlast deodorant is that you get 48 hours of protection.  I will be honest and say that unless I forget, I can&#x27;t imagine not applying deodorant every morning so my experiences are based on how long it lasts in a 24 hour period.  That said, I&#x27;ve been impressed.  I try to live an active lifestyle, walking to work, taking bar classes, and using the stairs at work whenever possible.  Because of that my day can get a little sweaty, but I thought this deodorant was a perfect defense against odor and wetness.  I felt pretty dry all day long and didn&#x27;t notice any odor to speak of.  I also haven&#x27;t noticed any problems with underarm staining in either my workout or regular clothes.  Nor have I had any problem with skin irritation, which is a plus for me since I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t always have a good reaction to all products.  I also thought the scent was nice, neutral and not overpowering.  If you prefer a more fun, specialty scent this will probably be boring to you, but I found it perfectly acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really liked this deodorant.  It lived up to the great experiences I&#x27;ve always had with secret and kept me fresh even while being active.</li>
            <li> I tried this product actually during a BzzCampaign and received a free product from Secret to try. I used to use the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Invisible Solid but I tried the gel. I love it! If you have ever been like me and have little deodorant balls under your arms after a day of use, the gel completely gets rid of it! Didn&#x27;t have that problem at all! And if you just shave it doesn&#x27;t burn either. If someone is senstivity to strong smells, I might suggest not to get because the scent is strong but if not affected by sensitivity isn&#x27;t overpowering. Last all day. Love it!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product from the brand. It was a little sample stick but it already looked like it was almost empty. When i tore back the seal, I got an overpowering whiff of the &amp;#34;completely clean scent&amp;#34;. It is a strong smell, it overpowers my perfume and makes it hard not to get nauseated. As far as protection goes, it&#x27;s about a 3.5. I don&#x27;t feel swampy after a workout. It also goes on clear and leaves no marks on dark clothes.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Secret outlast from Bzzgent. when I was a teenager I was a faithful Secret deodorant user. I stopped using it as an adult. Since trying  my free sample I remember why I quit using it. Despite the Secret Outlast label, it did not outlast for me. I live in Miami and work outside, so I personally need a Deodorant that actually lasts. I typically work an 8hr day. about 3hrs into my shift my armpits were more sweaty than normal and there was a bit of an odor. my armpits were very dry and uncomfortable. worse then if I would have not worn any deodorant at all. I am not a fan of the gel, and I associate the issues I had with Secret outlast to the Gel. Although, the label was enticing I will was dissatisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I received a trial sample of this as part of a promotion from the Secret Brand. The smell of this one is a bit strong which is my only reason for the 4 star review. When I purchase it, I will likely purchase unscented. Other than that, great product. It was my first time using a Gel as I usually purchase a solid or cream. I actually stay drier with this one than I do with my clinical strength deodorant, so I will likely purchase this when I use my small stockpile of clinical strength deodorants. GREAT product, but scent doesn&#x27;t need to be as strong.</li>
            <li> I was given this Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel for free by Scecret. I was unsure about it as it claims to 48 hour protection. It is suppose to  leave no white marks, and keep you fresh for an extended period of time. I was surprised to find out that this deodorant is everything it claims to be and much much more. I was outside all day in the heat playing with my kids, I had on a colored shirt. When I went inside my house and looked down and had no sweat marks at all under my arms, I still smelled fresh and no white marks on my shirt either. I know I will be a loyal customer. I love the smell. Its not to strong and over powering.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Arrived quick and a great value</li>
            <li> As a member of one2one network, i received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. i&#x27;m not a huge fan of gel antiperspirants, but this one dried quickly and didn&#x27;t leave residue under my arms. it smelled great and stayed smelling fresh all day long (yes, i just did a smell check 14 hours later - just now :) ). the only thing that kept me from giving it a perfect score is that i was a bit wet yesterday under my arms - but it was a much warmer day and i was overly layered. today - no issues!</li>
            <li> ITEM IS AS DESCRIBED ON LINE AND IS WORTH THE MONEY. IT IS FANTASTIC! lOVE THE &amp;#34;GEL&amp;#34; DEORDANT&#x27;S. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent and was given the opportunity to try the Secret Outlast for free.  I am very picky about my deodorant.  I my say I am pleased with this product.  There are  no white marks on my cloths.  I did stay dry while I was using it as well.  Now mind you it is fall/winter and I cannot vouch for what it will do in the heat of the summer.  As for odor protection it did a good job.  I cannot say it “lasted 48-hours” though.  But it did hold up for a good days work.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall I am pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I use Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel as soon as I step out of the shower for 48-hour odor protection with no white marks. It tingles a bit if I have just shaved, but it dries within seconds. It really is clear drying, it really lasts 48 hours or more. I received a sample of this from BzzAgent, but I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel Deodorant! It goes on clear. Its not sticky are gooey like other gel deodorants I have tried In the past. It dries fast and It don&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothes.I got this free from BzzAgent definitely will be stocking up on this deodorant!</li>
            <li> I was so very excited to receive free sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent. Thanks to Bzzagent.  I normally use solid or spray antiperspirant/deodorant so applying the gel first took a little getting used to but surprisingly I no longer even notice that. I love it! First time it feels little bit cold but not sticky at all.  I was suffering from armpit sweat but after using secret Outlast It&#x27;s gone.  I put this on right out of the shower and when I put on my shirt. What I like is it leaves NO white marks. That&#x27;s Amazing!!</li>
            <li> Recieved this to sample.  Works great. Dries very quickly.  No white marks. Smells great/clean, but not overwhelming so it won&#x27;t overpower your perfume.  Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel goes on clear and keeps me free from white marks on my shirts.  It keeps me smelling pleasant all day, but unfortunately does not keep me dry in the sweltering FL heat.  I received a free sample of this product from Secret and BzzAgent.  All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Secret is my favorite</li>
            <li> I received this deodorant sample as a BZZAGENT. I was excited to try something new and better! Who doesn&#x27;t keep searching for a better working deodorant. The &amp;#34;completely clean&amp;#34; scent is fresh-out-of-the-shower great! The outlasting power of Secret outlast completely clean clear gel definitely outlasts all others! The one drawback for me is I usually use a clear powder stick so the sticky gel feeling after putting it  on took some getting used to! Overall I love the no mess, great smelling, long lasting new Secret!</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent and Secret I #GotItFree!  I usually am an invisible solid gal...yes white streaks on my shirts and everything!  At least people knew I tried to put deodorant under my arms...right?  Well until Secret outlast completely clean clear gel deodorant came into my life!  Now I can wear deodorant and only have it under my arms where it should be worn.  The scent is light and feminine yet subtle enough not to give you a headache.  The random whiffs of the deodorant are a friendly reminder that you are still fresh and clean.  Which lasts ALL day long!  Great deodorant!</li>
            <li> I have been using Secret for years. I received a free sample of this product (thanks to Secret) and immediately switched from my old deodorant to this one. It goes on completely clean, as the name suggests, and smells great. I don&#x27;t have to worry about marks on my clothes and can get dressed right away. It holds up on those very hot days, too. With my previous deodorant, I would sometimes need to reapply mid-day. Not the case with this one. The name does say it lasts for 48 hours, but I reapply every 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I struggled for a long time trying to get just the right deo. Once i found it, I decided to order online so my husband didn&#x27;t have to search the shelves and come home with something that was not really what I wanted. He does all the shopping for us since I have MS and have to pace myself regarding getting out and about. I appreciate the subscribe and save experience; even with limited mobility, I can shop!</li>
            <li> I had never been a fan of gel deodorant, because every time I tried them they would irritate my skin. Texas it is very hot and humid so a deodorant is always a must! The thing I love about this one is the smell stays on all day!! It&#x27;s not overwhelming to where it will take over your perfume, it&#x27;s just pleasant and clean. Another thing I love, is that unlike the solid this one does not stain black clothes which I wear a lot of black to work. With the solid I always had to be careful not to get in on my shirt. The clear gel does not stain at all!! The only thing i don&#x27;t like about this deodorant is when you barely put it on, it feels wet however, it does dry up. Which is better than having your solid clump up! Lol With this deodorant a little goes a long way! I was given a sample size to try from Secret and I used it for over 3 weeks! I loved it so much that I actually went and bought my own full size!</li>
            <li> Great product, no more white marks!works same as it says it will. Recommend for sure. #gotitfree</li>
            <li> I got this from Bzzagent and I am very impressed.  I have a hard time finding deodorant and this worked awesome on me.  Now lets hope that is keeps working.  I normally have to change deodorants ever few months.  I will update then :)</li>
            <li> #GotItFree #BzzAgent Love this product.  Great for the LBD #NoWhiteResidue, the beac, the gym or on the go. Clean and fresh scent will Outlast You!</li>
            <li> I have never really liked clear gel deodorant but was surprised the Secret outlast was better then most. The smell was good and didn&#x27;t make my pits sticky but didn&#x27;t last as long as the invisible solid does.</li>
            <li> I received a free coupon to try this product.  I love the clear coverage this offers, but it doesn&#x27;t make up for the burn when applying after shaving.  I am also not a fan of the wetness you feel for 10-15 minutes after applying.  It did keep my dry throughout the day and kept me fresh smelling, but I don&#x27;t think that I will be switching to gel anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased a gel deodorant or changed my brand of deodorant in years but after receiving this product I have a new favorite! I was using an invisible solid but it left white marks that didn&#x27;t aways come out in the wash. The secret clear gel goes on smooth and dries very fast. I Remember 10+ years ago wearing gel and feeling like it was so wet under my arms and it doesn&#x27;t feel that way at all. The smell is also great. It isn&#x27;t over powering but without wearing and perfume or body spray it gives a nice sent.</li>
            <li> I used to use Secret products.  Being a Bzz Agent brought it back to me to consider.  I received a free sample and decided to really test it as the reason I stopped using product was because it seemed to lose its impact.  Sooo, I tested this with never worn t-shirts, that I wore during workouts.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that Secret Outlast held up - greatly reduced sweat, odor, staining.  I am perfectly pleased and will be purchasing this product from now on.</li>
            <li> I had high hope for Secret Outlast Clear Gel, and after receiving it in a FREE BzzKit, was anxious to give it a try. I am a high school biology teacher, and spend several hours each day on my feet in front of my students and in the lab. I typically use men&#x27;s clear solid for dryness and odor protection (I don&#x27;t love the scent, but it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that keeps me dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the way the clear gel went on. It was smooth, and the curve of the applicator is perfectly sized for my underarms (maybe I&#x27;m just too used to using the guys&#x27; one!). The gel dries incredibly fast--in fact, it was dry before I even had my outfit for the day assembled. Because it dries so quickly, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about clothing stains or streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the scent, and could smell it throughout the day as I became more active.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I have with the gel, is that it did not keep me dry. I had those cold, tacky underams and a wet shirt by the end of the day. Sadly, it looks like this gel just isn&#x27;t strong enough for me.</li>
            <li> I love it! I got this FREE from BZZAGENT.  I did not think it was going to work, I&#x27;ve been wearing different kinds and types of deodorant for over 30 years and this is the BEST so far.  I don&#x27;t have to use my Dysol anymore because this does the job.  I work all day and exercise in the evenings and I&#x27;m still hold strong.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Got it free through www.bzzagent.com to try. It goes on clear and really does last all day long. The best part is no more white lines on my black shirts! I&#x27;ve never seen a gel product that actually works all day, but this is it. The only negative is that it goes on wet so you have to wait a few seconds before you put on your shirt. Really though for me that is a small inconvenience for the benefits!</li>
            <li> Does not mark clothes. Pleasant smell. Long lasting even while working out. Not sticky. Will buy again!#gotitfree</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this deodorant from being a BzzAgent member. In the past, I never liked using a gel deodorant because it made me feel messy and wet, but I can now say that I have found a gel deodorant that I like. The scent is amazing, it doesn&#x27;t leave any white marks and dries really fast. It goes on clear and completely stays that way, no clumps, even after working out. This deodorant really stands up to the test, and is something that I will purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this!  I&#x27;ve had issues finding something that I&#x27;m not allergic to snd this is it!  And it works - dry, no odor issues.  I&#x27;ve found my new deoderant!  So glad I was chosen by Secret to try it out!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Secret&amp;#34; Brand is no secret when it comes to deodorant protection - they are the BEST!!!  Prior to starting this campaign, with my free sample as a Bzz Agent, I was using a regular white deodorant.  I am really digging this gel formula.  It is COMPLETELY clear, and dries relatively fast.  I was sent the &amp;#34;completely clean&amp;#34; scent, and it is nice. Very fresh smelling and not too overpowering.  I am not sure about it lasting 48 hours, b/c I don&#x27;t want to go that long without showering, but I feel good throughout the day.  Confident that I won&#x27;t have marks or wet spots - so it&#x27;s perfect in my book!  Thanks Secret and Bzz Agent!</li>
            <li> I usually apply an antiperspirant at night and then use regular deodorant in the morning, and this stuff fits the bill perfectly for a &amp;#34;regular deodorant.&amp;#34; It has a great fresh scent, goes on clear, and dries quickly with no white marks. It definitely saves off odor well, but doesn&#x27;t keep me as dry as I would like when I use it alone. So I&#x27;d definitely recommend it overall, but I&#x27;d suggest pairing it with an antiperspirant if you tend to sweat a lot :)</li>
            <li> This is a must add-on item to your Amazon order. I got this free to try from Bzzagent and was skeptical, since I previously was a devotee of clinical strength deodorants. This product was just as good with less clicks of the container. Not messy since clear, and really did last up to 48 hours! One hundred percent worth it!</li>
            <li> did not like it. Just like all deodorants it created a weird skin smell very shortly after. I have gone back to my unscented deodorant and am very happy now</li>
            <li> So I did get to try this product a out for free from bzzagent. I normally haven&#x27;t liked to many of Secrets deodorants, but this one really kept me dry and fresh smelling. I normally go to the gym on my lunch break and I have to admit I sometimes get interrupted during my workouts and need to come back up to the office right away and inhave to skip the shower. This has kept me smelling fresh. Great product, loves that it&#x27;s a clear gel and won&#x27;t leave white spots on my clothing</li>
            <li> I won a Bzz campaign,  so I got to try the Secret Outlast completely clean clear gel for free.  I work in a lab where it tends to get warm and I get warm and sweaty.  I had given up on Secret antiperspirant/deodorant products a few years ago when I was confronted by an old boss and told that I needed to change my deodorant because I smelled bad, and I have also tried another brand&#x27;s clear gel that did not dry quickly.  Since I won the Bzz Campaign,  I was getting the product for free, so I decided to give it a try.  I am well pleased with this Secret clear gel.  It goes on clear like it says,  I have not noticed any white marks; it dries very quickly,  I don&#x27;t have to wait for armpits to dry to finish dressing; I have had no sweating or odor issues while using this Secret,  and I have been warm enough I would have known.  It does smell very nice,  and application is smooth.  It is a little cold when you apply it, but it does dry quickly.  I think it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Tried the Secret Outlast Completely Clean through BzzAgent.  As far as whiteness protection- I have never used anything better!  It&#x27; truly didn&#x27;t leave any kind of mark at all.  I even got some on the front of my sweater and it came completely off, no mark!  It also had a nice clean scent that won&#x27;t overpower your perfume or other scents.  The only let down was that it does go on rather wet and takes a minute or so to dry.  I end up having to hold my arms out so that it dries.  If you aren&#x27;t bothered by a little wetness at first than this product will probably work great for you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an unscented, solid deodorant girl.  I tried a gel years ago and did not like it at all and I generally don&#x27;t like the smell of deodorant.  I hated the wet feeling and that it stuck around for a few minutes.  Thanks to BzzAgent, I gave gel another shot.  This clear gel is seriously awesome.  I apply after I&#x27;m dressed and this gel is dry by the time I pull my applying hand out from inside my shirt.  The gel lasts long and smells great.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Works better than roll-on, sprays or bars.  Dries pretty quickly.  When you shower, you do feel a coating that you must double soap-off.</li>
            <li> Before I begin I need to say that I was able to try a free sample of this product. I thnk this is definitely a must have item for the summer season. It does a great job at keeping me dry and confident during my long days at school and when I&#x27;m up all night running around at work. I&#x27;ve also used this before heading into the gym, and I can say that Secret Outlast has given me the best odor and wetness protection of all the brands I have tried before. It also does not leave those pesky white marks. The only thing that I must say that is potentially negative is scrubbing it off in the shower, as it does leave a film, but other than that, it does exactly what it promises!</li>
            <li> I got this as a free product to try from Bzzagent.  I&#x27;ve been a dedicated secret buyer until I tried the degree motion and i LOVED that.  I then tried the secret clinical and thought that was great.  So I had high expectations for this product.  It however did not quite meet my expectations.  First off it says 48 hours protection.  Well i always put deodrant on everyday so that doesn&#x27;t matter to me.  It&#x27;s also a gel, which i dont care for.  I prefer solids.  The smell is quite mascuiline where I prefer for a flowery feminine smell, otherwise it conflicts with my body spray.  The pros.. no white marks, no irritation.  the cons.  the smell its very strong, the protection itself (and i&#x27;m not a sweaty person), and the fact it&#x27;s a gell trying to get thru the small holes.  I have a tendency to get too much.  Which is then quite overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this was a decent product, in the 3 weeks i&#x27;ve used it i miss my degree, love the scent, i get no white marks and it lasts.</li>
            <li> It was so cool to get this from BzzAgent to try out and review. I am familiar with other Secret deodorants, but Secret Outlast is awesome! I really am amazed at how fast it dries without leaving clothing all marked up. The Completely Clean fragrance smells very clean as it suggests. I have tried other gel type deodorants in the past that left me feeling like I did not smell as fresh, this one can truly last ALL day with no extra applications. And honestly who doesn&#x27;t love watching the gel come out of the tiny holes at the top!!</li>
            <li> Even though I am pretty brand loyal to Dove (and have been for awhile) I was still game to give this a try when I recieved a free sample from BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;Now I remember why I have been a loyal Dove user all these years:&lt;br /&gt;1. The smell. Oh, God, the smell. I could smell it before I even opened the package it came in. Not a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;2. The gel. Having used and not been a fan of gels in the past, I was leery of the claim that it dries within seconds of application. It did not. I had to walk around with my arms overhead to wait for it to dry. This is probably due to #3...&lt;br /&gt;3. Uneven application. The applicator is ergonomically designed to fit your armpit, however, gel does not work this way. You get way too much on the outsides and almost nothing in the middle. Then you spend a few minutes trying to smush it around your armpit and hope for an even application.&lt;br /&gt;4. I can&#x27;t review the claim of it working 48 hours because I had to wash my armpits out after a few hours. The smell was starting to trigger a migraine and I would rather stink than deal with a bad headache.</li>
            <li> I got a sample from bzz agent and I was disappointed with it, The smell was over powering and it really didn&#x27;t keep me dry. Thanks but no thanks, Such a shame  cause I liked the idea of a long lasting deodorant but this didn&#x27;t work for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> I was given this Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel to try. I was sceptical as to its claims to be a 48 hour protection, leave no white marks, and keep you fresh for an extended period of time. I was pleasantly SURPRISED to find out that this deodorant is EVERYTHING it claims to be and MORE. I was outside on the family farm ALL day in the heat picking Cherries from a Cherry Tree in the orchard, I had on a colored tank top. I got in from my harvesting, looked down and had NO sweat marks at ALL under my arms, I still smelled fresh (not like a man&#x27;s gym locker lol), and no ugly embarrassing white marks on my shirt either. The deodorant works so well I was able to wear the SAME shirt to go out that night to meet up with friends.&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant should be in EVERYONE&#x27;S bathroom cabinet! I know I will be a loyal customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is awesome too. I have sensitive skin so I was worried when my sample was scented. It not only smelled great but it actually left my skin feeling soft not dry and didn&#x27;t bother it at all allergy wise.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my first time trying a gel deodorant. But this just happens to be the first gel deodorant that actually works. This is a great product. I&#x27;m happy I&#x27;ve gotten the opportunity to try and test this product out for free through #BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I think Secret Outlast clear gel is fantastic! The &amp;#34;completely clean&amp;#34; scent is wonderful; it smells so amazing that I can&#x27;t stop sniffing. ;-) I have to purchase more for the scent alone. I used it and was so impressed that it dries immediately and isn&#x27;t sticky or tacky like some gel deodorants are. You can go ahead and get dressed; no worries and no residue....</li>
            <li> The only brand I use and it always works, smells nice, and never stains your clothes, value pack is a good deal</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of the secret brand but I must say that I am in love with secret outlast . It really does the job all day with no worries Q i recommend you try it</li>
            <li> This deodorant is worth buying. It has kept me clean and fresh even in 110 degree weather. I like the smell and the fact that I can go all day without worrying about it not working. I would recommend this to everyone because it does not leave white marks on your clothes or residue on your underarm. I like the fact that i goes on clear and stays that way. I received this deodorant from BZZAGENT as a free trial and I love it hands down.</li>
            <li> works great on me! more to that, cheaper buying in here.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this from BzzAgent to try out and review. I have had mixed results with other Secret deodorants, but Secret Outlast is fantastic! It is cool to see the gel pop through the tiny holes on the dispenser before applying it - watch out because a little goes a long way and you don&#x27;t want to waste it! It feels cool and refreshing going on and it dries quickly, leaving NO white residue behind on dark clothing. The Completely Clean fragrance is great. I tend to be very sensitive to fragrances and have had some deodorant scents that have made me sick or given me a headache after wearing for only a short time. This one doesn&#x27;t bother me. It&#x27;s nice without being overpowering. Best of all, it really does control odor for more than a day! I showered one morning, applied Secret Outlast, went through my day and then on to bed, woke up the next morning and I still smelled fresh! I put on a little more to get through the day, and when I showered that night, still no bad odor. It also does not leave a thick residue that is noticeable on the skin or hard to wash off in the shower. It&#x27;s a winner in my book!</li>
            <li> I have always used a solid deodorant and learned to live with the white marks. I recently tried Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel and was surprised how smoothly it glided on my skin and NO white marks!! The scent is very pleasant and long lasting. Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel offers 48 hour protection, I do not feel like I need to re-apply my deodorant during those long, busy days. Even on hot, sticky days I have confidence that Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel is still working.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, BzzAgent for the opportunity to try Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel.</li>
            <li> I was really glad to get this product from BzzAgent. I haven&#x27;t used gel in years because it never seemed to dry... always felt tacky, and that residue would get into the fibers of my clothes and change the color of my clothes under my arms, even getting stiff and holding in odor even after washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this, and it really does dry fast. It smells great and leaves you smelling great all day into the next day. Sometimes the scent of my other deodorants would smell funky by the end of the day.. not a BO smell, but the scent of the product just morphs into something unpleasant. No problem with this one at all.. it stays just as fresh smelling all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter, who has hyperhydrosis uses a prescription antiperspirant, but still had problems with odor. She tried other deodorants on top, body sprays and perfume, and her odor still came through. She tried this and her problem is solved. Not sure what sort of voodoo they put in this stuff, but it works like it says it does. Love the stuff!</li>
            <li> I got this product free from Procter &amp; Gamble because I&#x27;m a Bzz. agent? I would never have tried Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Clear Gel if this wasn&#x27;t sent to me, and I love it! It keeps me odor free for 48 hours and I tested it while iwas moving! No odor for 2 days, awesome! The gel is clear and dries fast, so no white marks on my clothes! Thank you Secret Outlast!</li>
            <li> Now I sweat HORRIBLY!! I mean I can put on a shirt and in 2 minutes I will have pit stains. I have used prescription deodorants, men deodorant and nothing has worked for my pit stains or constant sweating issue! I received Secret Outlast from Bzzagent to try and I was skeptical. LET ME TELL YOU!! I was surprised this deodorant WORKS!! I put it on and have had ZERO pit stains from day 1. I would recommend this product to any woman suffering from pit stains or excessive sweating you will not be disappointed! The only down side of Secret Outlast is that it does burn a bit when applying directly after shaving you armpits, other than that Secret Outlast will be the only deodorant I use from now on!! Its a MUST BUY!</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean does not leave messy white marks on my clothes. It smells great and works great too. It works for me.</li>
            <li> Starting off, I usually use roll on deodorants because I couldn&#x27;t find any other one that wouldn&#x27;t leave a white mark or stopped working after a couple of hours! I got to try this product as part of a promotion from the brand and THANKS BzzAgent!!! I&#x27;m hooked on the always clean smell even after wearing it all day at my stressful work. I also have tried the Clinical Strenght but it really is pricey compared to this one that works well, may be better and is cheap! Now I wouldn&#x27;t try going a day without it.</li>
            <li> When Bzz Agent sent me this product to review, I expected to like it as much as I did any other antiperspirant.  In other words, I didn&#x27;t expect anything special.  I was wrong.  I loved the ease of application, the scent, the fact that it didn&#x27;t leave white marks, and that it really, truly worked---&#x3D;-even when I tested out its claim to work for 48 hours and it did despite the fact that I was very active. I suspected that I would go through the product quicker than stick products and I was wrong.  In fact, I was pleasantly surprised how long it lasted, loved that I got to use ALL the product , and was pleased that I didn&#x27;t have to deal with a broken or crumbly stick.  When I purchased my next antiperspirant, I purchased this product which says a lot as I usually go for the cheapest product available.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I stopped using gel deodorant years ago because it always felt wet under my arms and it always made me uncomfortable.  I was excited to be part of this bzzagent campaign because it had been so long since using a gel, I figured I would be a good candidate.  I&#x27;ve recently started running and use whatever deodorant is on sale.  I&#x27;m not much of a &#x27;sweater&#x27; in general, but now that I&#x27;ve been running I found that my current deodorant wasn&#x27;t keeping up as well as I would like.  Although the gel, for me, is still of a &#x27;went&#x27; feeling when I put it on - it did not stay that way for long and I felt great after my run.  I also like that it didn&#x27;t leave a residue on my clothes at all, which my current one does.  I&#x27;m overall, happy and pleasantly surprised with how much I like this deodorant!</li>
            <li> I got this from a buzz agent kit to sample and review but I had already been using it.  This really is the best deodorant/antiperspirant  that I&#x27;ve used.  Clean smelling, dries fast and keeps you swear free and smelling good for 48hrs.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Lasts long.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product as part of a promotion from the brand. I love it. I put it on right out of the shower and can say I have no problems about freshness for hte next 48 hours.</li>
            <li> Works great! I got this product as a free promo. I am now at the bottom of the container. Every application outlasted my day. Total dryness and no odor on 12-hour long work days.The scent is great. Not to strong, with a nice clean smell. The dial on the bottom clicks over easily but securely allowing customizable portions for personalized applications. I did not experience any negative effects from the product, no itching or rashes. A great product for me, and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> smells good my mother loves this one.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this as part of a bzz agent campaign and wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d like a gel antiperspirant....I&#x27;m now a believer!  It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of marks on my clothes.  I was particularly skeptical that this would keep me dry and odor-free over two full days, but it actually does.</li>
            <li> As a long time user of Secret solid I am always skeptical of new brands or formulas!  This one didn&#x27;t disappoint.  It goes on clear, dries fast and clear, smells great and lasts!  I haven&#x27;t used it the 48 hours it claims to last but can say that for me it has worked for at leas 24 hours!  I got this free from BzzAgent and will definitely be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I received this Secret Outlast gel deodorant for free to try out. I&#x27;m not a fan of gel as its wet going on - however this dried quickly and keeps me dry for a very long time. Good, clean scent!</li>
            <li> Great clean scent, not overpowering.  Goes on clear, dries quickly and protects all day.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast clean clear gel deodorant truly works great!  The gel goes on smooth, and dries quickly!  The scents are a nice fragrance without being too strong, and it truly lasts through your busy day!  Whether I am going to work out or going out dancing, I know that I can trust my deodorant will last through it all.  I am very very happy with it.  I did get to try it for free through a campaign through BzzAgent, and Secret Outlast deodorant, but all of these are my own views.</li>
            <li> When I turned the dial to push up the deodorant I was skeptical.  It seemed kind of messy.  I applied it and it went on smooth.  I put my shirt on expecting it to get my shirt wet.  Nope, it must already be dry.  Wow, impressive.  It seemed to last all day.  After work I workout for an hour.  I did not need to re-apply before or after my workout.  It controlled wetness and odor.  Even though I am not crazy about the way pushes up in the tube I am so impressed with the protection I will be buying it from now on.</li>
            <li> I received Secret Outlast free to test from BzzAgent. I like Secret products and the Secret Outlast has both positives and negatives for me. The protection is great and it does really last all day for me. I have a 6 month old baby and since the birth of this last one my hormones have been insane and in my world, that means I&#x27;ve been sweating A LOT! The only negative is that I always get an allergic reaction from the gel deodorant...this makes me sad. Other than that it is amazing.</li>
            <li> I received a free Secret Completely Clean as a BzzAgent.  I normally avoid gels because I hate the way they go on wet and take forever to dry.  Nothing worse than your clothes sticking to wet armpits!  I totally loved the feel of this one.  This goes on really smooth and dries super fast.  BUT I didn&#x27;t care for the Completely Clean fragrance.  It smelled like an air freshener or cleaning product to me.  I would give this 5 stars if it were a softer fragrance or had more of the &#x27;clean linen&#x27; smell.  The fragrance was just a deal breaker for me.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel to review as being a BzzAgent.  I typically use a solid as my antiperspirant/deodorant so applying the gel took a little getting used to since it&#x27;s a bit cold at first, but I no longer even notice that and I am surprised at how fast the gel dries.  The scent is extremely important to me.  I do not like Powder Fresh scents but this scent, Completely Clean, is very nice.  I like it and I don&#x27;t constantly smell it on myself throughout the day.  The wetness protection is not amazing but it&#x27;s very good. Actually I would be leery of a product that stopped the wetness 100%.  I don&#x27;t think that would be good for your body.  The advertising for this product says that it&#x27;s 48 hour protection but I don&#x27;t think I would go a day without putting it on.  My favorite part of this product is that it&#x27;s white mark free.  Now, while I was trying to put on the gel I did accidentally touched the gel to my shirt and there was a little bit of a mark that I just wiped clean with a wet towel, but at the end of the day when I would take my shirt off, underneath the armpits didn&#x27;t have a bunch of white marks, which usually turn into a little bit of a stain.  When I used this product, it didn&#x27;t do that.  I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised at how this performed and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this for free to try out. I was hesitant and didn&#x27;t think I would like it. My usual brand was Dove, but I found that in the summer months, I would still sweat and have that &amp;#34;hot deodorant&amp;#34; smell that I couldn&#x27;t stand. I switched to a clinical strength deodorant, which worked well except for the mess. It always caked onto my clothes and when I would store it in a drawer on its side, it would leak (mostly when it was hot out). It was also nearly impossible to wash off when I wanted to shave. But it kept me dry and fresh, so I kept using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this as a free sample to try, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like it. In fact, I left it in the box for a week or two (until my clinical strength was done). I was impressed immediately. It didn&#x27;t leak when stored in a drawer (so my husband could stop complaining about me cluttering the counter). It never stains my clothes. I&#x27;m always dry. My clothes are never stained. Lastly, it&#x27;s much easier to wash off when I need to. It also dries quickly after applying so I don&#x27;t rub it off onto my clothes and have to immediately change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have made a permanent switch to this deodorant and have recommended it to many of my friends - some of whom have also tried it and made the switch. I&#x27;m highly impressed and will be sad and upset if this ever leaves the market!</li>
            <li> I am a Bzz Agent and received a full size sample of Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel Deodorant and coupons to share with friends and family. I absolutely LOVE this product! It is a clear gel deodorant, but it is not like any other that I&#x27;ve used before. In fact, in the past I haven&#x27;t been a big fan of gel deodorant, but this one is different. It&#x27;s very effective, fast to dry after applied, keeps you dry and odor-free all day long, and the best part is - none of my clothes have been ruined by white deodorant marks!  I&#x27;m happy to say that I&#x27;ve found my new favorite deodorant. It&#x27;s #ClearlyBetter than anything else currently on the market!</li>
            <li> Let me just say this first, I&#x27;m a really big fan of Secret deodorants! I got even more excited when I got to test the new Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel for free for my BzzAgent campaign and this is how it went! This deodorant has a really great, clean and fresh scent, which I immediately loved! It promises you 48 hour odor protection, which I found out to be so true as it kept me dry and wonderfully smelling thru the whole day! It successfully endured my day at work, a dash thru the supermarket and a gruesome workout afterwards! All it takes is a one click of the deodorant and two swipes of it and you&#x27;re set for the day! One of the best things about it is that it dries so fast and leaves no white marks! I am in love with this deodorant and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> Chasing a toddler around the house all day long (especially in this warm autumn weather we have) calls for me to make sure I&#x27;m extra protected in the odor area.  Not only does Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel provide longer lasting odor protection, it also dries quickly without leaving any marks! Very happy with this deodorant!</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this deodorant. She had a wedding she needed to attend and was reapplying part of the day while wearing a black dress and it never got white marks on it. She recieved this product to test from a company. She said she will repurchase this for a long time!</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant! I received  a free package from Secret but will be buying it for myself soon.  Even after I&#x27;ve run several miles in our humid weather, it&#x27;s still working.  It&#x27;s not sticky like most gel deodorants and doesn&#x27;t leave a white residue on your clothes.</li>
            <li> I am a loyal Secret user, have been for years, and will continue to be.  However this particular product is not for me.  It takes too long to dry and by the end of the day I have been having some body odor issues.  This isn&#x27;t normal for me.  I am thinking this particular Secret product just doesn&#x27;t work well with my body chemistry.  I received a free sample as part of a promotion to try the product,</li>
            <li> Recently had the chance to try Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel deodorant for free to review and I’m pleased to report clear gel deodorant has come a long way since I tried it in my younger years! It goes on smooth (not gloppy) &amp;amp; dries super fast. The scent is light &amp;amp; fresh, not overpowering. It lasts all day and night without re application. I have even noticed my underarms are smoother. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an effective, pleasant deodorant. &amp;#60;img src&#x3D;&amp;#34;https://img.bzzagent.com/image/secret.jpg?Type&#x3D;activity&amp;amp;Activity&#x3D;5254132653&amp;amp;Campaign&#x3D;2877364477&amp;amp;Uid&#x3D;1583531&amp;amp;token&#x3D;2c3bacaeec125ff74b8cd15d2e93f944&amp;#34; alt&#x3D;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#62;&lt;/p&gt;</li>
            <li> I usually use the basic clinical strength deodorant, but was given a chance to try this for free through a program on Bzzagent.  I have now been using Secret Outlast Clear for two weeks and have not encountered any issues.  I can apply the deodorant once and it last throughout the day even when hiking wearing multiple layers. It goes on clear and does not leave marks on my clothing which I love!  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> got to try this with bzzagent. the first time i used it i thought it was pretty good. the second day i tested it by putting on a black shirt without being careful how i put the shirt on. i got mild white marks. the 3rd day i wore it i had to work harder at my job so i ended up sweating more. i could smell myself a little at the end of the day. lets just say i won&#x27;t be buying this one again.</li>
            <li> Really like the new Secret Outlast Clean Clear Gel. I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and received a free sample and so far, really great. It has a clean scent, so it reduces the sweat for 48 hours and no odor. Best of all, no matter how careful I am with putting on deodorant, it always seems to happen once or twice a week...I get deodorant on my clothing and find myself walking into a meeting or sitting in the car noticing marks on clothing. Such a bummer! But not with this new product - I even intentionally put it on clothing to &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; the reliability and so far so good....no marks. Great Secret product, stands up to the advertising.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Secret Outlast from buzzagent. They wanted me to try it and see what I thought.  I can say the name is correct with Outlast.&lt;br /&gt;I work in a very busy hospital that can also be very stressful at times.  Since I started using Secret Outlast I only need to apply my deodorant once a day. Unlike my former brand. I also love that is fast drying and clear. I don&#x27;t get and spots on my clothing now. I can even put it on after I&#x27;m dressed and don&#x27;t have to worry.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to try a new deodorant I would recommend this.  I promise no disappointment.</li>
            <li> one of them was opened and broke</li>
            <li> Everything I love about salt deodorants and standard anti-antiperspirants in one package, without any of the things I hate like the mess or failures. I have been using a full-size sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel given to me for free by BzzAgent for a few weeks now. I have not had a single deodorant failure, yet! No transfer to my clothes or gross white buildup that&#x27;s difficult to wash off; just a nice scent and sweat protection. I don&#x27;t think I am going back to my old brands, ever. This is all I need.</li>
            <li> I jog 7 miles several times a week, and usually I&#x27;m a sweaty, stinky mess! I was given Secret Outlast Completely Clean to try for free and I was so impressed with the results! The gel was very quick to dry and didn&#x27;t leave any white marks on my clothing. It wasn&#x27;t sticky, and the smell was fresh, mild, and very pleasant. After even my toughest runs, the rest of my body may be hot and sweaty, but not under my arms!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to #getitfree and try this new deodorant from #bzzagent.  First off, I&#x27;m not usually a clear gel kind of girl. Usually I&#x27;m a invisible solid girl. Actually I usually use Secret invisible dry. I haven&#x27;t used clear gels in many years. I was expecting a sticky wet feeling deodorant that left me feeling sweaty in just a couple hours. BOY WAS I WRONG! I am actually loving this new deodorant. No weird white creases, and it dries really quickly when applied, and isn&#x27;t sticky at all! I actually really like this scent too. I usually go for the powder fresh or cocoa butter scents, but this one is nice and not overpowering.  Thanks Secret, you may have just changed me into a gel girl!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and I got this sample of Secret Outlast deodorant called Secret Outlast: The Secret to 48 Hour Odor Protection. I&#x27;ve been using it this past week and it kept me dry all day. I haven&#x27;t needed 48 hour protection recently, but being a resident, you never know when you&#x27;ll have to pull a 48 hour shift! It would be nice to have that kind of confidence in your deodorant. I know I&#x27;ve sure needed it in the past...stress sweat is the worst! I have to admit that I do not like the scent they sent me - Completely Clean. I like powder fresh or baby powder scents. This is more of a floral scent. I&#x27;ve been smelling it all day and I keep thinking, &amp;#34;what&#x27;s that flowery smell?&amp;#34; It really confused me this morning because I didn&#x27;t realize it was the deodorant. Also, it&#x27;s a wet gel when you put it on; so, your underarms feel wet for a while when you first put it on, which is a little weird. I prefer a dry solid. However, it is invisible which is nice for dark clothes and it does give great odor protection.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I had a Halloween party last night and most of us dressed up. All the girls crowded into my bathroom to do costumes and makeup, and without fail, we wanted to freshen up before changing, which included applying new deodorant. Literally not one person had brought their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grabbed the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel that I received from BzzAgent and we all shared it, taking quick swipes with TP between armpits for those who got grossed out by the prospect of sharing something so personal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I could get away with this is the trust we share, and when I told them it would dry before they put their costumes on, they took a leap of faith and...everyone was very happy. We stayed dry, felt cleaner and no costumes were destroyed after applying the deodorant. Coupons were distributed accordingly...along with scheduled treats, no tricks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had a blast and everyone thanked me for helping out on the freshness front. It was really cool that Halloween landed on a Friday this year, but we all work too, so didn&#x27;t always have a chance to go home and prepare before the festivities started. My couple of overnighters did not ask for a re-application this morning, which I take as another very good sign!</li>
            <li> I received this deodorant as a Bzzagent. I was very skeptical to use a gel deodorant again, as I have tried them in the past and hated the wet feeling. I was very pleasantly surprised that this one dries almost instantly! It lasts all day and actually smells pretty good. Because it leaves no white marks, I will probably be switching out my clinical protection deodorant with this... I will have to try it in the summer time to see how it stands up the summer heat and sweating! :)</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel is a fast acting antiperspirant that holds up to both stressful situations and an active lifestyle. I was very impressed with the long lasting nature of the product and felt that it lasted well into the next day after use. I had no problems with any streaking or stains on my clothing which is always a plus. I am very thankful I received the product free of charge from BuzzAgent to sample and I will definitely be using this product from now on!</li>
            <li> After years of using Suave deodorant,  I wanted to try a clear gel &amp; have to admit I love it!  It lasts all day, has a great scent, and I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> This smells amazing while putting on and even while breaking a sweat. I only had a few streaks and a clump here and  there. I wonder if the streaking occurred because of my skin color?  I  have a natural tan I guess  you could call it. Native American in me :).  This is the first time I have ever used a gel deodorant too and so far really pleased with it</li>
            <li> its a good seller. Recomended</li>
            <li> I received this as part of a BZZ campaign , and I have to say this stuff truly lives up to it&#x27;s name.  The scent is light, it dries super fast, leaves no sticky feeling , no white marks even on your black clothing , and keeps you completly dry , and odorless no matter how hard you are working or playing.  I would definitly reccommend this deoderant!!!!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use Secret Outlast Completely Clean Clear Gel. I was however, a bit disappointed in the lasting effects. It started off great, but halfway through the day I didn&#x27;t feel fresh any longer. I also felt that there was an initial sticky feeling that I was not fond of.</li>
            <li> I was recently sent a sample of Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Gel Antiperspirant  because I am a Bzz Agent and I immediately put the product to use. I was so relieved at not having to worry about getting white streaks residue on any of my clothes especially my sleeveless black blouses and dresses.  The fact that this product does not leave no white marks  was a winner for me and that alone  enough to make me a loyal user.It was an additional bonus that it was quick to dry without leaving a sticky feeling and that I was odorless the entire day!!! I did have to figure how not to extract too  much gel out of the bottle because otherwise it sticks to the top of the cap and is a big waste of product but other than that I am sticking to this brand!</li>
            <li> I was given a sample from of this deodorant to try (thank you Secret) and I LOVE LOVE LOVE it. It smells so good and keeps me nice and dry. It was a hot and humid day today and I had no issues with sweat or odor. Recommend this deodorant to anyone who live a busy on the go lifestyle.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of the secret outlast completely clean clear gel as a part of a bzz campaign from bzzagent. I am so glad that I had this opportunity because I never really liked gel deodorants. So I tried this one and am really happy that I did because it really changed my mind about gel deodorants. Not only did it last a really long time, it dried clear and did not leave any white marks on any of my clothing. All in all, it is a really good option!</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of your outlast completely clean clear gel and I love it! I have no white marks and still smell great even when its over 100 outside! I wi be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I am lucky I got to try Secret Outlast gel for free through a Bzzagent campaign for Secret! I was incredibly skeptical to use a gel deodorant because I&#x27;ve had stain issues in the past and because I am a chef. To my surprise it went on easy(dries quick too), lasted a long hot day without leaving grody looking stains on my shirt and I Did Not Stink!! One to one and a half click is all you need and you&#x27;re good for the whole day!! I totally recommend this deodorant to any hard working hard sweating woman! Did I mention it smells good?? That is always a plus in my book :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the opinions I have given are My Own.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this from BzzAgent.  I&#x27;ll have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.  I&#x27;ve alway been a Secret user, but have preferred the solids.  Many years ago I tried a different brand of gel deodorant and hated it.  It took too long to dry, it was sticky and I didn&#x27;t feel like it lasted long enough.  This has definitely changed my opinion.  Although I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the completely clean scent (I prefer Power fresh scents), once it&#x27;s dried I don&#x27;t really smell anything.  This dries very quickly, it isn&#x27;t at all sticky and it definitely lasts as long as I need it.  Gel deodorant has certainly come a long way.  I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bzzagent for Secret Outlast Clean Clear Gel and was able to try this for free. I&#x27;ve been enjoying this product so far! As a teacher, this time of year is always a little challenging when it comes to knowing how to dress.  The heat has been turned on in our building yet we still have some warmer fall days outside so it can get very hot.  Secret Clean Clear Gel has been awesome!  No sweaty shirts at the end of the day in a hot, stuffy classroom.  My favorite part of this product is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I have very sensitive skin on my underarms and this product really helps; my skin doesn&#x27;t feel itchy or red.  Give it a try!!</li>
            <li> Love this secret. It is amazing no white marks up to 48 hrs of protection and it smells wonderful also. I would recommend this to anyone who lives in a hot climate for sure. I was able to review this product as part of a promotion and I a, so glad I was able too</li>
            <li> I received this deodorant for free from BzzAgent and am so happy with it.  I never had problems with wetness/odor control with my other deodorant, it was pretty good.  The one thing I did have a problem with is my &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; deodorant never was really clear, all my black tops got white marks.  Not with this one, it was absolutely clear!  The scent on this one is pretty strong and I was not a big fan of it, so when I purchased another one I went with the unscented.</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent and that I received the Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel as part of a promotion from the brand. I have been using the deodorant for two week now and I really like the results. I like the fact that it goes in clear and does not stain my clothes. Secret keeps it promise because I stay dry all day. The scent is refreshing and pleasant. Even my husband uses it. It delivers real results for people like you and me. I would definitely buy Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Women&#x27;s Clear Gel and make the switch. I love to smell good. My husband really likes the 48 hour protection. It&#x27;s a brand that my family trust.</li>
            <li> Great for summertime wear when you might be showing off those underarms. No white streaks and pleasing smell. Though don&#x27;t expect to miracles on staying dry if it is super hot out--life happens.</li>
            <li> Works well..smells wonderful and dries very quickly!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I use it under arm, under boob and secretly - twixt the thighs.  DON&#x27;T laugh.  My baby sister came down to Texas from Washington state and got hit with feels like 100 degree weather.....  I didn&#x27;t sweat, she wanted to know why and so I gave her one of these (comes in 2 pack)  and now she knows the secret (lol, get it) of not sweating in high heat (not that she gets to experience that very often in Seattle area) to no sweating in all those little female crevices.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last all day, other secret products are better</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodrant. It smells so amazing that i feel fresh all day long. And also its really affordable and long lasting. I would definitely recommend this to everyone who wants to be sweat odor fre and fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> Outlast is exactly what this did. I have never used a deodorant that lasted so long. Loved it</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I recently tried out Secret Outlast Completely Clean Scent Deodorant. Prior to trying this product I was using Mitchum gel antiperspirant because, as the mother of a 7 month old boy, I run around all day and NEED a good order and sweat control product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT CLAIMS (MY RESPONSES IN CAPS):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;48-hour odor protection: I HAVEN&#x27;T ACTUALLY GONE 48 HOURS BETWEEN APPLICATIONS, BUT I WILL SAY I HAVE GONE FROM APPLYING AN ANTIPERSPIRANT TWICE DAILY TO JUST ONCE WITH THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps stop odor before it starts: TOTALLY TRUE! I WAS HAVING SERIOUS ODOR ISSUES WITH MY MOMMY HORMONES AFTER HAVING MY SON AND THIS PRODUCT HAS GREATLY HELPED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no question this Completely Clean Scent keeps you feeling clean: BECAUSE THE SWEAT IS KEPT UNDER CONTROL - I DO FEEL MUCH CLEANER, I DON&#x27;T FEEL THE NEED TO CHANGE MY SHIRT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free sample of this product to try in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions expressed are my own.**</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance. It is mild but pleasant. This product saves me from those wet armpit days during summer :)</li>
            <li> I received a delux sample of this deodorant as part of a promotion from Secret. Having used clear gel deodorant in the past I was hesitant to give it a try as most clear gel deodorants leave you feeling a little soggy under the arms. However, I was VERY pleasantly surprised at how FAST this product dried once applied......and poof.....no soggy arm pit! As far as the lasting power goes, I can say it lasted me all through the day and when I woke up the next morning I was still smelling as lovely as I had the morning before when I had first applied it! Really a great product and I will for sure be purchasing this again in the future!!</li>
            <li> i love this deodorant i have tried many different ones, but for some reason i keep going back to secret brand. i don&#x27;t know what it is about but its coming closer to the conclusion with outlast clear gel it stays on and i don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying in fact i have to admit that is actually stays on all day and night, i don&#x27;t have to reapply until early in the afternoon but i have a habit of reapplying every morning. i give hats off to secret about this new advance technology that is coming closer to hiding up the uncomfortable odor that women are sometimes afraid to admit.&lt;br /&gt;I got this free to review from One2OneNetwork.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for free through BzzAgent. Before I received this I was a faithful Secret invisible sold user. This deodorant promises to keep you dry and odor free for 48 hours after applying. It works! I put it on in the morning and went about my normal day of chores and chasing my kids. It kept my odor free as well as dry! My favorite thing is that it doesn&#x27;t leave any unsightly white marks on your clothing. It was a little weird at first to get used to it going on a little wet but after a few minutes it dries and you don&#x27;t feel it.  This is a product that truly does what it says it will! Definitely worth trying!!</li>
            <li> I got this product free from BzzAgent to review so this is a #sponsored post.  That being said, I really loved this product.  Firstly, the scent was amazing.  I normally pick &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;baby powder/baby fresh&amp;#34; anyway as those are my go to scents.  Next, it is very easy to use.  One click is all you need.  The gel is clear, goes on smooth, and dries quickly.  I workout 6 days a week and this held up through my cardio session.  I was dry and my pits didn&#x27;t stink!  Of course I still had to shower afterwards because I was drenched in sweat, but I was happy with how the product preformed.  I will buy this in the future.  I tend to switch between Suave, Dove, and Secret but I like that this is totally clear and smells fresh.</li>
            <li> I never used a gel one before and after using it I am going to start using gel ones after I am finished with this one. I like that it is clear and you don&#x27;t have to worry about white marks and I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t clump up like I have seen on other antiperspirants.    The smell is nice and I do feel like it lasts all day. Sometimes I felt like a deordant was wearing off at the end of the day, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that feeling with this one.    Note: I got this as part of a promotion from the brand. Even though I got it as part of a promotion, my review is true and something I would put even if I didn&#x27;t get it as a promotion.</li>
            <li> Amazing deodorant.  Got a free sample from Secret to try out.  Normally hate gel deodorant, but since it was free thought I would give it a try.  The gel dried super fast, and the deodorant works better than any I have ever tried.  Kept me dry, even during exercise.  The deodorant has a nice scent to it, and kept me odor free.  Would for sure purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I had received this product as a sample from BzzAgent. I was a little skeptical about trying Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel. I am used to having that solid deodorant residue left behind by my solid deodorant product. To me, that residue shows me that the product has been applied and will work. Trying this clear gel was strange at first, since I wasn&#x27;t used to the cold, wet sensation of the gel. It dried pretty quickly and left me with a clean feeling, not sticky at all, which I was expecting. The scent was pleasant and just the right strength. This product kept me dry and odor-free all day! I think I&#x27;ll be making the switch to Secret Outlast® Completely Clean Clear Gel.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed by the clear gel that it lasted throughout my work day and my evening walks in these hot Houston days and nights!  I never have to worry about white marks ever again, and so relieved!  This product is even better than most clinical strength brands I have purchased in the past.  It goes on smooth and dries quickly especially when I am running late, not like other brands! I will definitely be purchasing this item in the future! This product was received by the brand for promotional review.</li>
            <li> I was able to receive a sample of this deodorant from BzzAgent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the same deodorant for years now - the only difference is that I&#x27;ve changed up the scent every now and again.  Deodorant is deodorant - right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was asked to try the Secret Clear Gel I thought, why not? What&#x27;s the worst that could happen?  If I hated it, I could just simply switch back to my old standby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a week.  Not bad, I thought.  But, when my stick of Secret went missing (the handi-work of a toddler) and I had to use my &#x27;standby&#x27; for the day I went into search mode!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the difference.  At first, I side-eyed how &#x27;tacky&#x27; my skin felt after application, but the other brand leaves residue, too - usually all over my dark shirts. I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore, and at the end of the day I don&#x27;t feel moist, icky, or stinky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say you have a convert on your hands.</li>
            <li> I work 11-hour days caring for two baby boys in addition to my own 3-year-old boy. These guys do not know how to wait--they&#x27;re still learning patience and empathy aaaand volume control. So I am always moving! With my old deodorant, I would apply it by 7:00 a.m. and notice odor by around noon. Not cool, since it&#x27;s another 5 hours before the first parent arrives, and I don&#x27;t have the luxury of re-applying deodorant around the lunch hour. (Kids gotta eat, apparently.) Now I do not notice any unpleasant odor all day, or even the next morning when I hit the shower. I do notice the Completely Clean fragrance whenever I lift my arms (which is frequently, between lifting children, doing the hokey pokey, and playing airplanes). It smells fantastic! I do have some dampness, but I&#x27;m glad it allows me to sweat, or I would be overheated. (You know, science and everything.) I love this stuff. And I&#x27;m not just saying that because I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and I got to try it for free. I am now hooked and I plan to replace my old deodorant with it!</li>
            <li> I love Secret Oulast deodorant! It comes in many forms and different scents. I have been using the invisible solid for a very long time and just recently recieved the gel form through a promotion. I thought id give it a try and was really impressed! It seems to dry faster than the other gel deodorant I&#x27;ve tried in the past. The only thing I don&#x27;t like with gel, is that sometimes it feels sticky.... So I still prefer the invisible solid. As for the completely clean scent, this is my favorite scent out of any deodorant. Light smelling and fresh. I don&#x27;t do well with strong perfume smelling deodorants and have finally found a great deodorant with a great scent thanks to Secret!</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant!  It&#x27;s the only one I will use as I find it provides the protection I need and lasts all day.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any type of uncomfortable film on my skin or mark my clothes.  The scent is very mild, which I like because I can be sensitive to strong scents.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this product!</li>
            <li> Great Deodorant. Long lasting, feels and stays fresh, clean, and dry!</li>
