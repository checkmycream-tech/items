    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Perfect for summer!</li>
            <li>It smelled wonderful just as I imagined it would after reading Janet Evanovich books and hearing Ranger uses it</li>
            <li>Happy I did order this size as the fragrance is not to my liking.</li>
            <li>Smells good like tea fresk</li>
            <li>Yes, I originally bought it because of Janet Evanovich&#x27;s &amp;#34;Ranger&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Not quite what I have thought, but very pleasant.</li>
            <li>This cologne is very light, and smells great.</li>
            <li>Good aroma very light.</li>
            <li>I love the limey freshness of this</li>
            <li>I think I gave the product 3 stars more because of the merchant than the product itself.</li>
            <li>Nice, clean scent.</li>
            <li>If you want to sample the fragrance (particularly you fans of Stephanie Plum), this could be a good way to go rather than spend $35 or more for something you may or may not like.</li>
            <li>I got order very quickly from supplier.  </li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t easy.</li>
            <li>The scent is actually light and pleasant particularly if you don&#x27;t use too much.  </li>
            <li>Ok so this is the 2nd time I have ordered this and as all ways I am pleased and will purchase it again!</li>
            <li>While the merchant was honest in describing the product at 0.17 ounce, that is actually 5ml or about 1 teaspoonful.  </li>
            <li>This unisex green tea based scent is amazing and light.</li>
            <li>Same lovely scent I remember from a trip to Italy.</li>
            <li>its A shame they could charge you for that with a straight face.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just me wearing it, but the perfume was harsh, not delicate like a rose.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I would also look at other offerings from this merchant quite critically and with a great deal of care.  </li>
            <li>Teeny tiny bottle (what else would it be for the price??) makes me smile.</li>
            <li>Cute little portable bottle of summer goodness!</li>
            <li>I would probably have preferred the merchant to clearly label the product as &amp;#34;sample size&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li>I was surprised it was in a bubble envelope and not a shipping box.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned that the scent would be &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; as in improperly stored or old, but was pleasantly surprised that it smelled as it should.  </li>
            <li>When you receive it, you can see that it is clearly marked &amp;#34;compliments of Bvlgari&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It isn&#x27;t Bulgari&#x27;s fault (and isn&#x27;t reflected in the stars), but worth noting that the store I purchased this from sent it in a flimsy envelope so the box was completely crushed when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s then that you realize that the product is one of those samples given out with other purchases by high end merchants.  </li>
            <li>The Bulgari Green Tea was fine but the Bvlgari Rose Essentielle disappointed me, didn&#x27;t smell like roses.  </li>

            <li> Cute little portable bottle of summer goodness! This unisex green tea based scent is amazing and light. Perfect for summer!</li>
            <li> I got order very quickly from supplier.  I was surprised it was in a bubble envelope and not a shipping box.  The tiny little glass bottle  was in its product box and the lid was open and box slightly crumpled but the bottle and lid were intact.  I was concerned that the scent would be &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; as in improperly stored or old, but was pleasantly surprised that it smelled as it should.  Now waiting on rest of order--body lotion &amp; shower gel from different supplier--much slower shipping!</li>
            <li> I love the limey freshness of this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t Bulgari&#x27;s fault (and isn&#x27;t reflected in the stars), but worth noting that the store I purchased this from sent it in a flimsy envelope so the box was completely crushed when it arrived.  It wasn&#x27;t worthy of gift giving :(</li>
            <li> If you want to sample the fragrance (particularly you fans of Stephanie Plum), this could be a good way to go rather than spend $35 or more for something you may or may not like. The scent is actually light and pleasant particularly if you don&#x27;t use too much.  While the merchant was honest in describing the product at 0.17 ounce, that is actually 5ml or about 1 teaspoonful.  When you receive it, you can see that it is clearly marked &amp;#34;compliments of Bvlgari&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s then that you realize that the product is one of those samples given out with other purchases by high end merchants.  The bottle is 2&amp;#34; tall and about 1/2&amp;#34; wide and probably contains no more than a few applications.  Photo and product description are misleading, but again if you just want a sample, this is it. Personally, I would also look at other offerings from this merchant quite critically and with a great deal of care.  I think I gave the product 3 stars more because of the merchant than the product itself. I would probably have preferred the merchant to clearly label the product as &amp;#34;sample size&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li> This item is very small ,although was expected from description. Happy I did order this size as the fragrance is not to my liking. It does not cling and stay. Short lived smell. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells good like tea fresk</li>
            <li> Good aroma very light.</li>
            <li> Ok so this is the 2nd time I have ordered this and as all ways I am pleased and will purchase it again!</li>

            <li> Nice, clean scent. Yes, I originally bought it because of Janet Evanovich&#x27;s &amp;#34;Ranger&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Not quite what I have thought, but very pleasant.</li>
            <li> The Bulgari Green Tea was fine but the Bvlgari Rose Essentielle disappointed me, didn&#x27;t smell like roses.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me wearing it, but the perfume was harsh, not delicate like a rose.  Also, the design of the lid is clumsy, it looks as though you would unscrew it but instead you have to pull it off and with such a tiny bottle to hold it isn&#x27;t easy.</li>
            <li> Once received item was as expected</li>
            <li> It smelled wonderful just as I imagined it would after reading Janet Evanovich books and hearing Ranger uses it</li>
            <li> Had I known the bottle was smaller than a dime I would never have bought it . It&#x27;s a joke</li>
