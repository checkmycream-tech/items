            <li>Best shave in years, like a lot of us who started shaving before the multi-blade cartridge craze</li>
            <li>Excellent for a beginner though because it is a forgiving razor and will allow beginners to skip the &amp;#34;alum block&amp;#34</li>
            <li>For me the gilette silver/blue blades work best, but you need to try for yourself to be,sure.</li>

            <li>This razor feels good, has nice weight.</li>
            <li>The British may make the best brushes, but the Germans make the best razors for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Fit and finish are great.  </li>
            <li>because that angle shaves my beard really nicely, it&#x27;s just something to keep in mind.</li>
            <li>Got this for my husband...leaves a nice smooth shave and great look with no razor bumps or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Excellent balance and the head is very well made.</li>
            <li>I also own the Muehle R89 twist and a Merkur Futur adjustable and a Merkur Slant Barberpole.</li>
            <li>is astounding,</li>

            <li>This razor is that nice.</li>
            <li>Worked amazing and huge difference!</li>
            <li>/&gt;GOOD - It&#x27;s beautifully made, very high quality.</li>
            <li>Good angle, weight adequate.</li>
            <li>I must reckon that this is the best affordable razor for someone new to DE shaving and the finish, feel and weight is accurate.</li>
            <li>This razor will give the same excellent shave as an Edwin Jagger (identical head).</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this, and would definitely purchase more products from Muhle.</li>
            <li>All outstanding products.</li>
            <li>Magic Shave&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Great quality, cuts very well.</li>
            <li>Love the look and feel of it.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it looks with the matching brush and stand which were part of the set I was given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I would have gotten a much better shave</li>
            <li>I plan to have this razor for many years.</li>
            <li>The design, machining and finish are top quality.</li>
            <li>I love look and style of it.</li>
            <li>but now love it.</li>
            <li>I will update when I have used it more.</li>
            <li>Way better than my hinged/butterfly safety razor.</li>
            <li>Something people need to mention more often is to keep in mind</li>
            <li>Nice fit and finish for the price and well made.</li>
            <li>My wife likes the fact that I tend to shave more often, because of the time and comfort factors.</li>
            <li>; section most of the time.</li>
            <li>most of us have grown up shaving</li>
            <li>Additionally, the closeness of the shave is outstanding with no irration at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Also be sure to buy a blade sampler pack.</li>
            <li>It is very well made, has a great finish and works quite well.  </li>
            <li>Great shave highly recommend</li>
            <li>The chroming job is flawless and the handle is non slip even when your hands are wet or oily (from pre shave oil for example) or have shave cream on them.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever used a safety razor, and I must admit that it is by far the best shave that I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>It was okay and is now used as my travel razor since this is my primary.  </li>
            <li>This helps with maintaining the right pressure since all I do is set the razor against the skin and let its own weight do the job.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d forgotten how easy it was to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>It is a fine razor and it may work for you.  </li>
            <li>The razor holds the blade fine.</li>
            <li>The handle unscrews from the head for disassembly making easy clean, and easy to change blades.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic razor that is a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>These cost a bit more but are well worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>Great shaver, solid design, and material.</li>
            <li>This razor is a great razor for me just starting.</li>
            <li>Lastly, my face feels great with no razor burns.</li>
            <li>It is angled quite nicely; gives a very close shave without being overly aggressive.  </li>
            <li>, it is of the top quality that you would expect from this company, the design is very forgiven, but you can achieve a very close shave, I have been shaving my head for 36yrs, and this safety razor is incredible for that, and my face, it is built like it will last me for the rest of my life, love this</li>
            <li>If you are just getting started with DE razors and wet shaving, I think this would make an excellent first choice.  </li>
            <li>far i enjoy the \\&quot;luxery\\&quot; aspect here, but i mostly enjoy being able to control my shave more than i could with a fusion/mach/tracer etc.</li>
            <li>I love this razor gives a very close shave and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m bump free, my skin is feels super smooth afterwards and it doesn&#x27;t cause any ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>so I know what a true baby bottom smooth shave should feel like.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact my first use I had zero nicks, which is better than with the 5 blade which always nicked me.</li>
            <li>I was not sure what to expect, but was thoroughly impressed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly higher priced than some of the classic entry models, but I feel this would be a great first razor...</li>
            <li>This razor matched what I could do with a straight razor, when I took two passes with the grain and one (very light) pass against the grain.</li>
            <li>The craftsmanship on this razor is without a doubt top notch and really motivates you to clean and buff the chrome after every shave.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good razor though.</li>
            <li>This performs just as well and much more reasonably.</li>
            <li>Construction wise, this seems as solid as any, so I rated the 3 stars.  </li>
            <li>I was told that the MÃ¼hle R89 would be a good starting razor.</li>
            <li>This thing reeks of cool and class.  </li>
            <li>I own and use about 6 high quality safety razors and this razor is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>For a mild shave, pair it with a Merkur razor blade.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great daily user even if you like to mix in some straight or shavette on the weekends as well.</li>
            <li>It provides a close, smooth, consistent shave.</li>
            <li>My first DE razor!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been so excited to shave my face until I decided to purchase the Muhle R89</li>
            <li>i had no idea that this would be such an amazing shaving implement.</li>
            <li>I love the way the razor keepers have been designed to be nearly flush with the razor plate.</li>
            <li>The Muhle R89 is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>The sleek design paired with the quality, make this purchase worth the money.</li>
            <li>well worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I shave with a smile with this shaver.</li>
            <li>The complete system works better than the cartridges and their system.</li>
            <li>Between that &amp; the Muhle R89 Closed Comb, the 3-piece Muhle is a better razor, has better weight distribution, and is heavier.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I was a little apprehensive at first, but I&#x27;m really happy with my choice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a pretty large handle which makes it easy to handle for people with large hands like me.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product overall and good for a beginner to DE razor wet shaving.</li>
            <li>All blades react differently with different people and the razor you will need to try a few to see which one you love the best.</li>
            <li>This is my first DE razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying there is anything wrong with this razor, it may well be among the best out there.</li>
            <li>so this the first time I shaved with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more for looks, than it is for providing extra grip.</li>
            <li>I first started using a Gillette DE safety razor over 50 years ago, had lots of nicks then, so went on to electrics and cartridge razors.</li>
            <li>One of my regular and favorite razors.</li>
            <li>Just a side, this is the first revue I have written for anything purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best ill never use anything else</li>
            <li>First time to use safety razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I switched from the standard disposable razors to this.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever used a DE safety razor.</li>
            <li>This is a good, chunky, heavy razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it is a little more picky about the angle in which you hold it, this is not a bad thing though</li>
            <li>Simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>- This is a razor made for people with large hands.</li>
            <li>The investment is large at the beginning</li>
            <li>Only safety razor Iv ever used but it gets the job done fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine but the handle is too short for me.</li>
            <li>I come from the world of straight razors</li>
            <li>Razors are very much a personal fit type of hardware.  </li>
            <li>Very forgiving, non aggressive DE razors.</li>
            <li>The time saving is from not spending so much time trying to rinse the razor between strokes.</li>
            <li>After much research I arrived with the R89 as my choice.</li>
            <li>This is true, I barely pulled the razor, but rather let the weight of the razor do the work, but the razor is not fussy at all.</li>
            <li>A nice razor for everyday shaving.</li>
            <li>I am new to safety razors and I can honestly say I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to any man looking to step up his grooming ritual.</li>
            <li>I am brand new to DE shaving and started out with the Microtouch One Classic Safety Razor.</li>
            <li>I can get as fast a shave and a cleaner shave lathering up the old way and shaving with this DE compared to whatever lube I used with cartridges.</li>
            <li>I shave my head and face daily and get really close with this, an alum block or styptic pencil handles the cuts pretty well, but my lack of experience probably increases their occurrence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was so easy that I actually went on and finished my entire face!</li>
            <li>Just shaved with my new Muhle R89 DE razor.</li>
            <li>This razor is just like most of what was written about it, but it so beyond my dreams of what a shave is suppose to be like, this is it, I won&#x27;t get technical about this other</li>
            <li>My husband wanted a smoother shave, I purchased this razor after I had given him Hot Shaves from a local barber...</li>
            <li>I paired it with a Personna Red blade and Truefitt and Hill 1805 shave cream and got a BSS the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been missing out on the best shave possible for the past 12 years!</li>
            <li>I have a very dense beard with thick, wiry hair, and when keeping all the other variable the same, this razor gives me a much more comfortable and closer shave than the Merkur.  </li>
            <li>I was told that the experience might be difficult and that it was important to use a light touch.</li>
            <li>so close and so soft...</li>
            <li>However, I cannot give 5 stars because the razor blade was completely bent when I received the package.</li>
            <li>There is no comparison between an old school DE shave and the over priced cartridge junk</li>
            <li>The knurling can get slick with shave cream or pre shave oil on your hands, but thats an easy fix.</li>
            <li>The cost is astounding less than 2 Euro for 10 blades, less than 2 Euro for the soap and the cream.</li>
            <li>It takes some practice and time to adapt to any new razor so don&#x27;t be discouraged if your first few shaves are less than stellar, soon you will naturally figure out what the razor wants (angle ect.)</li>
            <li>After much research, I found this razor to be a step above the others in the same price range.</li>
            <li>I have been in the army 15 years and finally decided to shave like an adult.</li>
            <li>It is much lighter than I expected and</li>
            <li>Its not too small, not too long, easy to grip (even when my hand is wet) and it shaves REALLY well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was willing to spend the extra cash for a reliable razor, that I hoped would last me a very long time.</li>
            <li>and I feel like it will produce less waste and give me better</li>
            <li>The Edwin Jagger DE89 is the exact same razor as the Muhle R89, but $15 less.</li>
            <li>But potential buyers should be aware that they can purchase an equivalent Edwin Jagger razor, with exactly the same head, for roughly HALF the price (give or take a little).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wet shaving</li>
            <li>have all been good but have also been bad for my skin.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I would have gotten a much better shave</li>
            <li> I plan to have this razor for many years.</li>
            <li> The design, machining and finish are top quality.</li>
            <li> I love look and style of it.</li>
            <li> but now love it.</li>
            <li> I will update when I have used it more.</li>
            <li> Way better than my hinged/butterfly safety razor.</li>
            <li> Something people need to mention more often is to keep in mind</li>
            <li> Nice fit and finish for the price and well made.</li>
            <li> My wife likes the fact that I tend to shave more often, because of the time and comfort factors.</li>
            <li> ; section most of the time.</li>
            <li> most of us have grown up shaving</li>
            <li> Additionally, the closeness of the shave is outstanding with no irration at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Also be sure to buy a blade sampler pack.</li>
            <li> It is very well made, has a great finish and works quite well.  </li>
            <li> Great shave highly recommend</li>
            <li> The chroming job is flawless and the handle is non slip even when your hands are wet or oily (from pre shave oil for example) or have shave cream on them.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used a safety razor, and I must admit that it is by far the best shave that I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> It was okay and is now used as my travel razor since this is my primary.  </li>
            <li> This helps with maintaining the right pressure since all I do is set the razor against the skin and let its own weight do the job.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d forgotten how easy it was to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> It is a fine razor and it may work for you.  </li>
            <li> The razor holds the blade fine.</li>
            <li> The handle unscrews from the head for disassembly making easy clean, and easy to change blades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic razor that is a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> These cost a bit more but are well worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> Great shaver, solid design, and material.</li>
            <li> This razor is a great razor for me just starting.</li>
            <li> Lastly, my face feels great with no razor burns.</li>
            <li> It is angled quite nicely; gives a very close shave without being overly aggressive.  </li>
            <li> , it is of the top quality that you would expect from this company, the design is very forgiven, but you can achieve a very close shave, I have been shaving my head for 36yrs, and this safety razor is incredible for that, and my face, it is built like it will last me for the rest of my life, love this</li>
            <li> If you are just getting started with DE razors and wet shaving, I think this would make an excellent first choice.  </li>
            <li> far i enjoy the \\&quot;luxery\\&quot; aspect here, but i mostly enjoy being able to control my shave more than i could with a fusion/mach/tracer etc.</li>
            <li> I love this razor gives a very close shave and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m bump free, my skin is feels super smooth afterwards and it doesn&#x27;t cause any ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> so I know what a true baby bottom smooth shave should feel like.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact my first use I had zero nicks, which is better than with the 5 blade which always nicked me.</li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect, but was thoroughly impressed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly higher priced than some of the classic entry models, but I feel this would be a great first razor...</li>
            <li> This razor matched what I could do with a straight razor, when I took two passes with the grain and one (very light) pass against the grain.</li>
            <li> The craftsmanship on this razor is without a doubt top notch and really motivates you to clean and buff the chrome after every shave.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good razor though.</li>
            <li> This performs just as well and much more reasonably.</li>
            <li> Construction wise, this seems as solid as any, so I rated the 3 stars.  </li>
            <li> I was told that the MÃ¼hle R89 would be a good starting razor.</li>
            <li> This thing reeks of cool and class.  </li>
            <li> I own and use about 6 high quality safety razors and this razor is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> For a mild shave, pair it with a Merkur razor blade.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a great daily user even if you like to mix in some straight or shavette on the weekends as well.</li>
            <li> It provides a close, smooth, consistent shave.</li>
            <li> My first DE razor!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been so excited to shave my face until I decided to purchase the Muhle R89</li>
            <li> i had no idea that this would be such an amazing shaving implement.</li>
            <li> I love the way the razor keepers have been designed to be nearly flush with the razor plate.</li>
            <li> The Muhle R89 is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> The sleek design paired with the quality, make this purchase worth the money.</li>
            <li> well worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I shave with a smile with this shaver.</li>
            <li> The complete system works better than the cartridges and their system.</li>
            <li> Between that &amp; the Muhle R89 Closed Comb, the 3-piece Muhle is a better razor, has better weight distribution, and is heavier.</li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive at first, but I&#x27;m really happy with my choice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a pretty large handle which makes it easy to handle for people with large hands like me.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product overall and good for a beginner to DE razor wet shaving.</li>
            <li> All blades react differently with different people and the razor you will need to try a few to see which one you love the best.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying there is anything wrong with this razor, it may well be among the best out there.</li>
            <li> so this the first time I shaved with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more for looks, than it is for providing extra grip.</li>
            <li> I first started using a Gillette DE safety razor over 50 years ago, had lots of nicks then, so went on to electrics and cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> One of my regular and favorite razors.</li>
            <li> Just a side, this is the first revue I have written for anything purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best ill never use anything else</li>
            <li> First time to use safety razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I switched from the standard disposable razors to this.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used a DE safety razor.</li>
            <li> This is a good, chunky, heavy razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it is a little more picky about the angle in which you hold it, this is not a bad thing though</li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> - This is a razor made for people with large hands.</li>
            <li> The investment is large at the beginning</li>
            <li> Only safety razor Iv ever used but it gets the job done fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine but the handle is too short for me.</li>
            <li> I come from the world of straight razors</li>
            <li> Razors are very much a personal fit type of hardware.  </li>
            <li> Very forgiving, non aggressive DE razors.</li>
            <li> The time saving is from not spending so much time trying to rinse the razor between strokes.</li>
            <li> After much research I arrived with the R89 as my choice.</li>
            <li> This is true, I barely pulled the razor, but rather let the weight of the razor do the work, but the razor is not fussy at all.</li>
            <li> A nice razor for everyday shaving.</li>
            <li> I am new to safety razors and I can honestly say I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product to any man looking to step up his grooming ritual.</li>
            <li> I am brand new to DE shaving and started out with the Microtouch One Classic Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> I can get as fast a shave and a cleaner shave lathering up the old way and shaving with this DE compared to whatever lube I used with cartridges.</li>
            <li> I shave my head and face daily and get really close with this, an alum block or styptic pencil handles the cuts pretty well, but my lack of experience probably increases their occurrence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was so easy that I actually went on and finished my entire face!</li>
            <li> Just shaved with my new Muhle R89 DE razor.</li>
            <li> This razor is just like most of what was written about it, but it so beyond my dreams of what a shave is suppose to be like, this is it, I won&#x27;t get technical about this other</li>
            <li> My husband wanted a smoother shave, I purchased this razor after I had given him Hot Shaves from a local barber...</li>
            <li> I paired it with a Personna Red blade and Truefitt and Hill 1805 shave cream and got a BSS the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been missing out on the best shave possible for the past 12 years!</li>
            <li> I have a very dense beard with thick, wiry hair, and when keeping all the other variable the same, this razor gives me a much more comfortable and closer shave than the Merkur.  </li>
            <li> I was told that the experience might be difficult and that it was important to use a light touch.</li>
            <li> so close and so soft...</li>
            <li> However, I cannot give 5 stars because the razor blade was completely bent when I received the package.</li>
            <li> There is no comparison between an old school DE shave and the over priced cartridge junk</li>
            <li> The knurling can get slick with shave cream or pre shave oil on your hands, but thats an easy fix.</li>
            <li> The cost is astounding less than 2 Euro for 10 blades, less than 2 Euro for the soap and the cream.</li>
            <li> It takes some practice and time to adapt to any new razor so don&#x27;t be discouraged if your first few shaves are less than stellar, soon you will naturally figure out what the razor wants (angle ect.)</li>
            <li> After much research, I found this razor to be a step above the others in the same price range.</li>
            <li> I have been in the army 15 years and finally decided to shave like an adult.</li>
            <li> It is much lighter than I expected and</li>
            <li> Its not too small, not too long, easy to grip (even when my hand is wet) and it shaves REALLY well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was willing to spend the extra cash for a reliable razor, that I hoped would last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> and I feel like it will produce less waste and give me better</li>
            <li> The Edwin Jagger DE89 is the exact same razor as the Muhle R89, but $15 less.</li>
            <li> But potential buyers should be aware that they can purchase an equivalent Edwin Jagger razor, with exactly the same head, for roughly HALF the price (give or take a little).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving</li>
            <li> have all been good but have also been bad for my skin.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re a newbie forget about putting a new Feather blade in it until you have your technique down.</li>
            <li> I recommend this, if you can live with a little old-fashioned low tech.</li>
            <li> I was new to DE shavers and purchased a few before getting this one.</li>
            <li> This is the first safety razor I have ever owned, so it&#x27;s not fair to compare anything regarding the operation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Muhle Closed Comb Double Edge Safety Razor, R89 for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> It definitely takes patients and a careful hand</li>
            <li> expect to keep this razor for a very long time.</li>
            <li> though, I prefer a heavy handle, it&#x27;s simply a matter of personal preference.  </li>
            <li> I have just bought the MÃ¼hle R89 after being disappointed by an electric razor that did not shave very close and was starting to be fussy in its old age (5yrs old...).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a three-part razor, which means that it&#x27;s a little more difficult to switch out blades, but on the other hand, soap and gunk can&#x27;t get into the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the key with the Muhle R89 is the closed comb design and its less aggressive blade angle.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift (I asked for it) and it has been everything I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> - It&#x27;s a matter of personal preference of course, and I like my razors on the heavy side.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49 and have used everything from multi bladed disposables, electrics, and in the last few years a Mach3.  </li>
            <li> Does not slip in hand when wet.</li>
            <li> ZERO regrets.</li>
            <li> The knurle handle design keeps it from slipping from my hands when shaving.</li>
            <li> He gets a closer shave that seems to last a little longer than other razors.</li>
            <li> I feel like when I compare this razor to my other safety razors</li>
            <li> I had gone away from a manual razor due to the skin irritation that I felt after the shaving was over, but i missed the closeness of the manual shave.</li>
            <li> Same razor as the Jack Black (this company makes them) at less than half the price.</li>
            <li> As a black man in the military</li>
            <li> I even hope to pass it down to my son someday..</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the knurling on the handle has little to no texture.</li>
            <li> It is actually not much more difficult than using a modern disposable razor</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to</li>
            <li> the handle could stand to be a little longer</li>
            <li> Took just a little getting use to</li>
            <li> I watched a few videos online on how to shave with one of these</li>
            <li> this razor, watch a few videos on how to use it.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with another DE razor for the past 6 months</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got small hands you might find it a tad unwieldly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is not a better one in the market.  </li>
            <li> I used the Dorco ST300 Platinum razor blade, which came with the Microtouch One razor and which was used for 4 past shaves.</li>
            <li> The comb was, in my view, extremely closed, almost to the point of being useless.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars because my beard is thick and</li>
            <li> I was a 5 blade cartridge guy who got tired of being raped every time I needed to buy replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that no blades were included and</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this razor gives a very close shave and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE razor. I can&#x27;t imagine going back to cartridges!</li>
            <li> Wonderful tool great stepping stone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying there is anything wrong with this razor, it may well be among the best out there. But potential buyers should be aware that they can purchase an equivalent Edwin Jagger razor, with exactly the same head, for roughly HALF the price (give or take a little). Just doesnt make sense to not go with the Edwin Jagger instead.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift (I asked for it) and it has been everything I expected it to be. When you buy a $55 razor you are getting just that, a $55 razor. The craftsmanship on this razor is without a doubt top notch and really motivates you to clean and buff the chrome after every shave. I love the way the razor keepers have been designed to be nearly flush with the razor plate. You can tell this isn&#x27;t just some walmart pile of junk, this is german engineering at it&#x27;s best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave itself: I come from the world of straight razors so I know what a true baby bottom smooth shave should feel like. This razor matched what I could do with a straight razor, when I took two passes with the grain and one (very light) pass against the grain. That being said I didn&#x27;t so this the first time I shaved with it. I have been shaving with another DE razor for the past 6 months so I had to learn what this razor likes and what my face likes. It takes some practice and time to adapt to any new razor so don&#x27;t be discouraged if your first few shaves are less than stellar, soon you will naturally figure out what the razor wants (angle ect.) and you wont even have to think about it. I feel like when I compare this razor to my other safety razors, it is a little more picky about the angle in which you hold it, this is not a bad thing though because that angle shaves my beard really nicely, it&#x27;s just something to keep in mind. Best of luck!</li>
            <li> Only safety razor Iv ever used but it gets the job done fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine but the handle is too short for me.</li>
            <li> This razor will give the same excellent shave as an Edwin Jagger (identical head). My only complaint is that the knurling on the handle has little to no texture. It&#x27;s more for looks, than it is for providing extra grip. Overall, a good razor though.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband...leaves a nice smooth shave and great look with no razor bumps or ingrown hairs. He loves it! Takes a little getting used to but we like it. Thank you</li>
            <li> This is the first safety razor I have ever owned, so it&#x27;s not fair to compare anything regarding the operation.  However, the appearance and quality of this product is second to none.  I am very happy with this, and would definitely purchase more products from Muhle.</li>
            <li> Have used it for a week now, perfect shave, haven&#x27;t gotten a nick yet. I think the key with the Muhle R89 is the closed comb design and its less aggressive blade angle. I first started using a Gillette DE safety razor over 50 years ago, had lots of nicks then, so went on to electrics and cartridge razors. But I became disillusioned with them, and especially the stratospheric prices recently. This performs just as well and much more reasonably. I also got it with the Muhle plastic blade guard, for when I travel. I recommend this, if you can live with a little old-fashioned low tech.</li>
            <li> Razors are very much a personal fit type of hardware.  What works best for one person, is not so good for another.  For me, this razor did not work at all.  The comb was, in my view, extremely closed, almost to the point of being useless.  Construction wise, this seems as solid as any, so I rated the 3 stars.  It is a fine razor and it may work for you.  It did not work well for me.</li>
            <li> One of my regular and favorite razors. Very forgiving, non aggressive DE razors. Excellent balance and the head is very well made. The chroming job is flawless and the handle is non slip even when your hands are wet or oily (from pre shave oil for example) or have shave cream on them. The British may make the best brushes, but the Germans make the best razors for sure. Outstanding product overall and good for a beginner to DE razor wet shaving. I also own the Muehle R89 twist and a Merkur Futur adjustable and a Merkur Slant Barberpole. All outstanding products.</li>
            <li> This is a good, chunky, heavy razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD - It&#x27;s beautifully made, very high quality. It looks the part and does the job. It&#x27;s a three-part razor, which means that it&#x27;s a little more difficult to switch out blades, but on the other hand, soap and gunk can&#x27;t get into the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHUNKY - This is a razor made for people with large hands. It&#x27;s got a pretty large handle which makes it easy to handle for people with large hands like me. If you&#x27;ve got small hands you might find it a tad unwieldly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HEAVY - It&#x27;s a matter of personal preference of course, and I like my razors on the heavy side. This helps with maintaining the right pressure since all I do is set the razor against the skin and let its own weight do the job.</li>
            <li> One of the best shaver money can buy. I have been using this over 6 months and must admit it was a great purchase. I was new to DE shavers and purchased a few before getting this one. I must reckon that this is the best affordable razor for someone new to DE shaving and the finish, feel and weight is accurate. If you can I would suggest buy the one with the longer handle.</li>
            <li> I have just bought the MÃ¼hle R89 after being disappointed by an electric razor that did not shave very close and was starting to be fussy in its old age (5yrs old...).  I was told that the MÃ¼hle R89 would be a good starting razor. i had no idea that this would be such an amazing shaving implement. I do not remember ever getting this close a shave either with a multi blade razor or an electric razor. There is no irritation of the skin with the Monsavon shaving soap complemented with Palmolive shaving cream. Not even a nick, with 3 passes the result is astounding, so close and so soft... I had gone away from a manual razor due to the skin irritation that I felt after the shaving was over, but i missed the closeness of the manual shave. I decided to try the traditional safety razor route. The MÃ¼hle R89 did not disappoint me.   I was told that the experience might be difficult and that it was important to use a light touch. This is true, I barely pulled the razor, but rather let the weight of the razor do the work, but the razor is not fussy at all. Maybe the combination of the MÃ¼hle R89 with Gillette Bleues blades was the key. The cost is astounding less than 2 Euro for 10 blades, less than 2 Euro for the soap and the cream. I have found a keeper! Closest shave of my life for the lowest cost of my life. Who knew?</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:800b67f227317867c8525f87431ae6d0]] The Muhle R89 safety razor is a three-piece safety razor with some grooves along the handle.  For a mild shave, pair it with a Merkur razor blade.  For a moderate shave use a Gillette Platinum razor blade.  For an aggressive shave use some Feather razor blades.</li>
            <li> This razor feels good, has nice weight. The handle unscrews from the head for disassembly making easy clean, and easy to change blades.</li>
            <li> Is like the specifications, so good safety</li>
            <li> I own and use about 6 high quality safety razors and this razor is by far my favorite. The Edwin Jagger DE89 is the exact same razor as the Muhle R89, but $15 less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been missing out on the best shave possible for the past 12 years! As a black man in the military I  have tried EVERYTHING!&lt;br /&gt;-Disposable razors&lt;br /&gt;-1, 2, 3, 4, 5 blades&lt;br /&gt;- Magic Shave&lt;br /&gt;- Electric razors of all kind&lt;br /&gt;- Clippers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have all been good but have also been bad for my skin. I&#x27;ve been using this safety razor for 1 month and I&#x27;m bump free, my skin is feels super smooth afterwards and it doesn&#x27;t cause any ingrown hairs. I will eventually buy another safety razor once I&#x27;m officially a pro.</li>
            <li> I have this razor and two vintage ones. The Muhle R89 is by far my favorite. It provides a close, smooth, consistent shave. It&#x27;s a fantastic razor that is a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> Great quality, cuts very well. Expensive yes but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> my husband loves this razor it seems he enjoys shaving with it sorry for not posting sooner thank you again</li>
            <li> Good weight; well constructed. Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> I am new to safety razors and I can honestly say I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing. The investment is large at the beginning but I just bought another pack of blades for 5.00. Great shave, great savings!</li>
            <li> These cost a bit more but are well worth the cost.  More stable and great quality.  There is not a better one in the market.  Same razor as the Jack Black (this company makes them) at less than half the price.</li>
            <li> Great safety razor. Feels nice and weighted in my hand. Give a perfect close shave.</li>
            <li> This razor is just like most of what was written about it, but it so beyond my dreams of what a shave is suppose to be like, this is it, I won&#x27;t get technical about this other then too say it rides the contour of your face like velvet, it is of the top quality that you would expect from this company, the design is very forgiven, but you can achieve a very close shave, I have been shaving my head for 36yrs, and this safety razor is incredible for that, and my face, it is built like it will last me for the rest of my life, love this you will too, I have big hands, and no problem, definitivel,  5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49 and have used everything from multi bladed disposables, electrics, and in the last few years a Mach3.  This is the first time I have ever used a safety razor, and I must admit that it is by far the best shave that I have ever had.  This is a wonderful razor with great weight and a comfortable feel. Even for my bigger hands. Planning in purchasing one for my father-in-law soon. Just a side, this is the first revue I have written for anything purchased on Amazon. This razor is that nice.</li>
            <li> Close shave, just some getting used to...</li>
            <li> The sleek design paired with the quality, make this purchase worth the money. I was a little disappointed that no blades were included and the handle could stand to be a little longer but if you&#x27;re looking for a quality shave, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted a smoother shave, I purchased this razor after I had given him Hot Shaves from a local barber...he loves to shave his face now!</li>
            <li> Great razor, very smooth shave and it saves a lot of money</li>
            <li> The razor holds the blade fine. Good angle, weight adequate.</li>
            <li> Worked amazing and huge difference! Had to buy a second one!</li>
            <li> Fit and finish are great.  Does not slip in hand when wet. Great shave highly recommend</li>
            <li> One of the best shave I got. Good built razor for the money.</li>
            <li> Works great. Simple and easy to use. Gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> Prior to owning this razor I was using a butterfly open Parker.  It was okay and is now used as my travel razor since this is my primary.  Love the look and feel of it.  Provides a close shave (I&#x27;ve used sharks, persons, and the one Muhle blade that came with it).  This thing reeks of cool and class.  I love the way it looks with the matching brush and stand which were part of the set I was given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great daily user even if you like to mix in some straight or shavette on the weekends as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best ill never use anything else&lt;br /&gt;I wish I hade of bought on 30 years ago&lt;br /&gt;I would have saved me thousands and I would have gotten a much better shave</li>
            <li> Same shaving head as the Edwin Jagger 89, just different handle. why pay twice the price? get the Edwin Jagger. Why not five stars, because nothings perfect.</li>
            <li> I was willing to spend the extra cash for a reliable razor, that I hoped would last me a very long time. I was a little apprehensive at first, but I&#x27;m really happy with my choice. Its not too small, not too long, easy to grip (even when my hand is wet) and it shaves REALLY well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect to keep this razor for a very long time. I even hope to pass it down to my son someday.. well worth the buy. ZERO regrets.</li>
            <li> Switching to DE safety razor shaving was the best decision I&#x27;ve ever made for my skin. After much research, I found this razor to be a step above the others in the same price range.</li>
            <li> My first DE razor!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been so excited to shave my face until I decided to purchase the Muhle R89</li>
            <li> Well crafted and works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Muhle Closed Comb Double Edge Safety Razor, R89 for 2 weeks and it has exceeded my expectations. I paired it with a Personna Red blade and Truefitt and Hill 1805 shave cream and got a BSS the first time I used it. I&#x27;m new to wet shaving but I know I will never go back to cartridge shaving ever again!</li>
            <li> Great shaver, solid design, and material. I shave with a smile with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I have been in the army 15 years and finally decided to shave like an adult. This razor is a great razor for me just starting. It is beautiful out of the box. The handle provides enough grip while shaving and the razor seems to be well balance. The weight feels great in your hands. I plan to have this razor for many years.</li>
            <li> Great product, works very good with no issue</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor for my husband and he loves it. He gets a closer shave that seems to last a little longer than other razors.</li>
            <li> The handle is a beautiful piece of craftsmanship. However, I cannot give 5 stars because the razor blade was completely bent when I received the package.</li>
            <li> This is the highest quality DE razor I have researched and purchased. The design, machining and finish are top quality.</li>
            <li> After researching razors, I purchased this razor for my husband.  Its well constructed and of good quality.  It&#x27;s fits well in his hand and balanced.  Word of caution..It definitely takes patients and a careful hand otherwise you will butcher your face like my husband did. There is definitely a learning curve.  But once mastered, you&#x27;ll have the closest shave ever!</li>
            <li> My husband loves how close of a shave he gets with this razor!</li>
            <li> First time to use safety razor. I love look and style of it. Took just a little getting use to but now love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I switched from the standard disposable razors to this. It has lots of weight to it - I feel like I&#x27;m using a well made tool. It is actually not much more difficult than using a modern disposable razor and I feel like it will produce less waste and give me better shaves. I will update when I have used it more.</li>
            <li> This is my first DE, but the construction is flawless, the razor is well machined and feels great in the hand. The knurling can get slick with shave cream or pre shave oil on your hands, but thats an easy fix. I shave my head and face daily and get really close with this, an alum block or styptic pencil handles the cuts pretty well, but my lack of experience probably increases their occurrence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a derby blade but i have been using wilkinson sword blades- $1.76 before taxes for a 10-pack at walmart. I have shaved both head and face twice on one and think i might be at the end of that blades life. A lot of blade reviews talk about 3-5 face shaves so i guess thats on par.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far i enjoy the \\&quot;luxery\\&quot; aspect here, but i mostly enjoy being able to control my shave more than i could with a fusion/mach/tracer etc.</li>
            <li> Way better than my hinged/butterfly safety razor. No bumps/ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Finally can shave regularly without issues. Something people need to mention more often is to keep in mind it&#x27;s part of a shaving system. The complete system works better than the cartridges and their system.</li>
            <li> I am brand new to DE shaving and started out with the Microtouch One Classic Safety Razor. Between that &amp; the Muhle R89 Closed Comb, the 3-piece Muhle is a better razor, has better weight distribution, and is heavier. The knurle handle design keeps it from slipping from my hands when shaving. I used the Dorco ST300 Platinum razor blade, which came with the Microtouch One razor and which was used for 4 past shaves. You would not believe what a close shave the Muhle gave me still! I swear, one pass ATG; and my face was BBS! I could only get BBS with the Microtouch with multiple passes. Also, I did not get one knick on my face whereas I would always get one knick after each shave with the Microtouch. Lastly, my face feels great with no razor burns. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Just shaved with my new Muhle R89 DE razor. This is the first time I have ever used a DE safety razor. What a remarkable experience! I had planned on just shaving the checks to get the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of the blade and technique. It was so easy that I actually went on and finished my entire face! Closest, non-aggressive shave that I have ever had and on only one pass! . I used the  Muhle R89, included Muhle blade, l&#x27;occitane soap, and Kent brush, No cuts or burns. Highly recommend this product to any man looking to step up his grooming ritual.</li>
            <li> A great starter/everyday razor.  It gives a wonderful shave with two passes.  Nice fit and finish for the price and well made.</li>
            <li> Best shave in years, like a lot of us who started shaving before the multi-blade cartridge craze, I&#x27;d forgotten how easy it was to get a close shave. I&#x27;ve gone back and forth with mug brush and soap, canned, and lotion-cream using cartridges. I can get as fast a shave and a cleaner shave lathering up the old way and shaving with this DE compared to whatever lube I used with cartridges. The time saving is from not spending so much time trying to rinse the razor between strokes. My wife likes the fact that I tend to shave more often, because of the time and comfort factors.</li>
            <li> A nice razor for everyday shaving. It doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars because my beard is thick and this razor I would put in the &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; category. Excellent for a beginner though because it is a forgiving razor and will allow beginners to skip the &amp;#34;alum block&amp;#34; section most of the time. Just remember to do your pre-shave ritual each time you use it. if you&#x27;re a newbie forget about putting a new Feather blade in it until you have your technique down. I could see where this razor could be the only razor a person will ever need, depending on beard coarseness.</li>
            <li> I was a 5 blade cartridge guy who got tired of being raped every time I needed to buy replacement cartridges. Someone suggested going &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; with a DE or safety razor. After much research I arrived with the R89 as my choice. I watched a few videos online on how to shave with one of these and now I&#x27;m hooked. There is no comparison between an old school DE shave and the over priced cartridge junk most of us have grown up shaving with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this razor, watch a few videos on how to use it. You will not kill yourself with it. As a matter of fact my first use I had zero nicks, which is better than with the 5 blade which always nicked me. Additionally, the closeness of the shave is outstanding with no irration at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be sure to buy a blade sampler pack. All blades react differently with different people and the razor you will need to try a few to see which one you love the best. For me the gilette silver/blue blades work best, but you need to try for yourself to be,sure.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!! Perfect!!</li>
            <li> I am quite impressed with this razor.  I was not sure what to expect, but was thoroughly impressed.  It is very well made, has a great finish and works quite well.  It is much lighter than I expected and though, I prefer a heavy handle, it&#x27;s simply a matter of personal preference.  It is angled quite nicely; gives a very close shave without being overly aggressive.  It is very similar in shape to the Merkur 34C, but it doesn&#x27;t feel quite as aggressive.  I have a very dense beard with thick, wiry hair, and when keeping all the other variable the same, this razor gives me a much more comfortable and closer shave than the Merkur.  If you are just getting started with DE razors and wet shaving, I think this would make an excellent first choice.  It&#x27;s slightly higher priced than some of the classic entry models, but I feel this would be a great first razor... well worth the money.</li>
