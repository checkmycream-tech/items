            <li>I brought this for a co-worker because she loved how I smelled when we were in the elevator together :-).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s warm and vanilla-y with hints of sweetness.</li>
            <li>and I asked for it on a \\&quot;strip\\&quot; card that I could carry around to see if I liked it.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite perfumes that I tried out &amp; bought years ago on a whim, and have LOVED using it ever since.</li>
            <li>Whenever we would go out I would borrow it, so I figured it was time to get my own.</li>

            <li>Thanks 4 the best delivery prices and sellers 😉👍</li>
            <li>Fancy smells of warm caramel, vanilla &amp; a candle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if it is some kind of knockoff or something.</li>
            <li>It would be a Perfect gift and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>and I could have gotten the real thing/longer magnificent smell.</li>
            <li>Its always my go to perfume just for going to the store or a nice night out.</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume for my daughters birthday, I liked the fragrance</li>
            <li>Its has a nice musky, floral scent.  </li>

            <li>It is also priced nicely.</li>
            <li>The real one lasts ALL DAY and it has a very strong and wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard some argue it&#x27;s a full &#x27;winter&#x27; scent because of how warm it is, but I think it could also could be a great Fall and Spring scent.    </li>
            <li>,I was greatly pleased that my package arrived in good condition,nd to top it</li>
            <li>Loved it I&#x27;ve used for years and was so happy to find on line much cheaper than in stores.</li>
            <li>Starts off good then the final smell is Amazing!!!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still smelling good without being too over powering or strong.</li>
            <li>Great pricing, fast shipping, good quality product.</li>
            <li>It is very strong</li>
            <li>To me, it smells like a much more toned-town (daytime) version of Benefit&#x27;s Something About Sofia, and that is my favorite scent of all time!</li>
            <li>This has a wonderful soft scent &amp; Amazon has it for 1/3 of the department stores!  </li>
            <li>My ex told me the first thing he noticed about me was how good I smelled so I can thank Jessica Simpson for that!</li>
            <li>The product came quick, smells delicious and the scent is sweet and mellow.</li>
            <li>This perfume goes on light and fruity but settles to a beautiful, rich, warm scent.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to the smell of a lot of perfumes so was very happy to find one that I not only liked</li>
            <li>,it smells clean and verry freshy,I always get good complements about it...</li>

            <li>It smells great, a light sweet scent like you just stepped out of the shower.</li>

            <li>Compared to this, Fancy LOve doesn&#x27;t even have a scent.</li>
            <li>Alluring floral femininity comes from the heart of this fragrance with the captivating draw of dewy Gardenia laced with the delicacy of Night Blooming Jasmine.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this, but did it make anyone else break out on their neck?</li>
            <li>so as much as I love the smell, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this perfume.</li>

            <li>Really amazing, but for someone who like really sweet perfums..</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and goes a long way.</li>

            <li>Fast shipping, huge bottle, great price.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this beautiful spray many many times in different stores from $60 and up.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unless you like very sweet fragrances</li>
            <li>not what the reviews said does not last at all or smell very good</li>
            <li>Fancy smells very fresh, clean, and kind of floral.</li>
            <li>On my skin it&#x27;s mostly caramel over vanilla and light floral, very sweet.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I am a huge fan of Fancy Love, and figured I&#x27;d give this one a try.</li>
            <li>It stays sweet, but to my nose, in the best way possible.  </li>
            <li>I bought this perfume because it was cheap and Amazon recommended it to me because I love Britney Spears&#x27; perfumes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy this lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li>What I love the most is that it starts off smelling like some sweet candy</li>
            <li>When I first sprayed it on I liked it, but wasn&#x27;t sure it lived up to all the hype I read about it.</li>
            <li>The price is perfect and delivery is always received before expected or on time.  </li>
            <li>With a mixture of berries, orange blossom, and jasmine, it has a great mixture of fruity and floral; it&#x27;s fruity, lightly sweet, and most importantly, made from real ingredients.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, provides long lasting scent, beautiful bottle.  </li>
            <li>She liked it right away</li>
            <li>perfume is pretty, sweet (just right), long-lasting, not overpowering, very pleasant, when I say &#x27;sweet&#x27;</li>
            <li>Came wrapped in original packaging and the bottle is HUGE!</li>
            <li>The super strong alcohol/vanilla gives me a headache!</li>
            <li>Creamy Sandalwood is united with embracing warmth of Vanilla Crème and infused with the sensual energy of Amber Crystals, rounding out the many unique layers of the fragrance and its inspiration...</li>
            <li>Love the fresh smell!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the full size too!</li>
            <li>A sweet, girly fragrance that I always get compliments when wearing!</li>
            <li>I just love the clean smell and so does my husband</li>
            <li>Shipping was very quick and packed well.</li>
            <li>very mild vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>It smells really strongly of alcohol.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t overpowering and strong like a night scent.</li>
            <li>When I sprayed it on a scarf the scent was so strong</li>
            <li>The fragrance isnt that strong either.</li>
            <li>It smells so strongly of baby powder</li>
            <li>I have had so many guys ask me what it is because they want to get it for their wives and so many women just walk right up and ask me what perfume I have on because they have to get it immediately.</li>
            <li>like I smell amazing, but I have consistently received compliments on it from men.</li>
            <li>When i opened the bottled the smell was sweet but crisper and slightly more woodsy than i was expecting based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li>It stayed on for most of the day, was not overpowering, and was a sweet, youthful scent.</li>
            <li>The scent is so refreshing, sweet and floral.</li>
            <li>My mom liked to much!</li>
            <li>Smells like sweet candy :)</li>
            <li>If you like a \\&quot;fruity vanilla\\&quot; scent, you&#x27;d be much better off saving your pennies (or ask Santa) and buying Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy- fruity yet sweet.  </li>
            <li>and there is just fine.</li>
            <li>&quot; that they have created, that&#x27;s fine with me - it&#x27;s their life.  </li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but had to since I am very happy with my purchase :)</li>
            <li>intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of its strong fruity nature is smells like one of those cheap perfumes&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light not too strong..</li>
            <li>I was very surprised it smell so good.</li>
            <li>I was excited to smell this because of the rave reviews and also because I imagined anything from Jessica Simpson would be very sweet and feminine.  </li>
            <li>I still like the smell very much as it is a very clean sweet smelling scent.</li>
            <li>Order this one, you don&#x27;t really have anything to lose, and Amazon&#x27;s price on this one is really outstanding!</li>
            <li>I would be happy to get this as a gift every single year :)</li>
            <li>Wonderful company, have referred a few friends to your online store to find cheap fragrance deals.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of anything Jessica Simpson.</li>
            <li>Huge bottle.</li>

            <li>I bought the product because I enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li>Love it.. Smells fresh and makes you feel girly</li>
            <li>her Dessert line was a FABULOUS IDEA..</li>
            <li>Amazon offerred at such a great price that I could not resist.</li>
            <li>It is light, neutral yet feminine scent.</li>
            <li>great Christmas present.</li>
            <li>but it feel so cheap and chemical that give me a headache.</li>
            <li>Great scent and it last all day.</li>
            <li>Such a great value.</li>
            <li>** uh... it is a cheap perfume...</li>
            <li>There is nothing interesting about this fragrance alone; it is about as intriguing as the vanilla scented candles you can find in every store ever.</li>
            <li>The product description actually does a great job in describing the fragrance.</li>
            <li>When I got the perfume it looked genuine since it was in a sealed box</li>
            <li>Got this perfume for really cheap</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a reason it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>Its very creamy and warm.</li>
            <li>It looks great sitting on my dresser too and just overall</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s what I get for being cheap.</li>
            <li>Not only that, but the bottle itself is quite attractive and looks well sitting on my dresser.</li>
            <li>Smelled cheap and watery.  </li>
            <li>$24.99 was such a great price for this perfume.  </li>
            <li>It made me a but light headed to even wear this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Will probably last until this Christmas, lol.</li>
            <li>I enjoy Fancy, have lots of complements on it.</li>
            <li>I ordered Fancy as well as Fancy Love because I thought I loved them equally</li>
            <li>There are many reviews claiming that this perfume is super sweet smelling and smells like cupcakes.  </li>
            <li>The smell was to strong and so sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>Sweet and strong  </li>
            <li>Shipping is fast too!!!</li>
            <li>She says it smells clean and fresh and makes her feel lovely.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how Amazon can give us such great bargains, but I&#x27;m glad they do, and I&#x27;m happy to save the money to spend on other things!    </li>
            <li>It came in the original box and is a huge bottle for the price.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this fragrance if you like a sweet scent at a great price.</li>
            <li>I like this perfume but let me tell you the smell is SUPER strong.</li>
            <li>I love it, and came super fast!!</li>
            <li>a try will love it and the scent is great for all age ranges, young as 16 and old as 100.</li>
            <li>I originally bought &#x27;Fancy&#x27; after smelling a sample vial.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this fragrance and the price was unbelievable and she  was very happy.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed...</li>
            <li>When I first got this perfume, I wasn&#x27;t sure how I felt about it.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments (from random men) on how great this stuff smells! :)</li>
            <li>It has a light, airy vanilla scent that is not too sweet.  </li>
            <li>so I was so excited.  </li>
            <li>Beyond excited for this purchase.</li>
            <li>The bottle is just so pretty and elegant looking.</li>
            <li>Plus the bottle looks pretty in my bathroom :)</li>
            <li>I first tried this scent on at Macy&#x27;s and fell in love with it, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $59.00.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to wear it, but when I sprayed it on it didn&#x27;t smell anything like what I tried at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>First time to order this, I love it.</li>
            <li>A floaral, light, sweet smell.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t smell like the original Jessica Simpson</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve NEVER in my life have smelled such a perfect creamy, sweet, romantic, sexy perfume---all in one--until I smelled THIS.    </li>
            <li>These is a very fun, flirty, and sweet scent.</li>
            <li>But, if this fragrance works for you, its a huge bottle &amp; the smell tends to last a while, good luck.</li>
            <li>when you catch this on sale you cant beat it, my girl is in love with this scent, its real and cheap ...</li>
            <li>This is eligible for Free Super Saver Shipping, &amp; I clicked that option.</li>
            <li>I have to say that this is by far one of my most favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li>Well, I am a mature woman, love Fancy, and have received many compliments when wearing it.  </li>
            <li>This is by far one of my favorite perfumes!</li>
            <li>Which I quickly looked over, but I should of paid more attention to it because that&#x27;s exactly what it smelled like..</li>
            <li>This item shipped fast and was packaged very securely.</li>
            <li>This perfume is great it is warm, and subtle like a brown sugar and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Some women do not like overly sweet scents (like Aquolina-Pink Sugar--although I love that one too--but not as much as this)..    </li>
            <li>I love sweet fragrances, but this one really disappoint me, yes</li>
            <li>the perfume smell great,its sweet but not overly sweet like candy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet without being overly sweet.</li>
            <li>However, you will have to see for yourself whether or not you will love it just as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I am also a fan of sweet perfumes.</li>
            <li>It is a foody type fragrance but nothing too sweet that it made my stomach hurt or gave me a headache.</li>
            <li>This Perfume is certainly different, but not in a good way.</li>
            <li>(ladies - it&#x27;s a scientifically proven fact that men prefer sweet smells like donuts, pumpkin pie and vanilla to ALL floral scents).</li>
            <li>I do get more of that woodsy note, and they also are much fruitier.    </li>
            <li>After spending a good hour or so at the perfume counter of Dillards, I finally found a match for me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not too candy/girly sweet smelling.  </li>
            <li>Sweet scent like candy</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who likes sweet scents.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sweet caramel</li>
            <li>What I love about Jessica Simpson is, her products r very affordable...</li>
            <li>It has a nice soft scent that others can smell, but I can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It has a sweet vanilla smell.</li>
            <li>I got it on as I as typing, this is so sweet</li>
            <li>One bottle lasts a while because one spray, arms length away, is good enough for all day wear.</li>
            <li>How cool is that.</li>
            <li>its so sweet  , like a vainilla</li>
            <li>Everything was packaged properly and it smells SO GOOD.</li>
            <li>scent is sweet but not over-wheeling,</li>
            <li>I will go to Macy&#x27;s and pay full price, if I can even find it.</li>
            <li>and then you start to smell a sweet scent.</li>
            <li>The powdery scent doesn&#x27;t disappear after you start smelling the sweet scent and the sweet scent isn&#x27;t overbearing either.</li>
            <li>Instead of the sweet caramel, vanilla notes everyone else notices</li>
            <li>, I get a sort of rotten fruit odour, something sweet but with</li>
            <li>All of Jessica Simpson&#x27;s perfumes seem to do this on me (which is a shame as I also have and really wanted to love [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet but not in your face sweet</li>
            <li>Good price, smell last all day</li>
            <li>Thanks for this opportunity for being able to express my thoughts and opinions in regards to this product.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume so much because I can&#x27;t stand those perfumes that smell literally like trees</li>
            <li>it smells so sweet.</li>
            <li>it smells sweet.</li>
            <li>So if your not into sweet scents I wouldnt recommend this one.</li>
            <li>Its sweet, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>If you have a sweet tooth (like I do)</li>
            <li>However, that being said, it is a lovely scent that really cannot be described.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too sweet for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy with lots of cologne and have smelled lots of perfume and this is not deserving of all the nearly perfect reviews on amazon.  </li>
            <li>its sweet and flowery but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a Perfume that has an Apricot/Nectarine smell and was on the sweeter side without being sickeningly sweet.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of sweet perfumes, I love paris hilton (black stripes) and ralph lauren (light blue box) and I think they´re perfect...</li>
            <li>The best way I can describe it is YUMMY, and I usually reserve that word and enthusiasm for cupcakes and cake-pops!</li>
            <li>This is not at all super sweet like Fantasy, which some might prefer.  </li>
            <li>When you first spray it, it&#x27;s alittle strong.</li>
            <li>Buy this..and you will smell yourself all day long in a happy, sweet vanilla bliss of a soft dessert. :)</li>
            <li>Great sent that works with other lotions and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>and it sounds like it&#x27;s great on other people.</li>
            <li>, when you first spray it on.&lt;br /&gt;-it goes away after awhile (and starts to smell good) but the perfume barely lingers on you by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;-the paint on the bottle even started chipping throughout continued use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>However when using it I quickly realized it was not the perfume I was used</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>This smell is absolutely wonderful, it makes me feel &#x27;pretty&#x27; and not many fragrances can do that.</li>
            <li>for the great communication and fast shipping ,Definitely will be ordering one soon because mine is done .</li>
            <li>you guys really were right on point, I love the way my Product was packaged and  </li>
            <li>I have to say I am not much of a Jessica Simpson fan, but her perfume is amazing!</li>
            <li>This perfume smells very pretty.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more than I can say for another favored Gucci brand (even more expensive).</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but I prefer other perfume better.</li>
            <li>More than any other perfume I own.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have normally chosen something Jessica Simpson, but I love it.</li>
            <li>AND IT WAS VERY REASONABLE VERSUS BUYING AT A DEPARTMENT STORE!</li>
            <li>I think I purchased the wrong kind... but good price!</li>
            <li>THIS is my favorite perfume in the whole world (so far)..:)    </li>
            <li>Sweet but fresh and floral.  </li>
            <li>Very light and can pretty much wear it in any season.</li>
            <li>Its feminine and not too strong - just the right amount for someone that wants to be noticed!</li>
            <li>Has become my new favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>On top of it...it was deliver in three business days and was in new condition - not tampered with.</li>
            <li>I doesn&#x27;t smell as genuine and sweet as the real stuff.</li>
            <li>I smelled it and thought it was a bit sweet at first, but oh my... it&#x27;s sweet in a sensually explosive manner.</li>
            <li>Such a nice hint of vanilla and sweet without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>This is what I expected and I will continue to buy it from now on ...very pleasant smell</li>
            <li>Very soft &amp;amp; sexy</li>
            <li>I walked around the store smelling it constantly and just fell in LOVE!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>A great gourmand fragrance, I first sprayed it on my boyfriend because I was already wearing a perfume, and perceived a strong fruity smell, I was not sure if I was going to like it because it was a blind buy, but after 20 mins or so, I smelled a beautiful, warm, feminine caramel scent.</li>
            <li>I would describe this perfume as very pretty, feminine, elegant and classy.</li>
            <li>It is not overpowering, but has a nice, light scent that is still noticeable enough to get some positive attention.</li>
            <li>While pleasant in small doses, it is incredibly sweet and gets overwhelming and cloying really fast.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this to any woman who wants a sophisticated sweet scent with a touch of vanilla and floral.</li>
            <li>smell last and is amazing...</li>
            <li>Smells amazing; especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Now, I don&#x27;t know if any of you are Bath and Body Works fans, but I&#x27;m a huge one and the closest thing I can compare this to is Forever Sunshine which is actually one of my favorite BABW scents.</li>
            <li>is far better than instores.</li>
            <li>To me, comes off as a woodsy smell, but nice overall.</li>
            <li>but Fancy is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>so the price is really worth it.</li>
            <li>It was worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It has a soft and lovely smell to it</li>
            <li>My wife and daughter loved this perfume but haven&#x27;t been able to find it locally lately.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>well worth it</li>
            <li>I finally decided to buy a bottle for myself and my mom loved it so much that I ended up buying one for her through this seller.</li>
            <li>It has a soft and lovely smell to it</li>
            <li>It is a cross between baby powder and some kind of fruity body spray.</li>
            <li>Covered in what looks like golden chrysanthemums.  </li>
            <li>I should have known by the price, but felt it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast as well!</li>
            <li>Sweet like your favorite dessert but also a little interesting.</li>
            <li>like this product it smells nice on older women as well as the young.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was that good as other reviewers were claiming.</li>
            <li>It last a long time and it smells very good.</li>
            <li>She def gave it the right name...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing it right now</li>
            <li>I got online right away and order Fancy.</li>
            <li>It is right up there to with dolce &amp; gabbanna the one.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t smell right.</li>
            <li>In similar fragrances I love that are on the sweet side</li>
            <li>However, I love overly sweet scents such as Britney Spears&#x27; Fantasy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet without being too sweet or little girly, yet also has a nice sandalwood vanilla scent with some floral thrown in.</li>
            <li>I seemed an excellent gift for only thirteen dollars, I buy this on black Friday and the smell is provocative</li>
            <li>Better bottle than I expected also the scent stays on you but isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>It is a pefect everyday kind of smell...not too strong....</li>
            <li>And quit honestly I have bought many of Jessica Simpson shoes and they are the most uncomfortable shoes ever.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell as sweet as the real one.</li>
            <li>Long lasting, beautiful, fun scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wanted this Fancy for a long time to own</li>
            <li>Definitely not old lady, too strong or sweet!</li>
            <li>Way too sweet! Smells like my grandmas perfume from the early 1900s.&lt;br /&gt;I kept it.</li>
            <li>and this is certainly a knock off!</li>
            <li>When I opened my package,it waswell packaged and super fast delivery by seller</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>At first, straight from the bottle it is almost too sweet.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can buy online at Amazon and its SO much cheaper than buying it at a department store or Ulta for example, plus it&#x27;s convenient to have it shipped directly to you.</li>
            <li>Fancy is so much nicer than VM; it wears well, is more subtle, and I am always getting compliments on how good I smell.  </li>
            <li>Item was shipped super fast, had it within days.</li>
            <li>It has a mild sweet and soft smell.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.. its a sweet fruity smell..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a general sweet perfume and nothing special, but for the price that I paid I have no complain</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying things from amazon since 2006 and this is the first time I decided to write a review.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this, the bottle, and the lasting power.</li>
            <li>I smelt the first day I wore</li>
            <li>I love this and definitely told everyone to put that on the \\&quot;shop for L\\&quot; list!</li>
            <li>Within days of using this for the first time I started breaking out on my neck and chest.</li>
            <li>This will be the beginning of many perfume purchases in the future!</li>
            <li>The note that sticks out the most on my skin is the vanilla, which is deep and decadent, and not at all foodie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fancy by Jessica Simpson was one of the first perfumes I had purchased from the line.</li>
            <li>I went back and bought a gift set and have reordered the perfume many times.</li>
            <li>Adore the scent that much!</li>
            <li>I first got of whiff of this scent at the office from someone who&#x27;d just bought it</li>
            <li>Love the smell it last all day.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>price is reasonable!</li>
            <li>and it really grew on me!</li>
            <li>It lingers in clothes and on pillows, which I love, and is still performing when I get in the shower the next morning.</li>
            <li>Not the real perfume!</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, and I recently bought it for my friend for her birthday, and she loves it, too.</li>
            <li>I also like the bottle i think its pretty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this perfume since it first came out</li>
            <li>First time I bought this perfume, I took a risk because I had no idea what it smelt like.</li>
            <li>Exactly what you can buy at Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Not only do I love wearing it because it makes me feel</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because the bottle is so pretty</li>
            <li>I purchased this without smelling it first</li>
            <li>Sure enough it was Fancy.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>Especially for the price, I&#x27;m glad I purchased it online because at the store it sells for wholesale price.</li>
            <li>I would give this ten stars if I could, this is one of my favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li>So This is my third time purchasing this perfume and let me tell you, it is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see if Fancy can get compliments like my $150 Flowerbomb ;)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty, well designed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this fragrance, on and off, for several years now, and I really love it.  </li>
            <li>It makes me feel very feminine!</li>
            <li>Once received, gourmand was not my first thought.</li>
            <li>and i received it first .Thanks</li>
            <li>When Jessica first brought out \\&quot;Fancy\\</li>
            <li>and when I saw a Jessica Simpson perfume I wasn&#x27;t interested in even trying it.</li>
            <li>It does seem to fade away in a few hours(edp), but it smells so good</li>
            <li>most importantly the fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended and I bought it from this seller and the price was 50% off than I would have at other large department or boutique stores.</li>
            <li>I went to a web site that lets you compare the perfume you normally wear and it will give you examples of similar scents that you could try, I&#x27;m so VERY pleased with this choice, classy scent, pretty bottle!</li>
            <li>Though seems to be more of a decoration than anything since chances are if you&#x27;re getting it for your SO, they probably won&#x27;t actively wear it either unless special occasion.</li>
            <li>It has a very soft and sweet scent....</li>
            <li>This is definitely for those who want that nice, vanilla-like smell but don&#x27;t want to smell like a 10 year old.</li>
            <li>There is nothing wrong with it, it is the real deal, and it arrived in perfect condition in it&#x27;s box wrapped in cellophane.  </li>
            <li>Think of how much better cookies taste when you spend the extra money for real vanilla extract versus the cheaper \\&quot;imitation\\&quot; vanilla (</li>
            <li>When I first spray it, there is a slight whiff of grapefruit, very refreshing, and then it dries down to a cozy delicious caramel.  </li>
            <li>the smell is not overwhelming but strong, but thats what i love.</li>
            <li>The sent is so soft and smooth and what I like about it is that it is not a strong smell!&lt;br /&gt;The design of the bottle is cute!</li>
            <li>It lasts for a long time and is definetly one of the better made perfumes endorsed by celebrities.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very pretty and looks very expensive - great price!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this and even in the evening after a long days work</li>
            <li>I also think it&#x27;s versatile and can be worn pretty much anytime and anywhere.</li>
            <li>I love this smell and bottle so much so that I&#x27;m going to order at least 2 more</li>
            <li>and I was surprised because I thought I was a sweet scent.</li>
            <li>Once that wears down, the scent itself is nice...</li>
            <li>I ALWAYS get compliments when I wear it (especially from men) and it is a very sweet \\&quot;cake\\&quot; smell - like vanilla and frosting - but not too much</li>
            <li>Definitely a must for first dates or wearing around the guy you are crushing on.</li>
            <li>Strong enough I can still smell it in the afternoon.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s something fruity mixed in with the caramel, but it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>certain smells</li>
            <li>I get even more of a reaction when I put Victoria&#x27;s Secret Candy Baby (a little more sweet smelling but very light)</li>
            <li>It is so soft and pretty!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it, especially since I bought a huge bottle of it.</li>
            <li>may be good or bad depending on what kind of attention you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>They also added a few sample perfume which are also amazing.</li>
            <li>The perfume smells amazing, however, I only know this because it left my front porch smelling for days.  </li>
            <li>There is a huge difference between fragrances that are made from real florals, and those from synthetics, which this obviously is.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;(Review)</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive &amp;</li>
            <li>A MUST BUY, NOW MY SISTER WANTS ONE, and she&#x27;s all about brand names and high-end stuff....</li>
            <li>really overpowering, like a stinging scent</li>
            <li>I bought a real one from macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I really am.     </li>
            <li>I bought this perfume when I was very specifically looking for something \\&quot;girly\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I really like this perfume.</li>
            <li>Not the real perfume ..</li>
            <li>The description is spot on how the fragrance smells in real life.  </li>
            <li>It gives off a very odd,synthetic scent.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>I feel very feminine wearing it</li>
            <li>Its smells really sweet.i pick up vanilla,caramel and almost like</li>
            <li>I really really like it</li>
            <li>I am a very picky person when it comes to parfumes but this one is a must buy.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really describe the scent</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this fragrance from her line.</li>
            <li>I can smell myself all day but its light enough that I am not bothered by it.</li>
            <li>He was absolutely dumbfounded by the strangeness of this scent and how it changes.</li>
            <li>what else to say haha</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>Everyone always compliments me on it and it&#x27;s perfectly light for daily use.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I do believe this is the real thing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>When wearing it you don&#x27;t have to put too much for you to smell it.</li>
            <li>Listen guys, I&#x27;m REALLY picky.</li>
            <li>I really like the perfume</li>
            <li>This is the real deal perfume, unlike some that I have ordered on amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the real one.</li>
            <li>the darker real one is from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>seller has the real thing...packaging,beautiful bottle and</li>
            <li>so thanks so much for your service&#x27;s....</li>
            <li>Came fast too.</li>
            <li>for example, i thought i would try some Lush perfumes, just for something different, tried 7 different scents, none of them were anywhere near being this great.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really describe the smell</li>
            <li>and I can still smell it when I get ready to shower at night.</li>
            <li>We bought this perfume for our daughter&#x27;s 25th birthday and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>but I have had it before and its much darker and smells stronger ..</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s enough spice in there to keep it interesting and not too \\&quot;young or teeny-bopperish\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Fancy is a nice name but Deadly for Men hits closer to home.</li>
            <li>The scent lasts for a few mins &amp; feels kind of sticky.</li>
            <li>I just love the sweet smell and it lasts all day long till the next day after.</li>
            <li>The perfume last all day and sure to get you notice because people will be givng you compliment left and right.</li>
            <li>- DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li>I love it so much no need to keep buying other perfumes.</li>
            <li>Its awesome, you cannot go wrong!</li>
            <li>Random people stop to tell me how good I smell!  </li>
            <li>ordered it with many other things</li>
            <li>All I gotta say is if you are looking for something sweet and sultry, not too much but just enough to let people know you are in the room, this is the one.</li>
            <li>This perfume is really nice and long lasting too</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s strong enough that it keeps me smelling sweet all day long.</li>
            <li>Then after a few minutes as it dried it kept getting better and better!</li>
            <li>This is very sweet, so be careful about it.  </li>
            <li>people need to try this.it stays on for a long time to enjoy so buy now.</li>
            <li>If you are trying it for the first time, this might be okay, but keep in mind that even with 2-3  times of spraying it on yourself, it won&#x27;t last long -- maybe for an hour?</li>
            <li>Overall, fancy is just way too sweet</li>
            <li>The notion I have that many celebrities are greedy, shallow, and spoiled sometimes keeps me from a full appreciation of the purchase, however.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re patient though, you&#x27;ll see that it develops into a super rich, soft, extremely feminine scent.  </li>
            <li>it is pretty strong but it lasts all day, which is something that is not very common in other perfumes.</li>
            <li>If someone wants to live by rigid  \\&quot;perfume</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t particularly care for Jessica Simpson, but every time I wear this someone asks me what I&#x27;m wearing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried any of Jessica Simpson&#x27;s products,and was amazed at the quality put into this particular fragrance.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very pretty and very big</li>
            <li>Highly recommendable...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this fragrance from her to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this fragrance.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend to those wholike vanilla sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li>i highly recommened this product to be out of stock soon..</li>
            <li>so it makes it a little sophisticated.</li>
            <li>First of all, I want to alleviate anyone&#x27;s concerns about this large bottle of fragrance being only about one-third the cost of what you would pay in a department store.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this through the summer and the scent does not fade away as easy as some other scents.</li>
            <li>fragances of perfumes are not strong as the original, is rare because the packages are seen as the originals., dissatisfied</li>
            <li>but I ordered directly from Amazon and this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Reminds you of wearing your favorite, cozy sweater &amp; snuggling up in a blanket.</li>
            <li>My friend wore it to my house and every since I knew I had to purchase it, it&#x27;s very feminine and soft smelling.</li>
            <li>I initially bought it as a inexpensive replacement for my then-favorite perfume fragrance; Hanae Mori- that has a very similar soft, vanilla based scent, but I think I like Jessica Simpson&#x27;s &amp;#34;Fancy&amp;#34; fragrance more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally a marc jacobs</li>
            <li>Big smile from the wife means all is well.</li>
            <li>This bottle is cute and the perfume its long lasting</li>
            <li>I normally wear vanilla noted fragrances</li>
            <li>the person loves the smell and does not indicate is is nothing but the real deal, some knock amazon as having other than original manuf.</li>
            <li>i want to be able to smell a scent on me all day long and not have to carry my perfume bottle around with me and re-spray several times a day.</li>
            <li>The next as far as comments would be Lucky You.  </li>
            <li>lol i use it very lightly a little definitely goes a long way</li>
            <li>It arrived exactly as expected, on time, in original packaging.  </li>
            <li>This perfume on the other hand is floral and light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I was attempting to show my sister Heat and the new Ed Hardy when the saleslady at Macy*s showed us Fancy.</li>
            <li>I tried putting a new sprayer on it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you&#x27;re into a mature vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Its not overbearing, or two powerful, it is not a very sexy scent, but a nice everyday wear.</li>
            <li>I usually never write reviews</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet, but it has more complexity than Pink Sugar and does not come off juvenile.</li>
            <li>Bought a small bottle from Ross for 12.99, and I should of known better from the amount of boxes for sale..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not juvenile or &amp;#34;old</li>
            <li>Fancy, which is Simpson&#x27;s debut fragrance, is a sweet/confectionary scent - not overbearingly sweet (a la Aquolina&#x27;s Pink Sugar, which smells like you doused yourself in cotton</li>
            <li>Also the scent is not so strong and overpowering just a little here</li>
            <li>something about the sweet pears mixed with vanilla and caramel..smells like a cupcake with such perfection.</li>
            <li>I left my scarf on my bannister and 30 minutes later I walked upstairs and noticed a really sweet scent but couldn&#x27;t place it until I grabbed my scarf.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells a little strong at first but dies down rather quickly to a nice subtle scent that you can smell through out the day without being over powered.</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle of this from Amazon and its almost clear.  </li>
            <li>It is a totally different color than the REAL stuff.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s 28 and enjoys this scent as something in between teenagers&#x27; scents and old lady perfumes.</li>
            <li>I literally sprayed it on myself and within an hour the scent was gone completely.</li>
            <li>This bottle was much cheaper than the stores and was the same product.  </li>
            <li>It is one of my favorites by far.</li>
            <li>It was purchased as a gift for an out of town relative, it was reasonable priced and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>wild</li>
            <li>I love that you only need a few sprays and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>But personally, I think if you enjoy a fragrance, and other people around you like your fragrance, you should wear it.  </li>
            <li>This is a heavy, rich, caramel/almond gourmand.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product a few years ago.</li>
            <li>,I love the flowery and subtle vanilla note</li>
            <li>I got it ahead of time (the day before Christmas no less),</li>
            <li>/&gt;-it does not have that sweet subtle smell of the real one that you find at Macys.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s young and flirty- yet mature and sensual at the same time.</li>
            <li>Lovely scent but really weak.</li>
            <li>I have thought about trying other perfumes (I also really like Jimmy Choo&#x27;s perfume) but this one cannot be beat!</li>
            <li>The perfume itself has a dark color to it, it is not a cheaply white clear liquid fragrance and it applies on the skin as a real perfume not a alcoholic substance, that dissipates.</li>
            <li>and then a little later smells like sweet vanilla</li>
            <li>but I only use a little, this perfume is way too sweet...</li>
            <li>It smells like the real perfume, but doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the ones from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a problem with purchasing it on Amazon- as far as the entire purchase/ order process or the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>I can barely smell it, and then it fades off to nothing.  </li>
            <li>Now, there is something else I want to say about Fancy; I&#x27;ve read comments and reviews where people have said that this fragrance is \\&quot;only for young women\\&quot; or \\&quot;not for anyone</li>
            <li>Definately worth purchasing again, i use it as my everyday scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lighter takes more sprays so the person I gave it to is not really happy with it.</li>
            <li>I mean, the smell&#x27;s cheap as swell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually order perfume online due to so many fakes</li>
            <li>The more I smelled it, the more I hated it.</li>
            <li>The original one I bought from Macy&#x27;s had a lasting fragrance (at least 6 hours).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance since 2009 and as long as I am alive</li>
            <li>The price was less for a large bottle than what we had paid for a bottle 1/3 its size.  </li>
            <li>When it first came out, I could only find it at a few select stores and it was a bit pricey.</li>
            <li>At first this perfume has a sour smell, not bad but not great either.  </li>
            <li>The scent lasts a long time, and just smells so good, you cannot go wrong!  </li>
            <li>I really do not care for celebrity fragrance, however this is alright when you want a little sweetness and don&#x27;t wamt to waste your precious Saks, and Neimon elite collection.</li>

            <li> Fancy smells of warm caramel, vanilla &amp; a candle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if it is some kind of knockoff or something.</li>
            <li> It would be a Perfect gift and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> and I could have gotten the real thing/longer magnificent smell.</li>
            <li> Its always my go to perfume just for going to the store or a nice night out.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve heard some argue it&#x27;s a full &#x27;winter&#x27; scent because of how warm it is, but I think it could also could be a great Fall and Spring scent.    </li>

            <li> Compared to this, Fancy LOve doesn&#x27;t even have a scent.</li>
            <li> Alluring floral femininity comes from the heart of this fragrance with the captivating draw of dewy Gardenia laced with the delicacy of Night Blooming Jasmine.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this, but did it make anyone else break out on their neck?</li>

            <li> /&gt;This is definitely the best of all of Jessica Simpson&#x27;s perfumes!</li>
            <li> They both love it.</li>
            <li> is a beauty and a winner, the bottle and box is very well packaged and has a very nice color.</li>
            <li> It has a familiar warm scent that just lingers on</li>
            <li> I love young sweet musky scents, so this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> my favorite smell that is budget friendly!</li>
            <li> It is a very sweet vanilla/cotton candy smell and the bottle is HUGE for this price!    </li>
            <li> This is the real deal and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Really amazing, but for someone who like really sweet perfums..</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> in good packaging, the scent is nice and the price (under $20 for a big bottle) is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Beautifully sweet–yet adult smell.</li>
            <li> It is a gourmand fragrance and smells warm and sweet.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping, huge bottle, great price.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this beautiful spray many many times in different stores from $60 and up.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless you like very sweet fragrances</li>
            <li> not what the reviews said does not last at all or smell very good</li>
            <li> Fancy smells very fresh, clean, and kind of floral.</li>
            <li> On my skin it&#x27;s mostly caramel over vanilla and light floral, very sweet.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I am a huge fan of Fancy Love, and figured I&#x27;d give this one a try.</li>
            <li> It stays sweet, but to my nose, in the best way possible.  </li>
            <li> I bought this perfume because it was cheap and Amazon recommended it to me because I love Britney Spears&#x27; perfumes.</li>
            <li> Enjoy this lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li> What I love the most is that it starts off smelling like some sweet candy</li>
            <li> When I first sprayed it on I liked it, but wasn&#x27;t sure it lived up to all the hype I read about it.</li>
            <li> The price is perfect and delivery is always received before expected or on time.  </li>
            <li> With a mixture of berries, orange blossom, and jasmine, it has a great mixture of fruity and floral; it&#x27;s fruity, lightly sweet, and most importantly, made from real ingredients.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, provides long lasting scent, beautiful bottle.  </li>
            <li> She liked it right away</li>
            <li> perfume is pretty, sweet (just right), long-lasting, not overpowering, very pleasant, when I say &#x27;sweet&#x27;</li>
            <li> Came wrapped in original packaging and the bottle is HUGE!</li>
            <li> The super strong alcohol/vanilla gives me a headache!</li>
            <li> Creamy Sandalwood is united with embracing warmth of Vanilla Crème and infused with the sensual energy of Amber Crystals, rounding out the many unique layers of the fragrance and its inspiration...</li>
            <li> Love the fresh smell!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the full size too!</li>
            <li> A sweet, girly fragrance that I always get compliments when wearing!</li>
            <li> I just love the clean smell and so does my husband</li>
            <li> Shipping was very quick and packed well.</li>
            <li> very mild vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> It smells really strongly of alcohol.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overpowering and strong like a night scent.</li>
            <li> When I sprayed it on a scarf the scent was so strong</li>
            <li> The fragrance isnt that strong either.</li>
            <li> It smells so strongly of baby powder</li>
            <li> I have had so many guys ask me what it is because they want to get it for their wives and so many women just walk right up and ask me what perfume I have on because they have to get it immediately.</li>
            <li> like I smell amazing, but I have consistently received compliments on it from men.</li>
            <li> When i opened the bottled the smell was sweet but crisper and slightly more woodsy than i was expecting based on the reviews.  </li>
            <li> It stayed on for most of the day, was not overpowering, and was a sweet, youthful scent.</li>
            <li> The scent is so refreshing, sweet and floral.</li>
            <li> My mom liked to much!</li>
            <li> Smells like sweet candy :)</li>
            <li> If you like a \\&quot;fruity vanilla\\&quot; scent, you&#x27;d be much better off saving your pennies (or ask Santa) and buying Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy- fruity yet sweet.  </li>
            <li> and there is just fine.</li>
            <li> &quot; that they have created, that&#x27;s fine with me - it&#x27;s their life.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but had to since I am very happy with my purchase :)</li>
            <li> intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of its strong fruity nature is smells like one of those cheap perfumes&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light not too strong..</li>
            <li> I was very surprised it smell so good.</li>
            <li> I was excited to smell this because of the rave reviews and also because I imagined anything from Jessica Simpson would be very sweet and feminine.  </li>
            <li> I still like the smell very much as it is a very clean sweet smelling scent.</li>
            <li> Order this one, you don&#x27;t really have anything to lose, and Amazon&#x27;s price on this one is really outstanding!</li>
            <li> I would be happy to get this as a gift every single year :)</li>
            <li> Wonderful company, have referred a few friends to your online store to find cheap fragrance deals.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of anything Jessica Simpson.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle.</li>
            <li> and i liked it so much</li>
            <li> I bought the product because I enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li> Love it.. Smells fresh and makes you feel girly</li>
            <li> her Dessert line was a FABULOUS IDEA..</li>
            <li> Amazon offerred at such a great price that I could not resist.</li>
            <li> It is light, neutral yet feminine scent.</li>
            <li> great Christmas present.</li>
            <li> but it feel so cheap and chemical that give me a headache.</li>
            <li> Great scent and it last all day.</li>
            <li> Such a great value.</li>
            <li> ** uh... it is a cheap perfume...</li>
            <li> There is nothing interesting about this fragrance alone; it is about as intriguing as the vanilla scented candles you can find in every store ever.</li>
            <li> The product description actually does a great job in describing the fragrance.</li>
            <li> When I got the perfume it looked genuine since it was in a sealed box</li>
            <li> Got this perfume for really cheap</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> Its very creamy and warm.</li>
            <li> It looks great sitting on my dresser too and just overall</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s what I get for being cheap.</li>
            <li> Not only that, but the bottle itself is quite attractive and looks well sitting on my dresser.</li>
            <li> Smelled cheap and watery.  </li>
            <li> $24.99 was such a great price for this perfume.  </li>
            <li> It made me a but light headed to even wear this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Will probably last until this Christmas, lol.</li>
            <li> I enjoy Fancy, have lots of complements on it.</li>
            <li> I ordered Fancy as well as Fancy Love because I thought I loved them equally</li>
            <li> There are many reviews claiming that this perfume is super sweet smelling and smells like cupcakes.  </li>
            <li> The smell was to strong and so sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> Sweet and strong  </li>
            <li> Shipping is fast too!!!</li>
            <li> She says it smells clean and fresh and makes her feel lovely.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how Amazon can give us such great bargains, but I&#x27;m glad they do, and I&#x27;m happy to save the money to spend on other things!    </li>
            <li> It came in the original box and is a huge bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this fragrance if you like a sweet scent at a great price.</li>
            <li> I like this perfume but let me tell you the smell is SUPER strong.</li>
            <li> I love it, and came super fast!!</li>
            <li> a try will love it and the scent is great for all age ranges, young as 16 and old as 100.</li>
            <li> I originally bought &#x27;Fancy&#x27; after smelling a sample vial.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this fragrance and the price was unbelievable and she  was very happy.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed...</li>
            <li> When I first got this perfume, I wasn&#x27;t sure how I felt about it.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments (from random men) on how great this stuff smells! :)</li>
            <li> It has a light, airy vanilla scent that is not too sweet.  </li>
            <li> so I was so excited.  </li>
            <li> Beyond excited for this purchase.</li>
            <li> The bottle is just so pretty and elegant looking.</li>
            <li> Plus the bottle looks pretty in my bathroom :)</li>
            <li> I first tried this scent on at Macy&#x27;s and fell in love with it, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $59.00.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to wear it, but when I sprayed it on it didn&#x27;t smell anything like what I tried at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> First time to order this, I love it.</li>
            <li> A floaral, light, sweet smell.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell like the original Jessica Simpson</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve NEVER in my life have smelled such a perfect creamy, sweet, romantic, sexy perfume---all in one--until I smelled THIS.    </li>
            <li> These is a very fun, flirty, and sweet scent.</li>
            <li> But, if this fragrance works for you, its a huge bottle &amp; the smell tends to last a while, good luck.</li>
            <li> when you catch this on sale you cant beat it, my girl is in love with this scent, its real and cheap ...</li>
            <li> This is eligible for Free Super Saver Shipping, &amp; I clicked that option.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this is by far one of my most favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li> Well, I am a mature woman, love Fancy, and have received many compliments when wearing it.  </li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite perfumes!</li>
            <li> Which I quickly looked over, but I should of paid more attention to it because that&#x27;s exactly what it smelled like..</li>
            <li> This item shipped fast and was packaged very securely.</li>
            <li> This perfume is great it is warm, and subtle like a brown sugar and vanilla.</li>
            <li> Some women do not like overly sweet scents (like Aquolina-Pink Sugar--although I love that one too--but not as much as this)..    </li>
            <li> I love sweet fragrances, but this one really disappoint me, yes</li>
            <li> the perfume smell great,its sweet but not overly sweet like candy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet without being overly sweet.</li>
            <li> However, you will have to see for yourself whether or not you will love it just as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I am also a fan of sweet perfumes.</li>
            <li> It is a foody type fragrance but nothing too sweet that it made my stomach hurt or gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> This Perfume is certainly different, but not in a good way.</li>
            <li> (ladies - it&#x27;s a scientifically proven fact that men prefer sweet smells like donuts, pumpkin pie and vanilla to ALL floral scents).</li>
            <li> I do get more of that woodsy note, and they also are much fruitier.    </li>
            <li> After spending a good hour or so at the perfume counter of Dillards, I finally found a match for me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too candy/girly sweet smelling.  </li>
            <li> Sweet scent like candy</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who likes sweet scents.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sweet caramel</li>
            <li> What I love about Jessica Simpson is, her products r very affordable...</li>
            <li> It has a nice soft scent that others can smell, but I can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It has a sweet vanilla smell.</li>
            <li> I got it on as I as typing, this is so sweet</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts a while because one spray, arms length away, is good enough for all day wear.</li>
            <li> How cool is that.</li>
            <li> its so sweet  , like a vainilla</li>
            <li> Everything was packaged properly and it smells SO GOOD.</li>
            <li> scent is sweet but not over-wheeling,</li>
            <li> I will go to Macy&#x27;s and pay full price, if I can even find it.</li>
            <li> and then you start to smell a sweet scent.</li>
            <li> The powdery scent doesn&#x27;t disappear after you start smelling the sweet scent and the sweet scent isn&#x27;t overbearing either.</li>
            <li> Instead of the sweet caramel, vanilla notes everyone else notices</li>
            <li> , I get a sort of rotten fruit odour, something sweet but with</li>
            <li> All of Jessica Simpson&#x27;s perfumes seem to do this on me (which is a shame as I also have and really wanted to love [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet but not in your face sweet</li>
            <li> Good price, smell last all day</li>
            <li> Thanks for this opportunity for being able to express my thoughts and opinions in regards to this product.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume so much because I can&#x27;t stand those perfumes that smell literally like trees</li>
            <li> it smells so sweet.</li>
            <li> it smells sweet.</li>
            <li> So if your not into sweet scents I wouldnt recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Its sweet, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> If you have a sweet tooth (like I do)</li>
            <li> However, that being said, it is a lovely scent that really cannot be described.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too sweet for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with lots of cologne and have smelled lots of perfume and this is not deserving of all the nearly perfect reviews on amazon.  </li>
            <li> its sweet and flowery but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a Perfume that has an Apricot/Nectarine smell and was on the sweeter side without being sickeningly sweet.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of sweet perfumes, I love paris hilton (black stripes) and ralph lauren (light blue box) and I think they´re perfect...</li>
            <li> The best way I can describe it is YUMMY, and I usually reserve that word and enthusiasm for cupcakes and cake-pops!</li>
            <li> This is not at all super sweet like Fantasy, which some might prefer.  </li>
            <li> When you first spray it, it&#x27;s alittle strong.</li>
            <li> Buy this..and you will smell yourself all day long in a happy, sweet vanilla bliss of a soft dessert. :)</li>
            <li> Great sent that works with other lotions and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> and it sounds like it&#x27;s great on other people.</li>
            <li> , when you first spray it on.&lt;br /&gt;-it goes away after awhile (and starts to smell good) but the perfume barely lingers on you by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;-the paint on the bottle even started chipping throughout continued use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> However when using it I quickly realized it was not the perfume I was used</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.  </li>
            <li> This smell is absolutely wonderful, it makes me feel &#x27;pretty&#x27; and not many fragrances can do that.</li>
            <li> for the great communication and fast shipping ,Definitely will be ordering one soon because mine is done .</li>
            <li> you guys really were right on point, I love the way my Product was packaged and  </li>
            <li> I have to say I am not much of a Jessica Simpson fan, but her perfume is amazing!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells very pretty.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s more than I can say for another favored Gucci brand (even more expensive).</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but I prefer other perfume better.</li>
            <li> More than any other perfume I own.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have normally chosen something Jessica Simpson, but I love it.</li>
            <li> AND IT WAS VERY REASONABLE VERSUS BUYING AT A DEPARTMENT STORE!</li>
            <li> I think I purchased the wrong kind... but good price!</li>
            <li> THIS is my favorite perfume in the whole world (so far)..:)    </li>
            <li> Sweet but fresh and floral.  </li>
            <li> Very light and can pretty much wear it in any season.</li>
            <li> Its feminine and not too strong - just the right amount for someone that wants to be noticed!</li>
            <li> Has become my new favorite scent.  </li>
            <li> This is my new favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> On top of it...it was deliver in three business days and was in new condition - not tampered with.</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t smell as genuine and sweet as the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I smelled it and thought it was a bit sweet at first, but oh my... it&#x27;s sweet in a sensually explosive manner.</li>
            <li> Such a nice hint of vanilla and sweet without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li> This is what I expected and I will continue to buy it from now on ...very pleasant smell</li>
            <li> Very soft &amp;amp; sexy</li>
            <li> I walked around the store smelling it constantly and just fell in LOVE!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> A great gourmand fragrance, I first sprayed it on my boyfriend because I was already wearing a perfume, and perceived a strong fruity smell, I was not sure if I was going to like it because it was a blind buy, but after 20 mins or so, I smelled a beautiful, warm, feminine caramel scent.</li>
            <li> I would describe this perfume as very pretty, feminine, elegant and classy.</li>
            <li> It is not overpowering, but has a nice, light scent that is still noticeable enough to get some positive attention.</li>
            <li> While pleasant in small doses, it is incredibly sweet and gets overwhelming and cloying really fast.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this to any woman who wants a sophisticated sweet scent with a touch of vanilla and floral.</li>
            <li> smell last and is amazing...</li>
            <li> Smells amazing; especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Now, I don&#x27;t know if any of you are Bath and Body Works fans, but I&#x27;m a huge one and the closest thing I can compare this to is Forever Sunshine which is actually one of my favorite BABW scents.</li>
            <li> is far better than instores.</li>
            <li> To me, comes off as a woodsy smell, but nice overall.</li>
            <li> but Fancy is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> so the price is really worth it.</li>
            <li> It was worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It has a soft and lovely smell to it</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter loved this perfume but haven&#x27;t been able to find it locally lately.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> well worth it</li>
            <li> I finally decided to buy a bottle for myself and my mom loved it so much that I ended up buying one for her through this seller.</li>
            <li> It has a soft and lovely smell to it</li>
            <li> It is a cross between baby powder and some kind of fruity body spray.</li>
            <li> Covered in what looks like golden chrysanthemums.  </li>
            <li> I should have known by the price, but felt it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast as well!</li>
            <li> Sweet like your favorite dessert but also a little interesting.</li>
            <li> like this product it smells nice on older women as well as the young.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was that good as other reviewers were claiming.</li>
            <li> It last a long time and it smells very good.</li>
            <li> She def gave it the right name...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing it right now</li>
            <li> I got online right away and order Fancy.</li>
            <li> It is right up there to with dolce &amp; gabbanna the one.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell right.</li>
            <li> In similar fragrances I love that are on the sweet side</li>
            <li> However, I love overly sweet scents such as Britney Spears&#x27; Fantasy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet without being too sweet or little girly, yet also has a nice sandalwood vanilla scent with some floral thrown in.</li>
            <li> I seemed an excellent gift for only thirteen dollars, I buy this on black Friday and the smell is provocative</li>
            <li> Better bottle than I expected also the scent stays on you but isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> It is a pefect everyday kind of smell...not too strong....</li>
            <li> And quit honestly I have bought many of Jessica Simpson shoes and they are the most uncomfortable shoes ever.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as sweet as the real one.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, beautiful, fun scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted this Fancy for a long time to own</li>
            <li> Definitely not old lady, too strong or sweet!</li>
            <li> Way too sweet! Smells like my grandmas perfume from the early 1900s.&lt;br /&gt;I kept it.</li>
            <li> and this is certainly a knock off!</li>
            <li> When I opened my package,it waswell packaged and super fast delivery by seller</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> At first, straight from the bottle it is almost too sweet.  </li>
            <li> I love that I can buy online at Amazon and its SO much cheaper than buying it at a department store or Ulta for example, plus it&#x27;s convenient to have it shipped directly to you.</li>
            <li> Fancy is so much nicer than VM; it wears well, is more subtle, and I am always getting compliments on how good I smell.  </li>
            <li> Item was shipped super fast, had it within days.</li>
            <li> It has a mild sweet and soft smell.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.. its a sweet fruity smell..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a general sweet perfume and nothing special, but for the price that I paid I have no complain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying things from amazon since 2006 and this is the first time I decided to write a review.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this, the bottle, and the lasting power.</li>
            <li> I smelt the first day I wore</li>
            <li> I love this and definitely told everyone to put that on the \\&quot;shop for L\\&quot; list!</li>
            <li> Within days of using this for the first time I started breaking out on my neck and chest.</li>
            <li> This will be the beginning of many perfume purchases in the future!</li>
            <li> The note that sticks out the most on my skin is the vanilla, which is deep and decadent, and not at all foodie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fancy by Jessica Simpson was one of the first perfumes I had purchased from the line.</li>
            <li> I went back and bought a gift set and have reordered the perfume many times.</li>
            <li> Adore the scent that much!</li>
            <li> I first got of whiff of this scent at the office from someone who&#x27;d just bought it</li>
            <li> Love the smell it last all day.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> price is reasonable!</li>
            <li> and it really grew on me!</li>
            <li> It lingers in clothes and on pillows, which I love, and is still performing when I get in the shower the next morning.</li>
            <li> Not the real perfume!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, and I recently bought it for my friend for her birthday, and she loves it, too.</li>
            <li> I also like the bottle i think its pretty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume since it first came out</li>
            <li> First time I bought this perfume, I took a risk because I had no idea what it smelt like.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you can buy at Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Not only do I love wearing it because it makes me feel</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because the bottle is so pretty</li>
            <li> I purchased this without smelling it first</li>
            <li> Sure enough it was Fancy.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> Especially for the price, I&#x27;m glad I purchased it online because at the store it sells for wholesale price.</li>
            <li> I would give this ten stars if I could, this is one of my favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li> So This is my third time purchasing this perfume and let me tell you, it is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see if Fancy can get compliments like my $150 Flowerbomb ;)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty, well designed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this fragrance, on and off, for several years now, and I really love it.  </li>
            <li> It makes me feel very feminine!</li>
            <li> Once received, gourmand was not my first thought.</li>
            <li> and i received it first .Thanks</li>
            <li> When Jessica first brought out \\&quot;Fancy\\</li>
            <li> and when I saw a Jessica Simpson perfume I wasn&#x27;t interested in even trying it.</li>
            <li> It does seem to fade away in a few hours(edp), but it smells so good</li>
            <li> most importantly the fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended and I bought it from this seller and the price was 50% off than I would have at other large department or boutique stores.</li>
            <li> I went to a web site that lets you compare the perfume you normally wear and it will give you examples of similar scents that you could try, I&#x27;m so VERY pleased with this choice, classy scent, pretty bottle!</li>
            <li> Though seems to be more of a decoration than anything since chances are if you&#x27;re getting it for your SO, they probably won&#x27;t actively wear it either unless special occasion.</li>
            <li> It has a very soft and sweet scent....</li>
            <li> This is definitely for those who want that nice, vanilla-like smell but don&#x27;t want to smell like a 10 year old.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with it, it is the real deal, and it arrived in perfect condition in it&#x27;s box wrapped in cellophane.  </li>
            <li> Think of how much better cookies taste when you spend the extra money for real vanilla extract versus the cheaper \\&quot;imitation\\&quot; vanilla (</li>
            <li> When I first spray it, there is a slight whiff of grapefruit, very refreshing, and then it dries down to a cozy delicious caramel.  </li>
            <li> the smell is not overwhelming but strong, but thats what i love.</li>
            <li> The sent is so soft and smooth and what I like about it is that it is not a strong smell!&lt;br /&gt;The design of the bottle is cute!</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time and is definetly one of the better made perfumes endorsed by celebrities.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very pretty and looks very expensive - great price!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this and even in the evening after a long days work</li>
            <li> I also think it&#x27;s versatile and can be worn pretty much anytime and anywhere.</li>
            <li> I love this smell and bottle so much so that I&#x27;m going to order at least 2 more</li>
            <li> and I was surprised because I thought I was a sweet scent.</li>
            <li> Once that wears down, the scent itself is nice...</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS get compliments when I wear it (especially from men) and it is a very sweet \\&quot;cake\\&quot; smell - like vanilla and frosting - but not too much</li>
            <li> Definitely a must for first dates or wearing around the guy you are crushing on.</li>
            <li> Strong enough I can still smell it in the afternoon.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s something fruity mixed in with the caramel, but it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> certain smells</li>
            <li> I get even more of a reaction when I put Victoria&#x27;s Secret Candy Baby (a little more sweet smelling but very light)</li>
            <li> It is so soft and pretty!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it, especially since I bought a huge bottle of it.</li>
            <li> may be good or bad depending on what kind of attention you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> They also added a few sample perfume which are also amazing.</li>
            <li> The perfume smells amazing, however, I only know this because it left my front porch smelling for days.  </li>
            <li> There is a huge difference between fragrances that are made from real florals, and those from synthetics, which this obviously is.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;(Review)</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive &amp;</li>
            <li> A MUST BUY, NOW MY SISTER WANTS ONE, and she&#x27;s all about brand names and high-end stuff....</li>
            <li> really overpowering, like a stinging scent</li>
            <li> I bought a real one from macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I really am.     </li>
            <li> I bought this perfume when I was very specifically looking for something \\&quot;girly\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I really like this perfume.</li>
            <li> Not the real perfume ..</li>
            <li> The description is spot on how the fragrance smells in real life.  </li>
            <li> It gives off a very odd,synthetic scent.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I feel very feminine wearing it</li>
            <li> Its smells really sweet.i pick up vanilla,caramel and almost like</li>

            <li> I am a very picky person when it comes to parfumes but this one is a must buy.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really describe the scent</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this fragrance from her line.</li>
            <li> I can smell myself all day but its light enough that I am not bothered by it.</li>
            <li> He was absolutely dumbfounded by the strangeness of this scent and how it changes.</li>
            <li> what else to say haha</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> Everyone always compliments me on it and it&#x27;s perfectly light for daily use.  </li>

            <li> Listen guys, I&#x27;m REALLY picky.</li>
            <li> I really like the perfume</li>
            <li> This is the real deal perfume, unlike some that I have ordered on amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the real one.</li>
            <li> the darker real one is from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> seller has the real thing...packaging,beautiful bottle and</li>
            <li> so thanks so much for your service&#x27;s....</li>

            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really describe the smell</li>
            <li> and I can still smell it when I get ready to shower at night.</li>
            <li> We bought this perfume for our daughter&#x27;s 25th birthday and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> but I have had it before and its much darker and smells stronger ..</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s enough spice in there to keep it interesting and not too \\&quot;young or teeny-bopperish\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Fancy is a nice name but Deadly for Men hits closer to home.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts for a few mins &amp; feels kind of sticky.</li>
            <li> I just love the sweet smell and it lasts all day long till the next day after.</li>
            <li> The perfume last all day and sure to get you notice because people will be givng you compliment left and right.</li>
            <li> - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> I love it so much no need to keep buying other perfumes.</li>
            <li> Its awesome, you cannot go wrong!</li>
            <li> Random people stop to tell me how good I smell!  </li>
            <li> ordered it with many other things</li>
            <li> All I gotta say is if you are looking for something sweet and sultry, not too much but just enough to let people know you are in the room, this is the one.</li>
            <li> This perfume is really nice and long lasting too</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s strong enough that it keeps me smelling sweet all day long.</li>
            <li> Then after a few minutes as it dried it kept getting better and better!</li>
            <li> This is very sweet, so be careful about it.  </li>
            <li> people need to try this.it stays on for a long time to enjoy so buy now.</li>
            <li> If you are trying it for the first time, this might be okay, but keep in mind that even with 2-3  times of spraying it on yourself, it won&#x27;t last long -- maybe for an hour?</li>
            <li> Overall, fancy is just way too sweet</li>
            <li> The notion I have that many celebrities are greedy, shallow, and spoiled sometimes keeps me from a full appreciation of the purchase, however.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re patient though, you&#x27;ll see that it develops into a super rich, soft, extremely feminine scent.  </li>
            <li> it is pretty strong but it lasts all day, which is something that is not very common in other perfumes.</li>
            <li> If someone wants to live by rigid  \\&quot;perfume</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t particularly care for Jessica Simpson, but every time I wear this someone asks me what I&#x27;m wearing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried any of Jessica Simpson&#x27;s products,and was amazed at the quality put into this particular fragrance.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very pretty and very big</li>
            <li> Highly recommendable...</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this fragrance from her to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this fragrance.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend to those wholike vanilla sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li> i highly recommened this product to be out of stock soon..</li>
            <li> so it makes it a little sophisticated.</li>
            <li> First of all, I want to alleviate anyone&#x27;s concerns about this large bottle of fragrance being only about one-third the cost of what you would pay in a department store.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this through the summer and the scent does not fade away as easy as some other scents.</li>
            <li> fragances of perfumes are not strong as the original, is rare because the packages are seen as the originals., dissatisfied</li>
            <li> but I ordered directly from Amazon and this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Reminds you of wearing your favorite, cozy sweater &amp; snuggling up in a blanket.</li>
            <li> My friend wore it to my house and every since I knew I had to purchase it, it&#x27;s very feminine and soft smelling.</li>
            <li> I initially bought it as a inexpensive replacement for my then-favorite perfume fragrance; Hanae Mori- that has a very similar soft, vanilla based scent, but I think I like Jessica Simpson&#x27;s &amp;#34;Fancy&amp;#34; fragrance more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally a marc jacobs</li>
            <li> Big smile from the wife means all is well.</li>
            <li> This bottle is cute and the perfume its long lasting</li>
            <li> I normally wear vanilla noted fragrances</li>
            <li> the person loves the smell and does not indicate is is nothing but the real deal, some knock amazon as having other than original manuf.</li>
            <li> i want to be able to smell a scent on me all day long and not have to carry my perfume bottle around with me and re-spray several times a day.</li>
            <li> The next as far as comments would be Lucky You.  </li>
            <li> lol i use it very lightly a little definitely goes a long way</li>
            <li> It arrived exactly as expected, on time, in original packaging.  </li>
            <li> This perfume on the other hand is floral and light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I was attempting to show my sister Heat and the new Ed Hardy when the saleslady at Macy*s showed us Fancy.</li>
            <li> I tried putting a new sprayer on it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you&#x27;re into a mature vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Its not overbearing, or two powerful, it is not a very sexy scent, but a nice everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I usually never write reviews</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet, but it has more complexity than Pink Sugar and does not come off juvenile.</li>
            <li> Bought a small bottle from Ross for 12.99, and I should of known better from the amount of boxes for sale..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not juvenile or &amp;#34;old</li>
            <li> Fancy, which is Simpson&#x27;s debut fragrance, is a sweet/confectionary scent - not overbearingly sweet (a la Aquolina&#x27;s Pink Sugar, which smells like you doused yourself in cotton</li>
            <li> Also the scent is not so strong and overpowering just a little here</li>
            <li> something about the sweet pears mixed with vanilla and caramel..smells like a cupcake with such perfection.</li>
            <li> I left my scarf on my bannister and 30 minutes later I walked upstairs and noticed a really sweet scent but couldn&#x27;t place it until I grabbed my scarf.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells a little strong at first but dies down rather quickly to a nice subtle scent that you can smell through out the day without being over powered.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this from Amazon and its almost clear.  </li>
            <li> It is a totally different color than the REAL stuff.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s 28 and enjoys this scent as something in between teenagers&#x27; scents and old lady perfumes.</li>
            <li> I literally sprayed it on myself and within an hour the scent was gone completely.</li>
            <li> This bottle was much cheaper than the stores and was the same product.  </li>
            <li> It is one of my favorites by far.</li>
            <li> It was purchased as a gift for an out of town relative, it was reasonable priced and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> wild</li>
            <li> I love that you only need a few sprays and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> But personally, I think if you enjoy a fragrance, and other people around you like your fragrance, you should wear it.  </li>
            <li> This is a heavy, rich, caramel/almond gourmand.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product a few years ago.</li>
            <li> ,I love the flowery and subtle vanilla note</li>
            <li> I got it ahead of time (the day before Christmas no less),</li>
            <li> /&gt;-it does not have that sweet subtle smell of the real one that you find at Macys.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s young and flirty- yet mature and sensual at the same time.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent but really weak.</li>
            <li> I have thought about trying other perfumes (I also really like Jimmy Choo&#x27;s perfume) but this one cannot be beat!</li>
            <li> The perfume itself has a dark color to it, it is not a cheaply white clear liquid fragrance and it applies on the skin as a real perfume not a alcoholic substance, that dissipates.</li>
            <li> and then a little later smells like sweet vanilla</li>
            <li> but I only use a little, this perfume is way too sweet...</li>
            <li> It smells like the real perfume, but doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the ones from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with purchasing it on Amazon- as far as the entire purchase/ order process or the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I can barely smell it, and then it fades off to nothing.  </li>
            <li> Now, there is something else I want to say about Fancy; I&#x27;ve read comments and reviews where people have said that this fragrance is \\&quot;only for young women\\&quot; or \\&quot;not for anyone</li>
            <li> Definately worth purchasing again, i use it as my everyday scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter takes more sprays so the person I gave it to is not really happy with it.</li>
            <li> I mean, the smell&#x27;s cheap as swell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually order perfume online due to so many fakes</li>
            <li> The more I smelled it, the more I hated it.</li>
            <li> The original one I bought from Macy&#x27;s had a lasting fragrance (at least 6 hours).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance since 2009 and as long as I am alive</li>
            <li> The price was less for a large bottle than what we had paid for a bottle 1/3 its size.  </li>
            <li> When it first came out, I could only find it at a few select stores and it was a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> At first this perfume has a sour smell, not bad but not great either.  </li>
            <li> The scent lasts a long time, and just smells so good, you cannot go wrong!  </li>
            <li> I really do not care for celebrity fragrance, however this is alright when you want a little sweetness and don&#x27;t wamt to waste your precious Saks, and Neimon elite collection.</li>
            <li> and its nice because its not a very popular smell like how everyone wears victorias secret.</li>
            <li> I sprayed my wrist and at first was a little overwhelmed by the alcohol smell, which really is expected with an EDP at this price point.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little wary because my boyfriend (who grew up in a Portuguese catholic church) doesn&#x27;t care for most scents, especially ones the old Portuguese women would wear.</li>
            <li> It arrived in less than 24 hours (thank you amazon prime) and was packaged in a new box.</li>
            <li> VERY dissapointed, waste of money!</li>
            <li> It is feminine, floral, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Goes well with my body scent and last long.</li>
            <li> it last quite long for the price too....</li>
            <li> It is so long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Not bad not great.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for years now and was so happy with the price I couldn&#x27;t pass it up, even though I read a few of the bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> Be careful to not use too much though - only a little is needed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of person that will read 1000 positive comments then 1 negative one, and decide against the product.</li>
            <li> I felt like it might be a little old lady-ish.</li>
            <li> to.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a cheap fake or knockoff</li>
            <li> I can still catch the vapors at the end of a long day.</li>
            <li> It looks me a long time to go through this bottle.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day long.</li>
            <li> Expected delivery was two days got it next day.</li>
            <li> It also lasts for a long time.    </li>
            <li> and i can smell it all day long..</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to get this perfume here at a major discount, the price was half the price you would pay at a department store, so I decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I am usually hesitant to try new perfumes</li>
            <li> This product however smells little different and definitely weaker.</li>
            <li> The only other fragrance I did this with was heat...</li>
            <li> It smells just like the other bottle of the same perfume I already owned.  </li>
            <li> I have bought some other on Amazon and the smell did not last, this one do.</li>
            <li> I have been hesitant to purchase this for very long time because of the price.  </li>
            <li> There is no reason to spend extra money on expensive name brand perfumes when you have this perfume offered at such a reasonable price in comparison.  </li>
            <li> Paying extra is not worth it unless you just have to have a name brand perfume sitting on your dresser.</li>
            <li> Call me crazy, but it didn&#x27;t scare me that bad because the smell is rich and amazing.  </li>
            <li> I usually find myself opting for this over my much more expensive colognes.</li>
            <li> Just about every single time I wear this perfume I get compliments!</li>
            <li> It could last a little longer</li>
            <li> When I sprayed it on my inner arms, my skin had a reaction and turned a little pink.  </li>
            <li> You know, perfumes smell different on different people though, so it&#x27;s hard to buy a perfume from online.</li>
            <li> It dies down to a fake smelling vanilla, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> Cute but painful.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is long lasting since I have not wore it yet</li>
            <li> This product is not real.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really no in between.</li>
            <li> I really NEVER buy celebrity named perfumes.</li>
            <li> it was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> it left just a slight essence wherever she went!  </li>
            <li> I find this scent to be sort of flat, it smells yummy but seems like it is missing something</li>
            <li> FAKE Definitely watered down from my real versions of this perfume</li>
            <li> I really do not like it at all!</li>
            <li> Both compliment each other.</li>
            <li> No vanilla or anything scent stated by any other reviewer..</li>
            <li> I just hope this will linger longer than other perfumes</li>
            <li> I have had so many compliments for complete strangers, which has accounted for some very awkward interactions, but that&#x27;s another story for another time!</li>
            <li> A little bit of it goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> This unfortunately was a knock off &amp; not the real deal.</li>
            <li> You will either love it or hate it.</li>
            <li> Normally I hate celebrity endorsed items, but my god I want to make love to this perfume.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a caramel and almonds over vanilla cake without any woodsy notes to tone that down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like cotton candy and vanilla, but it&#x27;s not loaded down with musk (yuk)</li>
            <li> then my other favorites!  </li>
            <li> the price was half of what is at the stores.</li>
            <li> Also, it is A LOT less money on Amazon than in a store at the mall.</li>
            <li> so I took a chance and bought Jessica&#x27;s fragrance on a Black Friday sale.  </li>
            <li> So I came home and found it on Amazon for less than half the price.</li>
            <li> I tend to avoid hoarding perfume fragrances and have narrowed my collection down to \\&quot;Heat\\&quot; by Beyonce, and just a few select others (3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tested this perfume in a store but bought in on Amazon for less than half the price!</li>
            <li> Maybe for a little girl works but not for me.</li>
            <li> This was a little treat for my wife.  </li>
            <li> And after working 8 hours those four little sprays were STILL lingering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mix of vanilla, caramel, and a little musk.</li>
            <li> Even the barista at a little coffee shop I go to has complimented this scent and asked what I always wear.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Not A cheaply perfume, it seems there was allot of care and thought into the product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s one of the few perfumes I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to either.  </li>
            <li> dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> I am a fragranceaholic and out of all the ones I have, this is one I get quite a few compliments on.</li>
            <li> Had it for a few months and it ran out</li>
            <li> OMG, I questioned if it was fake for its cheap price and the few reveries claiming it was fake.</li>
            <li> But give it a few minutes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap</li>
            <li> Let it sit for a few minutes before judging and you&#x27;ll start smelling vanilla.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money..</li>
            <li> pale skin)</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s definitely not a strong scent.  </li>
            <li> After spreading 4 little sprays, I would walk past people and they&#x27;ll say &amp;#34;dang, you smell good.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> At first can be annoying and a little bit sour, but when it settles is heavenly.</li>
            <li> but I can say that this fragrance has lasting power which can be a problem with some less expensive perfumes.</li>
            <li> JS is a vertically integrated entertainment mogul, but knows very little about putting together a perfume.</li>
            <li> Was not sure how it was going to smell buying through the internet, but I took the chance.</li>
            <li> but sadly, her scents she sold with those didn&#x27;t last one bit--even tho they smelled to DIE FOR.    </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not sure, just pop into Kohls and try it out on yourself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this is.  </li>
            <li> Had trouble with the UPS but no fault of Amazon!</li>
            <li> My wife applied a small dab but had to remove it after 10 minutes as it was causing her to tear up and affect her breathing.  </li>
            <li> so I usually wear it over another fragrance in which I want to pump up the vanilla/caramel notes.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday and have gotten a lot of complements on it!</li>
            <li> This is my everyday perfume!</li>
            <li> In fact, I usually pair it with my Forever Sunshine body cream and it smells divine together.</li>
            <li> My husband bought it for me for Christmas, and I was skeptical because it&#x27;s Jessica Simpson (love her or hate her I guess).</li>
            <li> hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I tried this fragrance at the suggestion of a saleswoman at a perfume shop since I was having a hard time finding my then-favorite Vanilla Musk by Coty in my area.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve hardly used any of it and the sprayer stopped working.  </li>
            <li> and OMG...it LASTS ALL DAY LONG!!!!!!!!    </li>
            <li> Sadly the cheapish lingering smell it gave me lasted and didn&#x27;t soften, so I gave it away to Womens center in my city.</li>
            <li> , I am in my late 20s.  </li>
            <li> I mean I like it</li>
            <li> Its a lot less expensive</li>
            <li> The fragrance is subtle and feminine.</li>
            <li> and it is not super expensive either.  </li>
            <li> Anyways whenever I wear this people who hug me hug me for a little longer to smell the greatness (creepy sometimes).</li>
            <li> i always hated perfumes cause they always smell to much like alcahole</li>
            <li> Even so, this heavy glass perfume container will still rival the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Does not last at all. :(</li>
            <li> Just the dumb idea that ohhhhh</li>
            <li> Usually my wife would come home from work and the scent would be faint.</li>
            <li> this looks weak and smells weak</li>
            <li> This is NOT authentic perfume!!</li>
            <li> an unpleasant sour, chemical note that I just can&#x27;t stand.  </li>
            <li> It has a semi-sweet smell with a lot of &amp;#34;warmth&amp;#34; behind it, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s approximately 5-8 days.</li>
            <li> The only one I can&#x27;t wear, but like, is \\&quot;Fancy Nights\\&quot; because of the cinnamon base, which I&#x27;m allergic to.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I get the worse headache from this fragrance</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t let people buy this fake product.</li>
            <li> It is fake.</li>
            <li> im so sad..</li>
            <li> This was a blind buy for me.</li>
            <li> yet it smells expensive.</li>
            <li> and you cant go wrong with this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I got this because my sister wears it all the time but is way to expensive in stores.</li>
            <li> I was done wrong by the majority of reviewers..</li>
            <li> I bought it blindly since I never smelled it before.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overpowering and you can catch faint whiffs of it from a distance off.</li>
            <li> so I automatically knew it was fake by the color</li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not overly expensive</li>
            <li> It can be worn casually, Or as an evening wear.</li>
            <li> Artificial fruit flavor meets fake vanilla.</li>
            <li> I work 8 hours cutting fruit.</li>
            <li> order one that is shipped n sold by amazon so that u dont get a fake one!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a fake!</li>
            <li> The smell is very wrong.  </li>
            <li> People are shocked when I tell them it&#x27;s Jessica Simpson.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a fragrance i could never get sick of that is long-lasting.</li>
            <li> The fruity notes are overpowered by the Toasted Almonds and Burnt Sugar Scent :(</li>
            <li> This was a blind buy and smells awful.</li>
            <li> In my experience, it drives men crazy!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just received this perfume today and I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Since I already opened it, I&#x27;m stuck with it :(</li>
            <li> everyone i know is a fan and if you are thinking about ordering it scent unsmelled, i don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am VERY unhappy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> IF YOU&#x27;RE READING THIS AND HAVE FEARS ITS FAKE IGNORE IT!!</li>
            <li> Base Notes:</li>
            <li> I think the vanilla base helps a lot with that.</li>
            <li> scent.this smells very expensive!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume about a year ago and absolutely hated it.</li>
            <li> but  when i smell it i hated the smell</li>
            <li> Fancy nights was terrible!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the problem is and worst of all, I can&#x27;t return it for a replacement.</li>
            <li> Worst perfume ever!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Lovely scent but really weak. Does not last at all. :(</li>
            <li> smells very good, deserves its price, thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> I have bought 2 bottles of this perfume at the mall. I saw it on Amazon and how inexpensive it was and what a mistake! It is a totally different color than the REAL stuff. It is a knockoff. I doesn&#x27;t smell as genuine and sweet as the real stuff. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I usually never write reviews but I can&#x27;t let people buy this fake product. The good thing though is that Amazon refunded my money with no disputes or problems. Be cautious before buying this product.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this scent in one of the fashion magazines I was reading &amp; decided to give it a shot.  Very inexpensive &amp; the scent is very nice.  Jessica does it again!!</li>
            <li> Compliments all day!!!</li>
            <li> JUST GOT it TODAY.....LOVE IT!!!! I bought it for more than the price shown, are the kidding me???&lt;br /&gt;The perfume is pretty, sweet (just right), long-lasting, not overpowering, very pleasant, when I say &#x27;sweet&#x27; it&#x27;s like flowers with an hint of a -sugar sandalwood- smell that just is REALLY PLEASANT!!! Not A cheaply perfume, it seems there was allot of care and thought into the product.&lt;br /&gt;I am telling you, if you love having a collection of perfume next to your expensive fragrances, this one is a keep-sake to go with the others!!&lt;br /&gt;This is a beauty and a winner, the bottle and box is very well packaged and has a very nice color. The perfume itself has a dark color to it, it is not a cheaply white clear liquid fragrance and it applies on the skin as a real perfume not a alcoholic substance, that dissipates. A MUST BUY, NOW MY SISTER WANTS ONE, and she&#x27;s all about brand names and high-end stuff....so hey, what are you waiting for??? BUY IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> Product came as it was described. It had been packaged well so it was not damaged in shipping. It looked like I had just bought it from the store. I have no complaints concerning my order of this product or with this company.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this!!!</li>
            <li> Just to let you know:&lt;br /&gt;-this perfume is not authentic.&lt;br /&gt;-it does not have that sweet subtle smell of the real one that you find at Macys.&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s really overpowering, like a stinging scent, when you first spray it on.&lt;br /&gt;-it goes away after awhile (and starts to smell good) but the perfume barely lingers on you by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;-the paint on the bottle even started chipping throughout continued use.&lt;br /&gt;-the spray nozzle also stopped working</li>
            <li> I just love the smell of this fragrance. Someone at my school had it and i liked it so much I just had to get it. My friend sprayed it on my clothing and i could still smell it after it had gone through the wash. It&#x27;s just a fragrance i could never get sick of that is long-lasting. I would definitely reccommend it to others!</li>
            <li> I bought the product because I enjoy the scent. The notion I have that many celebrities are greedy, shallow, and spoiled sometimes keeps me from a full appreciation of the purchase, however. I try to deal with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend because it&#x27;s her favorite perfume and she loves it. She couldn&#x27;t believe the price for the quantity!!!!!</li>
            <li> i have been using this perfume for awhile now and im in lovvvvvvvvve with it. i always hated perfumes cause they always smell to much like alcahole but thie has a nice sweet smell to it, its great for ppl  who love a nice frilly sweet scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying things from amazon since 2006 and this is the first time I decided to write a review. This product is not real. It is fake. I bought a real one from macy&#x27;s so I know what the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; one is like. This is not it. If you are trying it for the first time, this might be okay, but keep in mind that even with 2-3  times of spraying it on yourself, it won&#x27;t last long -- maybe for an hour? The real one lasts ALL DAY and it has a very strong and wonderful scent. This product however smells little different and definitely weaker.</li>
            <li> Love Jessica Simpson products and this perfume is one of them.  I love the smell, the bottle, everything.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Has become my new favorite scent.  It smells good on and I can smell it throughout the day.  Some perfumes don&#x27;t last but this one is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 6 mos. later.  The scent has changed and now reminds me more of a bug spray then a great scent.  Ew.</li>
            <li> This perfume is really nice and long lasting too</li>
            <li> I just love the clean smell and so does my husband</li>
            <li> I tested this perfume in a store but bought in on Amazon for less than half the price! It arrived exactly as expected, on time, in original packaging.  I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this perfume and I was able to get it at a great price. We both win.</li>
            <li> I have received numerous compliments on this item.  Everyone compliments the smell and asks what it is.  I am very pleased as well.</li>
            <li> Love it.. Smells fresh and makes you feel girly</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas present. Was not sure how it was going to smell buying through the internet, but I took the chance. Well, she loved it and so did I. It has a mild sweet and soft smell. The bottle is the most beautiful one I have seen. Anyone thinking about this product should get it. You will be highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> When I opened my package,it waswell packaged and super fast delivery by seller,I was greatly pleased that my package arrived in good condition,nd to top it the perfume smell great,its sweet but not overly sweet like candy,I love the flowery and subtle vanilla note so it makes it a little sophisticated.I love this perfume and the price on amazon is far better than instores.I got a lot of compliments and people wanted to know the name of perfume I was wearing.Am happy I bought this perfume.5 stars for jessica simpson,one of the best celebrity perfumes I think !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve NEVER in my life have smelled such a perfect creamy, sweet, romantic, sexy perfume---all in one--until I smelled THIS.    OMG...do not be fooled--MEN LOVE THIS..and of course most women. Some women do not like overly sweet scents (like Aquolina-Pink Sugar--although I love that one too--but not as much as this)..    something about the sweet pears mixed with vanilla and caramel..smells like a cupcake with such perfection. I hope this NEVER gets discontinued. Jessica did a great job--even tho her Dessert line was a FABULOUS IDEA..but sadly, her scents she sold with those didn&#x27;t last one bit--even tho they smelled to DIE FOR.    This hit it on the nail..and I don&#x27;t know one man who DOESNT like this perfume. It&#x27;s sweet without being overly sweet. It&#x27;s sexy..and OMG...it LASTS ALL DAY LONG!!!!!!!!    THIS is my favorite perfume in the whole world (so far)..:)    Buy this..and you will smell yourself all day long in a happy, sweet vanilla bliss of a soft dessert. :)</li>
            <li> Is there another word to describe this? I love the smell of this, the bottle, and the lasting power. Everything that makes a good perfume is in this bottle.     Once this hits your skin, 15 hours later- it&#x27;ll still be there. I love love LOVE this perfume. I wasn&#x27;t too estatic about her Dessert beauty line because of the staying power- but THIS perfume is just incredible. I originally bought &#x27;Fancy&#x27; after smelling a sample vial. I&#x27;m glad I got this. I really am.     This is also just perfect for any age group. It&#x27;s young and flirty- yet mature and sensual at the same time. It has a familiar warm scent that just lingers on you&#x27;re skin all day. It&#x27;s perfect for any occasion and for any season. I&#x27;ve heard some argue it&#x27;s a full &#x27;winter&#x27; scent because of how warm it is, but I think it could also could be a great Fall and Spring scent.    You will either love it or hate it. There&#x27;s really no in between. I love young sweet musky scents, so this is perfect for me. However, you will have to see for yourself whether or not you will love it just as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Hey i love this perfume smell wonderful</li>
            <li> I love this!!!!!! It smells so nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume when I was very specifically looking for something \\&quot;girly\\&quot;. The smell is the perfect combination of girls from marshmallows to caramel. Whenever I buy perfume I&#x27;m a little wary because my boyfriend (who grew up in a Portuguese catholic church) doesn&#x27;t care for most scents, especially ones the old Portuguese women would wear. He, however, LOVES this scent on me. He kept smelling my air (I spray a spritz on my wrist and a spritz on my hair) and telling me how good I smelt the first day I wore it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This perfume is definitely a winner and will become permanent  part of my collection.</li>
            <li> Not one of my fav scents, but very nice to wear to work. Its not overbearing, or two powerful, it is not a very sexy scent, but a nice everyday wear. I&#x27;ve worn this through the summer and the scent does not fade away as easy as some other scents. To me, comes off as a woodsy smell, but nice overall. just not my fav.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume after reading the wonderful reviews it got. I am also a fan of sweet perfumes. I really wanted to like it, especially since I bought a huge bottle of it. I really do not like it at all! It smells really strongly of alcohol. It dies down to a fake smelling vanilla, but nothing special. The super strong alcohol/vanilla gives me a headache!</li>
            <li> I tend to avoid hoarding perfume fragrances and have narrowed my collection down to \\&quot;Heat\\&quot; by Beyonce, and just a few select others (3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I was attempting to show my sister Heat and the new Ed Hardy when the saleslady at Macy*s showed us Fancy. My sister has and likes Fancy Love but believe me, my eyes \\&quot;jumped\\&quot; and ears twitched when I heard that guys were all over fancy. I smelled it and thought it was a bit sweet at first, but oh my... it&#x27;s sweet in a sensually explosive manner. I can&#x27;t stop sniffing myself. The only other fragrance I did this with was heat... and Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s Ecstasy. I love this and definitely told everyone to put that on the \\&quot;shop for L\\&quot; list!</li>
            <li> This fragrence is amazing! I ordered Fancy as well as Fancy Love because I thought I loved them equally but Fancy is by far my favorite. Compared to this, Fancy LOve doesn&#x27;t even have a scent. It is so yummy i want to lick my arm all day! It is a foody type fragrance but nothing too sweet that it made my stomach hurt or gave me a headache. People keep sniffing mewhich may be good or bad depending on what kind of attention you&#x27;re looking for. I say go to your local Macys or Dillards, etc and smell the testers but don&#x27;t buy it there because you save over fifty percent ordering from Amazon. This is the loweest price I have seen anywhere. I purchased the 100ml and the 50ml for travel. I highly recommend this if you&#x27;re into a mature vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> I ordered from Amazon immediately after trying on the scent in a store.  Amazon offerred at such a great price that I could not resist. Such a nice hint of vanilla and sweet without being overpowering.  Received the product promptly in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> This perfume is so \\&quot;light\\&quot; and perfect for daytime use. It isn&#x27;t overpowering and strong like a night scent. It is a very sweet vanilla/cotton candy smell and the bottle is HUGE for this price!    This retails at department stores for $59.00.    Scent Notes:  Heart: Luminous and joyful, the fragrance opens with the radiance of chic sparkling Pear and juicy Apricot Nectar wrapped with the glow of Red Fruits.    Alluring floral femininity comes from the heart of this fragrance with the captivating draw of dewy Gardenia laced with the delicacy of Night Blooming Jasmine. Toasted Almonds and Caramel noted provide a playful and daring element.    Base Notes: Creamy Sandalwood is united with embracing warmth of Vanilla Crème and infused with the sensual energy of Amber Crystals, rounding out the many unique layers of the fragrance and its inspiration...Jessica Simpson.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this, but did it make anyone else break out on their neck? Within days of using this for the first time I started breaking out on my neck and chest. I&#x27;ve never had another perfume do this, but I noticed it&#x27;s a bit oily when you spray it on too, so I bet that&#x27;s why. I wouldn&#x27;t dare spray it on my clothes since it&#x27;s this oily...so as much as I love the smell, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this perfume.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, great price!</li>
            <li> The scent is on the sweeter side which I  love. I would definitely recommend this fragrance if you like a sweet scent at a great price.</li>
            <li> I really like this perfume. To me, it smells like a much more toned-town (daytime) version of Benefit&#x27;s Something About Sofia, and that is my favorite scent of all time! Fancy smells very fresh, clean, and kind of floral.</li>
            <li> I been wearing fancy for about 8 years . I hope this never goes away. I am asked all the time what i am wearing . It almost as a cake vanilla dessert smell to it . I can&#x27;t say enough about this perfume ! It&#x27;s a 10 plus in my book ! Please keep carrying this perfume !!!</li>
            <li> Wispy notes of vanillaish, sandlewood,sultry bar girl sweetness..turned into cheapish fragrance notes as it soaked in on me.  I hung in there and used it anyway, used approx 1/4+ bottle.  Sadly the cheapish lingering smell it gave me lasted and didn&#x27;t soften, so I gave it away to Womens center in my city. I&#x27;ve heard women say they like it for themselves on amazon prior to purchase.  Note too,it can stain clothing (+ pale skin) w/ medium carmel color added to the fragrance. *But, if this fragrance works for you, its a huge bottle &amp; the smell tends to last a while, good luck.</li>
            <li> Not the real perfume ..its a knock~off...im so sad..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and I love how it makes me smell delicious!  The description is spot on how the fragrance smells in real life.  This will be the beginning of many perfume purchases in the future!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. The price was too good to give up.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this perfume.  I brought this for a co-worker because she loved how I smelled when we were in the elevator together :-).</li>
            <li> My best friend bought this perfume about a year ago and every time she would wear it I wanted to follow her around...it left just a slight essence wherever she went!  So I finally bought it!  Men seem to LOVE this scent and I love it!  It makes me feel feminine and sexy.  Its a lot less expensive then my other favorites!  Its awesome, you cannot go wrong!</li>
            <li> This Perfume is certainly different, but not in a good way. It&#x27;s an \\&quot;acquired taste\\&quot; but the scent just never grew on me. The more I smelled it, the more I hated it.The combination of Toasted Almonds,Red berries,Caramel and Apricots does not work. It gives off a very odd,synthetic scent.The fruity notes are overpowered by the Toasted Almonds and Burnt Sugar Scent :(</li>
            <li> This perfume smells very pretty. It has a very soft and sweet scent....it doesn&#x27;t really last ALL day, probably like 4 to 5 hours.  The bottle is very pretty and very big so the price is really worth it.</li>
            <li> Received it today. It&#x27;s the real thing at a great price. Smells wonderful and I absolutely love it. The shipping was super fast. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> This perfume is great it is warm, and subtle like a brown sugar and vanilla. I feel very feminine wearing it and my husband likes the smell too. It is one of my favorites &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Mother&#x27;s Day.  She&#x27;s 28 and enjoys this scent as something in between teenagers&#x27; scents and old lady perfumes.</li>
            <li> was given as a gift and the recipient loved it</li>
            <li> excelete seller and the product was welcomed</li>
            <li> I sprayed Fancy on a tester strip while out shopping one day and a week later you could still smell it on the paper.  It has the best staying power of any fragrance I&#x27;ve tested.  At first, straight from the bottle it is almost too sweet.  If you&#x27;re patient though, you&#x27;ll see that it develops into a super rich, soft, extremely feminine scent.  It stays sweet, but to my nose, in the best way possible.  There was one downfall though.  When I sprayed it on my inner arms, my skin had a reaction and turned a little pink.  It faded away in about 15 minutes.  Call me crazy, but it didn&#x27;t scare me that bad because the smell is rich and amazing.  I still can&#x27;t believe how good of a deal this perfume was.  The note that sticks out the most on my skin is the vanilla, which is deep and decadent, and not at all foodie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the package promptly, it was in perfect condition, sealed in plastic.  I&#x27;m a very happy customer.</li>
            <li> Fancy by Jessica Simpson was one of the first perfumes I had purchased from the line. It smells a bit like baby powder, but has an elegant twist.</li>
            <li> Great price! Excellent shipping, i couldn&#x27;t ask for more...</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! My husband bought it for me for Christmas, and I was skeptical because it&#x27;s Jessica Simpson (love her or hate her I guess). However, it smells wonderful and I just love it! You know, perfumes smell different on different people though, so it&#x27;s hard to buy a perfume from online. If you&#x27;re not sure, just pop into Kohls and try it out on yourself. My husband says he LOVES it on me!</li>
            <li> There are many reviews claiming that this perfume is super sweet smelling and smells like cupcakes.  When i opened the bottled the smell was sweet but crisper and slightly more woodsy than i was expecting based on the reviews.  I still like the smell very much as it is a very clean sweet smelling scent.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing! It is so soft and pretty! Its smells really sweet.i pick up vanilla,caramel and almost like a cake batter scent.this smells very expensive! This and Jennifer Lopez Still smell wonderful! Fancy nights was terrible! I like this one better.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful, and arrived intact!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my lil honey and she loves it! I also love it on her....def a great buy.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing. It is light, neutral yet feminine scent. It&#x27;s warm and vanilla-y with hints of sweetness. Definitely not old lady, too strong or sweet! This is my favorite perfume of all kind, and I always get compliments.</li>
            <li> My Jessica Simpson perfume arrived today and I am In Love!!! I love how expensive this perfume bottle looks!..She def gave it the right name...It&#x27;s def Fancy in every way!.. It looks and smells like it should cost 4 or 5x&#x27;s more than what it costs! I love this smell and bottle so much so that I&#x27;m going to order at least 2 more bottles!..I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Jessica&#x27;s and now I&#x27;m even more impressed with her!.</li>
            <li> The product came in a timely manner and was in pristine condition!  It smells just like the other bottle of the same perfume I already owned.  Nothing but good things to say!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume about a year ago and absolutely hated it. I&#x27;m very surprised it got so many good reviews!! It has a very cheap scent, it smells like a perfume they would sell at a dollar store. Also, the scent does NOT last. I literally sprayed it on myself and within an hour the scent was gone completely. This is one of those \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; items, and I would NOT recommend it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this perfume. I always get compliments when I wear it. It lasts for a long time and is definetly one of the better made perfumes endorsed by celebrities. I have to say I am not much of a Jessica Simpson fan, but her perfume is amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Strong enough I can still smell it in the afternoon.  Even better... the price was half of what is at the stores.</li>
            <li> Delicious perfume! It was worth it. Shipping was quick. Highly recommendable... great Christmas present. They also added a few sample perfume which are also amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful , amazing ... It&#x27;s smelled very very very nice . I really really like it and I will buy it again</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume because it was cheap and Amazon recommended it to me because I love Britney Spears&#x27; perfumes. Except I think this one might be better. It stayed on for most of the day, was not overpowering, and was a sweet, youthful scent.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume. It is feminine, floral, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> great fragrance.. five stars as a satisfaction.. I love it and I am gonna have it always... it&#x27;s recommended to be smelled.. see ya</li>
            <li> I found this perfume years ago at Macys when a perfume lady came at me wanting to spray me with it and I asked for it on a \\&quot;strip\\&quot; card that I could carry around to see if I liked it. I walked around the store smelling it constantly and just fell in LOVE! I went back and bought a gift set and have reordered the perfume many times. I ALWAYS get compliments when I wear it (especially from men) and it is a very sweet \\&quot;cake\\&quot; smell - like vanilla and frosting - but not too much (ladies - it&#x27;s a scientifically proven fact that men prefer sweet smells like donuts, pumpkin pie and vanilla to ALL floral scents). There&#x27;s enough spice in there to keep it interesting and not too \\&quot;young or teeny-bopperish\\&quot;. I have had so many guys ask me what it is because they want to get it for their wives and so many women just walk right up and ask me what perfume I have on because they have to get it immediately. I just love it and hope that it continues to be made (although, to my horror, I have heard rumors it&#x27;s discontinued? I&#x27;m stocking up just in case).</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes that I tried out &amp; bought years ago on a whim, and have LOVED using it ever since. I initially bought it as a inexpensive replacement for my then-favorite perfume fragrance; Hanae Mori- that has a very similar soft, vanilla based scent, but I think I like Jessica Simpson&#x27;s &amp;#34;Fancy&amp;#34; fragrance more.  Just about every single time I wear this perfume I get compliments! Literally tons- from both guys and girls. I love that I can buy online at Amazon and its SO much cheaper than buying it at a department store or Ulta for example, plus it&#x27;s convenient to have it shipped directly to you. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with purchasing it on Amazon- as far as the entire purchase/ order process or the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Great price for product. Would order from them again.</li>
            <li> This item shipped fast and was packaged very securely. It&#x27;s well worth the price. You get quite a bit for your money being that it&#x27;s 3.4 fl oz. It&#x27;s a light smell, good for any occasion.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume! Its feminine and not too strong - just the right amount for someone that wants to be noticed! I would be happy to get this as a gift every single year :)</li>
            <li> I really do not care for celebrity fragrance, however this is alright when you want a little sweetness and don&#x27;t wamt to waste your precious Saks, and Neimon elite collection.</li>
            <li> Better bottle than I expected also the scent stays on you but isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> Love how this perfume smell!! Very soft &amp;amp; sexy</li>
            <li> I will give this as a gift to my youngest d&#x3D;Daughter for her Birthday since I missed her for Christmas</li>
            <li> This is one of my go-to signature fragrances...i love everything by Jessica Simpson..she is awesome..her shoes are awesome...and her fragrances are awesome..i will always be a fan...beauty and fashio is def. her arena..love it</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance at a great price.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this fragrance, and truthfully I do somewhat like the scent, although I don&#x27;t LOVE it. On my skin it&#x27;s mostly caramel over vanilla and light floral, very sweet. Unfortunately I get the worse headache from this fragrance and I have never had a fragrance cause me a headache ever... I wear a lot of gourmand scents (Paris Can Can, Britney Fantasy) and have no issue. But literally just one sniff of this (even just sniffing the bottle without even spraying this and I instantly get a migraine.     Perhaps it&#x27;s that I don&#x27;t smell any of the fruits in this at all, or the amber... to my nose it&#x27;s just a caramel and almonds over vanilla cake without any woodsy notes to tone that down. In similar fragrances I love that are on the sweet side I do get more of that woodsy note, and they also are much fruitier.    Overall, fancy is just way too sweet and I just cannot tolerate the headache that goes along with it.</li>
            <li> I got this perfume after liking it on a friend. Whenever we would go out I would borrow it, so I figured it was time to get my own. I&#x27;m allergic to the smell of a lot of perfumes so was very happy to find one that I not only liked but that didn&#x27;t make me sneeze. I think the vanilla base helps a lot with that. This perfume smells a little strong at first but dies down rather quickly to a nice subtle scent that you can smell through out the day without being over powered. Sometimes I like to put it on when I&#x27;m sitting around the house. Adore the scent that much!</li>
            <li> I first got of whiff of this scent at the office from someone who&#x27;d just bought it and I knew I had to get it. Got it at a wonderful price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. It is one of her favorite fragrances</li>
            <li> This perfume smells incredible.. I&#x27;m normally a marc jacobs ~ michael kors girl... but omg I love this!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great perfume..got it in christmas and had to hid it from my sister. cause then i would never see it. it&#x27;s become both of us&#x27;s favorite. and for the price it&#x27;s a great bargin. its smells a bit like a vanilla &amp; maybe lilac. but best thing is that its not overwellming to the user. and it sure catches attention</li>
            <li> Love the smell it last all day. Love it. I will be buying another bottle. Cant beat the price either.Shipping was on time.</li>
            <li> This has a wonderful soft scent &amp; Amazon has it for 1/3 of the department stores!  I get complimented all the time on the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I am a huge fan of Fancy Love, and figured I&#x27;d give this one a try. I am glad I did! This smells amazing, and lasts! Hubby was also very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this fragrance and the price was unbelievable and she  was very happy.Big smile from the wife means all is well.</li>
            <li> es divino dulce y suave...</li>
            <li> My husband love this on me</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent , I love it</li>
            <li> I must admit, I never like celebrity perfume. Just the dumb idea that ohhhhh I smell like them. I don&#x27;t like that. And who in the hec knows what they smell like anyways for anyone to know.  I really NEVER buy celebrity named perfumes. And quit honestly I have bought many of Jessica Simpson shoes and they are the most uncomfortable shoes ever. Cute but painful. With that said.... My hubby bought me this, even though he knows my stand on celeb perfume. I must admit this is a very nice smell. Not to pricey and I like it. Is it my favorite go to perfume? No. I love Anne Pliska. But I have bought this many times because it&#x27;s a very pleasant smell.. I have got compliments on it as well.</li>
            <li> Goes well with my body scent and last long. Get a lot of compliments when I wear it. Enjoy this lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li> The product came in great condition.  The price was the lowest I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and the bottle. This bottle is cute and the perfume its long lasting and I love it</li>
            <li> Is my favorite fragrance from Jessica Simpson. It last a long time and it smells very good. I am a very picky person when it comes to parfumes but this one is a must buy.</li>
            <li> I had taken a chance on the purchase of this perfume without ever smelling it...I was not disappointed...one word for this product..\\&quot;AWESOME\\&quot; !!</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this from Amazon and its almost clear.  I got a bottle for Christmas and its amber colored like most perfume is.  I&#x27;m not sure why this is.  I&#x27;ve had this perfume before and it to was amber.</li>
            <li> After spending a good hour or so at the perfume counter of Dillards, I finally found a match for me. This is definitely my favorite scent of Jessica Simpsons. I can still catch the vapors at the end of a long day. That&#x27;s more than I can say for another favored Gucci brand (even more expensive). This is one purchase you will not regret. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Love it! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent. It&#x27;s one of my favorites and for this price, it&#x27;s a must have for me.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume it&#x27;s a big bottle 3.4 oz. and I got it on sale too. It smells like toasted almonds,vanilla,cupcakes,maybe jasmine flowers,tangerines.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really describe the scent but i love it lol i use it very lightly a little definitely goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have always loved this perfume</li>
            <li> Love Jessica Simpson products and this perfume is one of them. I love the smell, the bottle, everything.  It has a soft and lovely smell to it and I get plenty of compliments. The price is a bonus! Great product!</li>
            <li> very nice! love the smell! price is reasonable! good staying power.. my favorite smell that is budget friendly! order one that is shipped n sold by amazon so that u dont get a fake one! highly recommended.. its a sweet fruity smell.. it does change a bit after spraying it on for me it gets better!</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but I prefer other perfume better. It looks me a long time to go through this bottle.</li>
            <li> ...but you might love it. This was a blind buy for me. I would recommend trying it before you buy.</li>
            <li> It could last a little longer and I don&#x27;t particularly care for Jessica Simpson, but every time I wear this someone asks me what I&#x27;m wearing.  More than any other perfume I own.  The next as far as comments would be Lucky You.  It does seem to fade away in a few hours(edp), but it smells so good I don&#x27;t even care!  It&#x27;s like cotton candy and vanilla, but it&#x27;s not loaded down with musk (yuk) and it&#x27;s not too candy/girly sweet smelling.  I get even more of a reaction when I put Victoria&#x27;s Secret Candy Baby (a little more sweet smelling but very light) body spray on with it.  Enjoy!  :)  Heather&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heather UpChurch&lt;br /&gt;Art &amp; Design Studios&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> This is what I expected and I will continue to buy it from now on ...very pleasant smell and I am extremely happy ...thank you</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume, vanillas and sandalwoods blended. Great sent that works with other lotions and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this. I got it for her for mother&#x27;s day.</li>
            <li> Fancy By Jessica Simpson is absolutely a Great fragrance! The scent is so refreshing, sweet and floral. I absolutely adore this fragrance from her line. I would highly recommend this fragrance from her to anyone. It can be worn casually, Or as an evening wear. (Whatever your preference). The scent lasts a long time, and just smells so good, you cannot go wrong!  The bottle is well designed and looks so beautiful on the dresser.</li>
            <li> love this  perfume!! received it as a gift and hzd to get more. I get so many compliments when  I wear  it.</li>
            <li> When I first got this perfume, I wasn&#x27;t sure how I felt about it. I felt like it might be a little old lady-ish. I decided to give it a chance and it really grew on me! To top it off, I get TONS of compliments on it... Especially by the male population.</li>
            <li> It was on sale, so I decided to try it. The smell is great. I am usually hesitant to try new perfumes certain smells give me a headache. This perfume on the other hand is floral and light. I can smell myself all day but its light enough that I am not bothered by it.</li>
            <li> Sweet scent like candy</li>
            <li> I am inlove with this perfume!!! I will be purchasing more!!</li>
            <li> FAKE Definitely watered down from my real versions of this perfume</li>
            <li> very happy to see this stuff on Amazon. hard to find in stores. great price. I get so many compliments (from random men) on how great this stuff smells! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself. This perfume smells so good and sweet. I would recommend this to anyone who likes sweet scents.</li>
            <li> I love sweet fragrances, but this one really disappoint me, yes it&#x27;s sweet caramel but it feel so cheap and chemical that give me a headache. Maybe for a little girl works but not for me.</li>
            <li> This was a blind buy and smells awful. I ended up giving it away.</li>
            <li> Great scent and it last all day. One of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, provides long lasting scent, beautiful bottle.  I wouldn&#x27;t have normally chosen something Jessica Simpson, but I love it.</li>
            <li> ick.. I can see how people might like the caramel and vanilla afterthought in this perfume.. but it is over powered by the weirdest combination of baby wipes and raspberries... I gave it 2 stars instead of one because it smells better as it fades and because there is a possibility that this one is a fake.. My boyfriends reaction was hilarious.. he liked the way it smelled when he just sniffed the bottle, but once i sprayed it he was speechless. He was absolutely dumbfounded by the strangeness of this scent and how it changes. lol!</li>
            <li> Perfect! Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Loved it I&#x27;ve used for years and was so happy to find on line much cheaper than in stores. Nice fragrant not over bearing like some. Light and nice</li>
            <li> fragances of perfumes are not strong as the original, is rare because the packages are seen as the originals., dissatisfied</li>
            <li> I tried this fragrance at the suggestion of a saleswoman at a perfume shop since I was having a hard time finding my then-favorite Vanilla Musk by Coty in my area.  Fancy is so much nicer than VM; it wears well, is more subtle, and I am always getting compliments on how good I smell.  I absolutely love this fragrance!</li>
            <li> What I love about Jessica Simpson is, her products r very affordable...&lt;br /&gt;This smells too good on me, just started using it, and I&#x27;m getting a lot of compliment about it...&lt;br /&gt;I Love This Fragrance👌👌👌👌</li>
            <li> Sexy, beautifully scented - bought three and gave to my sister and two daughters for Mothers day- The bottle is very pretty and looks very expensive - great price!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume! Very light and can pretty much wear it in any season. Had trouble with the UPS but no fault of Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Starts off good then the final smell is Amazing!!!! Recommend for all ages. For the price buy it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this fragrance and now that they have it on Amazon with free Prime shipping, this is where I&#x27;ll come to buy it!  It has a nice soft scent that others can smell, but I can&#x27;t.  That&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to be.  :)</li>
            <li> I love fancy by Jessica Simpson. And again a really good price</li>
            <li> Very good! my nieces liked it...</li>
            <li> The only downfall to this is you will smell your wife instead of you, so will everyone else. great vanilla smelling perfume.</li>
            <li> This smell is amazing and lasts all day. I would recommend this to anyone who likes fruity scents and that last all day. I bought it for myself and my mom took over and started using this perfume.</li>
            <li> I bought dis product for myself and I love it,it smells clean and verry freshy,I always get good complements about it...u go jess!!</li>
            <li> Well I bought this for this  sister  and she really loved it I&#x27;m a guy so I wouldn&#x27;t no what else to say haha</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance! It&#x27;s so yummy! Smells just like caramel candy once it dries.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s something fruity mixed in with the caramel, but it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> This is actually my second bottle of Fancy. I love it, its one of my favorites and the price makes it even more Lovely!</li>
            <li> This perfume goes on light and fruity but settles to a beautiful, rich, warm scent. It&#x27;s sweet, but it has more complexity than Pink Sugar and does not come off juvenile. It lingers in clothes and on pillows, which I love, and is still performing when I get in the shower the next morning. Such a great value. I usually find myself opting for this over my much more expensive colognes.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It has a sweet vanilla smell. Every time I wear it someone always asks what I&#x27;m wearing!</li>
            <li> This perfume is too fruity and too intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw 451 reviews for this and ordered it as a gift for my wife. but she didn&#x27;t like it because its too fruity and too intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of its strong fruity nature is smells like one of those cheap perfumes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** uh... it is a cheap perfume... so what was I expecting... never mind **</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter loved this perfume but haven&#x27;t been able to find it locally lately.  Finding it on Amazon via a third party was a boon.  The price was less for a large bottle than what we had paid for a bottle 1/3 its size.  Shipping was very quick and packed well.</li>
            <li> I can barely smell it, and then it fades off to nothing.  So it&#x27;s definitely not a strong scent.  What I can smell of it is nice though.</li>
            <li> Today I received my bottle of Fancy and it is either a knock off or it has turned rancid.  The smell is very wrong.  And I just now read that Amazon will not take perfumes back.  I am VERY unhappy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This bottle was much cheaper than the stores and was the same product.  I love the smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li> The perfume smells amazing, however, I only know this because it left my front porch smelling for days.  The shipping box itself was not damaged but inside of that, the bottle was somehow cracked and leaked the perfume all over the bottom and consequently, the front of my porch.</li>
            <li> Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t say former because I purchased both on the same day but I do love, love, love Fancy by Jess. I would receive compliments when I wore Fancy love but I receive even more compliments when I wear Fancy! People are shocked when I tell them it&#x27;s Jessica Simpson. I love the smell of this and even in the evening after a long days work I still smell it on me and I&#x27;m not one of those take a bath, spray every hour wearers. Great scent and longevity.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes and I get compliments on it often when I wear it.  This is actually my second bottle.  It has a light, airy vanilla scent that is not too sweet.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> One of my all time fav :) inexpensive yet it smells expensive. I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance since 2009 and as long as I am alive I will never stop. Sweet, charming and delicious..yes delicious.......hmmmmmm I&#x27;m wearing it right now, so good</li>
            <li> I normally wear vanilla noted fragrances and this is similar but just different enough to catch my eye. I LOVE it!!!!</li>
            <li> Not the real perfume! I knew the price was too good to be true but i bought it anyway. i&#x27;ve been wearing the orignial for years and this is NOT it! VERY dissapointed, waste of money!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this perfume!</li>
            <li> Came super quick and packaged perfectly.  Fragrance was as promised, and at a great price. Wonderful company, have referred a few friends to your online store to find cheap fragrance deals.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday present for someone and they love it!  So it gets 5 stars!!!  Also, it is A LOT less money on Amazon than in a store at the mall.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite parfume.&lt;br /&gt;I always get compliments when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also bought it as a gift.</li>
            <li> I got it on as I as typing, this is so sweet and you cant go wrong with this fragrance. Someone will always ask what are you wearing trust me</li>
            <li> Smells OK, Not so great. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Got it for the wife as a gift. Though seems to be more of a decoration than anything since chances are if you&#x27;re getting it for your SO, they probably won&#x27;t actively wear it either unless special occasion.</li>
            <li> Love Jessica Simpson&#x27;s Fancy perfume. I get compliments on the perfume. It is one of my favorites now. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love it &amp; I had used it before fancy perfume stays the whole day &amp; great price.</li>
            <li> I Love the fragrance, the price, and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> My wife likes to wear fragrances so I took a chance and bought Jessica&#x27;s fragrance on a Black Friday sale.  My wife applied a small dab but had to remove it after 10 minutes as it was causing her to tear up and affect her breathing.  She&#x27;s allergic to to something in the fragrance which is a shame but that is how it is.  I will mention that my wife has used perfumes for many years so her reaction was somewhat a surprise.</li>
            <li> This was a little treat for my wife.  She never wore perfume growing up, but enjoys it from time to time or on days she is visiting with clients.  It&#x27;s a nice smell.  Not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Great price, great smell. I bought a bottle for my daughter in law and one for myself. Great buy. Love the fresh smell! One of my  favs!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and goes a long way. You don&#x27;t need much. has a beautiful bottle. Stays on all day long.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume it is very light and not overpowering.  It has a wonderful vanilla overtone to it with floral/fruity undertones. I will keep buying this perfume I love it so much no need to keep buying other perfumes.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy, rich, caramel/almond gourmand. While pleasant in small doses, it is incredibly sweet and gets overwhelming and cloying really fast. I find this scent to be sort of flat, it smells yummy but seems like it is missing something so I usually wear it over another fragrance in which I want to pump up the vanilla/caramel notes. There is nothing interesting about this fragrance alone; it is about as intriguing as the vanilla scented candles you can find in every store ever.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time on my smell.  One bottle lasts a while because one spray, arms length away, is good enough for all day wear.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite perfume. A friend and I stopped a woman to ask what she was wearing. I got online right away and order Fancy. The fragrance is subtle and feminine. The product description actually does a great job in describing the fragrance. The bottle and the packaging are equally lovely.</li>
            <li> Love the scent it&#x27;s light not too strong.. One of my favorite perfumes.  Expected delivery was two days got it next day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was that good as other reviewers were claiming. My wife gave it away after.</li>
            <li> The scent does NOT linger its a NO go.</li>
            <li> This scent lasts all day.  It truly lingers.</li>
            <li> I liked the way this smells on me...it last quite long for the price too....even my roommate uses it to because she likes the smell too...</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in a lot and I fell in love. I don&#x27;t usually order perfume online due to so many fakes but I ordered directly from Amazon and this is the real deal. It&#x27;s a nice Amber color and it smells sooooo good. Came wrapped in original packaging and the bottle is HUGE! This is a deal at this price.</li>
            <li> I got this because my sister wears it all the time but is way to expensive in stores. This is the real deal and smells amazing! I wear it everyday and have gotten a lot of complements on it!</li>
            <li> My mom liked to much! This is her favorite perfume!!!I recommended</li>
            <li> I saw it and saw the reviews on it and decided to get it have to now used.. will keep you guys posted as soon as i used.</li>
            <li> My GF loves this perfume. So I bought it for her. Great price on Amazon too.</li>
            <li> Not bad not great. Definitely has a powdery smell so don&#x27;t get if you don&#x27;t like powder!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas. The bottle was huge; what a bargain! It came before Christmas but was suppose to come 5 days after . How cool is that. The frangrance is intoxicating. the best bang for your buck out there.Fancy is a nice name but Deadly for Men hits closer to home. Howl if you hear me!</li>
            <li> Love this scent! Keep in mind perfumes and colognes will smell different on different people, but this one, for me, is my signature scent! I have had so many compliments for complete strangers, which has accounted for some very awkward interactions, but that&#x27;s another story for another time! I have thought about trying other perfumes (I also really like Jimmy Choo&#x27;s perfume) but this one cannot be beat! It has a semi-sweet smell with a lot of &amp;#34;warmth&amp;#34; behind it, if that makes sense. The best way I can describe it is YUMMY, and I usually reserve that word and enthusiasm for cupcakes and cake-pops!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so good! Actually a co - worker of mine was wearing this perfume and I just had to get it. I am glad that I made this purchase. It is one of the best perfumes I have ever had!! I urge everyone to make this purchase. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> It smells good on my wife and she was very happy to get it.  Actually, she asked for it.  I wouldn&#x27;t have bought her a fragrance if I didn&#x27;t know she already liked it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, and I recently bought it for my friend for her birthday, and she loves it, too.</li>
            <li> The product came quick, smells delicious and the scent is sweet and mellow. I also like the bottle i think its pretty. Definately worth purchasing again, i use it as my everyday scent. Love this product! ^_^</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume since it first came out and it&#x27;s become my signature scent.  Everyone always compliments me on it and it&#x27;s perfectly light for daily use.  I have very sensitive skin and it&#x27;s one of the few perfumes I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to either.  Love it!</li>
            <li> First time I bought this perfume, I took a risk because I had no idea what it smelt like. It was definitely worth it. I love love love this perfume!!!</li>
            <li> This smells a lot like one of my favorite perfumes &#x27;Badgley Mischka&#x27;.  The smell lingers longer than the &#x27;Vintage Bloom&#x27;.  I might by this again in the future.</li>
            <li> its so sweet  , like a vainilla</li>
            <li> Exactly what you can buy at Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Every time I wear this scent, people ask me what I have on</li>
            <li> I think this smells like cotton candy and I love it! One of my girlfriends said I smelled like a donut, lol</li>
            <li> There is no reason to spend extra money on expensive name brand perfumes when you have this perfume offered at such a reasonable price in comparison.  Paying extra is not worth it unless you just have to have a name brand perfume sitting on your dresser. Even so, this heavy glass perfume container will still rival the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for years now and was so happy with the price I couldn&#x27;t pass it up, even though I read a few of the bad reviews.  When I got the perfume it looked genuine since it was in a sealed box so I was so excited.  However when using it I quickly realized it was not the perfume I was used to.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a cheap fake or knockoff - DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> These is a very fun, flirty, and sweet scent. I highly recommend this fragrance. It is perfect for weekend shenanigans!</li>
            <li> this perfume will last about 30 seconds on your body then it will wear off. dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> this was given as a gift. the person loves the smell and does not indicate is is nothing but the real deal, some knock amazon as having other than original manuf. products in this department, I have not found this to be ture.</li>
            <li> I like this perfume but let me tell you the smell is SUPER strong. A little bit of it goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> when you catch this on sale you cant beat it, my girl is in love with this scent, its real and cheap ... well worth it</li>
            <li> Great perfume. Everything was packaged properly and it smells SO GOOD. I absolutely love it. This is eligible for Free Super Saver Shipping, &amp; I clicked that option. That&#x27;s approximately 5-8 days. I purchased this item on April 10th, and I received it on April 13th. You do the math. Overall its a great product and its a great price. Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
            <li> I am a repeated buyer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell last and is amazing... scent is sweet but not over-wheeling, one of my favorite perfumes</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite perfumes! Not only do I love wearing it because it makes me feel like I smell amazing, but I have consistently received compliments on it from men. It is not overpowering, but has a nice, light scent that is still noticeable enough to get some positive attention. In my experience, it drives men crazy! Definitely a must for first dates or wearing around the guy you are crushing on. ;)</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for years, and love it. The bottles I recently received look like water, and smell like it too. Whatever the problem is, I will never order them again. I will go to Macy&#x27;s and pay full price, if I can even find it. If not, I will change scents.</li>
            <li> I seemed an excellent gift for only thirteen dollars, I buy this on black Friday and the smell is provocative</li>
            <li> I loved this perfume! The sent is so soft and smooth and what I like about it is that it is not a strong smell!&lt;br /&gt;The design of the bottle is cute!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. Smells so yummy and it is not super expensive either.  I get compliments on how good I smell all the time. Def a must buy!</li>
            <li> Way too sweet! Smells like my grandmas perfume from the early 1900s.&lt;br /&gt;I kept it. I&#x27;ve been using the fragrance for my linens.&lt;br /&gt;Unless you like very sweet fragrances, I do not recommend this one.</li>
            <li> not what the reviews said does not last at all or smell very good</li>
            <li> Beyond excited for this purchase. Got this perfume for really cheap and it is the big bottle. Paid 60.00 for the same size bottle years ago at Macys. It smells so good.</li>
            <li> My daughter lives this perfume. I can find it in local stores for $40. I get it for 1/2 on amazon. Very impressed with all mg savings.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy. You will not be disappointed.If you want compliments this perfume will definitely give you plenty. It starts out with a powdery scent and then you start to smell a sweet scent. The powdery scent doesn&#x27;t disappear after you start smelling the sweet scent and the sweet scent isn&#x27;t overbearing either. Both compliment each other. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot either and it lasts. Also the price is great for a 3.4oz bottle of good scented perfume.</li>
            <li> I was done wrong by the majority of reviewers.. Bought a small bottle from Ross for 12.99, and I should of known better from the amount of boxes for sale.. But I went ahead and bought it because I read most reviews saying it smelled like a vanilla and woody fragrance... WRONGGGGG!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember seeing one review that said it smelled like BABY POWDER! Which I quickly looked over, but I should of paid more attention to it because that&#x27;s exactly what it smelled like.. No vanilla or anything scent stated by any other reviewer..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend, BUT IF YOURE INTO THAT KIND OF STUFF GO AHEAD AND BUY..</li>
            <li> Instead of the sweet caramel, vanilla notes everyone else notices, I get a sort of rotten fruit odour, something sweet but with an unpleasant sour, chemical note that I just can&#x27;t stand.  All of Jessica Simpson&#x27;s perfumes seem to do this on me (which is a shame as I also have and really wanted to love [[ASIN:B003WG3AQ0 Fancy Nights By Jessica Simpson Eau De Parfum Spray for Women, 3.40-Fluid Ounce]] )  It&#x27;s a shame because the bottle is so pretty and it sounds like it&#x27;s great on other people.</li>
            <li> Good fragance, plus cheaper. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of anything Jessica Simpson. I love her shoes, purses &amp; her perfumes. This unfortunately was a knock off &amp; not the real deal. The scent lasts for a few mins &amp; feels kind of sticky. There&#x27;s a reason it was so cheap. I should have known better.</li>
            <li> For my girlfriend. She liked it right away and it seems to have grown on her. She loves it now. As a guy, I think it smells good too. Good deal for the size of the bottle compared to the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this scent since it launched!!!  One of my favorites and I get compliments everywhere I go when I wear this!!!  Great price and Seller!!!  Shipping is fast too!!!</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells so beautiful, its unreal. It is one of my favorites by far. One thing that is imperative to being known as a good perfume is endurance and this one lasts for like 2 days, no lie, lol! I woke up the next morning and could still smell it on me which made me not even want to take a shower cause I&#x27;m like, I still smell good, lol but of course I did shower folks. All I gotta say is if you are looking for something sweet and sultry, not too much but just enough to let people know you are in the room, this is the one. I am a fragranceaholic and out of all the ones I have, this is one I get quite a few compliments on. A must have!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product ....this it&#x27;s my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume.she will be happy. Thanks 4 the best delivery prices and sellers 😉👍</li>
            <li> I purchased this without smelling it first but I took the chance and am pleased. It arrived in less than 24 hours (thank you amazon prime) and was packaged in a new box. When I sprayed it on a scarf the scent was so strong and I was surprised because I thought I was a sweet scent. I left my scarf on my bannister and 30 minutes later I walked upstairs and noticed a really sweet scent but couldn&#x27;t place it until I grabbed my scarf. Sure enough it was Fancy. It&#x27;s sweet but not in your face sweet and I love that. Its like a step below or deeper than viva la juicy and I love it. Plus the price is amazing.</li>
            <li> I am very happy about the affordable pricing of this perfume here and it&#x27;s the full size too! I love the scent of this and get so many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance!  I get a lot of compliments when I wear it!  Fast shipping!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing; especially for the price. This is my second bottle. Arrived on time, without damage, still in plastic wrapping. I also like Daisy, Miss Dior Cherie, Princess by Vera Wang.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> It was purchased as a gift for an out of town relative, it was reasonable priced and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine has tons of perfumes on her night stand and I always end up borrowing this scent. I finally decided to buy a bottle for myself and my mom loved it so much that I ended up buying one for her through this seller. Great price and GREAT product. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> this perfume is amazing. i put it on in the moring and it lasts all day.. i would def purchased it again</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to get this perfume here at a major discount, the price was half the price you would pay at a department store, so I decided to give it a shot. I bought this perfume and I love it. I was very surprised it smell so good. I do believe this is the real thing. I have bought some other on Amazon and the smell did not last, this one do. I spray it on in the morning and I can still smell it at night when I go to bed. Buy this one you won&#x27;t regret it. Good price, smell last all day that what you want in your perfume.</li>
            <li> I have been hesitant to purchase this for very long time because of the price.  But amazon had it for the cheapest price!!!! I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Love it! Masks the smell of my underarms. Oh yea....</li>
            <li> My Favorite.  Great price and wonderful smell</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrant for myself for mother&#x27;s day. I glad I did , thank you Jessica for delivery on this perfum. The perfume last all day and sure to get you notice because people will be givng you compliment left and right. The scent is a floral scent witha  lilac under tone. This is one of my favorite purfum and I will be giving these as gifts for christmas.  Please  give  it a try will love it and the scent is great for all age ranges, young as 16 and old as 100.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried any of Jessica Simpson&#x27;s products,and was amazed at the quality put into this particular fragrance. I will definitely be buying this again. Luckily,I received a $20 Amazon gift card from an awesome clothing company...SlipG. Thanks for this opportunity for being able to express my thoughts and opinions in regards to this product.</li>
            <li> This is my go to fragrance. It has a soft and lovely smell to it and I get plenty of compliments. The price is a bonus!</li>
            <li> My wife likes this perfume and I like it when she wears it.  Great perfume and the price is great on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this is by far one of my most favorite perfumes. I just love the sweet smell and it lasts all day long till the next day after. When wearing it you don&#x27;t have to put too much for you to smell it. What I love the most is that it starts off smelling like some sweet candy and then a little later smells like sweet vanilla, I just love it. It&#x27;s no wonder I love this perfume so much because I can&#x27;t stand those perfumes that smell literally like trees and I know that some of you know what I&#x27;m talking about and this is nothing like that it smells so sweet. Also the scent is not so strong and overpowering just a little here and there is just fine. And what I love most about this is that no matter how many people I give hugs to, I don&#x27;t end up smelling like them, It&#x27;s strong enough that it keeps me smelling sweet all day long. It is right up there to with dolce &amp; gabbanna the one. I get lots of compliments about it. Wherever I go out people are always asking me what perfume I&#x27;m wearing, oh tips, the guys love this.  My men friends and dates can&#x27;t get enough of it. Jessica Simpson did a great job with this perfume and I am one very satisfied customer. Especially for the price, I&#x27;m glad I purchased it online because at the store it sells for wholesale price. I would give this ten stars if I could, this is one of my favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li> Geez this stuff smells wonderful! I bought it blindly since I never smelled it before. I sprayed it on when it arrived and fell in love. It stayed on all night and I found myself sniffing it all night. I was sleeping and kept smelling my hand. This is definitely for those who want that nice, vanilla-like smell but don&#x27;t want to smell like a 10 year old. My husband loved it and said its very attractive. It doesn&#x27;t scream \\&quot;I&#x27;ve got perfume!\\&quot;. Its very creamy and warm. The bottle is so cute and feminine. The shipping was super fast as well!</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume &amp; it came quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The packing was good &amp; it is the original one.&lt;br /&gt;It is one of the best perfumes in the market.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product</li>
            <li> I am loving this perfume! When I first sprayed it on I liked it, but wasn&#x27;t sure it lived up to all the hype I read about it. Then after a few minutes as it dried it kept getting better and better! I can definitely smell the caramel and vanilla in it that others have described. It smells so wonderful! I&#x27;ve had it on for almost 5 hours now and it&#x27;s still smelling good without being too over powering or strong. I would describe this perfume as very pretty, feminine, elegant and classy. I also think it&#x27;s versatile and can be worn pretty much anytime and anywhere. The packaging is also really nice! The bottle is just so pretty and elegant looking. It looks great sitting on my dresser too and just overall makes me happy :) Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Paid double the price at Macey&#x27;s for the same product. The most awesome fragrance on the market. I&#x27;ve been stopped by strangers who want to know what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> Ive bought this perfume before, and like it. To me it smells like vanilla and lemons. Overall the comment I get is...it smells sweet. So if your not into sweet scents I wouldnt recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my self I love it!!!!&#x27;😀😀😀😀😀</li>
            <li> Beautiful, sexy scent that gets me lots of compliments.  Lasts all day.  Great price.  What more could a girl want?</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells and it lasts all day! I originally bought this product a few years ago. I love that you only need a few sprays and it lasts all day. Smells like sweet candy :)</li>
            <li> One of my favorites. Smells so good and I always get compliments. Often times it gets mistaken for one of Channels scents. Good going J.Simpson</li>
            <li> After (unsuccessfully) sampling a string of Jessica&#x27;s perfumes, I was leery about this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Ms. Simpson&#x27;s best-smelling perfume yet! Fancy, which is Simpson&#x27;s debut fragrance, is a sweet/confectionary scent - not overbearingly sweet (a la Aquolina&#x27;s Pink Sugar, which smells like you doused yourself in cotton candy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yum! Fancy smells of warm caramel, vanilla &amp; a candle. Reminds you of wearing your favorite, cozy sweater &amp; snuggling up in a blanket. A must-have fragrance for Fall!</li>
            <li> However I have a lot spray and I donated to the victims of the storm of Sandy to the people living in NYC</li>
            <li> Normally I hate celebrity endorsed items, but my god I want to make love to this perfume. It is a cross between baby powder and some kind of fruity body spray. It isn&#x27;t overpowering and you can catch faint whiffs of it from a distance off. Just enough to notice it but not want to kill the person wearing it. I definitely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Lots of compliments however my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t like it , I still wear it to work or when I&#x27;m not around him. Plus the bottle looks pretty in my bathroom :)</li>
            <li> I just received this perfume today and I am so disappointed. I first tried this scent on at Macy&#x27;s and fell in love with it, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $59.00. So I came home and found it on Amazon for less than half the price. I was so excited to wear it, but when I sprayed it on it didn&#x27;t smell anything like what I tried at Macy&#x27;s. In fact, it was nauseating. I&#x27;m wondering if it is some kind of knockoff or something. Since I already opened it, I&#x27;m stuck with it :(</li>
            <li> The seller was amazing! The perfume smells so good.  Its a beautiful bottle. It would be a Perfect gift and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> So This is my third time purchasing this perfume and let me tell you, it is my favorite perfume. It has become my signature sent. Its sweet, but not overpowering. It makes you feel fancy and sensual. I don&#x27;t know. Anyways whenever I wear this people who hug me hug me for a little longer to smell the greatness (creepy sometimes). Everyone loves it, especially me. Get it!!!</li>
            <li> It smells like the real perfume, but doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the ones from Macy&#x27;s. Usually my wife would come home from work and the scent would be faint. With this one... I can&#x27;t tell if she ever put it on.  I guess that&#x27;s what I get for being cheap. $10 more and I could have gotten the real thing/longer magnificent smell.</li>
            <li> I Love it and get tons of compliments!!  Random people stop to tell me how good I smell!  Great value</li>
            <li> Great perfume, one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> I went to a web site that lets you compare the perfume you normally wear and it will give you examples of similar scents that you could try, I&#x27;m so VERY pleased with this choice, classy scent, pretty bottle! I&#x27;m very very happy with this purchase. not overpowering at all but lasts the work day and beyond. I would suggest another good spray if I were doing a night out as well but I&amp;#34;m pleased with the pricing and the stay-power!  this would be a lovely gift for a girlfriend/wife/sister/mother that doesnt do well with stronger smells.&lt;br /&gt;I compared it to Princess by Vera Wang</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.  Pleased with price and product</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS ITEM...IT SMELLS GREAT AND IT WAS VERY REASONABLE VERSUS BUYING AT A DEPARTMENT STORE! I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Listen guys, I&#x27;m REALLY picky. I&#x27;m the type of person that will read 1000 positive comments then 1 negative one, and decide against the product. Well anyways, I went to a beauty supply store and got a scented body oil in this scent for $5. I LOOOVED IT!!! Had it for a few months and it ran out ):  i came online looking for the product and seen this 3.4 ounce for $20...  OMG, I questioned if it was fake for its cheap price and the few reveries claiming it was fake. IF YOU&#x27;RE READING THIS AND HAVE FEARS ITS FAKE IGNORE IT!! I work 8 hours cutting fruit. After spreading 4 little sprays, I would walk past people and they&#x27;ll say &amp;#34;dang, you smell good.&amp;#34; And after working 8 hours those four little sprays were STILL lingering. Long lasting, beautiful, fun scent. Looove it, ORDER ORDER ORDER</li>
            <li> I really like the perfume but I&#x27;ve hardly used any of it and the sprayer stopped working.  I tried putting a new sprayer on it but that didn&#x27;t work.  I don&#x27;t know what the problem is and worst of all, I can&#x27;t return it for a replacement.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of sweet perfumes, I love paris hilton (black stripes) and ralph lauren (light blue box) and I think they´re perfect... and I order this one but I only use a little, this perfume is way too sweet... I mean I like it but I won´t order this again...</li>
            <li> A great gourmand fragrance, I first sprayed it on my boyfriend because I was already wearing a perfume, and perceived a strong fruity smell, I was not sure if I was going to like it because it was a blind buy, but after 20 mins or so, I smelled a beautiful, warm, feminine caramel scent. This is very sweet, so be careful about it.  At first can be annoying and a little bit sour, but when it settles is heavenly.</li>
            <li> So, this perfume just arrived at my front door... Days ahead of schedule, so yay for that!  I was excited to smell this because of the rave reviews and also because I imagined anything from Jessica Simpson would be very sweet and feminine.  The perfume came in it&#x27;s box and the box was wrapped in plastic wrap (no different than if you purchased a bottle of perfume from the mall).  I sprayed my wrist and at first was a little overwhelmed by the alcohol smell, which really is expected with an EDP at this price point.  Once that wears down, the scent itself is nice... Sweet but fresh and floral.  I can&#x27;t imagine anyone hating this perfume.  It&#x27;s great for daytime and work as it shouldn&#x27;t offend any coworkers or classmates.  However, I love overly sweet scents such as Britney Spears&#x27; Fantasy.  This is not at all super sweet like Fantasy, which some might prefer.  I wanted something just as sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For extra info, I am in my late 20s.  I can imagine any female from ages 17-45 wearing this perfume.  It&#x27;s not juvenile or &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I can&#x27;t complain about my purchase.  I got it ahead of time (the day before Christmas no less), in good packaging, the scent is nice and the price (under $20 for a big bottle) is amazing.  We&#x27;ll see if Fancy can get compliments like my $150 Flowerbomb ;)</li>
            <li> .I like this product it smells nice on older women as well as the young. I like the  bottle it&#x27;s pretty, well designed</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought me this as a gift last year on Christmas (2013) and I&#x27;m still using it. This smell is absolutely wonderful, it makes me feel &#x27;pretty&#x27; and not many fragrances can do that. Not only that, but the bottle itself is quite attractive and looks well sitting on my dresser. Beautifully sweet–yet adult smell. Whomever created this scent and the packaging for this product was genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I haven&#x27;t purchased his for myself and yet I still felt the need to write a review about a year later. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume. Its always my go to perfume just for going to the store or a nice night out.</li>
            <li> Great product good price</li>
            <li> this perfume is and has always been my favorite. it is pretty strong but it lasts all day, which is something that is not very common in other perfumes. the smell is not overwhelming but strong, but thats what i love. i want to be able to smell a scent on me all day long and not have to carry my perfume bottle around with me and re-spray several times a day. this is such a feminine smell. everyone im around on a daily basis always compliments the scent. i dont know if its just how it smells with my skin, but i would reccomment it to anyone! bottle lasts forever(unless you spray it on everything just to smell it, like me!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wish i could rate it 10 stars if i could, 5 just doesnt do it justice!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume &amp; it&#x27;s a steal to be selling for under $25 compared to $60 at Dilliards. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. :D</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and the price is great! I use it almost every day and get compliments on it all the time! I love it!</li>
            <li> I love Fancy perfume by Jessica Simpson and I like to use it along with Fancy Love also by Jessica  It is so long lasting.  So perfect!!!!!!</li>
            <li> i bought this perfume for my self  because it had alot of good reviews but  when i smell it i hated the smell dont like it at all i had to give it away not buying this one again</li>
            <li> This is the real deal perfume, unlike some that I have ordered on amazon. Some are phonies, this one is amazing.</li>
            <li> The price is perfect and delivery is always received before expected or on time.  Very satisfied.  It&#x27;s always good to get what you want and the price doesn&#x27;t break a leg.</li>
            <li> This is my everyday perfume! I am constantly asked &amp;#34;what perfume are you wearing?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The scent lasts all day and its not overpowering.</li>
            <li> First of all, I want to alleviate anyone&#x27;s concerns about this large bottle of fragrance being only about one-third the cost of what you would pay in a department store.  There is nothing wrong with it, it is the real deal, and it arrived in perfect condition in it&#x27;s box wrapped in cellophane.  I don&#x27;t know how Amazon can give us such great bargains, but I&#x27;m glad they do, and I&#x27;m happy to save the money to spend on other things!    I&#x27;ve used this fragrance, on and off, for several years now, and I really love it.  It is a gourmand fragrance and smells warm and sweet.  If you have a sweet tooth (like I do) you will probably like Fancy also.  When I first spray it, there is a slight whiff of grapefruit, very refreshing, and then it dries down to a cozy delicious caramel.  It also lasts for a long time.    Now, there is something else I want to say about Fancy; I&#x27;ve read comments and reviews where people have said that this fragrance is \\&quot;only for young women\\&quot; or \\&quot;not for anyone over twenty-five\\&quot;.  Well, I am a mature woman, love Fancy, and have received many compliments when wearing it.  If someone wants to live by rigid  \\&quot;perfume rules\\&quot; that they have created, that&#x27;s fine with me - it&#x27;s their life.  Maybe they like having a lot of rules.  But personally, I think if you enjoy a fragrance, and other people around you like your fragrance, you should wear it.  And I want to encourage any lady out there, of any age, to give Fancy a try if you haven&#x27;t already.  It is truly a great scent!</li>
            <li> This parfum this nice my mom love it!</li>
            <li> First time to order this, I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my daughters birthday, I liked the fragrance and she loved it</li>
            <li> At first this perfume has a sour smell, not bad but not great either.  But give it a few minutes and it has a lovely smell.  I bought this and vintage bloom.  I like vb better, but this is nice too.  The bottle is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Item was shipped super fast, had it within days. Also i was astounded by the beauty of the bottle. It&#x27;s almost a piece of art when i look at it. Covered in what looks like golden chrysanthemums.  The fragrance is very elegant and quietly sweet. Almost smells like blackberries to me and i love it. Great buy, Great deal, Great shipping!</li>
            <li> Smelled cheap and watery.  Was not for me.. used it twice and gave it away.</li>
            <li> GF loves this and the price can&#x27;t be beat anywhere!</li>
            <li> Will buy this perfume until the day I die! Hopefully, they will never discontinue!</li>
            <li> $24.99 was such a great price for this perfume.  Its has a nice musky, floral scent.  I often don&#x27;t like scents that are floral but this smells nice.</li>
            <li> I think the scent of this perfume is not overpowering. I just hope this will linger longer than other perfumes</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents its has some vanilla like tones. It is very strong but sometimes I want to wear something like that. It makes me feel very feminine!</li>
            <li> This is NOT authentic perfume!! I should have known by the price, but felt it was worth a try.  I have worn the Fancy since it came out and this is certainly a knock off!</li>
            <li> Love the scent. My wife loves it as well which is a double plus.</li>
            <li> Smells great. A floaral, light, sweet smell. Huge bottle. Great price!</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments on this scent, especially when I mix it with Euphoria. Be careful to not use too much though - only a little is needed!</li>
            <li> Very nice scent for women who like sweeter, vanilla scents.</li>
            <li> The smell was to strong and so sweet smelling. It made me a but light headed to even wear this fragrance. I had to throw it away didn&#x27;t want to bother with returning it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the real one. For 15.99 I didn&#x27;t think so. Doesn&#x27;t smell as sweet as the real one. Wish I could return it. The one to the left is the Amazon on and the darker real one is from Macy&#x27;s. Been wearing this perfume for years now so I automatically knew it was fake by the color</li>
            <li> Fancy was ordered on the premise of it being a gourmand fragrance. Once received, gourmand was not my first thought. However, that being said, it is a lovely scent that really cannot be described. Order this one, you don&#x27;t really have anything to lose, and Amazon&#x27;s price on this one is really outstanding!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too sweet for me. I don&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s a general sweet perfume and nothing special, but for the price that I paid I have no complain and I&#x27;ll keep it. But I&#x27;ll never buy it again and I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> (Intro) I hope you&#x27;ll read this review in the spirit in which it is written. JS is a vertically integrated entertainment mogul, but knows very little about putting together a perfume. If you don&#x27;t believe me, check the price. Elegant perfumes like Chanel, Dior, Fendi, etc., don&#x27;t sell for $26 on Amazon. It&#x27;s not cheap b/c Amazon is giving you something for nothing; you are getting nothing for nothing. There is a huge difference between fragrances that are made from real florals, and those from synthetics, which this obviously is.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;(Review) It smells like cotton candy in a bottle, or maybe \\&quot;Mike and Ike,\\&quot; if they were in liquid form. Artificial fruit flavor meets fake vanilla. Think of how much better cookies taste when you spend the extra money for real vanilla extract versus the cheaper \\&quot;imitation\\&quot; vanilla (whatever that is, just some chemical that can fool your taste buds), and you&#x27;ll get the idea of how this fragrance smells. If you like a \\&quot;fruity vanilla\\&quot; scent, you&#x27;d be much better off saving your pennies (or ask Santa) and buying Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy- fruity yet sweet.  With a mixture of berries, orange blossom, and jasmine, it has a great mixture of fruity and floral; it&#x27;s fruity, lightly sweet, and most importantly, made from real ingredients. Best of all, the right kind of people--classy--will notice what you&#x27;re wearing.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfumes for work and play! A sweet, girly fragrance that I always get compliments when wearing!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this beautiful spray many many times in different stores from $60 and up.&lt;br /&gt;This seller has the real thing...packaging,beautiful bottle and most importantly the fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended and I bought it from this seller and the price was 50% off than I would have at other large department or boutique stores.</li>
            <li> My daughters favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume. It smells amazing. Fast shipping, huge bottle, great price. I get so many compliments when I wear this spray!</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells and comes in great glass bottle. I have all her scents and love them all. will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume by Jessica Simpson. I tend to buy everything of her products. I bought this at Christmas and still have a ton left. Will probably last until this Christmas, lol.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same perfume that sold in the stores. It&#x27;s lighter takes more sprays so the person I gave it to is not really happy with it. It was a Christmas present. I would not buy it again and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anybody else thank you</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter. She asked for it for Christmas. She was thrilled to get it and loves it!</li>
            <li> Delicious sweet perfume</li>
            <li> The bottle looks gaudy and the smell ? Likewise, like wise. I mean, the smell&#x27;s cheap as swell.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t recommend this to anyone at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with lots of cologne and have smelled lots of perfume and this is not deserving of all the nearly perfect reviews on amazon.  Dont get me wrong it smells ok but there are way better scents out there.  The 3 stars is based on the value of a 3.4 oz bottle for 25 bux and the fact that my girlfriend likes it.</li>
            <li> I love fancy  has a Wonderful scent. Sweet and strong  It is a very good perfume.  Would buy again and again!!!!</li>
            <li> you guys really were right on point, I love the way my Product was packaged and  my package I&#x27;ve wanted this Fancy for a long time to own so thanks so much for your service&#x27;s....</li>
            <li> I ran out of this perfume and found it here for a great price! It is a pefect everyday kind of smell...not too strong....but lasts the ENTIRE day...I kid you not. On top of it...it was deliver in three business days and was in new condition - not tampered with. I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but had to since I am very happy with my purchase :)</li>
            <li> My wife likes it though.</li>
            <li> smells like flowers in a sunny garden</li>
            <li> Just love this fragrance get alot of compliments on this I will be reordering. Came fast too. The fragrance isnt that strong either.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell like the original Jessica Simpson</li>
            <li> great perfume smells really goog</li>
            <li> It smells great, a light sweet scent like you just stepped out of the shower. Great price for a perfume this size.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing. It&#x27;s a mix of vanilla, caramel, and a little musk. You only need one spritz! It came in the original box and is a huge bottle for the price. Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I think my wife owns all the versions of fancy by J.S. This one is also a great perfume with a really nice scent.</li>
            <li> Omg i am in love with this perfume ,this thing smell so good and fresh .When i smelled it from this lady i had to order it for myself .I ordered it with many other things and i received it first .Thanks for the great communication and fast shipping ,Definitely will be ordering one soon because mine is done .</li>
            <li> very mild vanilla scent. my boyfriend loves it on me too. i highly recommend to those wholike vanilla sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff since I can&#x27;t find it anywhere and when I do it&#x27;s a arm and a leg so really happy I found this here</li>
            <li> the best I every had. people need to try this.it stays on for a long time to enjoy so buy now.</li>
            <li> Really amazing, but for someone who like really sweet perfums.. i wear this and i can smell it all day long..i&#x27;ll definitely buy again soon</li>
            <li> Jessica is amazing and I love it....</li>
            <li> Love it! Will buy again</li>
            <li> this is the best smelling perfume ever. for example, i thought i would try some Lush perfumes, just for something different, tried 7 different scents, none of them were anywhere near being this great. i get compliments on this scent EVERY time i wear it. i love it, my bf loves it, even my jerk brother said i smelled good. its sweet and flowery but not overpowering. everyone i know is a fan and if you are thinking about ordering it scent unsmelled, i don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really love this. When you first spray it, it&#x27;s alittle strong. It kind of had a powder smell to it. Let it sit for a few minutes before judging and you&#x27;ll start smelling vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;So it starts off smelling like powder and when it sets, it smells like vanilla. I love it. I also always get people asking what I&#x27;m wearing. Guys seem to really love the smell most.</li>
            <li> I LOVE-LOVE-LOVE THIS PERFUME! IT IS MY FAVORITE PERFUME OUT THERE... AND AS WE KNOW, THERE ARE SO MANY GREAT ONES. THIS WAS IS THE &amp;#34;VERY&amp;#34; BEST OF ALL THOUGH (WELL FOR ME ANYWAYS). THERE ISN&#x27;T A TIME WHEN I WEAR THIS SMELL, THAT I DO NOT GET A COMPILMENT FROM SOMEONE. I RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL. IT WAS SHIPPED WHEN IT SAID IT WOULD TOO. I RECOMMEND AND I GIVE IT 5 STARS.</li>
            <li> My daughter  loves the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great wonderful long-lasting gourmand for anyone to enjoy at this reasonable price. Sweet like your favorite dessert but also a little interesting.Perfect for all ages.</li>
            <li> This scent is perfect for any age. When Jessica first brought out \\&quot;Fancy\\&quot;, my 2 youngest adults daughters requested it for Christmas. When it first came out, I could only find it at a few select stores and it was a bit pricey. I finally found a really big gift set with 3 items in it and decided to split it between the girls. After I tried it myself, I was hooked. My youngest who is 27, and I both got gift sets or the big bottle today for Christmas, today. I now have all of her \\&quot;Fancy\\&quot; scents. The only one I can&#x27;t wear, but like, is \\&quot;Fancy Nights\\&quot; because of the cinnamon base, which I&#x27;m allergic to.</li>
            <li> Great price and arrived fast!!</li>
            <li> My all time fave perfume</li>
            <li> The original one I bought from Macy&#x27;s had a lasting fragrance (at least 6 hours). This one dissipates within 30 mins and starts fading after 5-10 mins. Don&#x27;t waste your money..it&#x27;s a fake!</li>
            <li> Smells so good--I bought this after asking my cousin what she was wearing, and I&#x27;ve already had someone compliment me on this perfume!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume and Amazon was the cheapest I found it. Everytime I wear it someone always asks me what perfume I am wearing. I get complements all the time on it. Best thing is it drives my husband wild lol</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this perfume my favorite fragrance and it&#x27;s not overly expensive</li>
            <li> My fiancé loves it...</li>
            <li> My favorite great price</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know the fragance, I bought it for the comments. I&#x27;m not regret about it. It&#x27;s completely delicious!! Thanks</li>
            <li> My wife liked the perfume for Valentine&#x27;s day and I did nott have to sleep on the couch!  Hurray :)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great quality.</li>
            <li> Worst perfume ever!! I&#x27;ve got it as gifts multiple times &#x27;re-gifted it immediately. It smells so strongly of baby powder I can&#x27;t stand it</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell right. I think I purchased the wrong kind... but good price!</li>
            <li> i love this perfume every since my mom brought it for me, it smells great! i highly recommened this product to be out of stock soon.. IT&#x27;S GREAT!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> it is the favorite of my granddaughter so I buy it for her</li>
            <li> I enjoy Fancy, have lots of complements on it.</li>
            <li> it was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume! I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years now and I always get compliments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. I can&#x27;t really describe the smell but I can say that this fragrance has lasting power which can be a problem with some less expensive perfumes. I spray this on in the morning and I can still smell it when I get ready to shower at night.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent! I have been searching for a Perfume that has an Apricot/Nectarine smell and was on the sweeter side without being sickeningly sweet. This is exactly what I wanted! It&#x27;s sweet without being too sweet or little girly, yet also has a nice sandalwood vanilla scent with some floral thrown in. Now, I don&#x27;t know if any of you are Bath and Body Works fans, but I&#x27;m a huge one and the closest thing I can compare this to is Forever Sunshine which is actually one of my favorite BABW scents. In fact, I usually pair it with my Forever Sunshine body cream and it smells divine together. Hope this helps with anyone considering buying the perfume. I&#x27;m always receiving compliments whenever I wear it and I highly recommend this to any woman who wants a sophisticated sweet scent with a touch of vanilla and floral.</li>
            <li> I love it, and came super fast!! and good price</li>
            <li> We bought this perfume for our daughter&#x27;s 25th birthday and she absolutely loves it.  She says it smells clean and fresh and makes her feel lovely.</li>
            <li> Smells soooo good! My friend wore it to my house and every since I knew I had to purchase it, it&#x27;s very feminine and soft smelling. I am not sure if it is long lasting since I have not wore it yet but damn it smells delicious!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this scent.  Get many compliments .</li>
            <li> Large size and a great smelling perfume.  It was way cheaper here than in the stores.  Glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and smells amazing. Men love it.</li>
            <li> Smells great, affordable!</li>
            <li> I love the parfuem...but I have had it before and its much darker and smells stronger ..this looks weak and smells weak</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great! I am not going to lie and when I saw a Jessica Simpson perfume I wasn&#x27;t interested in even trying it. I was given a sample and glad loved it. I always make sure i have a bottle. It is also priced nicely.</li>
            <li> My sister introduced me to this scent and I always thought it smelled nice on her and was impressed how long the scent lasted. So I bought myself a bottle and am now a huge fan! My ex told me the first thing he noticed about me was how good I smelled so I can thank Jessica Simpson for that! Even the barista at a little coffee shop I go to has complimented this scent and asked what I always wear. It lasts throughout the day especially when I spray it on my hair and clothes. I&#x27;ll put on a sweater that I wore a week ago and it will still smell like this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely the best of all of Jessica Simpson&#x27;s perfumes!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves this cologne.  I purchase one everytime she runs outl</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT FRAGRANCE AND PRICE WAS FAR BELOW STORE PRICES&lt;br /&gt;MY SWEETHEART LOVED IT</li>
            <li> excelente producto, la presentacion es muy bella y la fragancia es muy rica y es bastante duradera el olor en el cuerpo</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes, I just can&#x27;t believe the awesome price I got this for on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I have bought this perfume for my wife and my sister. They both love it. I recommend any guy get this for their spouse. It smells like candy! I recently recommended it for a friend of mine to get for his wife. She loved it too. Great pricing, fast shipping, good quality product.</li>
            <li> The greatest price around.Me and my daughters love this perfume, and even thought I bought some for them at Christmas, I could not pass this great price up.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells delicious! and its nice because its not a very popular smell like how everyone wears victorias secret. i found that everytime i wear this around guys they love it! Everyone i give the name of it out to ends up buying it. My brother buys it for all his girlfriends now. lol</li>
