            <li>Very happy with them.</li>
            <li>Great quality -- great price!!  </li>
            <li>These powder puffs for compacts are perfect- great quality and price.  </li>
            <li>Happy with my product</li>
            <li>Great deal, nice product.</li>
            <li>They absolutely fit perfectly in all of my pressed powder compacts.</li>
            <li>Good for the price, does the job.</li>
            <li>but this one seems good.</li>
            <li>I WAS SOOOOO NICE</li>
            <li>They fit into a regular compact, the quality is good and the price is excellent.</li>
            <li>Lays on powder foundation very smoothly.</li>
            <li>I will pay wholesale prices from here on out and grab a better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>OK for putting make up on I guess.  </li>
            <li>Just what I wanted and 20 in the package was a great value and will last a good while.  </li>
            <li>I go through a lot of these, a clean puff is the best thing to keep skin clear.  </li>
            <li>Great shipping would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Ribbon on top makes them easy to hold.</li>
            <li>So handy and such a great value.</li>
            <li>Great powder rounds, very soft.</li>
            <li>puffs work fine.</li>
            <li>Would definitely buy again- a great deal.  </li>
            <li>the original pad, thusfar.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can just get a clean one.</li>
            <li>when I order more, the old pouch can store eyeliners, mascaras, etc...</li>
            <li>You will not be able to get your fingers in the satin if you are an adult.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as describes.</li>
            <li>And I think they actually even included some extras :)</li>
            <li>I bought these makeup powder puffs because I&#x27;ve noticed that a cotton puff enables powder to be applied more smoothly AND because they&#x27;re shown with a ribbon which makes a small puff much easier to pick up.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I paid so much for these including the shipping costs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s worth value for money as I like to change my puff frequently .</li>
            <li>This is cheaper than buying them at the store, and keeping them in bulk is very convenient.</li>
            <li>and it was delivered fast.</li>
            <li>I can now change out soiled powder puffs without worrying about spending too much money.</li>
            <li>For the price you pay for puffs in the drug store, this deal was better hands down.</li>
            <li>The puffs I received are indeed 2-1/8 inches in diameter and their thickness is much heavier than one in a new pressed powder compact that I just received from a well-known company.  </li>
            <li>I like them just fine though I would like to try and find them in a larger size next time.</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>These are tiny tiny tiny and the fibers are kind of low quality.</li>
            <li>soft and comfy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good...does as well as</li>
            <li>I was surprised when they came in a clear make-up-brush type bag instead of a standard sealed package like u would find if buying from a drug store,  but doesn&#x27;t seem to effect the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>Not a single one in the entire package has this ribbon.</li>

            <li> AND they come in a heavy vinyl/plastic resealable pouch-</li>

            <li> The powder compacts outlast the puffs (big time), so I bought this package to keep on hand when the old puffs that are sold with the compact become too grunchy and disgusting.</li>

            <li> I bought these makeup powder puffs because I&#x27;ve noticed that a cotton puff enables powder to be applied more smoothly AND because they&#x27;re shown with a ribbon which makes a small puff much easier to pick up.  The puffs I received are indeed 2-1/8 inches in diameter and their thickness is much heavier than one in a new pressed powder compact that I just received from a well-known company.  Unfortunately, what arrived isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s picturedâ€”-as others have commented there is no ribbon on any of them, so I&#x27;ve had to rate them just 3 stars because I have to work at picking up the puff.  Annoying.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these powder puffs are quite tiny.  They were advertised as 2 1/8th inches in diameter; however, to my measurements, they are only 2 inches.... big difference, in my opinion.  DAME HILDA</li>
            <li> One of the best values I have found on amazon. AND they come in a heavy vinyl/plastic resealable pouch-when I order more, the old pouch can store eyeliners, mascaras, etc... Great shipping would highly recommend. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great quality -- great price!!  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I just wasn&#x27;t paying attention. I paid so much for these including the shipping costs. I was so disappointed in myself as a competent human being that I paid so much for these things. I will pay wholesale prices from here on out and grab a better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The puffs work fine. I have not tried to wash one and see if it is reusable.</li>
            <li> So handy and such a great value. These will travel well and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I only ordered these as the picture shows a ribbon to put a finger or 2 through. Not a single one in the entire package has this ribbon.</li>
            <li> I use these puffs to spread powdered charcoal onto my art boards. They&#x27;re small enough to render skies and clouds. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as describes. Very soft. Lays on powder foundation very smoothly. Ribbon on top makes them easy to hold. Would definitely order again. Considering price per puff this is a food value.</li>
            <li> I go through a lot of these, a clean puff is the best thing to keep skin clear.  They fit into a regular compact, the quality is good and the price is excellent.</li>
            <li> Great powder rounds, very soft.

And I think they actually even included some extras :)</li>
            <li> Great deal, nice product. I use these like crazy !</li>
            <li> They do the job they were meant to.  I like them just fine though I would like to try and find them in a larger size next time.</li>
            <li> These makeup pads are sturdy and everything expected. The pads are in a re-sealable heavy-duty ziplock type bag. The pads last a lot longer than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> NOPE! These are tiny tiny tiny and the fibers are kind of low quality. You will not be able to get your fingers in the satin if you are an adult. :S</li>
            <li> soft and comfy.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth value for money as I like to change my puff frequently .</li>
            <li> As a MUA I go through powder puffs like crazy! I put the puff on my pinky finger so I don&#x27;t touch the face I WAS SOOOOO NICE TO FIND THESE SMALLER ONES! The PERFECT size for the job, I am ordering again tonight!</li>
            <li> These powder puffs for compacts are perfect- great quality and price.  The powder compacts outlast the puffs (big time), so I bought this package to keep on hand when the old puffs that are sold with the compact become too grunchy and disgusting. This is cheaper than buying them at the store, and keeping them in bulk is very convenient. Would definitely buy again- a great deal.  They absolutely fit perfectly in all of my pressed powder compacts.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for my homemade body powder. Very happy with them.</li>
            <li> OK for putting make up on I guess.  No use at all as a powder puff.</li>
            <li> Happy with my product and it was delivered fast.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and 20 in the package was a great value and will last a good while.  Small size for loose or compact powder, now I don&#x27;t need to wash and reuse I can just get a clean one.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no pick up holder. It was different with pictures.</li>
            <li> Good for the price, does the job.</li>
            <li> For the price you pay for puffs in the drug store, this deal was better hands down. Same quality as the puffs that come in compacts if not better. I can now change out soiled powder puffs without worrying about spending too much money. Will definitely order bulk size again.</li>
            <li> So far so good...does as well as the original pad, thusfar.&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy replacement pads that fell apart in less than a week...but this one seems good.</li>
