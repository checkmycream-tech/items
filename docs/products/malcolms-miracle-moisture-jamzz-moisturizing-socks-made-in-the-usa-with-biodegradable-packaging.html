            <li>I put lotion on my feet every night and these are wonderful to place over the lotion.</li>
            <li>for nighttime these are the BEST!  </li>
            <li>Works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>My foot spa treatment worked wonderfully with them-</li>
            <li>a perfect gift, which says it all \\&quot; with love\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Safety, comfort and health benefits - perfect combination!  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>She has been happily wearing these for months.</li>
            <li>These socks with some good lotion (we like O&#x27;Keefes) are the ticket.  </li>
            <li>THey do look good and launder well.</li>
            <li>i love these socks!  </li>
            <li>Use every night with my favorite moisturizing lotion!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cute and I love them!</li>
            <li>the company has excellent customer service and i will use no other gloves or socks for nighttime moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t very comfortable.</li>
            <li>comfortable and effective</li>
            <li>I love these except for the seams.  </li>
            <li>Nice fit</li>
            <li>LOVE IS THE WORD.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I bought these socks with okeefes healthy feet cream.</li>
            <li>I find it better to wear the seam on the inside so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>The malcolms miracle love moisture</li>
            <li>i used to use my thorlos night and day but while they are very nice, they are too much for the nighttime.  </li>
            <li>Pretty great little item for a great price.</li>
            <li>They will fit your feet snugly; I tested them out myself and wear a size 10.</li>
            <li>hands smooth instead of just wiping off without anything to hold the cream on.</li>
            <li>my feet stay warm but not sweaty and the medication i must use for my sclerodermic arthritis is just enough occluded to remain effective.  </li>
            <li>They stay on great and feel comfortable as long as I get the seam at the toe so that it doesn&#x27;t rub.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay, but since it runs large, I don&#x27;t find it helpful to wear at night, which I believe is the point of these socks.</li>
            <li>I am or ding to more pair very soon.</li>
            <li>The idea is great, but I don&#x27;t find this does anything that wouldn&#x27;t be achieved by using a pair of regular short socks that I already own.</li>
            <li>Winter is always a challenge for me to keep my heels nice and soft.</li>
            <li>They were comfortable to wear and held the moisture pretty well.</li>
            <li>ALL SHOULD KNOW LOVE IS THE WORD TO LIVE YOUR LIFE.</li>
            <li>I love to juse them with my foot cream, Although I give them 5 stars, I would love a loose cuff.</li>
            <li>fabric is butter soft, and fits \\&quot; like a glove\\&quot; on my feet!&lt;br /&gt;I am really impressed as I tried other socks before these, which either lost their shape or started fraying pretty</li>
            <li>so great after a little at home pedicure</li>
            <li>I also bought a pedi grinder from qvc - basically battery operated sand paper that is great to take off the dead skin once a week.</li>
            <li>Because of their mostly cotton content and smooth texture they are the only socks my feet can tolerate -</li>
            <li>I own many pairs of the Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle socks in solid white (wish they were offered on Amazon).  </li>
            <li>This is EXACTLY  what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>That way there is no issues with a dryer getting to hot for any elastic properties or aging the garment too soon.</li>
            <li>Really keep toes toasty for a diabetic that helps</li>
            <li>These work better than I expected them to.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>A real life changer</li>
            <li>This works really well for putting on lotion on my feet at night.</li>
            <li>I have not had any problems getting used to the &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; shape and find that these socks stay up on my leg better than other materials which tend to stretch and fall to my ankles.  </li>
            <li>wash / hang dry easily too.  </li>
            <li>My only wish is that the maker would produce more of these in solid colors.</li>
            <li>Shape makes it hard to place on foot and fit snug.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>My feet slip around in the socks right after rubbing in the cream and putting on the socks, thus I have to wait until I&#x27;m completely ready for bed before using the socks, otherwise I was worried about slipping and falling when I got out of bed to get a glass of water before I went to sleep.</li>
            <li>I do not add lotion to my feet because, as some have pointed out, it can soak through the material and stain other surfaces but, the close fit does help retain natural moisture without making your feet too moist.  </li>
            <li>but the socks aren&#x27;t as tight a fit as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>I would give them 5 stars as they do hold the moisture in resulting in soft feet</li>
            <li>The fabric is soft  and does not lose it&#x27;s shape.  </li>
            <li>Both the socks and the gloves seem to do the trick as far as holding in the cream to make feet and</li>
            <li>Product as described; the socks stay in place with no slipping and wash well.</li>
            <li>Not too tight around your leg--not too hot.</li>
            <li>Occasionally I do have to adjust the seam if I&#x27;ve had them all day but the benefit to my feet is worth that small inconvenience.  </li>
            <li>but it is just a tube sock, straight and tight at the ankle.</li>

            <li> i would not recommend it.the color should be anything other than white.</li>
            <li> I bought these to help with my dry, cracked feet.</li>
            <li> The socks aren&#x27;t all that and are on the short side, so if you have trouble with dry skin at the back of your ankle, these socks aren&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> So I really only need one sock for one foot but usually go ahead and put some regular lotion on the other and donn the socks on both to prevent bed clothing getting soiled from the cremes.</li>
            <li> all they are  are plain socks last time i bought moisturzing socks they had cream in them  </li>
            <li> could not use these after putting lotion on my feet, as the material is very thin and the lotion bled right through</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t notice any moisturizing advantage as compared to other socks.</li>
            <li> This is not really worth the money.</li>
            <li> it is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them so far in application of sports cremes to a bad foot I have from an old injury and break.</li>
            <li> The rough texture of other socks and the nylon used in dress socks are extremely irritating to my condition.  </li>
            <li> She also said that the socks are fairly small and she&#x27;s got small feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I washed mine in the machine but in a small mesh bag I have for doing compression wraps and socks and gloves</li>
            <li> My wife is always complaining about how hard and flaky her feet are.  </li>
            <li> SUCKS</li>
            <li> When they arrived, I realized immediately that they had no shape (just tubes) and fit feet horribly.  </li>
            <li> She said the socks aren&#x27;t shaped like a typical foot shaped sock at all so they are difficult to wear and keep on.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, the seam is sewn across the toes so they are somewhat uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time.</li>
            <li> softest feet in the chilly north east.</li>
            <li> I wore them one night and found them very uncomfortable.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I purchased these socks for my sister who is currently going through chemotherapy. She said the socks aren&#x27;t shaped like a typical foot shaped sock at all so they are difficult to wear and keep on. They aren&#x27;t very comfortable. She also said that the socks are fairly small and she&#x27;s got small feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;October 2013 Update: The seller reached out to me and sent me a replacement pair. Please note that these socks do come in a tube form. They will fit your feet snugly; I tested them out myself and wear a size 10. They were comfortable to wear and held the moisture pretty well. I washed them once and they kept their shape.</li>
            <li> comfortable and effective</li>
            <li> seems to work and can be worn under socks</li>
            <li> I put lotion on my feet every night and these are wonderful to place over the lotion. The tops are not binding and there is NO elastic to bother you during your sleep. I also wear them underneath some of my slippers sometimes.  They&#x27;re cute and I love them!</li>
            <li> I love these except for the seams.  If you don&#x27;t pay attention to where they are they can bother your toes at night.  So if you pay attention, no problem.  They serve the purpose, don&#x27;t cut off circulation and hand wash / hang dry easily too.  Pretty great little item for a great price.</li>
            <li> the picture makes you think it forms the foot but it is just a tube sock, straight and tight at the ankle.</li>
            <li> Get yourself some inexpensive white tube socks and save some cash.  The socks aren&#x27;t all that and are on the short side, so if you have trouble with dry skin at the back of your ankle, these socks aren&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> Socks do what they are suppose just feel not well made. I am or ding to more pair very soon. Really keep toes toasty for a diabetic that helps</li>
            <li> I would give them 5 stars as they do hold the moisture in resulting in soft feet HOWEVER, the seam is sewn across the toes so they are somewhat uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time.</li>
            <li> These work better than I expected them to.  Nice fit and I would definitely buy again and I would also give them as gifts.</li>
            <li> This is EXACTLY  what I wanted.  The fabric is soft  and does not lose it&#x27;s shape.  After applying lotion, the product keeps&lt;br /&gt;the  moisture in yet can breath.</li>
            <li> I love to juse them with my foot cream, Although I give them 5 stars, I would love a loose cuff. If the legs or feet have a tendency to swell they can cut circulation.</li>
            <li> This is not really worth the money. It&#x27;s just okay, but since it runs large, I don&#x27;t find it helpful to wear at night, which I believe is the point of these socks. My feet slip around in the socks right after rubbing in the cream and putting on the socks, thus I have to wait until I&#x27;m completely ready for bed before using the socks, otherwise I was worried about slipping and falling when I got out of bed to get a glass of water before I went to sleep. The idea is great, but I don&#x27;t find this does anything that wouldn&#x27;t be achieved by using a pair of regular short socks that I already own.</li>
            <li> it is not worth the money. i would not recommend it.the color should be anything other than white. maybe someother color.</li>
            <li> I like the gloves for hands but the socks aren&#x27;t as tight a fit as I&#x27;d like. But they seem to stay on and wash well. I washed mine in the machine but in a small mesh bag I have for doing compression wraps and socks and gloves I also have. I only air dry removing the garments from the bag then and smoothing out and allowing to dry naturally. That way there is no issues with a dryer getting to hot for any elastic properties or aging the garment too soon. Or shrinking for that matter. These are made in the USA. Fabric isnt stated where it&#x27;s from. I&#x27;m not convinced these are fully leak proof. But I haven&#x27;t noticed any problems. I&#x27;ve used them so far in application of sports cremes to a bad foot I have from an old injury and break. So I really only need one sock for one foot but usually go ahead and put some regular lotion on the other and donn the socks on both to prevent bed clothing getting soiled from the cremes.</li>
            <li> this socks suck where is the moisturizing cream don&#x27;t call them moisture socks all they are  are plain socks last time i bought moisturzing socks they had cream in them  THESE SUCKS</li>
            <li> SOCKS IT TO ME, HELPS KEEP THE MEDICINE ON MY FEET, I LIKE EM. I LIKE &#x27;EM A LOT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.  LOVE IS THE WORD. ALL SHOULD KNOW LOVE IS THE WORD TO LIVE YOUR LIFE.</li>
            <li> i love these socks!  my feet stay warm but not sweaty and the medication i must use for my sclerodermic arthritis is just enough occluded to remain effective.  i used to use my thorlos night and day but while they are very nice, they are too much for the nighttime.  these keep my raynaud&#x27;s disease from turning my toes blue without the weight of the thorlos.  for nighttime these are the BEST!  the company has excellent customer service and i will use no other gloves or socks for nighttime moisturizing.  they work so well after my paraffin foot bath! Hooray for Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle!</li>
            <li> Use every night with my favorite moisturizing lotion! Not too tight around your leg--not too hot. Works wonderfully. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Both the socks and the gloves seem to do the trick as far as holding in the cream to make feet and hands smooth instead of just wiping off without anything to hold the cream on.</li>
            <li> I ordered these foot socks as a treat for myself- and I am so glad I did. My foot spa treatment worked wonderfully with them- I already see an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;The fabric is butter soft, and fits \\&quot; like a glove\\&quot; on my feet!&lt;br /&gt;I am really impressed as I tried other socks before these, which either lost their shape or started fraying pretty soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to give these \\&quot;love\\&quot; socks as gifts this holiday season.&lt;br /&gt;What a perfect gift, which says it all \\&quot; with love\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> do not fix like a sock</li>
            <li> so great after a little at home pedicure</li>
            <li> could not use these after putting lotion on my feet, as the material is very thin and the lotion bled right through</li>
            <li> Shape makes it hard to place on foot and fit snug.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was quick. Also bought Bamboo socks, have yet to try and compare.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to use these socks to help moisturize my feet.  When they arrived, I realized immediately that they had no shape (just tubes) and fit feet horribly.  They stretch at the heel and bunch in front of the ankle.  I wore them one night and found them very uncomfortable.  I also didn&#x27;t notice any moisturizing advantage as compared to other socks.</li>
            <li> My wife is always complaining about how hard and flaky her feet are.  So I am always searching for something that would help her out.  These socks with some good lotion (we like O&#x27;Keefes) are the ticket.  She has been happily wearing these for months.</li>
            <li> I bought these to help with my dry, cracked feet. Winter is always a challenge for me to keep my heels nice and soft. I bought these socks with okeefes healthy feet cream. Truly make the difference. I also bought a pedi grinder from qvc - basically battery operated sand paper that is great to take off the dead skin once a week. A real life changer and I&#x27;m no embarrassed to show my winter feet anymore. I use the cream and put on the socks at bedtime only, a nightly ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish there wasnt a seam on the socks. I find it better to wear the seam on the inside so it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> This works really well for putting on lotion on my feet at night. The medication I&#x27;m on causes cracking of the hands and feet so I need to use these at night. They stay on great and feel comfortable as long as I get the seam at the toe so that it doesn&#x27;t rub.</li>
            <li> The malcolms miracle love moisture jamzz moisturizing socks havent seemed to help with my feet.  I havent noticed a difference from their use at this point.  THey do look good and launder well.</li>
            <li> softest feet in the chilly north east.</li>
            <li> Safety, comfort and health benefits - perfect combination!  I just slip these on at home and can walk around in comfort without fear of falling.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Product as described; the socks stay in place with no slipping and wash well.</li>
            <li> I own many pairs of the Malcolm&#x27;s Miracle socks in solid white (wish they were offered on Amazon).  I wear them year-round.  Because of their mostly cotton content and smooth texture they are the only socks my feet can tolerate - you see, I have severe psoriasis on the soles of my feet.  The rough texture of other socks and the nylon used in dress socks are extremely irritating to my condition.  I do not add lotion to my feet because, as some have pointed out, it can soak through the material and stain other surfaces but, the close fit does help retain natural moisture without making your feet too moist.  I have not had any problems getting used to the &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; shape and find that these socks stay up on my leg better than other materials which tend to stretch and fall to my ankles.  Occasionally I do have to adjust the seam if I&#x27;ve had them all day but the benefit to my feet is worth that small inconvenience.  My only wish is that the maker would produce more of these in solid colors.</li>
