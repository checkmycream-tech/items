            <li>I am happy with the purchase of the silver gel and it arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Silver Gel is so effective for your skin.  </li>
            <li>It arrived on time, in good shape, and safely.</li>
            <li>I burnt my forearm while baking and this gel has been awesome with healing my wound, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Make sure you use a good conditioner on your hair .</li>
            <li>It was also effective for chaffed butt, bug bites, after shaving, itchy-bumps, and so on.</li>
            <li>As soon as I would get that warm feeling I would put it on and the sore never came out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool to the touch and spreads easy, now all I have to do is wait for the results!!!</li>
            <li>this is definitely worth your while for great tooth care.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the next best thing to Harry Potter magic!</li>
            <li>I love this Silver gel, I use it all the time for cuts, rashes, and cysts.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>use it for so many things!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really interesting how it works.</li>
            <li>I will not be without it any more now that I have found it.</li>
            <li>I heard that silver helps things heal better.</li>
            <li>It also made the burn area feel better too.</li>
            <li>I think it may have, but not 100% sure.</li>
            <li>We love this product and use it for scrapes and cuts.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>My all-time favorite body care gel containing silver.  </li>
            <li>The gel is so soothing for my skin and much better as a moisturizer</li>
            <li>Perfectly safe for children.</li>
            <li>It smoothes my skin, gives it a healthy glow, and protects as it aids in healing.</li>
            <li>This works better than triple antibiotic ointment and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Then I switched to this Silver Gel and the results were much more noticeable.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if this is magic or if it was just a fluke--</li>
            <li>It sure worked better than the gels I have been using.</li>
            <li>works better than the prescribed  cream given by my doctor..</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It is safe to use around the eyes and it has zero smell or color to it.</li>
            <li>Works for many purposes.</li>
            <li>Years ago when I was a rep for E&#x27;OLA I fell totally in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I am confident it will hold its record!&lt;br /&gt;DEFINITELY</li>
            <li>your teeth feel so strong and well set in healthy gums.  </li>
            <li>So far, I am very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic cream for many skin ailments.</li>
            <li>Hands really are looking good.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and apply.</li>
            <li>It is fine as an alternative product, but does not promote healing as described.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>A FANTASTIC PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>that really do nothing more then make you feel  better.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and stays where you put it and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>easy to apply dries quickly does the job and</li>
            <li>Another company adds lavender and tea tree essential oils to make it a stronger antibiotic gel...smells amazing too!  </li>
            <li>My wife used this for her poison oak and had success!</li>
            <li>I am familiar with colloidal silver but the gel helps it stay in place.</li>
            <li>Have not yet seen significant changes in a toe wart.</li>
            <li>Great for skin irritations, burns, dry skin, acne, etc.</li>
            <li>You can google why silver is such a good antibiotic.</li>
            <li>I had a very severe case of poison ivy and the many things I was using was keeping it somewhat under control</li>
            <li>Love this gel - fast delivery</li>
            <li>and I am using it for quick healing.</li>
            <li>It helped my burn heal quickly &amp; its soothing</li>
            <li>It sinks right in, and provides great healing benefits.</li>
            <li>Good but feels dry when it dries.</li>
            <li>definitely works better than this one!</li>
            <li>This is the best kept secret in the health world.</li>
            <li>but that was enough to be sure I always have this product on available.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m certain that each user will have his/her unique results.</li>
            <li>Clears up skin problems pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>This cream claims right on the package that its the &amp;#34;Ultimate Skin &amp; Body Care&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>the price is right</li>
            <li>Right now I am experimenting with my age spots that someone told me</li>
            <li>, I guess you could say, a cooling effect, that as long as I did not hit it, It made it kind of, unnoticeable that it was there.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product to anyone suffering from Acne, it&#x27;s definetly worth a shot!</li>
            <li>It does not dry your skin and you can apply makeup on top without a problem.</li>
            <li>At first i thought it would be too costly to use as a toothpaste, but one tube lasts and lasts.  </li>
            <li>This is a must have for any first aid kit.</li>
            <li>This was the first time for this.</li>
            <li>I first got this to put on a burn to see if it would help any.</li>
            <li>First, it has the consistency of KY jelly (or</li>
            <li>be honest, I can not really say as to if it speed-ed up any healing of the burn or not.</li>
            <li>A must in all first aid kits.</li>
            <li>Now, I have read up on it and am sure that this is the direction to go into an uncertain future.</li>
            <li>the pain that I was feeling minutes before had instantly feeling much better in minutes</li>
            <li>I love this gel and will definitely order again .</li>
            <li>think I&#x27;m going to stick with Sovereign Silver first Aid Gel....</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I bought this after researching Silver Gel on many reputable sites, and decided to try it to help calm down my psoriasis and dry skin on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 4 large tubes.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this making a positive difference.</li>
            <li>but I have watched many webinars and read studies done by medical scientists and this new form of silver</li>
            <li>Takes redness and burns to clear and calm skin.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and it is a fantastic aid to all types of skin ailments.</li>
            <li>and they are healing fast and</li>
            <li>the itching is much less!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We swear by it now for the whole family.</li>
            <li>The real healing began when I went to visit my sister and she had this stuff on hand and told me to try it.</li>
            <li>Recommend having this around your home in case you need it for accidental burns from cooking or too much time in the water</li>
            <li>This stuff makes them go away fast and heals my skin as if it never happened.</li>
            <li>This feels very sticky I would pick another brand gel</li>
            <li>Got too much sun?  </li>
            <li>Really would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Am really grateful.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It is very healing.  </li>
            <li>expected more out of this than I&#x27;m getting.....</li>
            <li>I think this gel really did the trick.</li>
            <li>I had some treatment on my hands and this was recommended for healing, fast scabbing, etc.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had to use it much</li>
            <li>If you use the standard antibacterial gel... but are looking for something a bit more natural, and</li>
            <li>My mom had a cut near her eye that she could not use antibiotics for and this cleared it right up.</li>
            <li>It is good for skin issues such as scars, burns, and other injuries.</li>
            <li>To tell for sure, i would have to compare it, and I am not really willing to burn or cut both or my arms to compare it and find out.</li>
            <li>Put it on a burn and not only does it sooth but the healing process is so quick that it&#x27;s almost miraculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Little kids with eczema that couldn&#x27;t wear shoes was better in 3 days.</li>
            <li>Normally I use what my dermotologist prescribes at night and put this product on during my work day.</li>
            <li>And so reasonably priced too for such a large amount.</li>
            <li>Nobody reacts exactly the same as another so results will vary.</li>
            <li>If I note an acne outbreak I use it 3 times daily and it seems to cut the time in half for it healing as well as often keeping it from becoming a large outbreak.  </li>
            <li>Used this on a skin rash and was a real help, my wife has had a problem, small swelling in the top of her ear and with only one application</li>
            <li>Siver has been used for centuries to kill infection, promote fast healing and restore overall health - it&#x27;s nothing new.  </li>
            <li>Have found that it gives quick relief from several different types of skin irritations.  </li>
            <li>I was raised on homopathic medicine and know the value of natural medicine.</li>
            <li>but so far, I do like it.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive; this may work well for others.</li>
            <li>Stops infection naturally.</li>
            <li>Heals my bug bites and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>We have had success with pink eye, cuts, boils, everything.</li>
            <li>I was feeling it cool down a bit</li>
            <li>I have only had it a short time, maybe  a couple weeks, so i have not used this stuff for any real length of time to say what this stuff will help with, or not.</li>
            <li>Anti-biotics are known to inhibit our bodies natural immune systems and in this age of anti-biotic-resistant disease, we need to find a natural product that will actually partner with our bodies, rather than work against it.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my hands and other dry areas, a fabulous product for daily use.</li>
            <li>It works very well, especially when followed an hour later with a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My daughter just commented yesterday that she was surprised how reduced the scar was, especially that I had healed that rapidly.</li>
            <li>recently had a tick bite near my under arm area and other bug bites that were very itchy and painful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was unbelievable how quickly he healed.</li>
            <li>It heals wounds and scars much faster than other stuff.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really seem to make a difference on acne or other minor cuts</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice anything good or bad.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> There are so many uses, we&#x27;ll always have some in our medicine cabinet!</li>
            <li> Love this Gel !</li>
            <li> I am happy with the purchase of the silver gel and it arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Silver Gel is so effective for your skin.  </li>
            <li> It arrived on time, in good shape, and safely.</li>
            <li> I burnt my forearm while baking and this gel has been awesome with healing my wound, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Make sure you use a good conditioner on your hair .</li>
            <li> It was also effective for chaffed butt, bug bites, after shaving, itchy-bumps, and so on.</li>
            <li> As soon as I would get that warm feeling I would put it on and the sore never came out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool to the touch and spreads easy, now all I have to do is wait for the results!!!</li>
            <li> this is definitely worth your while for great tooth care.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the next best thing to Harry Potter magic!</li>
            <li> I love this Silver gel, I use it all the time for cuts, rashes, and cysts.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> use it for so many things!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really interesting how it works.</li>
            <li> I will not be without it any more now that I have found it.</li>
            <li> I heard that silver helps things heal better.</li>
            <li> It also made the burn area feel better too.</li>
            <li> I think it may have, but not 100% sure.</li>
            <li> We love this product and use it for scrapes and cuts.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> My all-time favorite body care gel containing silver.  </li>
            <li> The gel is so soothing for my skin and much better as a moisturizer</li>
            <li> Perfectly safe for children.</li>
            <li> It smoothes my skin, gives it a healthy glow, and protects as it aids in healing.</li>
            <li> This works better than triple antibiotic ointment and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Then I switched to this Silver Gel and the results were much more noticeable.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if this is magic or if it was just a fluke--</li>
            <li> It sure worked better than the gels I have been using.</li>
            <li> works better than the prescribed  cream given by my doctor..</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It is safe to use around the eyes and it has zero smell or color to it.</li>
            <li> Works for many purposes.</li>
            <li> Years ago when I was a rep for E&#x27;OLA I fell totally in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I am confident it will hold its record!&lt;br /&gt;DEFINITELY</li>
            <li> your teeth feel so strong and well set in healthy gums.  </li>
            <li> So far, I am very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic cream for many skin ailments.</li>
            <li> Hands really are looking good.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and apply.</li>
            <li> It is fine as an alternative product, but does not promote healing as described.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> A FANTASTIC PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> that really do nothing more then make you feel  better.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and stays where you put it and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> easy to apply dries quickly does the job and</li>
            <li> Another company adds lavender and tea tree essential oils to make it a stronger antibiotic gel...smells amazing too!  </li>
            <li> My wife used this for her poison oak and had success!</li>
            <li> I am familiar with colloidal silver but the gel helps it stay in place.</li>
            <li> Have not yet seen significant changes in a toe wart.</li>
            <li> Great for skin irritations, burns, dry skin, acne, etc.</li>
            <li> You can google why silver is such a good antibiotic.</li>
            <li> I had a very severe case of poison ivy and the many things I was using was keeping it somewhat under control</li>
            <li> Love this gel - fast delivery</li>
            <li> and I am using it for quick healing.</li>
            <li> It helped my burn heal quickly &amp; its soothing</li>
            <li> It sinks right in, and provides great healing benefits.</li>
            <li> Good but feels dry when it dries.</li>
            <li> definitely works better than this one!</li>
            <li> This is the best kept secret in the health world.</li>
            <li> but that was enough to be sure I always have this product on available.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m certain that each user will have his/her unique results.</li>
            <li> Clears up skin problems pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The price was right.</li>
            <li> This cream claims right on the package that its the &amp;#34;Ultimate Skin &amp; Body Care&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> the price is right</li>
            <li> Right now I am experimenting with my age spots that someone told me</li>
            <li> , I guess you could say, a cooling effect, that as long as I did not hit it, It made it kind of, unnoticeable that it was there.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product to anyone suffering from Acne, it&#x27;s definetly worth a shot!</li>
            <li> It does not dry your skin and you can apply makeup on top without a problem.</li>
            <li> At first i thought it would be too costly to use as a toothpaste, but one tube lasts and lasts.  </li>
            <li> This is a must have for any first aid kit.</li>
            <li> This was the first time for this.</li>
            <li> I first got this to put on a burn to see if it would help any.</li>
            <li> First, it has the consistency of KY jelly (or</li>
            <li> be honest, I can not really say as to if it speed-ed up any healing of the burn or not.</li>
            <li> A must in all first aid kits.</li>
            <li> Now, I have read up on it and am sure that this is the direction to go into an uncertain future.</li>
            <li> the pain that I was feeling minutes before had instantly feeling much better in minutes</li>
            <li> I love this gel and will definitely order again .</li>
            <li> think I&#x27;m going to stick with Sovereign Silver first Aid Gel....</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I bought this after researching Silver Gel on many reputable sites, and decided to try it to help calm down my psoriasis and dry skin on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I ordered 4 large tubes.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this making a positive difference.</li>
            <li> but I have watched many webinars and read studies done by medical scientists and this new form of silver</li>
            <li> Takes redness and burns to clear and calm skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and it is a fantastic aid to all types of skin ailments.</li>
            <li> and they are healing fast and</li>
            <li> the itching is much less!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We swear by it now for the whole family.</li>
            <li> The real healing began when I went to visit my sister and she had this stuff on hand and told me to try it.</li>
            <li> Recommend having this around your home in case you need it for accidental burns from cooking or too much time in the water</li>
            <li> This stuff makes them go away fast and heals my skin as if it never happened.</li>
            <li> This feels very sticky I would pick another brand gel</li>
            <li> Got too much sun?  </li>
            <li> Really would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Am really grateful.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It is very healing.  </li>
            <li> expected more out of this than I&#x27;m getting.....</li>
            <li> I think this gel really did the trick.</li>
            <li> I had some treatment on my hands and this was recommended for healing, fast scabbing, etc.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had to use it much</li>
            <li> If you use the standard antibacterial gel... but are looking for something a bit more natural, and</li>
            <li> My mom had a cut near her eye that she could not use antibiotics for and this cleared it right up.</li>
            <li> It is good for skin issues such as scars, burns, and other injuries.</li>
            <li> To tell for sure, i would have to compare it, and I am not really willing to burn or cut both or my arms to compare it and find out.</li>
            <li> Put it on a burn and not only does it sooth but the healing process is so quick that it&#x27;s almost miraculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Little kids with eczema that couldn&#x27;t wear shoes was better in 3 days.</li>
            <li> Normally I use what my dermotologist prescribes at night and put this product on during my work day.</li>
            <li> And so reasonably priced too for such a large amount.</li>
            <li> Nobody reacts exactly the same as another so results will vary.</li>
            <li> If I note an acne outbreak I use it 3 times daily and it seems to cut the time in half for it healing as well as often keeping it from becoming a large outbreak.  </li>
            <li> Used this on a skin rash and was a real help, my wife has had a problem, small swelling in the top of her ear and with only one application</li>
            <li> Siver has been used for centuries to kill infection, promote fast healing and restore overall health - it&#x27;s nothing new.  </li>
            <li> Have found that it gives quick relief from several different types of skin irritations.  </li>
            <li> I was raised on homopathic medicine and know the value of natural medicine.</li>
            <li> but so far, I do like it.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive; this may work well for others.</li>
            <li> Stops infection naturally.</li>
            <li> Heals my bug bites and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> We have had success with pink eye, cuts, boils, everything.</li>
            <li> I was feeling it cool down a bit</li>
            <li> I have only had it a short time, maybe  a couple weeks, so i have not used this stuff for any real length of time to say what this stuff will help with, or not.</li>
            <li> Anti-biotics are known to inhibit our bodies natural immune systems and in this age of anti-biotic-resistant disease, we need to find a natural product that will actually partner with our bodies, rather than work against it.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my hands and other dry areas, a fabulous product for daily use.</li>
            <li> It works very well, especially when followed an hour later with a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My daughter just commented yesterday that she was surprised how reduced the scar was, especially that I had healed that rapidly.</li>
            <li> recently had a tick bite near my under arm area and other bug bites that were very itchy and painful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was unbelievable how quickly he healed.</li>
            <li> It heals wounds and scars much faster than other stuff.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really seem to make a difference on acne or other minor cuts</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice anything good or bad.</li>
            <li> one bad enough that it blistered up over about a 1 1/2&amp;#34; long area, so there is not really anything that will make it feel good, but it had</li>
            <li> The mark left was just a little darker then my normal skin tone, and is not very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> what a let down after reading all those great reviews :(</li>
            <li> just a little thinner then toothpaste), not really thick, but not really runny either.</li>
            <li> A  LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t long</li>
            <li> It does not take a long time to absorb into your skin either..</li>
            <li> My Dr. froze it with liquid nitrogen and it was slightly smaller but not much.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have found this product long time ago</li>
            <li> Use this for facial tenderness if I should get tender from treatments and it settles in down instantly!</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d known about the Silver Gel a long time ago!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this skin gel several times for extreme dry skin patches and it seems to work well.</li>
            <li> I used this daily with my moisturizer and nightly after washing my face mixed with a few drops of argan oil.</li>
            <li> I also get less white heads on my face when using this product .</li>
            <li> I used it on a rash which appeared on my little girl&#x27;s neck, and the rash disappeared nearly instantly.</li>
            <li> but just wanted to be out off this pain when I apply the gel I lay on my back for a few minutes</li>
            <li> This really dried my skin out and left a dark patch on my forehead...</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> are some other things that I can say about it.</li>
            <li> I use this product on skin abrasions and other cuts scrapes.</li>
            <li> I have used it on a severe burn that was about and inch or two in size and the burn completely disappeared and left no scar behind!</li>
            <li> I have previously posted reviews on other sizes of the ASAP Silver Gel.</li>
            <li> the dark patch of skin took 2 weeks to shed...</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t help I had to sit down for minutes because of the pain</li>
            <li> The blisters are gone in 3 days and the scab is gone in less than 10 days.  </li>
            <li> I was in so much pain a run to the bathroom to wash my eyes with cold water</li>
            <li> I could tell some difference in just a few hours.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money, don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I bought this product, put a dab on the bump a couple of times over the course of a few days and this bump has gone away.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using this gel on my face everyday after I shower, I havent had any coldsores at all.</li>
            <li> not sure if it would have worked a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I was having an allergic reaction to something, but the gel took care of it.</li>
            <li> I applied this immediately to a small scratch I got</li>
            <li> Whenever I feel like I am coming down with a cold, I put a little bit of ASAP Silver gel on my lymph nodes on my neck and arm pits and rub it in morning and night, for a few days</li>
            <li> are three layer of skin thick.  </li>
            <li> I dab it on the lesion approximately 10-12 times a day.  </li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> Due to meds I am on, my skin is extremely thin and a small bump or scratch will results in a horrible looking blood blister.  </li>

            <li> This is really a great skin product.  Had some skin infections and it got rid of it.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist says it is good anti fungal plus anti-infection. It heals wounds and scars much faster than other stuff. Also good for fungus on your nails.</li>
            <li> PERFECT PRODUCT WORTH THE MONEY $17.00 - A LOT GOES A  LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> I love this Silver gel, I use it all the time for cuts, rashes, and cysts.</li>
            <li> You need to try it to believe how good this gel is!</li>
            <li> My wife used this for her poison oak and had success!</li>
            <li> Great product! Will order again!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Whenever I feel like I am coming down with a cold, I put a little bit of ASAP Silver gel on my lymph nodes on my neck and arm pits and rub it in morning and night, for a few days and I don&#x27;t get sick. Or if I do, it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I use it for lots of thing&#x27;s. It is easy to apply and stays where you put it and absorbs quickly. I have had a number of cuts and scrapes and have applied it and it wasn&#x27;t long it was healing with no redness.</li>
            <li> Every person that works as a EMS to civilian has to carry the liqid 30ppm and this 24ppm gel. This will waylay anthrax and Hiv/aids blood fluids exposed to you extremities</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;I use it for so many things!&lt;br /&gt;I recently had a tick bite near my under arm area and other bug bites that were very itchy and painful.&lt;br /&gt;I started using the collodial silver gel on them and they are healing fast and the itching is much less!&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this product on severe cuts, burns, and tooth ache!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great!!&lt;br /&gt;Stocking up!!</li>
            <li> I used this daily with my moisturizer and nightly after washing my face mixed with a few drops of argan oil. If I note an acne outbreak I use it 3 times daily and it seems to cut the time in half for it healing as well as often keeping it from becoming a large outbreak.  Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> They can&#x27;t tell you this but I have watched many webinars and read studies done by medical scientists and this new form of silver is healing everything from cuts and sores to MRSA and Malaria!! It&#x27;s incredible. I use it on anything. Burns, rashes, use it for lube during sex to kill bacteria, it kills fungus so I use it if I start itching... I use the liquid to brush my teeth and more! Gargle if I feel a sore throat coming on.. Nasal spray for sinuses. YOu name it. This stuff is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> of the many applications brushing teeth is the best!  like swishing with coconut oil strengthens the teeth this also does it but with just brushing.  your teeth feel so strong and well set in healthy gums.  At first i thought it would be too costly to use as a toothpaste, but one tube lasts and lasts.  this is definitely worth your while for great tooth care.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the next best thing to Harry Potter magic! Seriously! My husband rides road bikes competitively. He had a bad accident and his doctor recommended he use this on his road rash and stitches. It was unbelievable how quickly he healed. You can google why silver is such a good antibiotic. It&#x27;s really interesting how it works. We swear by it now for the whole family. This is a must have for any first aid kit. And so reasonably priced too for such a large amount.</li>
            <li> I had a very severe case of poison ivy and the many things I was using was keeping it somewhat under control but I was miserable. The real healing began when I went to visit my sister and she had this stuff on hand and told me to try it. I could tell some difference in just a few hours. I applied it several times that evening and she gave me the rest to take home. There wasn&#x27;t much left. We stopped at a couple of health food stores looking for it on the trip home to no avail so I went on line and found it on Amazon. The price was right. I ordered 4 large tubes. I am familiar with colloidal silver but the gel helps it stay in place. I love it! I will not be without it any more now that I have found it. It is great stuff.</li>
            <li> I was raised on homopathic medicine and know the value of natural medicine. This was the first time for this. It immediately relieved the pain and the 3rd degree sunburn damage has healed . Recommend having this around your home in case you need it for accidental burns from cooking or too much time in the water</li>
            <li> I first got this to put on a burn to see if it would help any. I heard that silver helps things heal better. I can say this, putting it on the burn did dramatically reduce the scarring where the burn was. It also made the burn area feel better too. Granted, it is a burn, one bad enough that it blistered up over about a 1 1/2&amp;#34; long area, so there is not really anything that will make it feel good, but it had, I guess you could say, a cooling effect, that as long as I did not hit it, It made it kind of, unnoticeable that it was there. until i bumped it that is. The mark left was just a little darker then my normal skin tone, and is not very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some other things that I can say about it. First, it has the consistency of KY jelly (or just a little thinner then toothpaste), not really thick, but not really runny either. It is easy to use and apply. It does not take a long time to absorb into your skin either.. maybe a couple minutes.. and leaves no greasy feel afterwards either. I got some mosquito bites, and put some of this stuff on them, and the mosquito bites stopped itching almost instantly. I looked the next morning, and there were no marks left from the mosquito bites either. I could not tell I was ever bitten. I gave some to bob because of the same thing, and he had the same results from the mosquito bites too. In that aspect, this stuff is great for camping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to be honest, I can not really say as to if it speed-ed up any healing of the burn or not. I think it may have, but not 100% sure. To tell for sure, i would have to compare it, and I am not really willing to burn or cut both or my arms to compare it and find out. I have only had it a short time, maybe  a couple weeks, so i have not used this stuff for any real length of time to say what this stuff will help with, or not. That, i guess, i will find out over time. but so far, I do like it. I just wish it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful! There are so many uses, we&#x27;ll always have some in our medicine cabinet!</li>
            <li> We love this product and use it for scrapes and cuts. It also soothes sunburn.</li>
            <li> love this !!! No sticky or greasy  after feeling!! Great for skin irritations, burns, dry skin, acne, etc.</li>
            <li> This is a great skin product. I recently fractured my elbow and I am using it for quick healing. I use on my face too.</li>
            <li> I bought this after researching Silver Gel on many reputable sites, and decided to try it to help calm down my psoriasis and dry skin on my cheeks.  It works very well, especially when followed an hour later with a facial moisturizer. So far, I am very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> Great product recommended by my doctor.</li>
            <li> I use this gel because I get these nasty boils under my arms from time to time. This stuff makes them go away fast and heals my skin as if it never happened. Will continue to purchase this item. Can&#x27;t be without it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money, don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> This feels very sticky I would pick another brand gel</li>
            <li> This cream claims right on the package that its the &amp;#34;Ultimate Skin &amp; Body Care&amp;#34;. Care of what I&#x27;d like to ask?&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a base organic lotion to make sunscreen out of it. I started getting this weird rash on my neck, this So made it much worse! I missed the opportunity to send mine back, yup life happens, don&#x27;t even bother ordering this in the 1st place!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I use it to brush my dogs teeth and my vet tells me they have the best looking teeth he has seen on a dog.</li>
            <li> Good but feels dry when it dries.</li>
            <li> Silver Gel is so effective for your skin.  Got a rash? Got too much sun?  Got an insect bite? Put Silver Gel on it.  When you get a cut or injury, put Silver Gel on it.  I have used this product for over five years.  It has always been just what I needed.</li>
            <li> easy to apply dries quickly does the job and the price is right</li>
            <li> It is fine as an alternative product, but does not promote healing as described. Its cooling great for after being out in the sun</li>
            <li> It helped my burn heal quickly &amp; its soothing</li>
            <li> My recommendation for ASAP:  Buy it As Soon As Possible!&lt;br /&gt;I use ASAP for cuts, scratches. It even relieves sinus problems and ear aches.</li>
            <li> A must in all first aid kits. This is the best kept secret in the health world.</li>
            <li> I had a bump/nodule on my arm for several years. My Dr. froze it with liquid nitrogen and it was slightly smaller but not much. My Dr. sent me to a dermatologist who charged me $35 and told me &amp;#34;it&#x27;s scar tissue&amp;#34;. I bought this product, put a dab on the bump a couple of times over the course of a few days and this bump has gone away. Very impressed.</li>
            <li> My friends talked to me for two years to get onto silver. Now, I have read up on it and am sure that this is the direction to go into an uncertain future. Am using this product. Right now I am experimenting with my age spots that someone told me are three layer of skin thick.  Really would recommend this product. It arrived on time, in good shape, and safely. Thank you to the shippers for all the above. Am really grateful.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent shipment time.</li>
            <li> I had an itchy spot on my side for several months, and nothing I tried (anti-bacterial cream, moisturizer, etc) helped. My mother-in-law suggested ASAP. I applied it to my skin and almost instantly the itching was gone! I reapplied it twice a day for several days, and I have not itched there since! I am amazed! I now use ASAP for any skin irritations and cuts. Totally recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using ASAP for about 5 years. This silver gel is the best product I have found for shingles.  I dab it on the lesion approximately 10-12 times a day.  The blisters are gone in 3 days and the scab is gone in less than 10 days.  It is awesome!  I use it for all kinds of things and I love it.  It is definitely one item I will always have in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> My all-time favorite body care gel containing silver.  I even use it on our pets when they have skin issues.  Works great.  Clears up skin problems pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Used this on a skin rash and was a real help, my wife has had a problem, small swelling in the top of her ear and with only one application the pain was gone!</li>
            <li> Great product. Good price. Fast shipping. Thanks.</li>
            <li> The gel is so soothing for my skin and much better as a moisturizer then those expensive one&#x27;s that really do nothing more then make you feel  better.  I use this on my hands and other dry areas, a fabulous product for daily use.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this silver gel and decided to just try it so I put it to the test not sure if it would have worked a few weeks ago I had a accident at work as I worked in clothing as I was changing the hangers a piece brake a hit me in my eye I was in so much pain a run to the bathroom to wash my eyes with cold water but it didn&#x27;t help I had to sit down for minutes because of the pain I was feeling it cool down a bit but when I got home its start hurting again at this point I was thinking I have to go to the emergency room I then remembered I had order this silver gel and for some reason I decided to just put a bit in the affected eye I was scared yes but just wanted to be out off this pain when I apply the gel I lay on my back for a few minutes the pain that I was feeling minutes before had instantly feeling much better in minutes I went to bed and in the morning my eyes was as good as ever I love this gel and will definitely order again .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool to the touch and spreads easy, now all I have to do is wait for the results!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this skin gel several times for extreme dry skin patches and it seems to work well. I&#x27;m not sure if I was having an allergic reaction to something, but the gel took care of it. I applied it several times over a span of two days and viola! The areas healed and went away.</li>
            <li> I burnt my forearm while baking and this gel has been awesome with healing my wound, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a life saver! After suffering from cystic acne for years and trying handfuls of medications and topicals nothing seemed to work. Silver gel is the only product that has cleared my skin up. It does not dry your skin and you can apply makeup on top without a problem. I highly recommend the product to anyone suffering from Acne, it&#x27;s definetly worth a shot!</li>
            <li> This really dried my skin out and left a dark patch on my forehead... the dark patch of skin took 2 weeks to shed... it didn&#x27;t do anything for my patch of eczema either. Bummer. I was really looking forward to this making a positive difference. Oh well. The search continues. My skin is extremely sensitive; this may work well for others.</li>
            <li> I have had psoriasis on my scalp since I was  teenager . This gets rid of the lumps on my scalp  . Make sure you use a good conditioner on your hair . I use Mane&#x60;n Tail conditioner . This combined with liquid zinc and Waxelene helps a lot with thinning hair and scalp problems . I know some people complain about this product drying out their skin . You will probably just need to add something like Waxelene to help moisturize your skin . I also get less white heads on my face when using this product .</li>
            <li> A friend of mine swore by this stuff and I picked some up about a year ago and just loved it. My mom had a cut near her eye that she could not use antibiotics for and this cleared it right up. What a great find.</li>
            <li> Put it on itchy eyes, on your face each morning from the fridge... bye bye wrinkles, anything concerning your skin. Perfectly safe for children. Kills bacteria instantly and keeps it gone for 4 hrs if you don&#x27;t wash it off.</li>
            <li> Use for when I get any bumps on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from cystic acne for 30 years. This product is incredible!!!! Normally I use what my dermotologist prescribes at night and put this product on during my work day. It smoothes my skin, gives it a healthy glow, and protects as it aids in healing. I no longer use make up during the day. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This works better than triple antibiotic ointment and is non-greasy. It is a must have for home. It prevents scarring and I am known for past bad scarring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super impressed with this product I&#x27;m a guy that suffered a lot from skin sensitivity and every time I would get a pimple it would damage my skin and redness I wish I would have found this product long time ago</li>
            <li> Really good stuff, like it</li>
            <li> Great product, it works.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for any type of cuts or skin infections.  It is very healing.  A little goes a long way. Great product.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. It&#x27;s ok. There is a lot of hype on silver in the product.</li>
            <li> expected more out of this than I&#x27;m getting.....think I&#x27;m going to stick with Sovereign Silver first Aid Gel....definitely works better than this one! I&#x27;m not impressed....what a let down after reading all those great reviews :(</li>
            <li> I have a deep scar from basal cell carcinoma removal six months ago and I used a silicone stick for 3 months to reduce it. Then I switched to this Silver Gel and the results were much more noticeable. My daughter just commented yesterday that she was surprised how reduced the scar was, especially that I had healed that rapidly. I think this gel really did the trick.</li>
            <li> I had some treatment on my hands and this was recommended for healing, fast scabbing, etc.  Did a good job and I use it regularly.  Hands really are looking good.  Younger looking.  What can I say, I&#x27;m vain.</li>
            <li> Good product. After using this for a couple weeks now on scratches, pimples and a biopsy site, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that it helps heal and protect the area. I think it&#x27;s to be determined if it works AS well as some people claim but I&#x27;m certain that each user will have his/her unique results. Nobody reacts exactly the same as another so results will vary. I do agree with the majority that this is a really good product, that it works and should be in everyone&#x27;s medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Foot ulcer that hasn&#x27;t healed for over a year is now healing. Great product!</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly for supplier.  Have found that it gives quick relief from several different types of skin irritations.  Have not yet seen significant changes in a toe wart.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST FOR EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN FOR SKIN PROBLEMS!  Before I get anything out of my medicine cabinet, I try this product!</li>
            <li> Love this Gel ! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Use this for facial tenderness if I should get tender from treatments and it settles in down instantly! Takes redness and burns to clear and calm skin. Any wound; I run for silver gel - it is a rapid healer for you!</li>
            <li> This starts healing in hours for pets or people.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the purchase of the silver gel and it arrived very quickly.  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Excellent!! Stops infection naturally. The Greeks and Romans used to put silver into their drinking water jugs to kill bacteria. It works, has for centuries.</li>
            <li> Due to meds I am on, my skin is extremely thin and a small bump or scratch will results in a horrible looking blood blister.  I applied this immediately to a small scratch I got and it didn&#x27;t blister.  I also bought the spray and used it on a scratch and it worked as well.  Don&#x27;t know if this is magic or if it was just a fluke--but I will use it for any future scratches.  It sure worked better than the gels I have been using.</li>
            <li> recieved it well packaged. and for me the gel works . I  have used it on my thumb  nail fungus. works better than the prescribed  cream given by my doctor.. after a month the fungus is noticiably improved In about another month it will be gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years not. Great to ward off excema on my hands. I started using it while being a cashier and the dirty money caused an occassional problem. I also swear that it removed my neck tags. It&#x27;s also great for itches. I use the gel twice a week on my neck/chest and hands for preventative purpose and neck tags have not returned.&lt;br /&gt; I did have one bad excema breakout it didnt&#x27; work for so I got cortizone-10 for excema and it did a great job.</li>
            <li> great stuff, love it. package was sent and arrived when it was supposed to</li>
            <li> Works Great on Warts.</li>
            <li> Heals my bug bites and makes my skin soft. Love it.</li>
            <li> If you use the standard antibacterial gel... but are looking for something a bit more natural, and something bacteria hasn&#x27;t become resistent to... this is an EXCELLENT choice. We have had success with pink eye, cuts, boils, everything. We think it is JUST as effective!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Not greasy at all!  Another company adds lavender and tea tree essential oils to make it a stronger antibiotic gel...smells amazing too!  http://www.colloidal-silver-hydrosol.com/lavender-ionic-silver-hydrosol.html</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic cream for many skin ailments. I used it on a rash which appeared on my little girl&#x27;s neck, and the rash disappeared nearly instantly. It was also effective for chaffed butt, bug bites, after shaving, itchy-bumps, and so on. Every skin malady that popped up, to where this cream was applied, had disappeared in, what seems, a flash. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice anything good or bad. Didn&#x27;t really seem to make a difference on acne or other minor cuts</li>
            <li> No additional comments.</li>
            <li> I have previously posted reviews on other sizes of the ASAP Silver Gel. This product is wonderful! It is good for skin issues such as scars, burns, and other injuries. It is safe to use around the eyes and it has zero smell or color to it. I have used it on a severe burn that was about and inch or two in size and the burn completely disappeared and left no scar behind! I wish I&#x27;d known about the Silver Gel a long time ago!</li>
            <li> I use this product on skin abrasions and other cuts scrapes. It is as an alternative to triple antibiotic ointments. Works well.</li>
            <li> Love this gel - fast delivery</li>
            <li> Anti-biotics are known to inhibit our bodies natural immune systems and in this age of anti-biotic-resistant disease, we need to find a natural product that will actually partner with our bodies, rather than work against it.  Siver has been used for centuries to kill infection, promote fast healing and restore overall health - it&#x27;s nothing new.  But Americans got side-tracked with the great marketing efforts of anti-biotic producters.  This silver gel is awsome!  We use it for all kinds of external owies like rashes from contact dermatitis, bug bites, scrapes, cuts, burns, you name it!  Super-fast healer.  Just put it on, cover with bandaid if needed and see what tomorrow brings!  Amazing!</li>
            <li> Best gel i have ever found. Works for many purposes. One of my cures that I still cant beleive the results is on my coldsores. As soon as I would get that warm feeling I would put it on and the sore never came out. Ever since I started using this gel on my face everyday after I shower, I havent had any coldsores at all.</li>
            <li> Great standby for skin problems.</li>
            <li> Cat scratched me, applied the gel and it was only sore for 1 day and left no scar.  Haven&#x27;t had to use it much but that was enough to be sure I always have this product on available.</li>
            <li> Years ago when I was a rep for E&#x27;OLA I fell totally in love with this product. Little kids with eczema that couldn&#x27;t wear shoes was better in 3 days. Poison Ivy was no problem...burns were a breeze. My daughters back acne is its next mission. I am confident it will hold its record!&lt;br /&gt;DEFINITELY A FANTASTIC PRODUCT. Will post !</li>
