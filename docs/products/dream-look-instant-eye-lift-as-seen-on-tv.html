            <li>If you don&#x27;t have a good &amp;#34;old age&amp;#34; droop</li>
            <li>This product is superior than what is out there in the market.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, it surely does the job and keeps from having surgery on your eye lids as my sister was going to do....</li>

            <li>This is my favorite !</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and quite effective.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to wear yet.</li>
            <li>I use powdered brown shadow over the top.  </li>
            <li>I can see how these may be more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I love having my eyelids not droopy.  </li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I use these and love them.  </li>

            <li>but right now I am pretty happy with my eyelid.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and stays put.</li>
            <li>For me they are easy to use and stay on until I take them off.  </li>
            <li>They may take time getting used to putting them on, they peel off easily to reapply to make my eyes look lifted.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Needs a little practice with application and placement, but once you get it, its perfect.</li>
            <li>- I use these on the one eye only to even the lids out and it works GREAT.</li>
            <li>quick deliverly didnt work as well as the pictures look</li>
            <li>Unless you look super close to my eyes</li>
            <li>I love this product and highly recommend it to anyone that needs a lift...</li>
            <li>It well worth it</li>
            <li>but I did have nice big eyelids</li>
            <li>These look hideous and don&#x27;t even work right.</li>
            <li>Absolute rubbish!</li>
            <li>First off, remember, this is not surgery.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to work with, but I was satisfied with the product until I am able to get eyelid surgery.</li>
            <li>I think it really depends on the shape of your eyes and eyelids.  </li>
            <li>, THEY ARE VERY NOTICEABLE AND DON&#x27;T ALWAYS STAY STUCK TO THE EYELID</li>
            <li>They work but regardless how much makeup you put on your eyelids</li>
            <li>your going to see the tape I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li>Trust me, you will really like them.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>They really enhance my eyes.</li>
            <li>These are the real ones that stick and stay on always.</li>
            <li>I have one eye lid that droops more than the other.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised that such a simple thing can do such a great job.</li>
            <li>For me, these really open up my eyes and make them look bigger with a more pronounced eyelid.  </li>
            <li>Very natural and really opens my eye.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them to anyone with a droop.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>i would recommend them, took a while to put on but by the third try i was a pro lol 2nd time ordred having trouble putting on</li>
            <li>I love this Eye Lifting product it makes me look a little bit younger by making my eyes open more like when I was younger</li>
            <li>I am 67 years old and about two years ago, my upper lids started really drooping.  </li>
            <li>I would not stick tape on my eyelids for fear of stretching the delicate skin even more, so would not have bought this if i had realized that it&#x27;s stick-ons.</li>
            <li>Work really well with my eye lid and make my eyes look bigger too.</li>
            <li>By applying tinted eye lid primer first, then applying a light layer of false eyelash glue to the strip, then laying the strip on the natural crease it works well.  </li>
            <li>I feel better wearing them because my eyelids are heavy and at 49 I&#x27;m not ready for surgery.  </li>
            <li>So far I have wasted four strips trying to get it right</li>
            <li>Really does shave years off aged eyes.  </li>
            <li>I noticed female news reporters on FOX with such big eyes and thought they must have some new make up trick.  </li>
            <li>I will only use them when I am going somewhere, or when I feel depressed and ugly and am all by myself, lol.  </li>

            <li> these work great ppl took notice and asked if i had my eyelid procedure i would recommend them, took a while to put on but by the third try i was a pro lol 2nd time ordred having trouble putting on i think directions are wrong. or product changed</li>
            <li> You can see these things on your eyes.  They are not invisible...they look stupid and don&#x27;t work at all.  Don&#x27;t get them!!!!!</li>
            <li> THEY WORK - YOU JUST HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO PUT ON - EACH EYE IS DIFFERENT.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it surely does the job and keeps from having surgery on your eye lids as my sister was going to do.... my sister and I have used this product for several years.</li>
            <li> You can visible on your eyelids.</li>
            <li> Very hard to apply. Haven&#x27;t been able to wear yet.</li>
            <li> These are hard to cover up with make up</li>
            <li> quick deliverly didnt work as well as the pictures look</li>
            <li> Really does shave years off aged eyes.  Easy to apply and stays put.</li>
            <li> I hope you continue to carry these.  I don&#x27;t want to be without them.</li>
            <li> I think it really depends on the shape of your eyes and eyelids.  For me, these really open up my eyes and make them look bigger with a more pronounced eyelid.  I noticed female news reporters on FOX with such big eyes and thought they must have some new make up trick.  After a little research I discovered this is what they&#x27;re probably using</li>
            <li> I thought this was a firming lotion.  I would not stick tape on my eyelids for fear of stretching the delicate skin even more, so would not have bought this if i had realized that it&#x27;s stick-ons.</li>
            <li> They Work! Period. I highly recommend them to anyone with a droop. Hard to find in stores but get them any way you can.</li>
            <li> I WISH THEY WERE A LOT THINNER, THEY ARE VERY NOTICEABLE AND DON&#x27;T ALWAYS STAY STUCK TO THE EYELID HAVE TO PRESS THEM DOWN DURING THE DAY.</li>
            <li> I love this product and highly recommend it to anyone that needs a lift...just wish it was still sold in stores...</li>
            <li> So far I have wasted four strips trying to get it right but no luck.  I finally gave up.  I&#x27;ll try again another time.  They were just too obvious.</li>
            <li> I loved this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and do not want surgery for an eye lift.  I have one eye lid that droops more than the other.  By applying tinted eye lid primer first, then applying a light layer of false eyelash glue to the strip, then laying the strip on the natural crease it works well.  I use powdered brown shadow over the top.  If I notice a bit of stickiness during the day, I simply dust it with shadow again.  Very natural and really opens my eye.  For the other eye, I use a transparent strip that is thinner in the same manor of application.  This way it balances my eyes out perfectly.  If you don&#x27;t have a good &amp;#34;old age&amp;#34; droop I can see how these may be more noticeable.  Having said that, I would not recommend them for a younger person.</li>
            <li> Work really well with my eye lid and make my eyes look bigger too.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and I can not live without it.  I tried another brand but it was not up to par I therefore came back to Dream Look.  This product is superior than what is out there in the market.  I will keep purchasing this brand until I retire from the workforce!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife and she is very happy with it. It is easy to use and quite effective. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time for my droopy eyelids and have reordered three times.  I think they are great.  Unless you look super close to my eyes you can&#x27;t even tell I have them on.  I don&#x27;t use the cream that comes with them.  I simply put them on and they stay all day and night until I take them on.  One thing I learned is not to use anything but matt eyeshadow.  That way they don&#x27;t show up like a sore thumb.  I love having my eyelids not droopy.  Love these.</li>
            <li> Absolute rubbish! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I have one eye where the lid droops lower than the other - I use these on the one eye only to even the lids out and it works GREAT. I order again and again, I hope to never run out. Needs a little practice with application and placement, but once you get it, its perfect. May not be great for ALL eyelids, but perfect for my needs! A lifesaver!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite ! There is cheaper products but this is the best one. Stay all day and not very noticeable. I was thinking about eyelid surgery but right now I am pretty happy with my eyelid.</li>
            <li> I use these and love them.  For me they are easy to use and stay on until I take them off.  I feel better wearing them because my eyelids are heavy and at 49 I&#x27;m not ready for surgery.  I don&#x27;t use them everyday I just use them when going out, weekends.  People have to remember its a help for heavy eyelids and its NOT SURGERY!  They may take time getting used to putting them on, they peel off easily to reapply to make my eyes look lifted.  I don&#x27;t wear eye shadow (never did) so that is never a problem for me.  I don&#x27;t think they are noticeable at all.  Nobody has EVER said anything to me and nor has my husband.  It well worth it and I will continue to use them as long as they make them.</li>
            <li> I love this Eye Lifting product it makes me look a little bit younger by making my eyes open more like when I was younger I love it.</li>
            <li> TO EXPENSIVE, I HATE IT</li>
            <li> They work but regardless how much makeup you put on your eyelids your going to see the tape I really wanted to like this I did everything to try and the look of tape on my eyelids it just didn&#x27;t work but I did have nice big eyelids I got this from rite aid two years ago btw</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. Works well.</li>
            <li> First off, remember, this is not surgery.  I am 67 years old and about two years ago, my upper lids started really drooping.  These things give me an eyelid, not as wonderful as they used to be, but pretty dang good.  You will need to practice a couple of times, but they send you plenty.  I will only use them when I am going somewhere, or when I feel depressed and ugly and am all by myself, lol.  Trust me, you will really like them.</li>
            <li> It really works. I am surprised that such a simple thing can do such a great job. They really enhance my eyes.</li>
            <li> The Dream Look did lift my upper eyelids.  It is hard to work with, but I was satisfied with the product until I am able to get eyelid surgery.</li>
            <li> These look hideous and don&#x27;t even work right. I don&#x27;t see anyone walking around in public with these strips on their eyelids!?</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  Also be careful I accidentally bought the fake ones from China because they looked like the product. Awful.  These are the real ones that stick and stay on always.</li>
            <li> Realky did not make any difference in my eyes  Waste of money</li>
