            <li>You do need to follow the instructions, but if you do, it works great.  </li>
            <li>This product is EXCELLENT - better than the liquid hair color touch up</li>
            <li>Does smell like citronella, but its not un pleasant and the smell does fade.</li>
            <li>On the bright side, there are plenty of improvement opportunities here.  </li>
            <li>The color is good and it did arrive on time.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to find a product that does all the things you hoped for.  </li>
            <li>Comes out very easily in water so don&#x27;t worry about washing it out--</li>
            <li>The product was okay, but takes a bit longer</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>will for sure buy it again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad I bought 2, never want to run out.</li>
            <li>okay results sometimes too).  </li>
            <li>You can make it as runny as you like, by putting more water on it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>the spray can type a lot better.</li>
            <li>Gifted this to my aunt.</li>
            <li>Great choice for busy Moms!</li>
            <li>(Sounds gushy, but true!)</li>
            <li>Washes out easily.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and I now keep one in my sports bag.</li>
            <li>It will come off easily if you get it on your skin.</li>
            <li>it first with warm water, pull the hair away from the face, and rub on from scalp out.</li>
            <li>presentation is too cheap, I will buy it in a nicer presentation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this product, and it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>it was a cheap item.</li>
            <li>By the time there was any significant color on the gray, there were dents in my skull.  </li>
            <li>She likes it and says that this is a great temporary solution to touch up the roots (and cover up the grey) between color appointments.</li>
            <li>Best temp grey coverup I&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
            <li>If you color your hair and can&#x27;t afford to go in every three weeks, this is a dream come true.  </li>
            <li>LOL  gave to someone with dark hair.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t rub off unless you get it damp and REALLY try.</li>
            <li>This is a great little trick for between colorings.</li>
            <li>Great for roots alone and even a few strands...</li>
            <li>I just run the stick under warm water, part my hair and run it across back and forth once or twice, done.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply with just a tiny bit of water and glides on the touch-up spots easily</li>
            <li>...and it also gives my hair a little extra body, which is great for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>My grand mother used it back in the &#x27;60.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried hair mascara to cover grey, but thus stuff works a lot better.</li>
            <li>It is far superior than any of the other temporary cover-ups.  </li>
            <li>Simple, easy and fast</li>
            <li>Works well for its intended purpose and really fills a need for inbetween colorings and touchups.</li>
            <li>It really does...</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, too.</li>
            <li>I ordered this some time ago and can&#x27;t remember the details of why I didn&#x27;t return it....too much of a hassle considering</li>
            <li>Very convenience.</li>
            <li>I really love the simple apllication between root touch-ups, no mess.  </li>
            <li>I like it a little runny so that it covers quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a different brand, a liquid applied with a little wand, that, for me, is alot easier to use; the liquid spreads and covers more easily than the crayon -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Dark Brown and the light brown in the past which I loved.  </li>
            <li>If they could make one that would last several weeks, it would be better, but until then, I&#x27;m sticking with Roux Touch-up Stick.  </li>
            <li>One thing I do is to apply it as much as I want in the areas I need it, then take my fingers and rub it in around the hairline, so that the color blends evenly and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>(ie grey, white parts around face or at top of head).  </li>
            <li>It has only dripped once, and it came right off the counter.  </li>
            <li>having to use water to activate the stick does make my hair puff or curl up a little bit, and it kind of fades if I put heat back on it, plus it dries it up a bit.  </li>
            <li>I have used it about 8 times but still looks like new.  </li>
            <li>Get the tip slightly damp and just rub on clean hair.  </li>
            <li>for me though, I have African-American natural hair and when I have it straightened or blow-dried,</li>
            <li>It covers all my grays, completely.  </li>
            <li>I like to do it right after the shower when the hair is already wet.  </li>
            <li>But I used it to color a little leave-out I had for a #4 color wig, and the color itself seems EXACTLY that color!  </li>
            <li>It works a little better if I use a little brow brush.  </li>
            <li>The color was not a match, apparently they do not make the lighter blonde shade which I need.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little working in and much repeated dipping water (but I think using oil yields</li>
    </ol>

            <li> One of the few products I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> If you use just a little water, you will need to use a fine-tooth comb to separate and restore the natural look.  </li>
            <li> It is inexpensive and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It does the trick and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I think it will last me a long time and therefore, cost me less money.  </li>
            <li> It also does not dry as stiff as the mascara does.  </li>
            <li> If you just don&#x27;t have time for color touch ups as often as you should, this little stick is a big help.</li>
            <li> Too much trouble to send back.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rub off unless it gets wet (sweat for example), and even then, it doesn&#x27;t come off unless you rub it against something.  </li>
            <li> I know it hasn&#x27;t worked for some people, but I wonder if they got the tip wet.  </li>
            <li> I got heavily rained on yesterday and it was back to black,</li>
            <li> I am active and don&#x27;t always notice when I need a touch up.  </li>
            <li> Just wasn&#x27;t my color which is dark brown.</li>
            <li> I am not trying to be mean or critical</li>
            <li> It seems a bit awkward to use at first, but once you get the hang of it, it does the job.</li>
            <li> Not working, Dried already, even broken inside, I want my money back.</li>
            <li> It is not the easiest cover up for gray hair due to the thick, crayon like texture.&lt;br /&gt;Wet</li>
            <li> When I use it on just washed wet hair at the roots, it will cover thin spots and make my hair look fuller.</li>
            <li> The mascara type cover-up is usually runnier than mascara, and I&#x27;ve had to scrub and scrub to get drips off my bathroom counters.  </li>
            <li> The mascara type is also expensive for the amount you get, and still doesn&#x27;t my stubborn white hairs without a lot of layers.  </li>
            <li> It does leave hair a bit dull.</li>
            <li> I knew it would be hard</li>
            <li> I ordered two, both no good.</li>
            <li> It also sometimes pulls your hair, because the lipstick like color is very hard not like lipstick, but all in all it helps.</li>
            <li> It was like using a cold hard crayon.  </li>
            <li> however I ordered wrong color</li>
            <li> Awful.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> My grand mother used it back in the &#x27;60. Now, my mother is using it and she said that it is an excellent product...</li>
            <li> Great product! Love it!</li>
            <li> The product was okay, but takes a bit longer then I like to get it the gray covered.  It also sometimes pulls your hair, because the lipstick like color is very hard not like lipstick, but all in all it helps.</li>
            <li> works great however I ordered wrong color LOL  gave to someone with dark hair.  Should have ordered the lighter brown shade.</li>
            <li> If you just don&#x27;t have time for color touch ups as often as you should, this little stick is a big help. It is inexpensive and lasts a long time. It does leave hair a bit dull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a different brand, a liquid applied with a little wand, that, for me, is alot easier to use; the liquid spreads and covers more easily than the crayon - but that&#x27;s just me</li>
            <li> does what its supposed to, I only get gray around temples and I&#x27;m not coloring for that, this worked for me, no complaints.</li>
            <li> This product is EXCELLENT - better than the liquid hair color touch up I use to use.</li>
            <li> Takes about a minute, especially if you&#x27;ve just towel-dried your hair. Perfect for when you have a meeting today and a hair appointment next week.</li>
            <li> Works well for its intended purpose and really fills a need for inbetween colorings and touchups. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great little trick for between colorings. Perfect root touch-up. Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t rub off unless you get it damp and REALLY try. Doesn&#x27;t rub off on pillowcase, doesn&#x27;t run in sweat, etc. Essential part of my &#x27;tool kit&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I go w/ medium brown usually, the darkest is to dark and next one up is too light for me, but it gets you through.</li>
            <li> Awful.  I&#x27;ve used the Dark Brown and the light brown in the past which I loved.  The Medium is way to &#x27;orangish&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This product works well to cover gray at the stage in between hair color appointments. It seems a bit awkward to use at first, but once you get the hang of it, it does the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  I knew it would be hard and you do need water to make it work but it just doesn&#x27;t do the job for me.  It works a little better if I use a little brow brush.  The color is good and it did arrive on time.</li>
            <li> Just wasn&#x27;t my color which is dark brown. This has a reddish tone. Too much trouble to send back.</li>
            <li> I did buy this just to give it a try, but it actually works!!! It really does... Simple, easy and fast and you are good to go!&lt;br /&gt;I will for sure buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;The presentation is too cheap, I will buy it in a nicer presentation.</li>
            <li> I really love the simple apllication between root touch-ups, no mess.  Med brown matches well, blending in with highlights. Washes out easily.  I just run the stick under warm water, part my hair and run it across back and forth once or twice, done.  Glad I bought 2, never want to run out. I have used it about 8 times but still looks like new.  Will order again, recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> ...and it also gives my hair a little extra body, which is great for my fine hair. When I use it on just washed wet hair at the roots, it will cover thin spots and make my hair look fuller. Shipping was fast, too.</li>
            <li> It does the trick and lasts a long time.  I use a brush to blend it in.  Lasts until you wash your hair, so you don&#x27;t have to use it daily.</li>
            <li> It takes a little working in and much repeated dipping water (but I think using oil yields okay results sometimes too).  Great for roots alone and even a few strands...for me though, I have African-American natural hair and when I have it straightened or blow-dried, having to use water to activate the stick does make my hair puff or curl up a little bit, and it kind of fades if I put heat back on it, plus it dries it up a bit.  But I used it to color a little leave-out I had for a #4 color wig, and the color itself seems EXACTLY that color!  I&#x27;m glad I bought this product, and it was worth it.

I&#x27;ve been using old mascara, the mascara-type cover up, other crayon-type temporary colors, etc.  The mascara type cover-up is usually runnier than mascara, and I&#x27;ve had to scrub and scrub to get drips off my bathroom counters.  It won&#x27;t come out of my underclothing...at all.  The mascara type is also expensive for the amount you get, and still doesn&#x27;t my stubborn white hairs without a lot of layers.  Seemed like they lasted a couple of weeks.  I saw this and decided to buy it based on the customer reviews, especially one that told how to use it.  So glad I tried it!!!!!  It is far superior than any of the other temporary cover-ups.  It covers all my grays, completely.  It doesn&#x27;t rub off unless it gets wet (sweat for example), and even then, it doesn&#x27;t come off unless you rub it against something.  Unlike the mascara-type cover up, this does not end up all over my pillowcase.  It also does not dry as stiff as the mascara does.  If you use just a little water, you will need to use a fine-tooth comb to separate and restore the natural look.  Once it dries on your hair, you can touch it without it coming off on your hands.  Each time I use it, I expect to see it getting smaller and smaller, but it looks almost the same as when I started using it weeks ago.  I think it will last me a long time and therefore, cost me less money.  You do need to follow the instructions, but if you do, it works great.  Get the tip slightly damp and just rub on clean hair.  I like to do it right after the shower when the hair is already wet.  You can make it as runny as you like, by putting more water on it.  I like it a little runny so that it covers quickly and easily.  It has only dripped once, and it came right off the counter.  One thing I do is to apply it as much as I want in the areas I need it, then take my fingers and rub it in around the hairline, so that the color blends evenly and looks natural.  If they could make one that would last several weeks, it would be better, but until then, I&#x27;m sticking with Roux Touch-up Stick.  It&#x27;s so nice to find a product that does all the things you hoped for.  I know it hasn&#x27;t worked for some people, but I wonder if they got the tip wet.  If you color your hair and can&#x27;t afford to go in every three weeks, this is a dream come true.  (Sounds gushy, but true!)</li>
            <li> I ordered two, both no good. Not working, Dried already, even broken inside, I want my money back.</li>
            <li> I love it. Very convenience. It is health for using it. I have bought different colors just in case. good.</li>
            <li> works great! just what I wanted to blend away grays at the roots and washes out with shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried hair mascara to cover grey, but thus stuff works a lot better. It actually stays put and does not come off when you touch your hair. Does smell like citronella, but its not un pleasant and the smell does fade. Best temp grey coverup I&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
            <li> Great inbetween product, Great service! Would by again.Thanks for offering a great product at a good price! thank you again</li>
            <li> This really is a good quality substitute for hair coloring!  It is easy to apply with just a tiny bit of water and glides on the touch-up spots easily (ie grey, white parts around face or at top of head).  The color matches my hair perfectly.  And this blends in with your fingers well.  Then rinses off with soap.  Great choice for busy Moms!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd purchase of this touch-up stick.  I am active and don&#x27;t always notice when I need a touch up.  This works perfectly to hide those roots that sneak up on you.  It is easy to apply and I now keep one in my sports bag.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like drawing on your head with a sharpie except that it takes a lot to cover well. I like the spray can type a lot better.</li>
            <li> This product did not work well at all.  By the time there was any significant color on the gray, there were dents in my skull.  It was like using a cold hard crayon.  On the bright side, there are plenty of improvement opportunities here.  I am not trying to be mean or critical but it was not a valuable purchase experience for me at all.</li>
            <li> Really good! I totally recommend!</li>
            <li> The Roux stick is only a temp. fix. It is not the easiest cover up for gray hair due to the thick, crayon like texture.&lt;br /&gt;Wet it first with warm water, pull the hair away from the face, and rub on from scalp out. It will come off easily if you get it on your skin. It is preferable to the mascara like cover ups which get tangled in longer hair. There are powder forms of touch ups which I have not used, but will try in the future. Hope this was helpful.</li>
            <li> Gifted this to my aunt. She likes it and says that this is a great temporary solution to touch up the roots (and cover up the grey) between color appointments.</li>
