            <li>This color is just nice , look more like an orange color tho!</li>
            <li>Love this color - it has a good pop of orange</li>

            <li>Love this color super bright  </li>
            <li>This vibant color looks wonderful next to my medium brown skin.  </li>
            <li>and it was well wrapped :)</li>
            <li>I love love love ths color.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have more OPI than I want to count</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and it was packaged very nicely.</li>
            <li>The color is true to as shown and has a nice gloss finish.</li>
            <li>but I really enjoy wearing this color and get lots of compliments on it when I do.</li>
            <li>Color is a bit lighter than the picture, Overall, another great OPI polish.</li>
            <li>two coats is all I needed and with a Top coat this really made the color shine brighter</li>
            <li>I love opi for nails - I have purchased many different colors through different sellers, recommend this seller- item was delivery quickly and priced fair.  </li>

            <li>I will definitely buy more of the same color.</li>
            <li>I had to keep going over my nails with additional coats to make this look right, and it was such an off consistency from what I normally expect from OPI.</li>
            <li>Liked the color even though it is from an old collection, but it is difficult to apply.</li>
            <li>I compared this to other opi products I have and the consistancy of the nail polish was very runny.</li>
            <li>I have skin that is very pale and have to be careful on reds they either look orange or burnt red - and this one was more orange - then red, was going for the red</li>

            <li> Liked the color even though it is from an old collection, but it is difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I love OPI, but for some reason this color/texture was fairly difficult to apply. I had to keep going over my nails with additional coats to make this look right, and it was such an off consistency from what I normally expect from OPI.</li>
            <li> Always love OPI and this color is beautiful!</li>
            <li> Great color.  Stays on very well</li>
            <li> Slides on smoothly, looks great, long lasting! Seller had it here faster than anticipated and it was well wrapped :)</li>
            <li> I compared this to other opi products I have and the consistancy of the nail polish was very runny. The color is beautiful however I could not use it. My manicurist said remover was added to it.</li>
            <li> Color is a bit lighter than the picture, Overall, another great OPI polish. When applied correctly, will last for weeks.</li>

            <li> This is the hottest color to date of all the OPI polishes I have purchased. I put it on last night and my toes are to die for! Totally love this orange-red color!</li>
            <li> This color is electric orange. I love it. I have more OPI than I want to count but I just had to have this one too. It&#x27;s a bit tricky to apply evenly, but oh so beautiful when you&#x27;ve put it on:) I&#x27;m planing on buying the Euro-Mini set next.</li>
            <li> I love opi for nails - I have purchased many different colors through different sellers, recommend this seller- item was delivery quickly and priced fair.  I have skin that is very pale and have to be careful on reds they either look orange or burnt red - and this one was more orange - then red, was going for the red</li>
