            <li>my skin is very smooth.</li>
            <li>THIS SNAKE PEPTIDE, FEELS GOOD , GOES INTO THE SKIN QUICKLY, BUT ITS DEFINELY NOT A BOTOX ALTERNATIVE</li>

            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>Precious product that needs appreciation.</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it in my nighttime routing</li>
            <li>and i am sure it working, just may see more results in 30 days.</li>
            <li>and I wake up with my skin absorbing all this great stuff.</li>
            <li>Two weeks, no change, well yes, my pores are showing sooo much more, my age spots are showing even moreðŸ˜ž  </li>
            <li>and it was nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I used to have many pores and those started to disappear.</li>
            <li>Will get another bottle to see if I can get even better results.</li>
            <li>After one week of using in the morning, my skin is clearer and more moisturized.</li>
            <li>I ordered a jar and they sent a pump and this does not do what it says it feels ok but not what I thought I ordered</li>
            <li>It cleared up my post-acne marks, hydrates, and gave my skin a more glowing look.</li>
            <li>love it..</li>
            <li>and I love the sun and this product</li>
            <li>But I will give the product more time.</li>
            <li>I use many products and have lots of experience.</li>
            <li>You might love it if you have never used lots of products before.</li>
            <li>more like snake oil, you will get more results just using coconut oil, not saying that will amaze you either</li>
            <li>I am really satisfied with the result of Skin Rescue Rx.</li>
            <li>,my favorite would recommend this people that have tried many thing , IAM  hook on it.</li>
            <li>It is still better than putting injections of Botox in your face.</li>
            <li>, it has hyaluronic acid in it and is nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I bought 2 more just</li>
            <li>I love this  product.  </li>
            <li>Love it on my lips as well creates a fullness</li>
            <li>I feel confident that the lines will continue to fade.  </li>
            <li>and I would gladly recommend this to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This really earned my trust and all the girls who tried this out surely loved it.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s what my injections are for :) Super satisfied with the product, shipping time, and condition of box.</li>
            <li>It has a very light texture; it is really easy to apply and produces results quickly.</li>
            <li>I do feel it softened the fine lines and tightened my skin.</li>
            <li>I did not see any difference in my fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I do see a difference with my fine lines.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, first time I had something that worked so fast like this.</li>
            <li>FINE LINES DISAPPEAR WITH CONTINUING  USE</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see any diminishing of fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Those light wrinkles are disappearing and for me to get ahead of the wrinkles</li>
            <li>I use it every night and the day after my skin feels fantastic.</li>
            <li>All of the ingredients work to smooth lines and reduce pores.</li>
            <li>Great product with actual results.</li>
            <li>and i advise you try it because there are different skin types and the service was great.</li>
            <li>So far I seem to have nice smooth eye area, I was hoping for better results on my forehead and mouth area.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, you can wear under your makeup.</li>
            <li>My skin also feels soft, smooth and hydrated, which are great signs that this product is well worth the purchase</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I never took any vitamins nor did I eat a lot of healthier vitamin rich food.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure what it would do for my face.</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>This product has done a great job my skin is also not as rough</li>
            <li>So just keep your options open and be wise in you choice</li>
            <li>After applying it the next morning my skin looked really good</li>
            <li>Claim of being the alternative to Botox is about the only good thing  I see.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think I have seen the full benefits yet.</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle trying to give it a fair shot.</li>
            <li>Have had no bad reactions at all.  </li>
            <li>The seller quickly ships also.</li>
            <li>Of course I don&#x27;t expect to see results so quickly, but I&#x27;m convinced that all the ingredients listed are not in it.</li>
            <li>I have been using  this for several weeks and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>First of all i love this product really much and it deliver super quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and silky but hydrates very well.</li>
            <li>and my skin is so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>BUT - SO FAR, LOVE HOW IT FEELS AND WILL SEE HOW RESULTS GO.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about an ounce worth of colored oil.</li>
            <li>I noticed some difference, but it sure is nowhere near what they advertise it to be.</li>
            <li>So far I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it in conjunction with their other facial treatment, and have been very happy with the smoothing, soothing, moisturizing effects.</li>
            <li>I did not see any results and I am 41 with only very fine lines.</li>
            <li>So when I received it I decided to give it a fair shot since all the other products were appealing and I have actually never used emu oil on my face.</li>
            <li>I like this so much I bought a back-up quickly.</li>
            <li>It somehow manages to be rich and light at the same time.</li>
            <li>To those expecting the botox effect, the amount in this container is not enough; the argireline peptide works better, but is still not botox.</li>
            <li>peeling at first when applying foundation on lower jar area.</li>
            <li>This is a truly lovely facial product.</li>
            <li>Delivery was lightening fast!</li>
            <li>My skin texture and overall appearance has improved and my face feels and looks more supple and youthful.</li>
            <li>I will keep using this product and write another review when I am sure what my final results are.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it never did anything for my skin.</li>
            <li>but the results are almost immediate, my skin had become more elastic because of the collagen, its radiant and younger looking, and it doesnâ€™t make my skin dry which I love.</li>
            <li>I have only two days that I am using it,till now I am not seeing any difference , overall it looks good</li>
            <li>First time using such an effective product, overall I have to say its a 5 star product, works well!</li>
            <li>..I have pretty much stopped using the other creams that caused breakouts, and my skin looks much better than it did before.</li>
            <li>within these last two weeks my skin has become so much smoother and brighter and my pores and fine lines have shrunk.</li>
            <li>Really in snake peptide</li>
            <li>Not too much results after two weeks but still hoping.</li>
            <li>It works better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I am 66, my skin has become very porous and wrinkled with sun damage and age spots.</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really didnt have anything to compare it to?</li>
            <li>This is really great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast service excelent product</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>VERY CREAMY AND LUXURIOUS FEEL TO IT</li>
            <li>but it is very moisturizing like a cream</li>
            <li>It goes on silky, after about 6 weeks of use, I really didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>This product really does lift your skin.  </li>
            <li>I really did not feel no change on my face</li>
            <li>My face looks more radiant and my skin is not as rough.</li>
            <li>But my skin Does seem to be smoother but not as much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I liked it well enough to give it a second chance for more&lt;br</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to add alot of drops to your face and it would still work effectively within a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time or money on this!!!</li>
            <li>I have used other retinol products and this one my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>and I should have researched a little better first.</li>
            <li>It is on par with other products for which I have paid much more.</li>
            <li>With so many other products out there, this does not stand out.</li>
            <li>I use 2x day, it only takes a little, light but powerful, super ingredients really do make a difference!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product along side my other normal beauty products and have found amazing results thus far.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching my face, my skin has never felt this soft before as I have dry skin.</li>
            <li>I will buy more of this as it actually helped my skin look younger!</li>
            <li>I switched over to this brand because it&#x27;s way cheaper and actually contains so much more extra stuff.</li>
            <li>Very silky moisturizer - so far</li>
            <li>I really like the way this feels on my skin, makes your face really soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely helped reduce the appearance of my laugh lines and my forehead lines.</li>
            <li>helped me alot and is much cheaper than alot of other products!&lt;br /&gt;Getting 1 more bottle later this week!</li>
            <li>seen better results using plain almond oil and coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to try some new things to benefit my face.</li>
            <li>so Im stocked cause this stuff is a cant live with out.</li>
            <li>My only solution for this is this cream which is very simple to use and after some time you will see the huge results</li>
            <li>My skin feels firmer with less fine lines.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t exactly make wrinkles disappear but it definitely moisturized and revitalized the appearance of my face.</li>
            <li>I am not to confident in the other benefits as I have not seen any difference in the firmness however, I used it after facial treatment</li>
            <li>and I my fine lines are less noticeable and my skin looks moist and dewy but not oily.</li>
            <li>Soft and natural (mainly ingredients)</li>
            <li>used daily  saw results on one side, did not work on deep wrinkles only slightly on fine lines so far.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this product and wanted me to try it to help clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>So far no one has answered my question.</li>
            <li>It feels extremely natural when you put it on.</li>
            <li>wow, all i can say is WOW</li>
            <li>Having wrinkles at the age of 35 is too early I think.</li>
            <li>While it made my skin smoother, it was a far cry from a botox alternative.</li>
            <li>but I like the smoothness of it so far.</li>
            <li>So far I am liking this product--</li>
            <li>No difference on my skin thus far.</li>
            <li>This serum leaves my skin soft like silk</li>
            <li>Did not do much, have been using daily since I received it</li>
            <li>Using this product made me look younger by almost 15 years; I applied this every morning and night with a gentle massage.</li>
            <li>I would probably give this one more chance , results is slow.</li>
            <li>But Im pretty sure I can sort out the fake reviews-</li>
            <li>I think it mainly helps those who actually avoid being in the sun without sunscreen though.  </li>
            <li>Effective against damage from having sensitive skin, my skin is very sensitive and when I eat something wrong it would break out.</li>
            <li>if you haven&#x27;t tried a similar skin care product like this I highly recommend giving this serum a try.</li>
            <li>I normally use an $82 Hydrating Serum from a big cosmeceutical that does not hydrate and soften the skin as well as this.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind they were not deep set, but wow!</li>
            <li>I also bought a bottle for my mom who is 50 years old, and she received countless compliments on how &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; her skin looks after she began using this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely helped reduce the appearance of my laugh lines and my forehead lines within a few month from this product.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of using it once a day ONLY in the mornings as directed I really saw no results or difference in my skin other</li>
            <li>I broke out within a week pretty heavily.</li>
            <li>So I of course I started to wonder if I wasted my money, but I have tried so many face products in the past that did not work at all.</li>
            <li>I was not able to see very much difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>It left it feeling and looking smooth for several hours, but I got the same results, if not better when  using other skin care products.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product did feel and smell nice</li>
            <li> This product is good for hydration nothing else , no Botox whatsoever , but if you looking for more hydration this product will do the work</li>

            <li> my skin is very smooth.</li>
            <li> THIS SNAKE PEPTIDE, FEELS GOOD , GOES INTO THE SKIN QUICKLY, BUT ITS DEFINELY NOT A BOTOX ALTERNATIVE</li>

            <li> I love this cream.</li>
            <li> Precious product that needs appreciation.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it in my nighttime routing</li>

            <li> and I wake up with my skin absorbing all this great stuff.</li>
            <li> Two weeks, no change, well yes, my pores are showing sooo much more, my age spots are showing even moreðŸ˜ž  </li>
            <li> and it was nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I used to have many pores and those started to disappear.</li>
            <li> Will get another bottle to see if I can get even better results.</li>
            <li> After one week of using in the morning, my skin is clearer and more moisturized.</li>
            <li> I ordered a jar and they sent a pump and this does not do what it says it feels ok but not what I thought I ordered</li>
            <li> It cleared up my post-acne marks, hydrates, and gave my skin a more glowing look.</li>
            <li> love it..</li>
            <li> and I love the sun and this product</li>
            <li> But I will give the product more time.</li>
            <li> I use many products and have lots of experience.</li>
            <li> You might love it if you have never used lots of products before.</li>
            <li> more like snake oil, you will get more results just using coconut oil, not saying that will amaze you either</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied with the result of Skin Rescue Rx.</li>
            <li> ,my favorite would recommend this people that have tried many thing , IAM  hook on it.</li>
            <li> It is still better than putting injections of Botox in your face.</li>
            <li> , it has hyaluronic acid in it and is nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I bought 2 more just</li>
            <li> I love this  product.  </li>
            <li> Love it on my lips as well creates a fullness</li>
            <li> I feel confident that the lines will continue to fade.  </li>
            <li> and I would gladly recommend this to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This really earned my trust and all the girls who tried this out surely loved it.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s what my injections are for :) Super satisfied with the product, shipping time, and condition of box.</li>
            <li> It has a very light texture; it is really easy to apply and produces results quickly.</li>
            <li> I do feel it softened the fine lines and tightened my skin.</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference in my fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I do see a difference with my fine lines.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, first time I had something that worked so fast like this.</li>
            <li> FINE LINES DISAPPEAR WITH CONTINUING  USE</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any diminishing of fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Those light wrinkles are disappearing and for me to get ahead of the wrinkles</li>
            <li> I use it every night and the day after my skin feels fantastic.</li>
            <li> All of the ingredients work to smooth lines and reduce pores.</li>
            <li> Great product with actual results.</li>
            <li> and i advise you try it because there are different skin types and the service was great.</li>
            <li> So far I seem to have nice smooth eye area, I was hoping for better results on my forehead and mouth area.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, you can wear under your makeup.</li>
            <li> My skin also feels soft, smooth and hydrated, which are great signs that this product is well worth the purchase</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I never took any vitamins nor did I eat a lot of healthier vitamin rich food.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure what it would do for my face.</li>
            <li> It applies smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This product has done a great job my skin is also not as rough</li>
            <li> So just keep your options open and be wise in you choice</li>
            <li> After applying it the next morning my skin looked really good</li>
            <li> Claim of being the alternative to Botox is about the only good thing  I see.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think I have seen the full benefits yet.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle trying to give it a fair shot.</li>
            <li> Have had no bad reactions at all.  </li>
            <li> The seller quickly ships also.</li>
            <li> Of course I don&#x27;t expect to see results so quickly, but I&#x27;m convinced that all the ingredients listed are not in it.</li>
            <li> I have been using  this for several weeks and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> First of all i love this product really much and it deliver super quick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and silky but hydrates very well.</li>
            <li> and my skin is so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> BUT - SO FAR, LOVE HOW IT FEELS AND WILL SEE HOW RESULTS GO.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about an ounce worth of colored oil.</li>
            <li> I noticed some difference, but it sure is nowhere near what they advertise it to be.</li>
            <li> So far I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it in conjunction with their other facial treatment, and have been very happy with the smoothing, soothing, moisturizing effects.</li>
            <li> I did not see any results and I am 41 with only very fine lines.</li>
            <li> So when I received it I decided to give it a fair shot since all the other products were appealing and I have actually never used emu oil on my face.</li>
            <li> I like this so much I bought a back-up quickly.</li>
            <li> It somehow manages to be rich and light at the same time.</li>
            <li> To those expecting the botox effect, the amount in this container is not enough; the argireline peptide works better, but is still not botox.</li>
            <li> peeling at first when applying foundation on lower jar area.</li>
            <li> This is a truly lovely facial product.</li>
            <li> Delivery was lightening fast!</li>
            <li> My skin texture and overall appearance has improved and my face feels and looks more supple and youthful.</li>
            <li> I will keep using this product and write another review when I am sure what my final results are.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it never did anything for my skin.</li>
            <li> but the results are almost immediate, my skin had become more elastic because of the collagen, its radiant and younger looking, and it doesnâ€™t make my skin dry which I love.</li>
            <li> I have only two days that I am using it,till now I am not seeing any difference , overall it looks good</li>
            <li> First time using such an effective product, overall I have to say its a 5 star product, works well!</li>
            <li> ..I have pretty much stopped using the other creams that caused breakouts, and my skin looks much better than it did before.</li>
            <li> within these last two weeks my skin has become so much smoother and brighter and my pores and fine lines have shrunk.</li>
            <li> Really in snake peptide</li>
            <li> Not too much results after two weeks but still hoping.</li>
            <li> It works better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I am 66, my skin has become very porous and wrinkled with sun damage and age spots.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really didnt have anything to compare it to?</li>
            <li> This is really great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast service excelent product</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> VERY CREAMY AND LUXURIOUS FEEL TO IT</li>
            <li> but it is very moisturizing like a cream</li>
            <li> It goes on silky, after about 6 weeks of use, I really didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> This product really does lift your skin.  </li>
            <li> I really did not feel no change on my face</li>
            <li> My face looks more radiant and my skin is not as rough.</li>
            <li> But my skin Does seem to be smoother but not as much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I liked it well enough to give it a second chance for more&lt;br</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to add alot of drops to your face and it would still work effectively within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time or money on this!!!</li>
            <li> I have used other retinol products and this one my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> and I should have researched a little better first.</li>
            <li> It is on par with other products for which I have paid much more.</li>
            <li> With so many other products out there, this does not stand out.</li>
            <li> I use 2x day, it only takes a little, light but powerful, super ingredients really do make a difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product along side my other normal beauty products and have found amazing results thus far.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching my face, my skin has never felt this soft before as I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I will buy more of this as it actually helped my skin look younger!</li>
            <li> I switched over to this brand because it&#x27;s way cheaper and actually contains so much more extra stuff.</li>
            <li> Very silky moisturizer - so far</li>
            <li> I really like the way this feels on my skin, makes your face really soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely helped reduce the appearance of my laugh lines and my forehead lines.</li>
            <li> helped me alot and is much cheaper than alot of other products!&lt;br /&gt;Getting 1 more bottle later this week!</li>
            <li> seen better results using plain almond oil and coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to try some new things to benefit my face.</li>
            <li> so Im stocked cause this stuff is a cant live with out.</li>
            <li> My only solution for this is this cream which is very simple to use and after some time you will see the huge results</li>
            <li> My skin feels firmer with less fine lines.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t exactly make wrinkles disappear but it definitely moisturized and revitalized the appearance of my face.</li>
            <li> I am not to confident in the other benefits as I have not seen any difference in the firmness however, I used it after facial treatment</li>
            <li> and I my fine lines are less noticeable and my skin looks moist and dewy but not oily.</li>
            <li> Soft and natural (mainly ingredients)</li>
            <li> used daily  saw results on one side, did not work on deep wrinkles only slightly on fine lines so far.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product and wanted me to try it to help clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> So far no one has answered my question.</li>
            <li> It feels extremely natural when you put it on.</li>
            <li> wow, all i can say is WOW</li>
            <li> Having wrinkles at the age of 35 is too early I think.</li>
            <li> While it made my skin smoother, it was a far cry from a botox alternative.</li>
            <li> but I like the smoothness of it so far.</li>
            <li> So far I am liking this product--</li>
            <li> No difference on my skin thus far.</li>
            <li> This serum leaves my skin soft like silk</li>
            <li> Did not do much, have been using daily since I received it</li>
            <li> Using this product made me look younger by almost 15 years; I applied this every morning and night with a gentle massage.</li>
            <li> I would probably give this one more chance , results is slow.</li>
            <li> But Im pretty sure I can sort out the fake reviews-</li>
            <li> I think it mainly helps those who actually avoid being in the sun without sunscreen though.  </li>
            <li> Effective against damage from having sensitive skin, my skin is very sensitive and when I eat something wrong it would break out.</li>
            <li> if you haven&#x27;t tried a similar skin care product like this I highly recommend giving this serum a try.</li>
            <li> I normally use an $82 Hydrating Serum from a big cosmeceutical that does not hydrate and soften the skin as well as this.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind they were not deep set, but wow!</li>
            <li> I also bought a bottle for my mom who is 50 years old, and she received countless compliments on how &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; her skin looks after she began using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely helped reduce the appearance of my laugh lines and my forehead lines within a few month from this product.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of using it once a day ONLY in the mornings as directed I really saw no results or difference in my skin other</li>
            <li> I broke out within a week pretty heavily.</li>
            <li> So I of course I started to wonder if I wasted my money, but I have tried so many face products in the past that did not work at all.</li>
            <li> I was not able to see very much difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> It left it feeling and looking smooth for several hours, but I got the same results, if not better when  using other skin care products.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft, just like it does when I use other facial products.</li>
            <li> Since it costs so much and not sure what my skin reaction would be</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s making any real difference.</li>
            <li> Before I bought or heard about this product I would say my skin was in pretty bad condition as far as large pores, oily, acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I cant wait to see the long term of it.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have had is that the pump doesn&#x27;t work, so I don&#x27;t know how much to useâ€¦.so far have been using whatever clings to the rod, but once the supply goes down, it will be impossible to tell how much to use.  </li>
            <li> My forehead and cheeks actually feel rough and dry..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Just started using it 2 weeks ago and so far I have visible change in my wrinkles, hoping they will go away after a few weeks or so !</li>
            <li> they are less deep.</li>
            <li> It is not even a good moisturizer :(&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t recommend, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> My acne has as well decreased significantly and on the plus side I have gotten 5 weeks of use out of less than a quarter of the bottle!!</li>
            <li> No real noticable difference, except my skin did appear to be softer.</li>
            <li> You only need a few drops it goes on like a serum</li>
            <li> Only a few drops at day and night.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I really am not seeing a difference.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I eat extremely well and sleep</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way too!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and made me at least 7 years younger.</li>
            <li> I skin fells smoother and my wrinkles on my forehead are visibly less than before.</li>
            <li> The lines on my forehead and around my mouth have gotten less noticeable after just a month.</li>
            <li> This product do not work like all the previous reviews, after finishing the product I put 100%almond oil in the bottle and has been using it for a bout 3 weeks</li>
            <li> It does not work too well for under the black circles on the eyes, but the rest of the face looks rested, even co-workers are noticing the change.</li>
            <li> I also found it odd</li>
            <li> Due to this unfortunate series of events I started to have old and wrinkly skin.</li>
            <li> I tried using a very small amount thinking I had just been using it wrong, but it still comes right off.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this because men need a little help too.</li>
            <li> than it being a little softer.</li>
            <li> I did not see any results and it dried my face out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had people compliment my skin after using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buy almond oil.</li>
            <li> That says something, when you see them everyday and they notice?</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and night in my trouble areas and it does help.  </li>
            <li> This just balls up and peels off of my face after  a few minutes.</li>
            <li> And my small wrinkles  are almost gone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with botox  :/</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where any of the negative reviews are coming from, bc</li>
            <li> at least I know I&#x27;ll get what I pay for.</li>
            <li> It has been awful, but just after five applications, things have significantly improved.  </li>
            <li> I MEAN NOT TAKE AWAY</li>
            <li> My little secret!</li>
            <li> 3 days and my forehead wrinkles are hardly noticeable!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great underneath makeup</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure about this, don&#x27;t think it is doing ANYTHING to reduce my wrinkles.... :(</li>
            <li> but I was wrong as always.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> It has a bit of a weird smell too.</li>
            <li> It repaired a chicken pox scar on my face that I have had since childhood.  </li>
            <li> I think I was allergic to something in it. :(</li>
            <li> It is worthless.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the advertisement of the product</li>
            <li> Horrible didn&#x27;t do what said</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like it.  will reorder.  i change my products after finishing off one.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything. I have used it  for sixty days every day and have not noticed a difference in wrinkles. It is worthless. I threw my money away!</li>
            <li> I have not bought this item yet.. But Im pretty sure I can sort out the fake reviews- the overhyped ones that are posted to sell the product. A topical cream can not ever act as the same results as Botox injections. I&#x27;m only posting this because I don&#x27;t want people to be fooled into spending money on a product that sells only its looks and not its results. So just keep your options open and be wise in you choice</li>
            <li> what a joke, I think I must be way too gullible looking for eternal youth and good looking skin.  Really in snake peptide I don&#x27;t think so,</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizing texture. Not too much results after two weeks but still hoping.</li>
            <li> I never took any vitamins nor did I eat a lot of healthier vitamin rich food. Due to this unfortunate series of events I started to have old and wrinkly skin. I didnâ€™t know how to solve this but botox alternative saved me!</li>
            <li> I have been using this about three weeks. It works better than I expected. I am very happy with the product. I would like to know if I should use my regular moisturizer with it.  So far no one has answered my question.</li>
            <li> I did not see any results and it dried my face out. I did not see any results and I am 41 with only very fine lines.</li>
            <li> Once again...To the graveyard!</li>
            <li> Gives great results fast</li>
            <li> I really LOVE this product and it works!</li>
            <li> Great serum for hydration, which is why I purchased it. I normally use an $82 Hydrating Serum from a big cosmeceutical that does not hydrate and soften the skin as well as this. To those expecting the botox effect, the amount in this container is not enough; the argireline peptide works better, but is still not botox. I was not expecting the &amp;#34;botox&amp;#34; effect, that&#x27;s what my injections are for :) Super satisfied with the product, shipping time, and condition of box.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my face!</li>
            <li> Not sure about this, don&#x27;t think it is doing ANYTHING to reduce my wrinkles.... :(</li>
            <li> I think that this is the best one Iâ€™ve used by far. It doesnâ€™t feel unnatural when you use it. It feels extremely natural when you put it on. I will buy more of this as it actually helped my skin look younger!</li>
            <li> I am not at the stage where botox is needed but I am noticing frown lines, crows feet around my eyes and wrinkles under my eyes. I have seen and heard people use snake venom in replace of botox. Since it costs so much and not sure what my skin reaction would be I got this during one of their promotion. This is something I will be investing in from now on. Those light wrinkles are disappearing and for me to get ahead of the wrinkles I hope I don&#x27;t need to get botox treatment.</li>
            <li> I do feel it softened the fine lines and tightened my skin. If you don&#x27;t use a microdermabrasion on you skin you will notice&lt;br /&gt;some peeling at first when applying foundation on lower jar area. I liked it well enough to give it a second chance for more&lt;br /&gt;improvement. Should be ok for all skin types.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It really is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have to give this product sometime to see if it work as described. to soon to give an opinion at this time</li>
            <li> I purchased this in January and have been using it ever since. This product stinks!!!!I have not seen any noticable changes whats so ever. Do not waste your time or money on this!!! Also when i contacted the company, they would not wrok with me at all and issue me a refund or even a credit...</li>
            <li> Who thought if I could change botox with this. Precious product that needs appreciation. This really earned my trust and all the girls who tried this out surely loved it. Now we look sexier and younger.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it in my nighttime routing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 2 months and I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s making any real difference.</li>
            <li> This is a truly lovely facial product. It somehow manages to be rich and light at the same time. The most effective product I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s light and silky but hydrates very well. My skin feels firmer with less fine lines. I&#x27;ve used it in conjunction with their other facial treatment, and have been very happy with the smoothing, soothing, moisturizing effects.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I switched over to this brand because it&#x27;s way cheaper and actually contains so much more extra stuff. Good product brand if you haven&#x27;t tried a similar skin care product like this I highly recommend giving this serum a try.</li>
            <li> This is the best serum I have ever used. It repaired a chicken pox scar on my face that I have had since childhood.  Will purchase again</li>
            <li> i guess it works.  like anything else, it takes time.  I like to see instant results and i am sure it working, just may see more results in 30 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had people compliment my skin after using it for a few days. It didn&#x27;t exactly make wrinkles disappear but it definitely moisturized and revitalized the appearance of my face.</li>
            <li> Smells great and I apply it before going to bed and I wake up with my skin absorbing all this great stuff. I notice that my wrinkles under my eye are starting to shrink and my skin is definitely clearer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb!</li>
            <li> I skin fells smoother and my wrinkles on my forehead are visibly less than before. I think this is a very good product.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product and wanted me to try it to help clear up my skin. This product has done a great job my skin is also not as rough and my wife appreciates that, she says I look younger. I will continue to use this because men need a little help too.</li>
            <li> I thought this was all chemistry and would harm me but I was wrong as always. This is clinically proven to work and I think it&#x27;s revolutionary. Grab one for you as well, it totally works.</li>
            <li> All i can say is DO NOT DRINK IT....wow, all i can say is WOW</li>
            <li> It feels good and silky when applied. I was not able to see very much difference in my skin.  Probably will not make another purchase.</li>
            <li> I am 66, my skin has become very porous and wrinkled with sun damage and age spots. This product brightens my immediately. THEN I noticed a big difference in the wrinkles around my mouth...they are less deep. Age spots are gradually disappearing too! I am so happy with this product I have ordered it for two of my friends and can&#x27;t wait to see their surprise when they discover how wonderful it is. I have used other retinol products and this one my absolute favorite. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I use it every night and the day after my skin feels fantastic. This is not botox but it works great if you want to improve your skin without getting harmful injections.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any difference?</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference in my fine lines.  I would not order this product again.  Maybe some people may see a difference but I did not.</li>
            <li> First of all i love this product really much and it deliver super quick. It&#x27;s definitely helped reduce the appearance of my laugh lines and my forehead lines within a few month from this product. You don&#x27;t need to add alot of drops to your face and it would still work effectively within a few weeks. Good product would recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it more stars! 3 days and my forehead wrinkles are hardly noticeable! Keep in mind they were not deep set, but wow!</li>
            <li> Amazing for the skin, does a great job of cleaning up the damage from sun tanning and really tightens everything up. First time using such an effective product, overall I have to say its a 5 star product, works well!</li>
            <li> The snake peptide is actually syn-ake palmitoyl on the bottle ingredient list. There must not be enough in the bottle because there was no relaxing of the facial muscles going on. I looked up syn-ake palmitoyl and it is suppose to mimic snake venom and synake actually reduces inflammation in the skin. I do not have inflammation on my face. I eat extremely well and sleep well so I do not need a product to reduce inflammation.  on the advertisement I did not see emu oil in the ingredients or I would not have purchased it anyway. I do not buy oil based products I am acne prone. So when I received it I decided to give it a fair shot since all the other products were appealing and I have actually never used emu oil on my face. I broke out within a week pretty heavily. I am very disappointed in the advertisement of the product and I should have researched a little better first. Of course I would not have known to research synake or emu oil.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for 3 weeks. Did absolutely nothing. Another gimmick, in my opinion. Botox alternative??? As if!! Ha!</li>
            <li> Two weeks, no change, well yes, my pores are showing sooo much more, my age spots are showing even moreðŸ˜ž  u will continue using it until its finished. I will write a review then.</li>
            <li> This is a good product that compliments Botox.  I use this product in  between my Botox treatments.  All of the ingredients work to smooth lines and reduce pores.</li>
            <li> Having wrinkles at the age of 35 is too early I think. I didn&#x27;t want any facial injections so I decided to go with this cream. Works like a charm and made me at least 7 years younger.</li>
            <li> Effective against damage from having sensitive skin, my skin is very sensitive and when I eat something wrong it would break out. This helps a lot in healing up the damage, I just apply it and it heals up in no time.</li>
            <li> This product has exceeded my expectations--wow!! It&#x27;s definitely helped reduce the appearance of my laugh lines and my forehead lines. I can&#x27;t wait to see long-term results. I&#x27;ve experienced no breakouts from this product which is a miracle in itself. I use 2x day, it only takes a little, light but powerful, super ingredients really do make a difference! no complaints!</li>
            <li> Soft and natural (mainly ingredients) and i love the bottle style with pump, also came at within a good time frame! Thanks</li>
            <li> I really didnt have anything to compare it to? I just wanted to try some new things to benefit my face. I thought it worked good.</li>
            <li> I am not to confident in the other benefits as I have not seen any difference in the firmness however, I used it after facial treatment and I healed in 2 days nicely. still waiting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where any of the negative reviews are coming from, bc I have nothing but great things to say about this item.  I&#x27;ve suffered from melasma for years.  It has been awful, but just after five applications, things have significantly improved.  Have had no bad reactions at all.  Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I like this so much I bought a back-up quickly. It delivers results rapidly, it beats the rival I paid $50 for and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve been using this for 2 weeks now; Iâ€™m applying it every day before I go to sleep with a derma roller. I noticed my skin has improved in terms of its softness and elasticity. I will continue using it to achieve my desired results.</li>
            <li> This is really great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helped me alot and is much cheaper than alot of other products!&lt;br /&gt;Getting 1 more bottle later this week!</li>
            <li> I had an appointment with my cosmetologist for Botox injection, When suddenly my friend recommended this serum to me and I tried it as soon as possible. And after a week of using it I never went for Botox Injections again. I have been using this for a while now and I can say that there are no wrinkles on my face my skin is very smooth.</li>
            <li> used it faithfully and have not seen any claims as advertised. Waste of money</li>
            <li> I saw a difference after about a week.</li>
            <li> Have been using for 3 weeks and have not noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> Very silky moisturizer - so far so good. I do see a difference with my fine lines. Delivery was lightening fast!</li>
            <li> Good product, I&#x27;m very happy with the all natural ingredients in this. After applying it the next morning my skin looked really good and it was nice and smooth. Great stuff, first time I had something that worked so fast like this.</li>
            <li> Love it. My pores are smaller. And my small wrinkles  are almost gone</li>
            <li> Works good but is a bit over-hyped.  You can get the same result with over-the-counter products at Target.  While it made my skin smoother, it was a far cry from a botox alternative.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference at all in lines. I&#x27;ll stick with botox  :/ at least I know I&#x27;ll get what I pay for. Bummed.</li>
            <li> Bought it as it was on sale. (Ye, I am a bargain hunter I know). I have noticed that after using it skin started to look somehow cleaner. I used to have many pores and those started to disappear. So far so good. Will get another bottle to see if I can get even better results.</li>
            <li> This works really great but unfortunately it irritated my skin. It made my skin really red &amp; burned a bit. I think I was allergic to something in it. :(</li>
            <li> Great product with actual results. My skin texture and overall appearance has improved and my face feels and looks more supple and youthful. I use it every morning and my skin has never looked and felt better! The lines on my forehead and around my mouth have gotten less noticeable after just a month. I finally found something that does what it claims.</li>
            <li> I and my skin love this product,it does not disappoint! It is on par with other products for which I have paid much more. After one week of using in the morning, my skin is clearer and more moisturized. My complexion is even visibly brighter. The seller quickly ships also. I will be adding this one to my regimen and repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Fast service excelent product</li>
            <li> This product do not work like all the previous reviews, after finishing the product I put 100%almond oil in the bottle and has been using it for a bout 3 weeks and my skin is so soft and smooth! Don&#x27;t waste your money buy almond oil.</li>
            <li> Just started using it 2 weeks ago and so far I have visible change in my wrinkles, hoping they will go away after a few weeks or so ! I am pretty impressed !!</li>
            <li> I am an aesthetician, and this is THE BEST SERUM EVER.</li>
            <li> This product did feel and smell nice and i advise you try it because there are different skin types and the service was great.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and contains everything that I need all in one, this supplement works well and has contains a bunch of good ingredients that&#x27;s amazing for skin care. I will definitely be re-ordering this serum when I run out.</li>
            <li> Using it daily in the morning and its like a daily vitamin but for the skin. It does a great job with keeping my skin healthy with nutrients. It looks great now and best of all has a healthy glow to it.</li>
            <li> this is the best !!&lt;br /&gt;brings out the YOUTH !!&lt;br /&gt;it does NOT. I MEAN NOT TAKE AWAY WRINKLES,&lt;br /&gt;IT HELPS REDUCE THEM,&lt;br /&gt;GIVING YOUR FACE AND NECK A GREAT GLOW  &amp;  FINE LINES DISAPPEAR WITH CONTINUING  USE</li>
            <li> Just \\&quot;OK\\&quot;. My skin feels soft, just like it does when I use other facial products. It applies smoothly and absorbs quickly. No difference in my facial appearance. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Am using twice daily as directed. Am 71 so don&#x27;t expect a miracle but I like the smoothness of it so far.</li>
            <li> I ordered a jar and they sent a pump and this does not do what it says it feels ok but not what I thought I ordered</li>
            <li> No real noticable difference, except my skin did appear to be softer.</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping some with the wrinkles texture of my skin is smoother I recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I have been using  this for several weeks and am very pleased with the results.  The only problem I have had is that the pump doesn&#x27;t work, so I don&#x27;t know how much to useâ€¦.so far have been using whatever clings to the rod, but once the supply goes down, it will be impossible to tell how much to use.  But the effect on my skin has been a good oneâ€¦..I have pretty much stopped using the other creams that caused breakouts, and my skin looks much better than it did before.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff, you can feel it tighten your skin immediately.</li>
            <li> Botox alternative?  Really. Dont see it. Claim of being the alternative to Botox is about the only good thing  I see. Good advertising but doesnt work for me</li>
            <li> So far I am liking this product-- I use this in conjunction with Uplift by Younique and am noticing fewer lines and wrinkles.  I think it mainly helps those who actually avoid being in the sun without sunscreen though.  If you are going to allow yourself to get burned repeatedly, nothing is going to prevent and diminish wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Saw immediate results. I&#x27;ve tried every serum on the market. This is a keeper  Imagine looking 5 years younger in three weeks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great serum! It cleared up my post-acne marks, hydrates, and gave my skin a more glowing look. I am a combination oily skin, but it has never caused any break outs- only prevents them. I will be buying another bottle when I am done with my current one. And a little goes a long way too! I also bought a bottle for my mom who is 50 years old, and she received countless compliments on how &amp;#34;young&amp;#34; her skin looks after she began using this.</li>
            <li> A+++ SELLER, VERY QUICK TO SHIP PRODUCT OUT, YOUR SKIN FEELS WONDERFUL AFTER APPLYING PRODUCT, VERY CREAMY AND LUXURIOUS FEEL TO IT, JUST TRIED LAST NIGHT SO, WILL SEE HOW RESULTS GO BUT - SO FAR, LOVE HOW IT FEELS AND WILL SEE HOW RESULTS GO.</li>
            <li> i got pimples which  I have not had since my teen ager years / no snake bites but this stuf is jus $$$$$ and no results.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great. love it.. I am 60 and I love the sun and this product actually has an affect on my face.</li>
            <li> I had used a more expensive cream, and tried this gel like cream instead. So far I seem to have nice smooth eye area, I was hoping for better results on my forehead and mouth area. But I will give the product more time. It&#x27;s been over a month now.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks, and my skin is looking tighter. It does not work too well for under the black circles on the eyes, but the rest of the face looks rested, even co-workers are noticing the change. That says something, when you see them everyday and they notice?</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks. Of course I don&#x27;t expect to see results so quickly, but I&#x27;m convinced that all the ingredients listed are not in it. It&#x27;s about an ounce worth of colored oil. I guess we will never know, lol. No difference on my skin thus far.</li>
            <li> Before I bought or heard about this product I would say my skin was in pretty bad condition as far as large pores, oily, acne prone skin so when I researched these ingredients I bought it thinking it would be a miracle face treatment that I would see immediate change with....After 3 weeks of using it once a day ONLY in the mornings as directed I really saw no results or difference in my skin other than it being a little softer. So I of course I started to wonder if I wasted my money, but I have tried so many face products in the past that did not work at all. I am now going on my 5th week of using it and It&#x27;s like an &amp;#34;activator&amp;#34; just turned to the ON position. within these last two weeks my skin has become so much smoother and brighter and my pores and fine lines have shrunk. My acne has as well decreased significantly and on the plus side I have gotten 5 weeks of use out of less than a quarter of the bottle!!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, you can wear under your makeup. I have noticed that my face appears nicer. Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s as good as Botox..cause nothing compares to that! But, good product, i will order again.</li>
            <li> I noticed some difference, but it sure is nowhere near what they advertise it to be. I use many products and have lots of experience. You might love it if you have never used lots of products before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made my face feel softer. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure what it would do for my face. After 2 wks of use I have noticed that my face looks good and it&#x27;s softer.</li>
            <li> THIS SNAKE PEPTIDE, FEELS GOOD , GOES INTO THE SKIN QUICKLY, BUT ITS DEFINELY NOT A BOTOX ALTERNATIVE, I WONT BE REODERING!!</li>
            <li> works great!!! will be buying more asap!!!</li>
            <li> more like snake oil, you will get more results just using coconut oil, not saying that will amaze you either but this is nothing like they try to portray it.  Does nothing.  Rinse and repeat, does nothing.</li>
            <li> This is serum is the best I have ever used. You only need a few drops it goes on like a serum but it is very moisturizing like a cream so I can use it without Applying a moisturizer and It hides my pores. I have been using this serum for only a week and my skin already looks firmer and I my fine lines are less noticeable and my skin looks moist and dewy but not oily. This serum leaves my skin soft like silk I can&#x27;t stop touching my face, my skin has never felt this soft before as I have dry skin. This serum has it all vitamins, Peptides, antioxidants , Dmae, Retinol and HA I will not be without this one!! I absolutley Love it!!</li>
            <li> It goes on silky, after about 6 weeks of use, I really didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin.  It left it feeling and looking smooth for several hours, but I got the same results, if not better when  using other skin care products.  Didn&#x27;t see any diminishing of fine lines.  I have just a bit left in the bottle and will just use it on the back of my hands, and have switched to another product for my face.  I also found it odd I coudn&#x27;t find anything about the manufacturer online by typing in the company name and city that was listed on the bottle.  Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> Good deal for this and works well, for the price this product is perfect it works well and has a good supply that I can use everyday. I been using for 2 weeks now and it does an amazing job.</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied with the result of Skin Rescue Rx. Iâ€™ve just started to use it but the results are almost immediate, my skin had become more elastic because of the collagen, its radiant and younger looking, and it doesnâ€™t make my skin dry which I love. I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> 12 points to this serum</li>
            <li> the  best ever work the first days.  ,my favorite would recommend this people that have tried many thing , IAM  hook on it.</li>
            <li> This product really does lift your skin.  However it has to be used daily.  It is still better than putting injections of Botox in your face.</li>
            <li> Awesome, I already bought 2 more bottles and recommended it to my friends. It&#x27;s not great underneath makeup but it definitely does what it claims!!!</li>
            <li> Did not do much, have been using daily since I received it</li>
            <li> great product would order again thx</li>
            <li> This product is good for hydration nothing else , no Botox whatsoever , but if you looking for more hydration this product will do the work</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell any difference between this product and a product from the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I really did not feel no change on my face I used it like I was told to. Red the bottle and put it on my face felt nothing at all almost gone would I buy it again no</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used to product to give it an 5 star review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Rachel h</li>
            <li> This stuff does work.  I use it everyday and night in my trouble areas and it does help.  But it&#x27;s not like Botox so don&#x27;t expect that.  It wears off as the day goes on.  I do like it though, it has hyaluronic acid in it and is nice and smooth.  Only a few drops at day and night.  It should last a while too!</li>
            <li> I have only two days that I am using it,till now I am not seeing any difference , overall it looks good but it is kind of sticky.</li>
            <li> Break outs .... guess not for all type of the skin</li>
            <li> I really like the way this feels on my skin, makes your face really soft. I am using this in combination with their 20% C serum and I can already see a difference in my skin. My face looks more radiant and my skin is not as rough.</li>
            <li> Did not see any results. I would not recommend anyone to buy. I would like my money back on both of my products if possible.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin.  I finished this product and I haven&#x27;t notice any improvement.  It is not even a good moisturizer :(&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t recommend, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a few weeks so I don&#x27;t think I have seen the full benefits yet. But my skin Does seem to be smoother but not as much as I had hoped. I will keep using this product and write another review when I am sure what my final results are.</li>
            <li> This just balls up and peels off of my face after  a few minutes. I tried using a very small amount thinking I had just been using it wrong, but it still comes right off. I have combination skin type if that helps anyone else.  I think this was a purchase error on my side.</li>
            <li> I really am not seeing a difference. I am on my second bottle trying to give it a fair shot. It has a bit of a weird smell too.</li>
            <li> Adding this to my daily skin care is helping a lot, use to seeing a lot of dryness and a bit flakiness. This serum is a great remedy because after using for 4 days I started to see the spots healing up.</li>
            <li> After about a week using this I could tell my skin had a glow and all my friends were asking what I was doing different. My little secret!</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff just to give it a try and not even a week a seen results. I cant wait to see the long term of it. I bought 2 more just so Im stocked cause this stuff is a cant live with out. My lips look pumper and my forehead wrinkles have soften a hole lot. You got to try it for your self and I hope it works for you as it has for me</li>
            <li> I would probably give this one more chance , results is slow. used daily  saw results on one side, did not work on deep wrinkles only slightly on fine lines so far.</li>
            <li> Went on nicely, felt like liquid silk. Unfortunately, it never did anything for my skin.</li>
            <li> I tried this for a month and noticed no obvious results. With so many other products out there, this does not stand out.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you get upset when you see deep wrinkles in your face and want to remove them somehow. My only solution for this is this cream which is very simple to use and after some time you will see the huge results</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell if it helps</li>
            <li> I am so happy to see something clicked for my skins after trying a lots of products, and it it will reduce, and spots will vanish over time, it aint any magic. I am definately gonna recommen to my friends</li>
            <li> I use to have a bunch of different types of creams but this one helped cleaned it all up and save me the time of applying it. This product is great and works for my skin, very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I love this  product.  I do Notice a change in my skin texture and pore size diminishing.  I ordered a 2nd bottle wish it came in bigger bottle.  Love it on my lips as well creates a fullness I dont bother with lipstick anymore.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™m 76 and Iâ€™m way pass my prime, but I still want to look good and beautiful. Using this product made me look younger by almost 15 years; I applied this every morning and night with a gentle massage. After several weeks of using it I have radiant youthful looking skin.</li>
            <li> As a woman who does not want to age ungraciously I find myself seeking out alternative treatments for my skin care.  I had heard that there was a topical treatment that worked similarly to Botox, but with out the pain of going under the needle. I&#x27;ve been using this product along side my other normal beauty products and have found amazing results thus far.  My finest lines along my eyes and forehead have diminished quite nicely and with continued use I feel confident that the lines will continue to fade.  My skin also feels soft, smooth and hydrated, which are great signs that this product is well worth the purchase and I would gladly recommend this to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Horrible didn&#x27;t do what said</li>
            <li> It has a very light texture; it is really easy to apply and produces results quickly. So far I love it.</li>
            <li> It has been 2 weeks since I started using this on my face and I have not had good results.  My face is breaking out , my pores look larger and my skin actually feels dryer. .I&#x27;ve seen better results using plain almond oil and coconut oil. My forehead and cheeks actually feel rough and dry..guess it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
