            <li>I love it fits perfectly</li>
            <li>This is so worth the money!!!!</li>
            <li>then i realized it did look good</li>
            <li>However the wig fit her perfectly and the quality was good.</li>
            <li>Also, the quality of the wig hair is nice.</li>
            <li>Great product, quick ship</li>
            <li>This wig is so much better than</li>
            <li>Disney, I still love ya-</li>
            <li>it is so much better than the Disney version.</li>
            <li>My niece is so in love with it</li>
            <li>they add the perfect extra touch!</li>
            <li>Plenty of hair, very full.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true to the picture and was delivered on time!</li>
            <li>This wig took a long time to recieve, but it really was the best that I have seen.</li>
            <li>It looked nice, I have very long thick curly hair and was able to wear it and looked great :)</li>
            <li>The wig fits great, on both me (29 yrs old) and my 9 yr old daughter, with the adjustable clips.</li>
            <li>and at first i was kind of surprised by the look, but</li>
            <li>I was also excited to confirm that the wig does in fact fit an adult head!</li>
            <li>Worth the wait</li>
            <li>It was advertised as fitting an adult too.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Looks very pretty on, and the braid is nice and long, to about my elbow.</li>
            <li>Loved it, very soft felt like human hair.</li>
            <li>The braid is VERY thick-just like Elsa&#x27;s-and true to the picture.</li>
            <li>Seemed like it was meant more for a teen sized head.</li>
            <li>Cheap Material(I know what more would you expect for less that $20 dls)</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have a large head  or gobs of hair by any means and could barely get it to fit.</li>
            <li>As far as the style and color goes, it was perfect (it even comes with really cute snowflake hair pins) but it didn&#x27;t cover my hairline in front or back, even when I wore a wig cap with my (short) hair pinned down flat to my head.</li>
            <li>I was really worried when I placed the order.</li>
            <li>She was Ariel last year and had a wig that actually fit, so we know how one is suppose to go around her head.</li>
            <li>But lets face it, that is a small price to pay for such a beautiful costume wig.</li>
            <li>However, good enough for little girls wanting to dress up as Elsa for Halloween.</li>
            <li>I like how this wig can fit a child to an adult because of the clip inside of the wig that allows different size fits.</li>
            <li>Just like frozen the only thing is that we struggled with the top because it looked bit different than on the photo.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this Elsa wig because it was so natural and Wayyyyy better looking than the other little girl&#x27;s Elsa wigs.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it for normal wear, but for costume wear</li>
            <li>I tried it on, and yes, it is big enough to fit an adult and it has the clasps to adjust to a child.</li>
            <li>Just be aware that at the front middle of the forhead, the wig is shaped in a &#x27;widows peak&#x27;.</li>
            <li>This is large enough to cover all of it.</li>
            <li>Adult,..</li>
            <li>this is for a child not an adult as advertised</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter who is 6 years old and it does not even cover her hair.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old loves it.</li>
            <li>Worn on a 6 yr old because of the adjustable size.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit &amp; I have a small head/hat size for an adult!</li>
            <li>but this wig is definitely for someone with a smaller head and the title says it&#x27;s for an adult</li>
            <li>My 6 year old daughter has long hair.</li>

            <li> but this wig is definitely for someone with a smaller head and the title says it&#x27;s for an adult</li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter has long hair.</li>
            <li> I have many wigs, and have purchased some that have this terrible cheap &#x27;sheen&#x27; look to them, which i can&#x27;t stand-</li>
            <li> the-very cheap looking-store bought versions and sad to say-sorry</li>
            <li> The company exaggerates how long it will take to arrive at the destination.</li>
            <li> bought for my 14 yr old and did not fit her head.</li>
            <li> I could see the netting and it didn&#x27;t have the long and thick realistic hair that this one did.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig once I had read reviews of all the other wigs, saying they were too small for an adult head.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other people are raving about.</li>
            <li> terrible, the size is not for an adult, maybe for a small kid it could be nice.</li>
            <li> Honestly my only complaint is that it has a rubber band-very unattractive-around the bottom closing up the braid.</li>
            <li> was flesh toned instead of black because you can see the black stick out from under the wig.</li>
            <li> It also came with a wig cap that is tight to keep hair from peeking out.</li>
            <li> Maybe we got a defective-sized wig, but this did NOT fit my daughter&#x27;s head, who just turned 4.</li>
            <li> And The Worst Part Didn&#x27;t Fit</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m sorry to say, that this wig also did not fit me well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the wig did not fit my child&#x27;s head and was very uncomfortable for her.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m So Sorry To Say This,.&amp;#34;&amp;#34;But</li>
            <li> so I ordered another one that was terrible!</li>

            <li> I order this and my daughter actually changed her mind in what she wanted to be this Halloween. However the wig fit her perfectly and the quality was good.</li>
            <li> I was really worried when I placed the order. The company exaggerates how long it will take to arrive at the destination. My wig came 3 weeks earlier than they said. I was also excited to confirm that the wig does in fact fit an adult head! This wig is a go for the grown ups. Do NOT order for a child&#x27;s head. It is too big for kids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m So Sorry To Say This,.&amp;#34;&amp;#34;But I Didn&#x27;t Like it,.Cheap Material(I know what more would you expect for less that $20 dls) And The Worst Part Didn&#x27;t Fit An Adult,..Like They Said.</li>
            <li> The Wig was great quality and the pins that came with it were exquisite as well but this wig is definitely for someone with a smaller head and the title says it&#x27;s for an adult and I don&#x27;t have a large head  or gobs of hair by any means and could barely get it to fit.

            <li> This wig took a long time to recieve, but it really was the best that I have seen. I needed it so I could dress as Elsa for a child&#x27;s birthday party and was worried I wouldn&#x27;t get it in time so I ordered another one that was terrible! I could see the netting and it didn&#x27;t have the long and thick realistic hair that this one did. Worth the wait (it still came in time too).</li>
            <li> terrible, the size is not for an adult, maybe for a small kid it could be nice.</li>
            <li> This wig is so much better than the-very cheap looking-store bought versions and sad to say-sorry Disney, I still love ya-it is so much better than the Disney version. I tried it on, and yes, it is big enough to fit an adult and it has the clasps to adjust to a child. I would not recommend it for normal wear, but for costume wear it is absolutely perfect! The braid is VERY thick-just like Elsa&#x27;s-and true to the picture. Honestly my only complaint is that it has a rubber band-very unattractive-around the bottom closing up the braid. I will have to go to an arts and craft store to find something to wrap over it to cover the rubber band. But lets face it, that is a small price to pay for such a beautiful costume wig. This is so worth the money!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who is 6 years old and it does not even cover her hair.</li>
            <li> I like the wig, but I do wish the hair cap that came with it was flesh toned instead of black because you can see the black stick out from under the wig.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter&#x27;s Halloween costume. She got a ton of compliments on it!</li>
            <li> I love it fits perfectly</li>
            <li> My 5 year old loves it. It fits her. It was advertised as fitting an adult too. I tried it on. It doesn&#x27;t fit &amp; I have a small head/hat size for an adult! However, good enough for little girls wanting to dress up as Elsa for Halloween.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Worn on a 6 yr old because of the adjustable size.  Plenty of hair, very full.  Perfect for a Halloween costume.  Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Elsa wig because it was so natural and Wayyyyy better looking than the other little girl&#x27;s Elsa wigs. I like how this wig can fit a child to an adult because of the clip inside of the wig that allows different size fits. My niece is so in love with it so I am a very Happy customer.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter has long hair. This is large enough to cover all of it. It also came with a wig cap that is tight to keep hair from peeking out. Also wig has adjustable straps</li>
            <li> Awesome wig! It&#x27;s true to the picture and was delivered on time! My daughter loves this for her Elsa costume</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the wig did not fit my child&#x27;s head and was very uncomfortable for her.</li>
