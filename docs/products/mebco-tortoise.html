            <li> I love this brush !!!!!! Since I bought this brush I&#x27;m not ripping my hair out thanks!!</li>
            <li> No more tangles! I was expecting a stronger plastic, but I&#x27;ve used it for de tangling 3a, 3c and 4c hair with absolutely no issues thus far. This comb has cut down the yelps I get from my little ones tremendously.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, exactly as described.  Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Received this comb in December 2013 as a gift. It was never used and sat in my draw until about 3 weeks ago. This is THE BEST DETANGLING COMB I have ever used. My hair is almost waist length 3c thick curly hair. Once I put my products on my hair for my prepoo,  the comb literally takes seconds to detangle my hair. I broke one of the teeth so I&#x27;m about to order 3 more (1 for me and 2 of my daughters). Awesome product. Forever a user!!!!</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well.  I like the wide teeth. Don&#x27;t seem to have as much hair breakage.</li>
            <li> I love this comb but the initial packaging of the protect was not strong enough and teeth were missing when the comb arrived. Still works great though</li>
            <li> I love this comb. I use it to comb out my waist length hair twice a day.</li>
            <li> Loved it so much I ordered two more, one for my purse and one for my gym bag.  I used to lose gobs of my long fine hair in my comb/brush after showering/washing it and now -- almost NONE!  It also seems to fluff up my dry hair and I can see my hair looking healthier/better, too.</li>
            <li> Awesome diet angler for kinky curly hair!</li>
            <li> Perfect come that don&#x27;t pull your hair out.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and long naturally curly hair and this comb is the best thing that&#x27;s ever happened to me. It ended the nightmare of detangling my hair that used to take over an hour after washing and conditioning. I love this come so much I bought 2 more for myself  (back ups) and 5 for my best friend and her 4 daughters who are all into natural hair care and styling.</li>
            <li> I have long hair ... This is the only comb that can get the tangles out after washing my hair.</li>
            <li> These work great for our thick wavy hair. Takes the tangles out of wet or dry hair without pulling out the waves.  Got some for both my daughters too.</li>
            <li> I love this comb to use with my natural hair. It&#x27;s the only comb that helps me to get through all of these hair. I&#x27;ve tried others but I will stick with this one, no doubt.</li>
            <li> This comb was somewhat of impulse purchase while I was shopping for other things on amazon. I have long, thick hair that is fragile and breaks easily, and this comb is fantastic.  Out of the variety of items I purchased, this comb was delivered first. Well packaged, and just as represented online.  Some reviewers have mentioned that it&#x27;s not good on thin hair, and I can see how that might be case. But I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box and saw the size of it, it was smaller then what I thought. It&#x27;s slightly bigger then the average human hand. But it works! I&#x27;ve been struggling with my natural 4b hair for months. I&#x27;ve had to change from comb to pick to detangler because my hair just gets longer and longer. This took the ease off of my hair BIG TIME. With water and conditioner in my hair, it detangled my kinks in less then 10 minutes. But I have ear length twa so that&#x27;s just me. I didn&#x27;t feel any ripped hair. I took my time and it did all the work for me. Love this.</li>
            <li> It arrived with a missing middle tooth, other than that it&#x27;s a nice comb. I took a shot hoping I wouldn&#x27;t get a broken one like others in the reviews.</li>
            <li> When this comb was shipped to me, one of the comb&#x27;s tongs was broken. I requested to MayaBeauty to ship me another and they were very helpful, patient, and polite. After I emailed them pictures of my broken comb, they agreed to send me another (which arrived within a week). The product itself is great also because I use it to detangle my hair in the shower after wearing twists, braids, or bantu-knots. Now, being African-American our natural hair is VERY knotty and tangly. This comb removes the tangles with ease and doesn&#x27;t require a lot of pressure to do so. Overall, this comb is great and the company is great also.</li>
