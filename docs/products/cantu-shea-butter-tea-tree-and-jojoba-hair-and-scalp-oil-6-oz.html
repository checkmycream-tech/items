            <li>I give this product two thumbs up!!! :)</li>
            <li>Ladies if you try my tip you will love this hair oil.</li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t want to be bothered and selling it in a bottle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft and nourished.</li>
            <li>I first tried to put the bottle in warm water but it didn&#x27;t work out too well.</li>
            <li>Works very well and spreads more evenly when heated.</li>
            <li>This oil smells really good and last awhile.</li>
            <li>This is a great gel, and it nourishes and replenishes your scalp and hair without all the stickiness and gooiness of other products.</li>
            <li>Natural hair requires more moisture than relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>well they almost got the name right</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s meant to be a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars as I&#x27;m satisfied with the product overall.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner are great, which is why I was really excited about this no fuss and convenient product, but the bottle is so user unfriendly that I lost patience and only used it on half of my head!</li>
            <li>I heated up the bottle in a tall glass of hot water and was able to easily squeeze out the oil into a small 3 oz jar that I had.</li>
            <li>I love this it really protects my hair from the heat of my flat iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a easy remedy, but I can&#x27;t imagine it&#x27;s selling well in it&#x27;s current state.</li>
            <li>I really can tell the difference when I don&#x27;t use this before styling my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>so it really helps to add moisturize to my 4C hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to use my finger tip and apply as little or as much as I want.</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Made my curly hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I was able to squeeze out enough to try this hair oil which is thick not like a fluid, but extremely light in consistency.</li>
            <li>CLEARLY the product says \\&quot;no drip oil\\&quot; and comes in grease form but in a nozzle container.</li>
            <li>The oil is VERY oily, and even though I slept in a satin cap at night my face stayed irritated the entire time that I used it.</li>
            <li>my hair is soft and shiny but not greasy.</li>
            <li>and it gives it moisture and helps with his natural curl.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very conflicted in how to rate this product as the hair oil should get a 5 star rating but the fact they decided to put it in a bottle instead of a jar gets a single star.</li>
            <li>used yesterday and after that - I had to shampoo my hair 2 times with regular shampoo and 2 times with clarifying to get this stuff completely out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is not greasy despite how thick it is, Its important to note I am African American</li>
            <li>Both of my boys have natural curly hair but my youngest hair is very dry.</li>

            <li> so my hair type is dry.</li>
            <li> before I blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> Despite the bottles&#x27; inconvenience it helped me with my issue of a dry scalp</li>
            <li> I know many people have complained about the bottle and how difficult it is to get the oil out.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and last a few days.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The smell of the tea tree oil it contained was overpowering, even though I only used a small amount, and it followed you for hours.</li>
            <li> So I personally took that to mean that when you&#x27;re done using it it won&#x27;t drip and you can take it with you without worrying it&#x27;ll spill all over your stuff.</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday, sometimes twice a day.</li>
            <li> I have to leave the bottle upside down so that I could access the oil, also the product is very heavy on the hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair stiff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and oily but hair is normally very dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to get to the core of this product because of the packaging.</li>
            <li> The bottle on this product is so hard, that you have to literally use all muscle to try and squeeze the oil out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to squeeze out.</li>
            <li> Even if you take the cap off, it&#x27;s still hard to squeeze out.</li>
            <li> My bottle cracked from squeezing so hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to squeeze the product out</li>
            <li> I eventually ended up cutting the bottle open and putting it in another container.</li>
            <li> &quot; out because it was so thick.</li>
            <li> This is a really thick oil.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes my scalp without being heavy!!</li>
            <li> It was VERY hard to get the \\&quot;oil\\</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to get to the core of this product because of the packaging. The product is called No Drip...well they almost got the name right, it should be No Use. The bottle on this product is so hard, that you have to literally use all muscle to try and squeeze the oil out. And as you know when oiling your hair, your hands get slippery, which makes for another dilemma. The shampoo and conditioner are great, which is why I was really excited about this no fuss and convenient product, but the bottle is so user unfriendly that I lost patience and only used it on half of my head!</li>
            <li> As others have stated, this is indeed a great oil for sealing after using your favorite moisturizer. It leaves the hair very soft and shiny. I found only two drawbacks: 1) The smell of the tea tree oil it contained was overpowering, even though I only used a small amount, and it followed you for hours. 2) The oil is VERY oily, and even though I slept in a satin cap at night my face stayed irritated the entire time that I used it. Others may have a different experience with it.</li>
            <li> used yesterday and after that - I had to shampoo my hair 2 times with regular shampoo and 2 times with clarifying to get this stuff completely out of my hair.  Can only imagine how much damage it did due to excessive shampooing. Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t use it! into the trash...</li>
            <li> Great product! Made my curly hair very soft and manageable. A little goes a long way. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of the bottle! It was VERY hard to get the \\&quot;oil\\&quot; out because it was so thick. I first tried to put the bottle in warm water but it didn&#x27;t work out too well. I eventually ended up cutting the bottle open and putting it in another container. All in all, I would buy again, just wish they would change the packaging.</li>
            <li> Very Difficult to get out of the bottle but the product is great.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Moisturizes my scalp without being heavy!!</li>
            <li> This is a great gel, and it nourishes and replenishes your scalp and hair without all the stickiness and gooiness of other products. The Shea butter is the best for shiny healthy looking hair and some of the other ingredients help to keep your hair looking and feeling great.</li>
            <li> Smells good, love the results. The only flaw is.... it&#x27;s hard to squeeze out. Even if you take the cap off, it&#x27;s still hard to squeeze out. My bottle cracked from squeezing so hard. But I love the oil</li>
            <li> This is a really thick oil. It makes my hair stiff. I am going to try it on my daughters hair since she has type 3 hair and I have type 4 hair.</li>
            <li> I love this it really protects my hair from the heat of my flat iron. I really can tell the difference when I don&#x27;t use this before styling my hair. I like the fact that it is not greasy despite how thick it is, Its important to note I am African American so my hair type is dry. If you are looking for a heat protectant and moisturizer this product is the one for you. before I blow dry my hair I put this in and I get excellent results my hair is soft and shiny but not greasy.</li>
            <li> This is the hardest oil I have ever came across. I have to leave the bottle upside down so that I could access the oil, also the product is very heavy on the hair. I have this over a year and wouldn&#x27;t be buying another.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s very thick and oily but hair is normally very dry so it really helps to add moisturize to my 4C hair. I know many people have complained about the bottle and how difficult it is to get the oil out. well, I simply put the bottle in the microwave and heat it up slowly --in 30 second intervals until it melts. Works very well and spreads more evenly when heated. The reason for the 4 star rating is the bottle.</li>
            <li> First things first, this product is great! It adds great moisture and I use it everyday, sometimes twice a day. CLEARLY the product says \\&quot;no drip oil\\&quot; and comes in grease form but in a nozzle container. So I personally took that to mean that when you&#x27;re done using it it won&#x27;t drip and you can take it with you without worrying it&#x27;ll spill all over your stuff. So IGNORE the people who say its hard to squeeze out because their idiots. It&#x27;s meant to be a hot oil treatment. Put it in the dam microwave to melt the grease into its oil form....</li>
            <li> I am transitioning into natural hair and this oil is awesome. Natural hair requires more moisture than relaxed hair. A little goes a long way and last a few days. This oil smells really good and last awhile. I give this product two thumbs up!!! :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I used this on my 2 yr olds hair. Both of my boys have natural curly hair but my youngest hair is very dry. I moisturizer daily with this and it gives it moisture and helps with his natural curl. It&#x27;s hard to squeeze the product out but it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> Despite the bottles&#x27; inconvenience it helped me with my issue of a dry scalp</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful it moisturizers the scalp  and retains the hair moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very conflicted in how to rate this product as the hair oil should get a 5 star rating but the fact they decided to put it in a bottle instead of a jar gets a single star. I was able to squeeze out enough to try this hair oil which is thick not like a fluid, but extremely light in consistency. It&#x27;s smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft and nourished. I heated up the bottle in a tall glass of hot water and was able to easily squeeze out the oil into a small 3 oz jar that I had. It dries back to the same consistency which frankly I prefer as I don&#x27;t always like squeezing oils out of the bottle. I&#x27;m able to use my finger tip and apply as little or as much as I want. Ladies if you try my tip you will love this hair oil. Maybe the company will take notice and change the packaging soon. It&#x27;s a easy remedy, but I can&#x27;t imagine it&#x27;s selling well in it&#x27;s current state. Most people don&#x27;t want to be bothered and selling it in a bottle is simply misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars as I&#x27;m satisfied with the product overall. Just hate the bottle.</li>
            <li> Works good under wigs stops itchy Scalp love it</li>
            <li> My son referred me to this product and I love it!</li>
