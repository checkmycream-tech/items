            <li>that can interfere with the glue) and to top it off</li>
            <li>and once I removed them the top of all of my nails have been peeling.</li>
            <li>I think I could get more than a week, if I took more care.  </li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>The sticky part is perfect for only wearing them a day or two.</li>
            <li>This product is good is you want to display pretty hands for an evening and an evening alone.  </li>
            <li>I work in an environment that is rough on nails and even the best gel manicure is chipped by Monday at 10am on me.</li>
            <li>Great for my busy schedule when I can&#x27;t get to the nail salon.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It might be important to note that I use and abuse my hands though.</li>
            <li>I would add this color to my subscribe and save if it was available.</li>
            <li>Overall, these are great.</li>
            <li>A great deep metallic purple match for Sinful Colors &amp;#34;let&#x27;s talk&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>After it dries, I use a light coat of nail glue and immediately apply each nail, pressing it on for about five seconds or so.</li>
            <li>So amazing in fact, I was surprised they were so cheap.</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful frosty dark purple.</li>
            <li>but I found that to not be true at all</li>
            <li>Love these nails they feel so much lighter then nail products that use nail glue</li>
            <li>They have been doing this now for over a month and have peeled off into the quick.</li>
            <li>have also received so many people telling Me how much they love the color, also these nails are short length...</li>
            <li>Super Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>This color is so vibrant and fun!.....</li>
            <li>It looks better from the back if you don&#x27;t see the nail underneath.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use the included alcohol prep wipe, or they won&#x27;t adhere properly.</li>
            <li>Love all the different color &amp; design choices.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how fabulous these nails are!</li>
            <li>You really &amp;#34;nailed&amp;#34; it with this one!</li>
            <li>;D</li>
            <li>I tried these Impress nails a while back and at first didn&#x27;t like them because they popped off easily.</li>
            <li>If you follow the instructions and apply them right, they really do last a full week.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>I like that they are ready to come off after a week or two</li>
            <li>in this color it didn&#x27;t really bother me</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to use these.</li>
            <li>I put these on today and they have stayed on very well</li>
            <li>They really like the color of them</li>
            <li>Not only are they incredibly easy to apply, but they also look natural and they don&#x27;t destroy my own nails when I remove them.</li>
            <li>The others I used popped off in less than 24 hrs (some within a couple hours) and that was with the brush on nail glue--and to top it off many of the other brands screamed &#x27;press on nail&#x27;-</li>
            <li>I first put a clear coat on my nails.</li>
            <li>Even if they only last a couple of days, they are well worth the price, but what&#x27;s even better is that I&#x27;ve had them last up to a whole week!</li>
            <li>The purple color was a little brighter than I expected, but they&#x27;ll still look good on.</li>
            <li>Although it might not be exactly the same size, you can normally find one that will work.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because it looks a bit more dark blue in the photograph</li>
            <li>They look like a professional manicure, they stay on tight for a week or more (with added glue if necessary)</li>
            <li>The glue keeps them from chipping/shredding/etc... and pulling them off is fairly easy even without soaking them as I do because I&#x27;m impatient but I would recommend soaking them first because it does hurt a bit to pull them off dry.</li>
            <li>I used to go get my nails done professionally</li>
            <li>So I like this product, but this must be an old bottle or something.</li>
            <li>They look classy, as well.</li>
            <li>really the only thing I&#x27;ve found that will last.</li>
            <li>After trying this brand for the first time I tried several other brands of &amp;#34;press on nails&amp;#34; that were a bit cheaper thinking</li>
            <li>longer and my left hand, less on my right.  </li>
            <li>These easy to put on false nails are my solution.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> , they do not damage your nails, it is wwaaaaaaayyy less expensive than getting them done professionally, it is extremely quick to put them on and take them off, and the don&#x27;t damage your nail.</li>
            <li> I have thin nails, going to the nail salon where they sand the nail bed, doesn&#x27;t work for me because eventually the nails get so thin that they start to crack easily.  </li>
            <li> When a nail comes off I re-clean the nail and then select a new false nail to replace it</li>
            <li> I use a little extra brush on glue before placing them and I get at least 7 days out of them, sometimes longer.</li>
            <li> When it arrived in the mail I was sad to see that it was really purple and looked somewhat childish.</li>
            <li> (just brush it on my nail not the false nail; the false nail already has an adhesive soft glue on it) and then press them on</li>
            <li> making it to daytime appointments is always hard for me.</li>
            <li> When mentioned &amp;#34;Girl&amp;#34; they mean it.</li>
            <li> all would be created equal and I was wrong!</li>
            <li> I have a secret, though.</li>
            <li> but it just is too expensive</li>
            <li> They just looked fake all the way around.</li>
            <li> But these do not look fake at all.</li>

            <li> Just love impress nails. If you follow the instructions and apply them right, they really do last a full week. Easy to apply. Since they come with extras to accomodate various nail sizes, do not throw the bottle away after you&#x27;re finished applying them. Just stick it in your purse and you&#x27;ll have extras if one of them happens to come loose during the week. Although it might not be exactly the same size, you can normally find one that will work. Also, cut your nails short before using them. It looks better from the back if you don&#x27;t see the nail underneath. I work in an environment that is rough on nails and even the best gel manicure is chipped by Monday at 10am on me. These are durable and really the only thing I&#x27;ve found that will last. The purple color was a little brighter than I expected, but they&#x27;ll still look good on.</li>
            <li> I wear these all the time.  I have thin nails, going to the nail salon where they sand the nail bed, doesn&#x27;t work for me because eventually the nails get so thin that they start to crack easily.  These easy to put on false nails are my solution.  I clean the nails with acetone and then press and hold the false nail to the bed.  They remain on for about a week; longer and my left hand, less on my right.  When a nail comes off I re-clean the nail and then select a new false nail to replace it with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend that you use gloves for washing dishes, cleaning and the like so the nails last longer.  I don&#x27;t swim so I don&#x27;t know how regular swimming would effect the longevity.</li>
            <li> Super Fast Shipping! Highly Recommend! Item as described.</li>
            <li> When mentioned &amp;#34;Girl&amp;#34; they mean it.</li>
            <li> This color is so vibrant and fun!.....I used to go get my nails done professionally but it just is too expensive and I work a night shift so making it to daytime appointments is always hard for me. I tried these Impress nails a while back and at first didn&#x27;t like them because they popped off easily. I have read may reviewers say they stay on for a week plus so I&#x27;m sure for a lot of people they do.......However, I decided to try them with a brush on nail glue (just brush it on my nail not the false nail; the false nail already has an adhesive soft glue on it) and then press them on and they stay on for a week or more. And they look real!!!!! (meaning a real professional manicure/set of fake nails done professionally) After trying this brand for the first time I tried several other brands of &amp;#34;press on nails&amp;#34; that were a bit cheaper thinking all would be created equal and I was wrong! The others I used popped off in less than 24 hrs (some within a couple hours) and that was with the brush on nail glue--and to top it off many of the other brands screamed &#x27;press on nail&#x27;- which obviously you don&#x27;t want people to know your nails are press on. They just looked fake all the way around. I was actually relieved when they popped off. But these do not look fake at all. They look like a professional manicure and they do stay on tight for a week (for me only if I use a brush on glue with it. It might be important to note that I use and abuse my hands though. I ride horses and have playful puppies and use a lot of lotions etc...that can interfere with the glue) and to top it off they do not damage your nails even with the brush on glue added to it. I feel they actually protect my nails. The glue keeps them from chipping/shredding/etc... and pulling them off is fairly easy even without soaking them as I do because I&#x27;m impatient but I would recommend soaking them first because it does hurt a bit to pull them off dry. I now have the black and the French on my subscribe and save because I hope to continuously use them. I like that they are ready to come off after a week or two so I can keep switching around colors. I would add this color to my subscribe and save if it was available. Overall, these are great. They look like a professional manicure, they stay on tight for a week or more (with added glue if necessary), they do not damage your nails, it is wwaaaaaaayyy less expensive than getting them done professionally, it is extremely quick to put them on and take them off, and the don&#x27;t damage your nail.</li>
            <li> I wore these for a week and once I removed them the top of all of my nails have been peeling. They have been doing this now for over a month and have peeled off into the quick. imPress nails damage your nails. I wouldn&#x27;t not recommend to ANYONE. Rather, I am warning everyone what they do to their nails after wearing for just 5-7 days.</li>
            <li> A great deep metallic purple match for Sinful Colors &amp;#34;let&#x27;s talk&amp;#34;. Be sure to use the included alcohol prep wipe, or they won&#x27;t adhere properly.</li>
            <li> I have crappy nails, and I don&#x27;t want to pay for, or use acrylics or gels.  These are perfect!!  They stay on for about a week, which is long enough for me.  Actually, I bought some glue, so if one falls off before then, I glue it back on.  I think I could get more than a week, if I took more care.  I know I could, but after a week, I want a change.  I love these.</li>
            <li> Excellent. I always get compliments. I have a secret, though. I first put a clear coat on my nails. After it dries, I use a light coat of nail glue and immediately apply each nail, pressing it on for about five seconds or so. Lasts for up to a week. Great for my busy schedule when I can&#x27;t get to the nail salon. Love all the different color &amp; design choices.</li>
            <li> I use this Kiss product all the time, although I alternate different colors for each month.  February is pink, December is red...you get the picture.  Anyway, August is purple.  I don&#x27;t expect these nails to last too long, but these fell off after 1 hour.  So I like this product, but this must be an old bottle or something.</li>
            <li> I liked these too although I enjoyed rated R better. They are a but frosty as well which Im not a fan of but in this color it didn&#x27;t really bother me</li>
            <li> I get compliments on this color almost daily every time I wear them! It is a beautiful frosty dark purple. This brand of nails fits me well and they last. I use a little extra brush on glue before placing them and I get at least 7 days out of them, sometimes longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect. I recomend a lot. Seems your nails.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to use these. Thankfully they turned out amazing. So amazing in fact, I was surprised they were so cheap. They look classy, as well. The only downside... I suggest purchasing some nail glue. The sticky part is perfect for only wearing them a day or two. Before I used the glue, a couple fell off within 2 days and the adhesive was gone. Great investment all around.</li>
            <li> This product is good is you want to display pretty hands for an evening and an evening alone.  The pack says that the nails last up to one week but I found that to not be true at all especially is you like to wash your hands regularly.  They last 12 hours tops before one starts to feel like they might loose one any moment.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how fabulous these nails are! Not only are they incredibly easy to apply, but they also look natural and they don&#x27;t destroy my own nails when I remove them. Even if they only last a couple of days, they are well worth the price, but what&#x27;s even better is that I&#x27;ve had them last up to a whole week! And don&#x27;t even get me started on all the compliments I receive about how gorgeous my nails look! Thank you, Kiss Products! You really &amp;#34;nailed&amp;#34; it with this one! ;D</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it looks a bit more dark blue in the photograph and I never see any in this color when I&#x27;m at the store. When it arrived in the mail I was sad to see that it was really purple and looked somewhat childish.</li>
            <li> Love these nails they feel so much lighter then nail products that use nail glue I put these on today and they have stayed on very well&lt;br /&gt;I have also received so many people telling Me how much they love the color, also these nails are short length...people have asked if they were real nails or done at a salon these are perfect for purple lovers</li>
            <li> They are great Ilove them I get a lot of compliments  on them. They really like the color of them</li>
