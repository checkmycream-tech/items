            <li>it keeps my hair clean non greasy and smelling good for days!</li>
            <li>I find it kind of misleading that their sulfate-containing shampoo advertises &amp;#34;0% silicone,&amp;#34; and the dimethicone-containing conditioner advertises &amp;#34;0% sulfate.&amp;#34; I figured both descriptions applied to both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>This does a great job and the scent is wonderful, lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>There is a lot to love about this conditioner, but the scent is really the best part...</li>
            <li>I was sent a free sample of this from Influenster and honestly it works amazingly.</li>
            <li>Smells great, and you don&#x27;t need very much to wash alot of hair.</li>
            <li>Now I have a favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Bought this along with the shampoo and love the product.</li>
            <li>My hair smells great, it lathers very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d surely buy it again.</li>
            <li>It works good on first bottle</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and smelling great.  </li>
            <li>I like this conditioner not only because of the great result, actually I love the scent.</li>
            <li>both those things means it&#x27;s pretty spectacular</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this conditioner is perfect for my hair type because it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy Herbal Essences brought back this line.</li>
            <li>It is a fabulous drugstore product that compares to many higher end drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with it overall and the fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li>product works nicely and has a very fresh and natural scent.</li>
            <li>Well, as a shampoo and conditioner it is nothing at all special.</li>
            <li>love it, so glad they brought it back!</li>
            <li>And overall the product is just amazing.</li>

            <li>I first bought the color</li>
            <li>this conditioner left my hair with great body but average shine.</li>
            <li>It was very light, and didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>I was looking for the older Herbal Essence rinse that I guess has been replaced by this one.</li>
            <li>Also leaves hair very shiny and soft</li>
            <li>I use this product on my daughters&#x27; hair and it makes it very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>But that smell certainly takes me back.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has an irresistible scent and gives my hair major shine with no buildup.</li>
            <li>I barely use a dime sized dollop to wash my mid back length hair.</li>

            <li> I love this product!!!  The scent is to die for... And overall the product is just amazing. The shipper did a wonderful job  delivering the product.  Definitely would buy more products through this company</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner not only because of the great result, actually I love the scent. Makes u feel nice and fresh all day long. ..</li>
            <li> I was sent a free sample of this from Influenster and honestly it works amazingly. Within just a few washes I could definiltey see a difference in my hair. It was way shinier and healthier! It is a fabulous drugstore product that compares to many higher end drugstore brands. I am absolutley in love with it!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioerand use it ever day!</li>
            <li> This does a great job and the scent is wonderful, lasts for a long time. I&#x27;m happy to have found it&#x27;s still being made.</li>
            <li> It works good on first bottle</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  Leaves my hair soft and smelling great.  Love all the herbal essences products!</li>
            <li> I almost had a coronary when I discovered they were bringing this back. I have been sulfate &amp; silicone-free for about 8 years so for me to use something with both those things means it&#x27;s pretty spectacular (I actually only use these to wash out coconut oil after I&#x27;ve done a deep conditioning treatment, to soften the damage). Well, as a shampoo and conditioner it is nothing at all special. But that smell certainly takes me back. Now I just need to watch if Bath &amp; Body Works brings back Plumeria. Then I&#x27;ll be set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy Herbal Essences brought back this line. This conditioner has an irresistible scent and gives my hair major shine with no buildup. I have fine hair and this conditioner is perfect for my hair type because it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. There is a lot to love about this conditioner, but the scent is really the best part...it&#x27;s divine and doesn&#x27;t fade all day. Love it!</li>
            <li> I find it kind of misleading that their sulfate-containing shampoo advertises &amp;#34;0% silicone,&amp;#34; and the dimethicone-containing conditioner advertises &amp;#34;0% sulfate.&amp;#34; I figured both descriptions applied to both the shampoo and conditioner.

            <li> love it, so glad they brought it back! only conditioner I use!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. Cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner!!!!</li>
            <li> I like this although it is not what I was hoping it would be.  I was looking for the older Herbal Essence rinse that I guess has been replaced by this one.</li>

            <li> made a great gift basket for Christmas. product works nicely and has a very fresh and natural scent. thank you</li>
            <li> This conditioner does not work as well as some of the others that Herbal Essences has in there line of hair care products.  I will not reorder.</li>
            <li> I like herbal essences bc it keeps my hair clean non greasy and smelling good for days!</li>
            <li> I use this product on my daughters&#x27; hair and it makes it very soft and shiny.</li>
