            <li>Good for a beginner.</li>
            <li>GOOD RAZOR.  </li>
            <li>Good razer.</li>
            <li>Good vender.</li>
            <li>Appears to be of good quality and should be at the price.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad that I gave Merkur another chance because the 180 almost turned me away from safety</li>
            <li>Like the diligent Amazon shopper that I am, I thoroughly researched my options and ended up going with the Merkur 180, it had tons of positive reviews and seemed like the best place to start.</li>
            <li>This razor is amazing.</li>
            <li>I own a Feather Popular DE razor (which works well</li>
            <li>Kind of neat stuff.</li>
            <li>just about every forum and even amazon, everyone calls for a merkur hd classic 34c as the perfect starter razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, is inexpensive and very light weight).</li>
            <li>Very light weight.  </li>
            <li>Great, gentle, light razor gives a very enjoyable shave.</li>
            <li>After corking it performed with fantastic voice!  </li>
            <li>I have had this razor for many months now.  </li>
            <li>I would like to seek input on the a razor just a tad more aggressive.  </li>
            <li>I love all these razors and some were quite pricey.  </li>
            <li>I probably use this one more than any of my others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that the difference is in the razors.</li>
            <li>It seems like the 25C better positions the razor blade, the 180 placed the blade at too steep of an angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this review helped you make a more informed decision.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this razor.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the way this razor shaves.</li>
            <li>But, if you don&#x27;t do all the pre-shave warmups you will most probably not like this razor.</li>
            <li>Removing blade takes slightly more attention than my others, but</li>
            <li>then bought this 25c after reading that many felt it was a better beginner razor than the 34c.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since become more accustomed to the 3 inch handle of the 34c, but it took getting used to.</li>
            <li>felt that the Feather Popular and this Merkur 25c were just more comfortable than the 34c.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>comb is interesting on this too.</li>
            <li>Some say the shorter handle is better because you can maneuver it more easily along the contours of your face.</li>
            <li>Its designed for allowing longer hairs and beard growth through to the blade more easily.</li>
            <li>Its designed for allowing longer hairs and beard growth through to the blade more easily.</li>
            <li>I was more impressed than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I also feel more comfortable shaving faster with this razor.</li>
            <li>The shaves have been very mild as related to skin irritation, with regard to the closeness of the shave, it is very good.  </li>
            <li>Its very affordable, fun to use, great shave and won&#x27;t bite.  </li>
            <li>Easy to handle, quality razor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s great to get the major stubble and follow up with a disposable to get to the BBS point.</li>
            <li>But i use this one routinely and find it pretty nice.  </li>
            <li>I get excellent, smooth shaves with this razor and would recommend it particularly for someone with sensitive skin prone to razor burn.</li>
            <li>This little guy has become my best buddy.</li>
            <li>The smooth finish helps it glide across your whiskers.</li>
            <li>This Merkur open comb is just great without the steep price tag.  </li>
            <li>fit finish.</li>
            <li>It DOES seem to keep more shaving soap/cream on my face right up until it meets the blade.</li>
            <li>It DOES seem to keep more shaving soap/cream on my face right up until it meets the blade.</li>
            <li>I have several very nice DE razors-</li>
            <li>The long handle is great for grip and balance.</li>
            <li>This was my first DE razor but will buy more.</li>
            <li>I also own a Merkur 34c because this is considered to be the &#x27;catch all&#x27; razor that many websites claim sets the standard.</li>
            <li>My shaves are more efficient, and my skin is generally much smoother when using this razor.</li>
            <li>My shaves are more efficient, and my skin is generally much smoother when using this razor.</li>
            <li>But I prefer the more aggressive and exposed blades of my EJ and HD classic for WTG and XTG passes.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first razor I&#x27;ve used that does not clog when shaving anything longer than a week of stubble!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned it--$15 worth of blades</li>
            <li>Satisfied so far.</li>
            <li>It is fun using the soap and brush.</li>
            <li>The blade sits right on the combs and does not allow for as close of a shave one gets with a safety bar/closed comb razor.</li>
            <li>open comb helps keep soap on your face as the razor passes, which gives me a more mild shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an overall more mild razor to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this open comb is forgiving yet gives a close shave, open comb leaves soap on your face for a smoother shave and looks great too.  </li>
            <li>It is much heavier than the Feather, and seems to be more aggressive in its shaving action.</li>
            <li>The open comb also allows the lather to pass through, keeping more on your face between you and the blade.</li>
            <li>I was expecting this razor to shave a bit more aggressively because of the open comb design.  </li>
            <li>I love using different razors and all of mine have their place</li>
            <li>This is the first de razor I&#x27;ve had since my 60&#x27;s Gillettes---they are still usable</li>
            <li>/&gt;It just doesn&#x27;t seem possible to find a better \\&quot;starter\\&quot; razor than this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an open comb, unlike the bar that the Feather and 34c (and many others) sport.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an open comb, unlike the bar that the Feather and 34c (and many others) sport.</li>
            <li>It is very light in weight and the long handle improves my control of the razor.</li>
            <li>The quality of the razor is good for Merkur, which is the standard of safety razors, so it&#x27;s not the build or quality that is the problem, just the fact that it&#x27;s open comb.</li>
            <li>I decided to make the transition to a safety razor after hearing positive reviews from friends.</li>
            <li>It has a long handle but it is thinner than most razors.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the longer handle personally.</li>
            <li>, it has the same heft that the other Merkur models have which greatly aids in the shaving action:</li>
            <li>It is way more mild and less aggressive than 34c and EJ89  and will be my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; for early pre 6am shaves and the one I recommend to newbies.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get a close clean shave with only one pass.</li>
            <li>I own quite a few razors at present and only the Merkur Progress does a better job, IMHO.</li>
            <li>Gives me a much better shave than cartridge razors could ever dream of, and with less irritation.  </li>
            <li>The 25c is more forgiving because MUCH less blade is exposed, thus desireable for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>will try a machined SS razor like a feather, Icon or Pils for more overall weight and refinement, and will continue to seek open comb versions.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>I grip it the same as the short (like a dart, towards the end) because this allows the weight of the head to draw down across your skin more easily.</li>
            <li>I found that this one worked far better and that cuts could be entirely avoided with proper preparation.</li>
            <li>I laugh at my friends who still pay the big bucks for Gillette Mach 8, 9 whatever they&#x27;re on now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first open comb razor I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>the 1 1/2 inch of hair was no trouble at all!  </li>
            <li>I only use it when I&#x27;ve let my beard go for a few days because the open tooth design has an aggressive \\&quot;bite\\&quot; that is good for longer beard and mustache growth.</li>
            <li>I also own the Mekur 180 (which is the closed comb version) and while I like that razor too, this is far less aggressive.</li>
            <li>I say this in comparison to my other razors which are a Gillette Super Speed, Edwin Jagger 89 and Merkur Slant Bar.  </li>
            <li>Also was surprised by the platinum blade included.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect from an open comb.</li>
            <li>This type of safety razor offers no gap between the comb and the blade.</li>
            <li>I shave with this razor, unlike the others, one pass is generally sufficient and I don&#x27;t get the stinging razor burn or nicks</li>
            <li>I shave with this razor, unlike the others, one pass is generally sufficient and I don&#x27;t get the stinging razor burn or nicks</li>
            <li>I actually get a consistently close shave with the 25c than the other two.</li>
            <li>It takes a little practice to avoid producing lines in the shave soap from the comb teeth, but this is not difficult.  </li>
            <li>I find that odd since I don&#x27;t have much to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I was more impressed than I expected.  I have the &#x27;23&#x27; and have loved it.  The &#x27;23&#x27; is almost too forgiving as I have a tough beard so open comb seemed the way to go.  Also was surprised by the platinum blade included.  After corking it performed with fantastic voice!  The long handle is great for grip and balance.</li>
            <li> Excellent! This is the first open comb razor I&#x27;ve tried. I was always a bit afraid of them because the open comb looked like it would be easier to nick yourself. Just the opposite. I also own the Mekur 180 (which is the closed comb version) and while I like that razor too, this is far less aggressive. The open comb also allows the lather to pass through, keeping more on your face between you and the blade. Great 1st razor. Not for fans of aggressive razors.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for many months now.  I have been using Derby blades with it.  The shaves have been very mild as related to skin irritation, with regard to the closeness of the shave, it is very good.  I say this in comparison to my other razors which are a Gillette Super Speed, Edwin Jagger 89 and Merkur Slant Bar.  It takes a little practice to avoid producing lines in the shave soap from the comb teeth, but this is not difficult.  I get excellent, smooth shaves with this razor and would recommend it particularly for someone with sensitive skin prone to razor burn.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing. I only use it when I&#x27;ve let my beard go for a few days because the open tooth design has an aggressive \\&quot;bite\\&quot; that is good for longer beard and mustache growth. It is very light in weight and the long handle improves my control of the razor. I use this razor with a Big Ben blade. I get a close clean shave with only one pass. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this razor to shave a bit more aggressively because of the open comb design.  But, it was every bit as tame as the Merkur long handle 180.  I would like to seek input on the a razor just a tad more aggressive.  But i use this one routinely and find it pretty nice.  Great for the price.</li>
            <li> Exceptional craftsmanship!! The razor is a little aggressive if you are not used to using it. The smooth finish helps it glide across your whiskers. If it&#x27;s your first time using a safety razor, go slow and  use the razor&#x27;s handle to your advantage for control. You have one of the closest shaves ever!!&lt;br /&gt;A must have for your razor set</li>
            <li> Not aggressive enough.  I have to go over the same spot several times to get a close shave.  Good for a beginner.</li>
            <li> This razor changed my life.  It&#x27;s the first razor I&#x27;ve used that does not clog when shaving anything longer than a week of stubble!  Shaved my head and the 1 1/2 inch of hair was no trouble at all!  No more using the electric clippers to mow down the beard or head to a manageable length for the mach-whatever the hell it is.</li>
            <li> GOOD RAZOR.  NO PROBLEMS  LONG HANDLE</li>
            <li> I have several very nice DE razors- the Muhle R41 2013 and 2011, the Muhle R89, Parker 24C, Above the Tie H2, R2 and M2.  I love all these razors and some were quite pricey.  This Merkur open comb is just great without the steep price tag.  Its very affordable, fun to use, great shave and won&#x27;t bite.  I love using different razors and all of mine have their place but this open comb is forgiving yet gives a close shave, open comb leaves soap on your face for a smoother shave and looks great too.  I probably use this one more than any of my others.</li>
            <li> Great shave. Not as aggressive as some have reported. Very kind to my face.</li>
            <li> Good razer. Good vender.</li>
            <li> This is the first de razor I&#x27;ve had since my 60&#x27;s Gillettes---they are still usable but I wanted to compare them with the newer Mekur razor. They are comparable but I don&#x27;t think I needed the long handle.</li>
            <li> I recommend to use w/ hand stropped Lord Chrome w/ GFT Violet and cold alum and I do mean cold brr.</li>
            <li> It gives a great shave.  However, with my thick hair, it takes several repeats.  I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s great to get the major stubble and follow up with a disposable to get to the BBS point.</li>
            <li> I decided to make the transition to a safety razor after hearing positive reviews from friends. Like the diligent Amazon shopper that I am, I thoroughly researched my options and ended up going with the Merkur 180, it had tons of positive reviews and seemed like the best place to start. Despite soaking and lathering, I couldn&#x27;t manage to avoid cutting my face up with the 180.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to try the 25C due to its open tooth design. I found that this one worked far better and that cuts could be entirely avoided with proper preparation. I&#x27;m sure that the difference is in the razors. It seems like the 25C better positions the razor blade, the 180 placed the blade at too steep of an angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the 180 feels (and is) dangerous and doesn&#x27;t provide a better shave. Even a relatively novice user such as myself can use the 25C with supreme confidence that he won&#x27;t carve himself up. I&#x27;m very glad that I gave Merkur another chance because the 180 almost turned me away from safety razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helped you make a more informed decision.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor. I started shaving with a Merkur slant bar. I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect from an open comb. I LOVE the way this razor shaves.</li>
            <li> Great, gentle, light razor gives a very enjoyable shave.</li>
            <li> The 25C is an open comb razor but is not nearly as agressive as the Muhle R41 (2011). It will bite you but I&#x27;ve used it five times without any weepers, yet. It&#x27;s kinda like a semi-agressive Merkur 34C. Any razor I use on my goatee area simply bounces off and this is why the 25C gets 4 stars, it could use an ounce or two of weight. It has a long handle but it is thinner than most razors. I own quite a few razors at present and only the Merkur Progress does a better job, IMHO. If you are looking for a conservative open comb razor then this may well be the answer. But, if you don&#x27;t do all the pre-shave warmups you will most probably not like this razor. It&#x27;s a wet shave razor for wet shave prepped beards.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle, quality razor</li>
            <li> This little guy has become my best buddy. Use it almost on a daily basis. Gives me a much better shave than cartridge razors could ever dream of, and with less irritation.  Also has saved me a ton of cash over the past year I&#x27;ve owned it--$15 worth of blades has lasted me over a YEAR! I laugh at my friends who still pay the big bucks for Gillette Mach 8, 9 whatever they&#x27;re on now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merkur has the looks, quality, price, and performance. A more perfect razor was never made. Buy it.</li>
            <li> Not many reviews for this one, eh?&lt;br /&gt;Good fit finish. Perfect blade alignment.  Longer and thinner handle is different, not better or worse.  It is slightly lighter than my hd classic and ej. Removing blade takes slightly more attention than my others, but no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;The open comb helps keep soap on your face as the razor passes, which gives me a more mild shave. The blade is not very exposed which will be less inimidating for anyone just starting out.&lt;br /&gt;You need to pay attention with EJ89 and HD classics. The 25c is more forgiving because MUCH less blade is exposed, thus desireable for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this razor for ATG on my neck and chin. But I prefer the more aggressive and exposed blades of my EJ and HD classic for WTG and XTG passes.&lt;br /&gt;As for the long handle i&#x27;d say it makes zero difference to the shave.&lt;br /&gt;I will try a machined SS razor like a feather, Icon or Pils for more overall weight and refinement, and will continue to seek open comb versions.&lt;br /&gt;On just about every forum and even amazon, everyone calls for a merkur hd classic 34c as the perfect starter razor.&lt;br /&gt;It just doesn&#x27;t seem possible to find a better \\&quot;starter\\&quot; razor than this. It is way more mild and less aggressive than 34c and EJ89  and will be my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; for early pre 6am shaves and the one I recommend to newbies.&lt;br /&gt;Buying this anywhere other than amazon and especially aos would be simply rediculous.</li>
            <li> This type of safety razor offers no gap between the comb and the blade. The quality of the razor is good for Merkur, which is the standard of safety razors, so it&#x27;s not the build or quality that is the problem, just the fact that it&#x27;s open comb. The blade sits right on the combs and does not allow for as close of a shave one gets with a safety bar/closed comb razor.</li>
            <li> An excellent razor! The quality is superb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m newish to wet shaving, and I have a total baby face. My facial hair is sparse, but if I let it grow out eventually it just looks creepy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I own a Feather Popular DE razor (which works well, is inexpensive and very light weight). I also own a Merkur 34c because this is considered to be the &#x27;catch all&#x27; razor that many websites claim sets the standard. It is much heavier than the Feather, and seems to be more aggressive in its shaving action. I&#x27;ve practiced with it, but often cut my chin and lips. And despite trying different razors, the shave quality hasn&#x27;t been as close as I&#x27;d like.I find that odd since I don&#x27;t have much to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then bought this 25c after reading that many felt it was a better beginner razor than the 34c. I have to agree with them. I actually get a consistently close shave with the 25c than the other two. This surprises me since the blade is situated in such a way as to be less aggressive than the others. I also feel more comfortable shaving faster with this razor. It&#x27;s an overall more mild razor to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the Feather, it has the same heft that the other Merkur models have which greatly aids in the shaving action: no pushing the razor into the face, but rather let the weight of the head draw the blade down in short strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the 34c, this has a long handle. I&#x27;ve since become more accustomed to the 3 inch handle of the 34c, but it took getting used to. I don&#x27;t have large hands, but the short handle was uncomfortable to use at first. I enjoy the longer handle personally. I grip it the same as the short (like a dart, towards the end) because this allows the weight of the head to draw down across your skin more easily. Some say the shorter handle is better because you can maneuver it more easily along the contours of your face. I don&#x27;t think it makes a difference. I flat out felt that the Feather Popular and this Merkur 25c were just more comfortable than the 34c.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb is interesting on this too. It&#x27;s an open comb, unlike the bar that the Feather and 34c (and many others) sport. Its designed for allowing longer hairs and beard growth through to the blade more easily. Since I don&#x27;t possess a manly beard, I can&#x27;t attest to that. It DOES seem to keep more shaving soap/cream on my face right up until it meets the blade. Less seems to get pushed away. That might just be my imagination though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On thing I dislike about this razor is that it comes apart in three pieces instead of two. The 34c is easier to replace the blade on because it is two pieces. The Feather is even simpler, as it is a butterfly style. The three piece can be slightly cumbersome to change out, but it&#x27;s not rocket science. You get used to it. It&#x27;s just a minor quibble of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I shave with this razor, unlike the others, one pass is generally sufficient and I don&#x27;t get the stinging razor burn or nicks like I do with the 34c. My shaves are more efficient, and my skin is generally much smoother when using this razor. With the other two, I need to do multiple passes in various directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess this razor just agrees with my face.esting on this too.

            <li> Very light weight.  Appears to be of good quality and should be at the price.  It does shave conservatively and beginners need this.  Satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> Very good razor. Take a few shaves to learn. I will not go back to disposables.  It is fun using the soap and brush. It takes no longer shaving using a DE razor than it does a disposable. This was my first DE razor but will buy more. Kind of neat stuff.</li>
