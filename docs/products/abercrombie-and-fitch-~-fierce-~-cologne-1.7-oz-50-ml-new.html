            <li>It&#x27;s nice to find Fierce Cologne that doesn&#x27;t cost $100.</li>

            <li>Great price for a Great Cologne, item came packaged as well as if I purchased it at the actual store!</li>
            <li>Great price and product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a very important thing because you don&#x27;t want your dream girl to be allergic to you.</li>
            <li>girls love it.</li>
            <li>I Ordered This Cologne For My Husband, And I&#x27;m Going To Definetely Enjoy It On Him!</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance but this was shipped to us with the box saturated in the cologne.</li>
            <li>i love the smell though</li>
            <li>And all seems to be written by 1 or 2 people :)</li>
            <li>I have CK Eternity, CK One, but this one is really more addictive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>What can i say, my favorite</li>
            <li>,after i wash my clothes i can still smell it LOVE</li>
            <li>Item delivered on time, and it was as described :)</li>
            <li>and if there&#x27;s one thing that many people were always asking for, or recognizing the scent of, was Fierce.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not awful, it is quite perfume-like and gives me a headache.</li>
            <li>I love it when my boyfriend puts it on.</li>
            <li>just absolutely LOVE when he wears</li>
            <li>4 stars because i have seen better perfume before.</li>
            <li>This is the gift for my boyfriend and it makes his smell so adorable.</li>
            <li>It would be even better if it was sold cheaper.  </li>
            <li>love this product - however came spoiled ..</li>
            <li>well i love the smell</li>
            <li>get more compliments for the Abercrombie, as it lasts throughout my day.</li>
            <li>Either get it from Abercrombie storefront, or a reputable dealer that you know to trust.</li>
            <li>I got this because my granddaughter (age 8) thought everybody should smell like her dad.</li>
            <li>He is his favorite.</li>
            <li>my husband love&#x27;s this colonge  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s our favorite scent</li>
            <li>AND it&#x27;s free shipping!</li>
            <li>but it took two weeks to get to me and it was a gift so it just would have been better if i had gotten it in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>I trade off on occasion with Carolina Herrera 312 and Calvin Klein, as these are also very pleasant and long</li>
            <li>Came sealed in original packaging, 100% genuine cologne and everyone loves this scent!</li>
            <li>As the name implies, the scent does stand out from softer selections and its popularity makes it easily noticeable, if not known.</li>
            <li>The scent is fairly accurate.</li>
            <li>smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>I pray this will always be available for purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just the right cologne to fit his need</li>
            <li>This is a very clean, powerful, smooth scent.</li>
            <li>lol I&#x27;m sure other girls do to.</li>
            <li>On time delivery was a real bonus!!!</li>
            <li>It was packed well, in its original box and packaging.</li>
            <li>I was very excited when I made my ordered and shipping was very fast.....</li>
            <li>It used to be super cheap</li>
            <li>This is by far my most favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>Since it is the scent, fine; however, I do not believe it was worth the $52 because of the length of the scent.</li>
            <li>Smells good, chicks dig it, same price as the store tho</li>
            <li>It the only stuff I wear where all women have to say \\&quot;you smell good mmmm!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>not bad at all...</li>
            <li>product arrived safely and quickly, and as usual smells great.</li>
            <li>It was sent quickly.</li>
            <li>Got this for my fianc√© for Christmas and it came on time, and was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering, but fresh and not musky.</li>
            <li>Well worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to tell everyone that this company is selling knock off colognes for full price claiming it&#x27;s the real thing!</li>
            <li>I much rather pay $20 more for the real thing.</li>
            <li>I remember being a teen and loving this scent.</li>
            <li>No, really this is good stuff.</li>
            <li>Should&#x27;ve gone straight to a store to buy the original....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always smelled this cologne on other people and loved how it smelled.</li>
            <li>He like it very much.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Evidently there was a leak in the bottle.</li>
            <li>I guess next time I will go to the store to be in the safe side.</li>
            <li>Now that I own it, it smells just the way I expected it to.&lt;br /&gt;-You</li>
            <li>I too, smelled it first in the mall, and have been using it since.</li>
            <li>the actual product was fantastic!</li>
            <li>in mind, this doesn&#x27;t have a romantic smell, but rather a SEXY smell.</li>
            <li>I was a bit scared that this wouldn&#x27;t be the exact product sold at A&amp;F, but after getting it, I realized it was.</li>
            <li>This item smell very much like the real thing</li>
            <li>Got it with the package soaked in the stuff and the lid completely destroyed, the smell isn&#x27;t as good as the regular cologne you get, It&#x27;s a replica clearly</li>
            <li>Although Fierce is marketed for a young adult audience, I&#x27;ve found it equally useful in more professional life.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a sweet fragrance, yet it&#x27;s strong and fantastic.</li>
            <li>This was easy and simple way to get it</li>
            <li>Pure alcohol.</li>
            <li>to use just 1 short spray---is easy to get to much on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It shod last a little longer, but is smells great</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this was the real Fierce cologne.......</li>
            <li>My son absolutely loves this cologne.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really say much.</li>
            <li>It lasts on your clothes or skin for a reasonable about of time.</li>
            <li>Women seem to really like the fragrance on me.</li>
            <li>bought this for my brother they shipped it really fast</li>
            <li>Very well packaged.thanks.</li>
            <li>The real deal.</li>
            <li>This is the REAL deal.</li>
            <li>Thanks for sending what you advertise.</li>
            <li>Chicks really dig it</li>
            <li>I met a girl that very day</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, the stock made a big comeback in 2011 but have since dropped back to near all-time lows.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes you win but other times you loose.</li>
            <li>This was a new cologne gift for my husband who is really picky about smells.</li>
            <li>Classic cologne smell that never fades, lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>; A&amp;F makes high quality products.</li>
            <li>I have bought a few off of ebay over the years and they are mostly faked.</li>
            <li>The item was brand new and smelling like it suppose to.  </li>
            <li>If we learned anything from the recent recession is that those who live below their means will be able to thrive on the good and bad days.</li>
            <li>Since day first this cologne didn&#x27;t even last for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>And upon seeing the other reviews of these reviewers, you&#x27;ll see the same thing, regardless of the item :)</li>
            <li>and it is the exact same thing we sold in stores&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty bottle with a male picture that can be seen from both sides of the bottle.</li>
            <li>it was to be clear in color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearly a replica and should stated as so.</li>
            <li>This was old product .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really inebriating, addictive...</li>
            <li>As an adult, I ordered this to try again.</li>
            <li>It is not a wasted choice.</li>
            <li>We do not have a abercrombie &amp; Fitch near us.</li>
            <li>Well, I will proudly admit I was wrong!</li>
            <li>anyhow I won&#x27;t be buying cologne from Amazon no more but surely will order the same cologne from the manufacturer itself.</li>
            <li>careful buying this though...go to a couple hot spots and see if you smell it on 90% of the guys there.</li>
            <li>&quot; cologne is one of the major reasons for this.</li>
            <li>The fake stuff doesnt last more than a few minutes and is mostly alcohol in a bottle.</li>
            <li>And the smell lasts only about a hour then it wears off completely</li>
            <li>The sender product was old and discolored, also the smell was faint and does not last as long or smell as good as the one I always purchase in the store.</li>
            <li>Particularly it&#x27;s not a pretty manly picture, but I really don&#x27;t have to stare at it when I&#x27;m using the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t last no longer than a minute and the liquid in the bottle is yellow rather than clear.</li>
            <li>Replacing a bottle I bought in store, Fierce is made from natural Orange extracts which even women sensitive to all other perfumes don&#x27;t find offensive.</li>
            <li>the scent doesn&#x27;t last more than a few minutes which is a dead give away.</li>
            <li>It is a small bottle by well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Also not generic or imitation, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>It smells horrible, any avid user will be able to tell right off the bat.</li>
            <li>The liquid is yellow not normal clear color.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> That&#x27;s a very important thing because you don&#x27;t want your dream girl to be allergic to you.</li>
            <li> girls love it.</li>
            <li> I Ordered This Cologne For My Husband, And I&#x27;m Going To Definetely Enjoy It On Him!</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance but this was shipped to us with the box saturated in the cologne.</li>
            <li> i love the smell though</li>
            <li> And all seems to be written by 1 or 2 people :)</li>
            <li> I have CK Eternity, CK One, but this one is really more addictive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What can i say, my favorite</li>
            <li> ,after i wash my clothes i can still smell it LOVE</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, and it was as described :)</li>
            <li> and if there&#x27;s one thing that many people were always asking for, or recognizing the scent of, was Fierce.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not awful, it is quite perfume-like and gives me a headache.</li>
            <li> I love it when my boyfriend puts it on.</li>
            <li> just absolutely LOVE when he wears</li>
            <li> 4 stars because i have seen better perfume before.</li>
            <li> This is the gift for my boyfriend and it makes his smell so adorable.</li>
            <li> It would be even better if it was sold cheaper.  </li>
            <li> love this product - however came spoiled ..</li>
            <li> well i love the smell</li>
            <li> get more compliments for the Abercrombie, as it lasts throughout my day.</li>
            <li> Either get it from Abercrombie storefront, or a reputable dealer that you know to trust.</li>
            <li> I got this because my granddaughter (age 8) thought everybody should smell like her dad.</li>
            <li> He is his favorite.</li>
            <li> my husband love&#x27;s this colonge  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s our favorite scent</li>
            <li> AND it&#x27;s free shipping!</li>
            <li> but it took two weeks to get to me and it was a gift so it just would have been better if i had gotten it in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> I trade off on occasion with Carolina Herrera 312 and Calvin Klein, as these are also very pleasant and long</li>
            <li> Came sealed in original packaging, 100% genuine cologne and everyone loves this scent!</li>
            <li> As the name implies, the scent does stand out from softer selections and its popularity makes it easily noticeable, if not known.</li>
            <li> The scent is fairly accurate.</li>
            <li> smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I pray this will always be available for purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just the right cologne to fit his need</li>
            <li> This is a very clean, powerful, smooth scent.</li>
            <li> lol I&#x27;m sure other girls do to.</li>
            <li> On time delivery was a real bonus!!!</li>
            <li> It was packed well, in its original box and packaging.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I made my ordered and shipping was very fast.....</li>
            <li> It used to be super cheap</li>
            <li> This is by far my most favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> Since it is the scent, fine; however, I do not believe it was worth the $52 because of the length of the scent.</li>
            <li> Smells good, chicks dig it, same price as the store tho</li>
            <li> It the only stuff I wear where all women have to say \\&quot;you smell good mmmm!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> not bad at all...</li>
            <li> product arrived safely and quickly, and as usual smells great.</li>
            <li> It was sent quickly.</li>
            <li> Got this for my fianc√© for Christmas and it came on time, and was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering, but fresh and not musky.</li>
            <li> Well worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to tell everyone that this company is selling knock off colognes for full price claiming it&#x27;s the real thing!</li>
            <li> I much rather pay $20 more for the real thing.</li>
            <li> I remember being a teen and loving this scent.</li>
            <li> No, really this is good stuff.</li>
            <li> Should&#x27;ve gone straight to a store to buy the original....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always smelled this cologne on other people and loved how it smelled.</li>
            <li> He like it very much.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Evidently there was a leak in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I guess next time I will go to the store to be in the safe side.</li>
            <li> Now that I own it, it smells just the way I expected it to.&lt;br /&gt;-You</li>
            <li> I too, smelled it first in the mall, and have been using it since.</li>
            <li> the actual product was fantastic!</li>
            <li> in mind, this doesn&#x27;t have a romantic smell, but rather a SEXY smell.</li>
            <li> I was a bit scared that this wouldn&#x27;t be the exact product sold at A&amp;F, but after getting it, I realized it was.</li>
            <li> This item smell very much like the real thing</li>
            <li> Got it with the package soaked in the stuff and the lid completely destroyed, the smell isn&#x27;t as good as the regular cologne you get, It&#x27;s a replica clearly</li>
            <li> Although Fierce is marketed for a young adult audience, I&#x27;ve found it equally useful in more professional life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a sweet fragrance, yet it&#x27;s strong and fantastic.</li>
            <li> This was easy and simple way to get it</li>
            <li> Pure alcohol.</li>
            <li> to use just 1 short spray---is easy to get to much on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It shod last a little longer, but is smells great</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this was the real Fierce cologne.......</li>
            <li> My son absolutely loves this cologne.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really say much.</li>
            <li> It lasts on your clothes or skin for a reasonable about of time.</li>
            <li> Women seem to really like the fragrance on me.</li>
            <li> bought this for my brother they shipped it really fast</li>
            <li> Very well packaged.thanks.</li>
            <li> The real deal.</li>
            <li> This is the REAL deal.</li>
            <li> Thanks for sending what you advertise.</li>
            <li> Chicks really dig it</li>
            <li> I met a girl that very day</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, the stock made a big comeback in 2011 but have since dropped back to near all-time lows.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes you win but other times you loose.</li>
            <li> This was a new cologne gift for my husband who is really picky about smells.</li>
            <li> Classic cologne smell that never fades, lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> ; A&amp;F makes high quality products.</li>
            <li> I have bought a few off of ebay over the years and they are mostly faked.</li>
            <li> The item was brand new and smelling like it suppose to.  </li>
            <li> If we learned anything from the recent recession is that those who live below their means will be able to thrive on the good and bad days.</li>
            <li> Since day first this cologne didn&#x27;t even last for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> And upon seeing the other reviews of these reviewers, you&#x27;ll see the same thing, regardless of the item :)</li>
            <li> and it is the exact same thing we sold in stores&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty bottle with a male picture that can be seen from both sides of the bottle.</li>
            <li> it was to be clear in color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clearly a replica and should stated as so.</li>
            <li> This was old product .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really inebriating, addictive...</li>
            <li> As an adult, I ordered this to try again.</li>
            <li> It is not a wasted choice.</li>
            <li> We do not have a abercrombie &amp; Fitch near us.</li>
            <li> Well, I will proudly admit I was wrong!</li>
            <li> anyhow I won&#x27;t be buying cologne from Amazon no more but surely will order the same cologne from the manufacturer itself.</li>
            <li> careful buying this though...go to a couple hot spots and see if you smell it on 90% of the guys there.</li>
            <li> &quot; cologne is one of the major reasons for this.</li>
            <li> The fake stuff doesnt last more than a few minutes and is mostly alcohol in a bottle.</li>
            <li> And the smell lasts only about a hour then it wears off completely</li>
            <li> The sender product was old and discolored, also the smell was faint and does not last as long or smell as good as the one I always purchase in the store.</li>
            <li> Particularly it&#x27;s not a pretty manly picture, but I really don&#x27;t have to stare at it when I&#x27;m using the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t last no longer than a minute and the liquid in the bottle is yellow rather than clear.</li>
            <li> Replacing a bottle I bought in store, Fierce is made from natural Orange extracts which even women sensitive to all other perfumes don&#x27;t find offensive.</li>
            <li> the scent doesn&#x27;t last more than a few minutes which is a dead give away.</li>
            <li> It is a small bottle by well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Also not generic or imitation, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> It smells horrible, any avid user will be able to tell right off the bat.</li>
            <li> The liquid is yellow not normal clear color.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first that this cologne could have garnered so much attention and praise.</li>
            <li> but I received it and was totally disappointed, when I first put it on the smell was nice for bout a few hrs and the next day I put it on again....</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of Fierce and the smell of the cologne delivered wasn&#x27;t even in the same universe.</li>
            <li> i also use Polo black which by far surpasses all n</li>
            <li> There are many other reviews saying the product is fake as well.</li>
            <li> It is not &amp;#34;stale,&amp;#34; as cologne sometimes gets if it&#x27;s been sitting around for too long.</li>
            <li> I long sold their declining stock as well.  </li>
            <li> but now don&#x27;t really care to pay for premium prices for stuff that are too thick and with overlong sleeves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> out.it lasts a very long time</li>
            <li> Great smell but way to expensive!!!</li>
            <li> Gone are the guttonly, excessive days of 2007 and early 2008 where people just buy no matter the price due to uncontrollable and unlimited credit.  </li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about buying this through an outside vendor, but, as others have already commented, I had no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I would buy from here again, especially because the price is a few bucks cheaper than it is in the store</li>
            <li> It was just what we expected.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by the fragrance of the cologne that smelled more pungent than the one I used to buy at the A&amp;F stores.</li>
            <li> The smell is not authentic &amp; does not last.</li>
            <li> Once you wear fierce you just can not think of any other fragrance .</li>
            <li> Where you know that the actual Abercrombie &amp; Fitch would&#x27;ve rejected poor packaging such as this.</li>
            <li> either gag from the smell or chase you down the block to grab your shirt and smell it</li>
            <li> i wondeting if the Abercombie is watered down.</li>
            <li> one lasts maybe half a day, while the one from the store lasts for days.</li>
            <li> Its not so overpowering that people complain, but just subtle enough for people to &#x27;sniff you out&#x27; to ask what you are wearing.&lt;br /&gt;Beware of fakes though.</li>
            <li> Because this one fades after about half an hour.</li>
            <li> ( I prefer to spray a little on my neck and shirt...</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure if this bottle wasn&#x27;t stored properly because it&#x27;s seriously lacking.</li>
            <li> I get compliments practically everyday from someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used to get this when I worked there&lt;br /&gt;Saved a few bucks by ordering it online</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Although, I would not suggest it for everyday use.</li>
            <li> ,i have my husband to wear it everyday even when he goes to work</li>
            <li> From this item, I realized that you can actually tell if a 5 star review is fake.</li>
            <li> Even the picture on the bottle is of poor quality.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. :(</li>
            <li> This product is fake.</li>
            <li> i would say its too expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> I have to say this time I got a fake one.</li>
            <li> Obviously it&#x27;s fake</li>
            <li> is definitely a fake.</li>
            <li> Cologne is a fake.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i was using the fake target spray, this lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> We were very disappointed when this arrived in the mail today due to this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very expensive as with their clothes.  </li>
            <li> smell was bad</li>
            <li> but still you would think it wouldnt be this bad</li>
            <li> Terribly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that i didn&#x27;t take the time to read the review before making the purchase.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a fake!!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t put this on my worst enemy.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this was the real Fierce cologne.......</li>
            <li> Good condition, good fragrance</li>
            <li> smells fantastic. excellent product. it&#x27;s the second time I buy it.  girls love it. A+++++++++++Fierce cologne by Abercrombie &amp; Fitch</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t order any perfumes... those are Duplicate</li>
            <li> Ever wonder where that nauseating perfume-like smell is originating from in an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch store and hits you the moment you walk through their doors? \\&quot;Fierce\\&quot; cologne is one of the major reasons for this. So why all the 5 stars? Don&#x27;t believe everything you read. The only thing that is \\&quot;Fierce\\&quot; about this stuff is its overpowering, incapacitating smell. I wouldn&#x27;t put this on my worst enemy.</li>
            <li> Sprayed it on and turned into a spartan, airbrushed on abs and all.</li>
            <li> This product is fake. I have been a long time user of Fierce and the smell of the cologne delivered wasn&#x27;t even in the same universe. There are many other reviews saying the product is fake as well. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Great price for a Great Cologne, item came packaged as well as if I purchased it at the actual store! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Best smelling cologne ever.</li>
            <li> The sender product was old and discolored, also the smell was faint and does not last as long or smell as good as the one I always purchase in the store. I hope that this is just a mistake and that not all of the products are that way.</li>
            <li> I Ordered This Cologne For My Husband, And I&#x27;m Going To Definetely Enjoy It On Him! Smells Wonderful! I Recommend This To Any Man!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by the fragrance of the cologne that smelled more pungent than the one I used to buy at the A&amp;F stores.</li>
            <li> Not what it says it is</li>
            <li> Never buy this product. When I sprayed it, my girlfriend said it smelled like &amp;#34;dog&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance but this was shipped to us with the box saturated in the cologne. Evidently there was a leak in the bottle. My husband still wanted to keep it but as time passed all the cologne evaporated. Waste of money. :(</li>
            <li> I bought it for my boyfriend birthday and he loves it since he is the A&amp;F fan. The smell is great!</li>
            <li> i would say its too expensive for what it is. i love the smell though</li>
            <li> My son asked me to get this for him.  It smells wonderful. It&#x27;s not overpowering, but fresh and not musky.</li>
            <li> This item smell very much like the real thing and I&#x27;m thinking about buying it again because it is really the best smell ever created :)</li>
            <li> I got this for my son and he loved it and the price I paid was pretty good too.  Great product and he received it on time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any idea how this would smell before I bought it. I took a chance and I&#x27;m very glad I did. I get compliments practically everyday from someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend this and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> so happy with it my sons loved it.</li>
            <li> My son absolutely loves this cologne. I get it every year for him during Christmas. Classic cologne smell that never fades, lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I would say that buying colognes in here is a gambling. Sometimes you win but other times you loose. I have to say this time I got a fake one. Since day first this cologne didn&#x27;t even last for 5 minutes. Pure alcohol. I did email the seller but they acted like: they couldn&#x27;t find my order although I gave it to them. I guess next time I will go to the store to be in the safe side.</li>
            <li> Bought it because my girlfriend likes it lol I&#x27;m sure other girls do to. If you&#x27;ve ever been to Abercrombie, it&#x27;s the scent they spray out of their deodorizers.</li>
            <li> Terribly disappointed. As my signature cologne, they couldn&#x27;t fool me.. it&#x27;s a fake!! The smell is not authentic &amp; does not last. It smells horrible, any avid user will be able to tell right off the bat. I&#x27;m disappointed that i didn&#x27;t take the time to read the review before making the purchase. I will be taking this product to the Abercrombie store and reporting this order. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to make a purchase with this company... you&#x27;ll end up as unsatisfied as I am.</li>
            <li> It was what I ordered . It is a Christmas gift. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just the right cologne to fit his need</li>
            <li> My go to cologne for nights out. Always get comments about it. Well worth it to me. I love the smell!</li>
            <li> From this item, I realized that you can actually tell if a 5 star review is fake. They just say short phrases like:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;good fragrance&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;smells good, nice product&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Good price, quick shipping. Works fine&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t really say much. And all seems to be written by 1 or 2 people :) And upon seeing the other reviews of these reviewers, you&#x27;ll see the same thing, regardless of the item :)</li>
            <li> Used to get this when I worked there&lt;br /&gt;Saved a few bucks by ordering it online and it is the exact same thing we sold in stores&lt;br /&gt;This is a 50/50 cologne&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;ll either gag from the smell or chase you down the block to grab your shirt and smell it</li>
            <li> Obviously it&#x27;s fake it&#x27;s yellow and smells like 2 colognes mixed together the scent doesn&#x27;t last more than a few minutes which is a dead give away. I&#x27;m scared for this to actually make contact with my skin. Even the picture on the bottle is of poor quality. Where you know that the actual Abercrombie &amp; Fitch would&#x27;ve rejected poor packaging such as this. I&#x27;m going to tell everyone that this company is selling knock off colognes for full price claiming it&#x27;s the real thing!</li>
            <li> This was old product . It was yellow. it was to be clear in color.</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne, it&#x27;s not overpowering or anything, very pleasant smelling and lasts a good while, very quick service.</li>
            <li> My husband has purchase this cologne from Abercrombie for years &amp; decided to try amazon since it is cheeper. We were very disappointed when this arrived in the mail today due to this is definitely a fake. The smell doesn&#x27;t last no longer than a minute and the liquid in the bottle is yellow rather than clear. It&#x27;s clearly a replica and should stated as so. I much rather pay $20 more for the real thing. This is a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> The scent is fairly accurate. I had a bottle from the store and I compared the two fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;This one lasts maybe half a day, while the one from the store lasts for days. Since it is the scent, fine; however, I do not believe it was worth the $52 because of the length of the scent. Should&#x27;ve gone straight to a store to buy the original....</li>
            <li> I bought this gift for xmas gift for my son. The scent is very pleasant and not too over powering.</li>
            <li> I smell good when I wear this, and others think so as well. A girl I knew who had Anosmia could smell it from 50 feet away.</li>
            <li> I thought the aroma would be stronger n last thru out the day not the case by the time i get yo the office its all gone.. i also use Mont Blanc n i find the Aroma lasts longer...i wondeting if the Abercombie is watered down. i also use Polo black which by far surpasses all n last throughout the day...  i m tempted to return Abercrombie.</li>
            <li> Cologne is a fake. Don&#x27;t smell the same as what you buy in the store ( close but not same). The liquid is yellow not normal clear color. And the smell lasts only about a hour then it wears off completely</li>
            <li> This is the Panty dropper your shopping for must own for the rotation</li>
            <li> This product was a gift suggestion so I assume it is a five star.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived when promised and received no complaints~!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been to several Abercrombie stores when I was traveling to Miami. I was just inebriated by the scent all the stores have.... I just had to ask the guys that work there what was that great smell.... This is how I found out about this fragrance. I did the only thing I could... I bought myself a bottle of this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really amazing... It&#x27;s not a sweet fragrance, yet it&#x27;s strong and fantastic. It combines so well with every occasion, I use it all the time. I have CK Eternity, CK One, but this one is really more addictive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pretty bottle with a male picture that can be seen from both sides of the bottle. Particularly it&#x27;s not a pretty manly picture, but I really don&#x27;t have to stare at it when I&#x27;m using the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fixation:&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance fixes kinda well. It lasts for a couple of hours, but could last longer. For instance, CK&#x27;s Eternity lasts a lot longer than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;I just love this scent! It&#x27;s really inebriating, addictive... It&#x27;s really good. It shod last a little longer, but is smells great while it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great smell but way to expensive!!!</li>
            <li> What can i say, my favorite i use it all the time when i go out.it lasts a very long time ,after i wash my clothes i can still smell it LOVE IT ..hope my review helps</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, and it was as described :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to find Fierce Cologne that doesn&#x27;t cost $100. It is a small bottle by well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. buying it again for the 4th time now &amp; finally getting around to rating it.  If it ain&#x27;t broke...</li>
            <li> This was a new cologne gift for my husband who is really picky about smells. He had never smelled it before, but I had and decided to but it for him. He loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always smelled this cologne on other people and loved how it smelled. Now that I own it, it smells just the way I expected it to.&lt;br /&gt;-You don&#x27;t have to put on a ton to smell nice. Two squirts get the job done for me.&lt;br /&gt;-With out a doubt, this product was a great buy. It smells great. It lasts on your clothes or skin for a reasonable about of time. ( I prefer to spray a little on my neck and shirt...the smell lasts longer on my shirt)</li>
            <li> I tried this out and found it to be awesome! Women seem to really like the fragrance on me. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I used to work at A&amp;F and if there&#x27;s one thing that many people were always asking for, or recognizing the scent of, was Fierce. It used to be super cheap but they must have caught on that it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> bought this for my brother they shipped it really fast it arrived in 2-3 days which was great and my brother loved it</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne.  It was great to be able to buy it on this website for a bit cheaper.  It made a great stocking stuffer and he loves this scent!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a staple of the image A&amp;F sets-dated and targeted to an age. I remember being a teen and loving this scent. As an adult, I ordered this to try again. While it&#x27;s not awful, it is quite perfume-like and gives me a headache. I would recommend to a teen, but not to anyone over the age of 25.</li>
            <li> this smells so amazing!! I love it when my boyfriend puts it on. Definitely a great gift for any occasion</li>
            <li> product arrived safely and quickly, and as usual smells great.</li>
            <li> Excellent scent good product and service.</li>
            <li> smells great and good price</li>
            <li> Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Colone is great and &amp;#34;fierce&amp;#34; is the one I always use for myself, people always ask, what colon is this, simply great, I like it.</li>
            <li> Parece que tiene foromona</li>
            <li> Very well packaged.thanks.</li>
            <li> The real deal. Now I don&#x27;t have to look upon Abercrombie models in shame when I go into the poorly-lit store.</li>
            <li> Although Fierce is marketed for a young adult audience, I&#x27;ve found it equally useful in more professional life. As the name implies, the scent does stand out from softer selections and its popularity makes it easily noticeable, if not known. Although, I would not suggest it for everyday use. It is not a wasted choice.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because it is the best cologne I have ever smelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just absolutely LOVE when he wears it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> not bad at all...i like it, the smell would last for a while. 4 stars because i have seen better perfume before.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product. It was sent quickly. Also not generic or imitation, this is the real deal. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Smells good, chicks dig it, same price as the store tho that why I took one star off. Still a solid buy.</li>
            <li> This is the REAL deal. Smells great and the girls love it. Thanks for sending what you advertise. Good Job</li>
            <li> No flaws with this transaction whatsoever! Came sealed in original packaging, 100% genuine cologne and everyone loves this scent! I recommend it to every dude! Chicks really dig it</li>
            <li> This is the gift for my boyfriend and it makes his smell so adorable. And yes! He like it very much.</li>
            <li> The item was brand new and smelling like it suppose to.  It would be even better if it was sold cheaper.  Besides that, it is great.</li>
            <li> love this product - however came spoiled ..smell was bad</li>
            <li> The abercrombie and Fitch cologne was in perfect condition! The box was sealed shut, and it smells wonderful. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great price and product was exactly as described. This was a gift for a friend who absolutely loved the scent!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl and i wear this stuff because it smells so great. I think its unisex if not oh well i love the smell</li>
            <li> Great price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;Need to use just 1 short spray---is easy to get to much on.&lt;br /&gt;otherwise np.</li>
            <li> I have been using Abercrombie Fierce for years now. I too, smelled it first in the mall, and have been using it since. I trade off on occasion with Carolina Herrera 312 and Calvin Klein, as these are also very pleasant and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;I get more compliments for the Abercrombie, as it lasts throughout my day. Its not so overpowering that people complain, but just subtle enough for people to &#x27;sniff you out&#x27; to ask what you are wearing.&lt;br /&gt;Beware of fakes though. I have bought a few off of ebay over the years and they are mostly faked. Either get it from Abercrombie storefront, or a reputable dealer that you know to trust. The fake stuff doesnt last more than a few minutes and is mostly alcohol in a bottle.</li>
            <li> great price smell good</li>
            <li> I got this because my granddaughter (age 8) thought everybody should smell like her dad. And now I do...</li>
            <li> good price. it was a gift for son-in-law. He is his favorite. We do not have a abercrombie &amp; Fitch near us. This was easy and simple way to get it</li>
            <li> my husband love&#x27;s this colonge  and so do i ,i have my husband to wear it everyday even when he goes to work</li>
            <li> great smell i love it; A&amp;F makes high quality products. I should have bought the 3.4oz instead. I will correct that next time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s our favorite scent</li>
            <li> My nephew loves this, it smells so good</li>
            <li> Got this for my fianc√© for Christmas and it came on time, and was exactly what I wanted! We are both very happy with the product and will buy from seller in future for sure!</li>
            <li> This order shipped on time and was just as described by Amazon. I am very pleased with the purchase and would gladly buy this item again!</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about buying this through an outside vendor, but, as others have already commented, I had no problems whatsoever. It was packed well, in its original box and packaging. It is not &amp;#34;stale,&amp;#34; as cologne sometimes gets if it&#x27;s been sitting around for too long. I would buy from here again, especially because the price is a few bucks cheaper than it is in the store AND it&#x27;s free shipping!</li>
            <li> This is the sexiest scent I have ever smelled on a man.  I pray this will always be available for purchase.</li>
            <li> the actual product was fantastic! but it took two weeks to get to me and it was a gift so it just would have been better if i had gotten it in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Great, arrived at my desk within 5 days.  I met a girl that very day and we are still together. Results may vary. No, really this is good stuff. Replacing a bottle I bought in store, Fierce is made from natural Orange extracts which even women sensitive to all other perfumes don&#x27;t find offensive. That&#x27;s a very important thing because you don&#x27;t want your dream girl to be allergic to you. Citrus allergies excluded.</li>
            <li> This is a very clean, powerful, smooth scent. You will get a ton of compliments wearing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful buying this though...go to a couple hot spots and see if you smell it on 90% of the guys there. If not, don&#x27;t tell anyone what you&#x27;re wearing; you&#x27;ve found a signature scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer Burberry Brit or London for work, but this is definitely my go to scent otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, this doesn&#x27;t have a romantic smell, but rather a SEXY smell. Would definitely work on a date but it screams w/ energy and sexiness.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my purchase! On time delivery was a real bonus!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I made my ordered and shipping was very fast.....but I received it and was totally disappointed, when I first put it on the smell was nice for bout a few hrs and the next day I put it on again....oh man, the smell was totally different and only last then an hour.....for $52 I could&#x27;ve ordered it from the manufacturer itself only if I knew.....anyhow I won&#x27;t be buying cologne from Amazon no more but surely will order the same cologne from the manufacturer itself.</li>
            <li> best fragrance I have.&lt;br /&gt;i was using the fake target spray, this lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after smelling it at the Abercrombie and Fitch store.  It was just what we expected.</li>
            <li> This is nice if you want to smell like the Abercrombie Store.  It&#x27;s very expensive as with their clothes.  I admit I used to be a fan but now don&#x27;t really care to pay for premium prices for stuff that are too thick and with overlong sleeves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this anyway because I like this smell and do miss it since I don&#x27;t go to their stores anymore.  I long sold their declining stock as well.  Surprisingly, the stock made a big comeback in 2011 but have since dropped back to near all-time lows.  Gone are the guttonly, excessive days of 2007 and early 2008 where people just buy no matter the price due to uncontrollable and unlimited credit.  If we learned anything from the recent recession is that those who live below their means will be able to thrive on the good and bad days.</li>
            <li> Once you wear fierce you just can not think of any other fragrance . This is just mindblowing . Must try !!</li>
            <li> I was a bit scared that this wouldn&#x27;t be the exact product sold at A&amp;F, but after getting it, I realized it was. This is a great product and I plan on buying more of it from here than driving over to A&amp;F to buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...and the women do too! It smells good for any occasion and if you spray on your jacket it will stick for a while. It the only stuff I wear where all women have to say \\&quot;you smell good mmmm!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first that this cologne could have garnered so much attention and praise. Well, I will proudly admit I was wrong! This is by far my most favorite cologne. Sweet smell, ideal for dates and dress-up days at college. Scent in its purest form lasts 5-6 hours, but can still smell it the next day. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Do colognes expire? Because this one fades after about half an hour. Have never received a compliment on my cologne when I bought this one online. I use to get compliments from the store bought ones. So I&#x27;m not sure if this bottle wasn&#x27;t stored properly because it&#x27;s seriously lacking.</li>
            <li> Got it with the package soaked in the stuff and the lid completely destroyed, the smell isn&#x27;t as good as the regular cologne you get, It&#x27;s a replica clearly but still you would think it wouldnt be this bad</li>
