            <li>I got these brushes in the mail a month earlier than i should have which made me very happy.</li>
            <li>Ii love the brushe</li>
            <li>The smell has completely gone away, so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>Nice brush set but would&#x27;ve liked a card indicating what each brush is normally used for.</li>
            <li>I decided against my better judgement to ignore some of the reviews on here because many more reviews were positive, and boy, what a mistake that was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re gorgeous, easy to use, EXTREMELY soft!</li>

            <li>so soft work really good.</li>
            <li>I dislike these brushes soooooo much!!!</li>
            <li>For the amount and price very worth it.</li>
            <li>but I do make up frequently for various events with a variety of people and these brushes are perfect!</li>
            <li>The powder brush is large, which I love.</li>
            <li>The handles are very soft and feel great, and the case is just the right size and very convenient.</li>
            <li>They are also nice ans soft, silky.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the product, filled all my expectations, and came early to the expected date.</li>

            <li>High quality and stylish looking.</li>
            <li>Super soft, and cute.</li>
            <li>The brushes don&#x27;t shed, very sturdy and are light.</li>
            <li>And they did smell a bit chemically/plasticy right out of the wrappers.</li>
            <li>These are well worth the money I like them much better than brushes such as MAC they clean Ashly and are super soft!</li>
            <li>Face brushes are pretty soft but the brown top brushes shed way too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably be ordering more as my younger daughter wishes for a set as well.</li>
            <li>Everything came as described , it had the name of the brush on the sides of them for learning purposes, Thanks!</li>
            <li>First thing you should know is the overpowering smell these brushes have when first opened.</li>
            <li>No biggie tho, looked cheap and something a 5 yr old would use.</li>
            <li>When i first seen this product i couldn&#x27;t wait to receive it</li>
            <li>The smell went away and the shedding stopped after the first washing.</li>
            <li>, I really recommend them to any one looking for brushes!</li>
            <li>I really felt like I got my $ worth with these.</li>
            <li>Super cute pink set of make-up brushes really wowed the crowd at our early Christmas this year!  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>but that is what beauty school is for thanks a lot</li>
            <li>Really recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li>and I love face the their pink!</li>
            <li>I was actually looking for some brushes for a long time and finally found some good ones for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with my order, despite the fact that two of my brushes were missing.</li>
            <li>It seems like brushes are missing, but the pouch has two extra slips in case you wish to add more brushes; COUNT YOUR BRUSHES!</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>not sure why i need to say more.</li>
            <li>There is a plastic-type smell when you first open them.  </li>
            <li>Everything came well packaged and NO MISSING BRUSHES!</li>
            <li>The color pink is so, so cool, They do have some shedding as well as that manufactures smell</li>
            <li>My daughter loves this brush set..very soft and seem durable so far!</li>
            <li>I normally use Wet N Wild eyeshawdows from Walgreens, but lately I have also been using a collection called BARE, which you can also find it at Walgreens, Its the department store version of NAKED by Urban Decay, and it&#x27;s great, along with a pallet by Modern Collection which has been found at Walmart, Family Dollar, &amp; 5 below, Overall, these brushes have worked for me with cheap and expensive eyeshawdows, &amp; I could not recommend a better product!</li>
            <li>The fact that they&#x27;re too soft makes the make up slide off the brushes.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want that smell near my brushes after i had got the smell out of them.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, I actually don&#x27;t wear that much makeup</li>
            <li>The brushes are huge, not the small, pencil like size I am use to.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and really grab on to the make up powder, contrary to other reviews.</li>
            <li>The other pink top eye brushes are pretty stiff but usable</li>
            <li>These brushes are real soft, they are covered in plastic, comes in a pink plastic carrying case and you get a small and large version of some of the same brushes.</li>

            <li> I was really stoked when I purchased this product apparently for no reason, one of my brushes came broken and a different one had hair falling off (unused brush)</li>
            <li> I am not a professional make up artist</li>
            <li> Honestly I was disappointed with the quality, haven&#x27;t had them very long and some are coming apart.</li>
            <li> but when I gave it to someone as a gift the first brush she picked up was broken.</li>
            <li> Only down side is that the picture shows the brushes say &amp;#34;Makeup For You&amp;#34; and my brushes have no marking.</li>
            <li> For example, as I took the fan brush out of the case, the black piece in which the actual bristles are on, fell off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got the pink brush set</li>
            <li> They where what I truly expected</li>
            <li> These DO shed a little, that&#x27;s to be expected though.</li>
            <li> pink make-up brushes was what i was going for!!</li>
            <li> they shed like crazy, 2ndly they don&#x27;t even look the same as in the pictures, and i ordered the pink ones and they gave me some matte black ones.</li>
            <li> Then what little does stick doesn&#x27;t apply to your face.</li>
            <li> After a few months of use they begin to fall apart.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve seen reviews where people say brushes are missing)</li>

            <li> unfortunately this was not the case the brushes come in different colors like a dirt brown color!</li>
            <li> It felt as if I was suffocating just from opening the shipping package.&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, several of my brushes were broken.</li>

            <li> I got the pink brush set and this is by far, the best brushes I ever had! The brushes are very soft! The angle, blending brush is kind of off. These are really good for traveling far places as well. I would recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this brush set..very soft and seem durable so far!</li>
            <li> Awesome all 24 brushes where there.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping love it üòçüëåüëå</li>
            <li> These are well worth the money I like them much better than brushes such as MAC they clean Ashly and are super soft!</li>
            <li> I dislike these brushes soooooo much!!! 1st they shed like crazy, 2ndly they don&#x27;t even look the same as in the pictures, and i ordered the pink ones and they gave me some matte black ones.</li>
            <li> Love the whole set cant wait to use them.. looking forward to buy more for my friends and family.. ...</li>
            <li> The wait cun many cravings and luckily arrived in perfect condition, is a product of very good quality as I imagined. re like me. thanks</li>
            <li> Nice brush set but would&#x27;ve liked a card indicating what each brush is normally used for. Very pretty case and lovely brushes.</li>
            <li> Loved the colors and it was a great deal.. but when I gave it to someone as a gift the first brush she picked up was broken.</li>
            <li> I am a make-up freak and this is the cheapest, prettiest, and one of the best sets of brushes I have ever gotten. Def. Recommended.</li>
            <li> exactly as i wanted and got here super quick! not sure why i need to say more. you guys rock!</li>
            <li> I was really stoked when I purchased this product apparently for no reason, one of my brushes came broken and a different one had hair falling off (unused brush) but besides that the shadow brush seem to have work good .</li>
            <li> I am not a professional make up artist but I do make up frequently for various events with a variety of people and these brushes are perfect! I was in need of a kit for when I am on the job to travel with. The handles are very soft and feel great, and the case is just the right size and very convenient. The bristles are very soft and really grab on to the make up powder, contrary to other reviews. I think it all depends on the eye shadows you choose. I normally use Wet N Wild eyeshawdows from Walgreens, but lately I have also been using a collection called BARE, which you can also find it at Walgreens, Its the department store version of NAKED by Urban Decay, and it&#x27;s great, along with a pallet by Modern Collection which has been found at Walmart, Family Dollar, &amp; 5 below, Overall, these brushes have worked for me with cheap and expensive eyeshawdows, &amp; I could not recommend a better product!</li>
            <li> I hate these. The bristles are plastic and no make up sticks to them to apply. Then what little does stick doesn&#x27;t apply to your face. Its a vute idea, but save your money for better quality.</li>
            <li> When the brushes arrived I thought they were perfect, but after using then the brushes didn&#x27;t hold the product very well. The fact that they&#x27;re too soft makes the make up slide off the brushes.</li>
            <li> Super cute pink set of make-up brushes really wowed the crowd at our early Christmas this year!  Twenty-four pieces gives you everything you think you might ever need and more.  We don&#x27;t even know what to use all of them for!  They seem to be good quality and they do work well.  I don&#x27;t notice shedding.  There is a plastic-type smell when you first open them.  We are hoping as they are used the smell will decrease.  I&#x27;ll probably be ordering more as my younger daughter wishes for a set as well.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!! I love these brushes. I go to cosmetology school and I have gotten so many compliments. everyone loves them and think they are super cute.the case it comes in is so handy as well. great product</li>
            <li> Was actually very impressed by the quality of the brushes. For the amount and price very worth it. Would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic! Great quality and my makeup always looks flawless. I&#x27;m satisfied with my order, despite the fact that two of my brushes were missing.</li>
            <li> These brushes caught my eye b/c of the color and it seemed like a good deal for the price. Honestly I was disappointed with the quality, haven&#x27;t had them very long and some are coming apart.</li>
            <li> Very soft. The color does not run out when washing. The powder brush is large, which I love. All of the brushes are labeled.</li>
            <li> MY MOM LOVED IT!!!! Everything came as described , it had the name of the brush on the sides of them for learning purposes, Thanks!</li>
            <li> The brushes are huge, not the small, pencil like size I am use to.  Great starter kit if for younger teenagers</li>
            <li> First thing you should know is the overpowering smell these brushes have when first opened. Very strong. Air them out and wash them before use. Face brushes are pretty soft but the brown top brushes shed way too much. I had to throw them out. The other pink top eye brushes are pretty stiff but usable (some).&lt;br /&gt;Oh and i had to throw out the case. No biggie tho, looked cheap and something a 5 yr old would use. The smell was just awful. I tried to air it out but didn&#x27;t help. I didn&#x27;t want that smell near my brushes after i had got the smell out of them. All in all... I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase again, with that being said, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to you. Find yourself better quality and something not made in China.</li>
            <li> Wish there we&#x27;re more than 2 blending brushes, but I&#x27;m still very pleased with this and use this kit everyday!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Con was the bad chemical smell it had. Would recommend letting it air out, outside for a day. The smell has completely gone away, so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> After a few months of use they begin to fall apart.</li>
            <li> When i first seen this product i couldn&#x27;t wait to receive it pink make-up brushes was what i was going for!! unfortunately this was not the case the brushes come in different colors like a dirt brown color! Also I&#x27;m missing 2 brushes from my Kit!! Sending it back is such a hassle because it took me a month to receive (only because its in china)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my new brushes! They&#x27;re gorgeous, easy to use, EXTREMELY soft! Easy to maintain and so much fun to use!</li>
            <li> there was alot of fallout with these brushes (mostly the eyeshadow brushes) and they were the ones i would use the most but they do pick up product great :)</li>
            <li> These DO shed a little, that&#x27;s to be expected though. And they did smell a bit chemically/plasticy right out of the wrappers. The smell went away and the shedding stopped after the first washing. I love the selection and have all the brushes I need. Admittedly, I actually don&#x27;t wear that much makeup so I only use like 5 of these regularly. They are also nice ans soft, silky. Over all I like them a lot and would probably order them again.</li>
            <li> I like the brushes, the material is great. They do not shed, and they are for a great price! Super soft, and cute. Only down side is that the picture shows the brushes say &amp;#34;Makeup For You&amp;#34; and my brushes have no marking.</li>
            <li> I loved the brushes! There really nice and work great, I really recommend them to any one looking for brushes!</li>
            <li> Just as pictured - brushes are a great quality and I am very happy with them - would purchase again</li>
            <li> Loved the brushes! Happy with it i like the texture so soft work really good. Satisfied with it .... Recommend</li>
            <li> The brushes are really good to use. The hair on them don&#x27;t fall out at all. They where what I truly expected</li>
            <li> I order them and was nervous when I got them because come reviews that I read were not so very good.. but when they got here I was very happy they are soft and I love the color.</li>
            <li> Still dont know what most of them are for but that is what beauty school is for thanks a lot</li>
            <li> HOT DAMM !!!!-- Hello universe,. I ordered these in Dec. for a Christmas gift, was Pist when they didn&#x27;t come. Anyway--These brushes finally arrived-- The color pink is so, so cool, They do have some shedding as well as that manufactures smell so do air them out, then wash them. These brushes are real soft, they are covered in plastic, comes in a pink plastic carrying case and you get a small and large version of some of the same brushes. These are great for anyone. So if you order this set just be prepared to wait it out.</li>
            <li> They have every brush you will ever need and them some. Work great and the color is beautiful. would buy again</li>
            <li> VERY HAPPY WITH MY ORDER! Theses brushes are a really good deal for 19 dollars. The brushes don&#x27;t shed, very sturdy and are light. Love the color as well. Really recommend these brushes. Everything came well packaged and NO MISSING BRUSHES! It seems like brushes are missing, but the pouch has two extra slips in case you wish to add more brushes; COUNT YOUR BRUSHES! (I&#x27;ve seen reviews where people say brushes are missing) Overall GREAT product and if i ever need more brushes, i will order from them.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product, filled all my expectations, and came early to the expected date. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Honestly, if I could give this no stars, I would. I decided against my better judgement to ignore some of the reviews on here because many more reviews were positive, and boy, what a mistake that was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, let me say that these brushes advertise 24 pieces, correct? Well, mine came with 23.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the putrid, toxic smell that came off of the brushes was horrendous. It felt as if I was suffocating just from opening the shipping package.&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, several of my brushes were broken. For example, as I took the fan brush out of the case, the black piece in which the actual bristles are on, fell off.&lt;br /&gt;Fourthly, I read in a review that the brushes are labeled, and guess what? They&#x27;re not.&lt;br /&gt;And finally, a few of the brushes were damaged in that the paint is scraped off of some of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to buy them, I hope you have better luck than I did.</li>
            <li> I got these brushes in the mail a month earlier than i should have which made me very happy. Upon opening i thought that 2 brushes were missing, so when i contacted the seller they told me i was wrong and it just looks like theyre missing cause one spot takes up to much space. That problem was solved and once i washed them no bristles came out and they pick up a good amount of color. I was very pleased with the quality and the price.</li>
            <li> The brushes are amazing. High quality and stylish looking. I really felt like I got my $ worth with these.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed the brushes fall apart fast</li>
            <li> Its good for the price you pay...!!!!!!! I was actually looking for some brushes for a long time and finally found some good ones for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Ii love the brushe the work really good and I love face the their pink! Just love them since the first time I saw them!</li>
