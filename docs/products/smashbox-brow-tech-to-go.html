            <li>I buy two at a time now to make sure I am not without.</li>
            <li>Love my smash box brow tech.  </li>
            <li>It just gets overdone on many women, IMHO.  </li>
            <li>but it sure works well</li>
            <li>this is the perfect addition to my blonde brows.</li>
            <li>The taupe color is a better match for my coloring.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other gel eyebrows products and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to put on</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and would strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I liked the pencil very much.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect color for dark blondes / light brunettes</li>
            <li>Light strokes is the trick.</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Too much of a good thing due to the current trend and emphasis on having beautiful brows!</li>
            <li>I love the ease that it applies, the smoothness and it looks natural, this is the best pencil I have found, and I do love the small brush that keeps brows from going wild and it stays in place, its great......</li>
            <li>Great color but not much product in tube.</li>
            <li>I just love this product so easy to use and looks really natural on, I would recommend this product</li>
            <li>Looks very natural, and goes on really smooth.  :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a medium to light blond and my brows are the darker mousy blond that my natural hair color mostly is these days.  </li>
            <li>The pencil goes on smoothly and the brush helps to give the brow a more natural look.</li>
            <li>Love this product...can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>I have light brown hair and very sparse eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Pricey for the quantity but worth it.</li>
            <li>it is the most natural looking brow pencil I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>Long lasting (last all day through sweat and all), easy application, blends in perfectly.  </li>
            <li>If your brows are very light blonde</li>
            <li>Second purchase :)</li>
            <li>Most brown shades have too much red undertone.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t ever use any other kind of brow product again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for a long time, love it.</li>
            <li>I love that it goes on easily without tugging, looks natural, and has the clear gel on the other end of the tube.  </li>
            <li>This pencil doesn&#x27;t take much pressure to get just a light touch of color, enough to fill-in and even cover some of the gray hairs that now populate my brows.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the gel.  </li>
            <li>The actual product is awesome but the item I got from this company, the brow color stick was broken so the color stick keeps sliding out.</li>
            <li>It may be too dark for those that have very light to light blonde hair and brows.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love that it&#x27;s an all in one pencil on one end and a brush with gel on the other end.  </li>
            <li>But use of SB Brow Tech To Go and a light touch works very well for me, plus it lasts a fairly long time.</li>
            <li>By drawing my eyebrows outward and making the arch higher I&#x27;ve fixed that problem.  </li>
            <li>Also, it has a little more reddish tint to it than I like.</li>
            <li>recently tried a couple different highly and highly rated products when this product was temporarily unavailable and switched back to this when it became available.  </li>
            <li>It is clear and lightweight and holds hairs in place without being sticky at all.  </li>
            <li>But really, what make up is totally water proof?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so this give the definition I need while still looking natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough, and also dark enough at the same time.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have purchased this on amazon because it is not found in my small town.</li>
            <li> Maybe she received a bad or expired product because I have used this for 2 years now, and the gel is definitely not glue-like.  </li>
            <li> I thought the brow tech was waterproof but was wrong.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not a eyebrow person. But I do have smaller eyes. By drawing my eyebrows outward and making the arch higher I&#x27;ve fixed that problem.  This is the best eyebrow pencil I have ever bought. From the color to the shape. I fell on love with it as soon as I tried it and 100% recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my go to brow pencil. Easy to apply. Light strokes is the trick.Stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally blonde, but my brows are little bit darker so this color works. If your brows are very light blonde this color probably won&#x27;t match well enough for you. Also, it has a little more reddish tint to it than I like.</li>
            <li> Great color but not much product in tube. The color stick kept breaking too. Lasted two weeks. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to, gotta have it eyebrow pencil.  Priced better than any retail store around.</li>
            <li> Great color. Awesome natural coverage. Pricey for the quantity but worth it. Second purchase :)</li>
            <li> The actual product is awesome but the item I got from this company, the brow color stick was broken so the color stick keeps sliding out. but it&#x27;s still usable and is the perfect shade. Thanks</li>
            <li> I thought the brow tech was waterproof but was wrong. Also, the color TAUPE was too red. I heard TAUPE was recommended for gray hair but it was not a natural look at all. I also don&#x27;t like the feeling of putting glue on my brows. However, I was quite impressed with their quick no questions asked refund.[[ASIN:B003DZXC36 Smashbox Brow Tech To Go Taupe]]</li>
            <li> absolutly love this product. if you are on the fence about it take a chance and buy it. it is the most natural looking brow pencil I have ever used. No sharpener needed perfect in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous. You won&#x27;t ever use any other kind of brow product again. It last quite a while too.</li>
            <li> Love it. My only fear is that someday they&#x27;ll discontinue it. I&#x27;ve tried other gel eyebrows products and this one is the best. The little brow-set spool at the opposite end makes the product stay put.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this on amazon because it is not found in my small town.

            <li> I have light brown hair and very sparse eyebrows.  Other reviewers have said they thought this had a reddish tint, and I don&#x27;t see this at all and consider it neutral in tone. It may be too dark for those that have very light to light blonde hair and brows.  I love that it goes on easily without tugging, looks natural, and has the clear gel on the other end of the tube.  Someone else stated she didn&#x27;t like putting glue on their eyebrows.

It is clear and lightweight and holds hairs in place without being sticky at all.  I absolutely love that it&#x27;s an all in one pencil on one end and a brush with gel on the other end.  I consider it to be water resistant, not water proof.  But really, what make up is totally water proof?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently tried a couple different highly and highly rated products when this product was temporarily unavailable and switched back to this when it became available.  I buy two at a time now to make sure I am not without.</li>
            <li> Love this product...can&#x27;t live without it.  used to get on QVC but no longer carrying it.</li>
            <li> Love my smash box brow tech.  I have very light eyebrows so this give the definition I need while still looking natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a long time, love it. Thank u</li>
            <li> Great color easy to use and apply</li>
            <li> I have to say, this is a very good brow pencil/liner/filler.  I use the taupe color.  I&#x27;m a medium to light blond and my brows are the darker mousy blond that my natural hair color mostly is these days.  This pencil doesn&#x27;t take much pressure to get just a light touch of color, enough to fill-in and even cover some of the gray hairs that now populate my brows.  And then to add some extra smoothness, if you need or want it, the gel brush on the other end helps to set everything.  I don&#x27;t like my brows to have a &amp;#34;too-perfect&amp;#34; look that I&#x27;ve seen on some women where you see more brow color than natural brow and the shape looks artificial.  Yuk! Too much of a good thing due to the current trend and emphasis on having beautiful brows! It just gets overdone on many women, IMHO.  But use of SB Brow Tech To Go and a light touch works very well for me, plus it lasts a fairly long time.</li>
            <li> Must have product for brows, covers gray.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyebrow product I&#x27;ve found so far.  The taupe color works very as I&#x27;m a blonde who is greying around the edges.  I don&#x27;t really use the gel.  In fact I&#x27;d forgotten it was there until I was looking to buy another tube.  I work 10 hour shifts and it stays put until I wash it off.  It&#x27;s light enough, and also dark enough at the same time.  Just right.</li>
            <li> Just the best eye brow pencil, got one for my sister also.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect color for dark blondes / light brunettes</li>
            <li> This is the best product for thinning and light colored eyebrows I&#x27;ve ever used.  Looks very natural, and goes on really smooth.  :)</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding the pencil and decided to check Amazon. I bought two, that way I&#x27;ll start looking and ordering before using the second one. Like it! It&#x27;s easy to put on and I can follow my brows. Sometimes I use a Q-tip to take off the excess but it sure works well and I&#x27;ll keep using. Taupe is the best color for me.</li>
            <li> Best brow pencil ever.  Just wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> this is the perfect addition to my blonde brows. It is the perfect color without looking like I had to draw on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I received this promptly and packaged well. I liked the pencil very much. The taupe color is a better match for my coloring. Most brown shades have too much red undertone. The pencil goes on smoothly and the brush helps to give the brow a more natural look. I shall definitely continue to buy this item.</li>
