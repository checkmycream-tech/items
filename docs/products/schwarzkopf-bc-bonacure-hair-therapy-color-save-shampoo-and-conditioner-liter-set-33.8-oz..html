            <li>That is also important to me, is the smell, it leaves your hair silky soft, smelly and healthy!!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>Purple shampoos are much better than this for maintaining the &amp;#34;cleanness&amp;#34; of color.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Love this Shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>I love this product, just not from this seller.</li>
            <li>My hairdressor is always telling me how healthy my hair is, even after not going in for 3 months...</li>
            <li>I love the smell too.</li>

            <li>I am also pleased that the shampoo is Sulfate Free, which is also not listed in the product details.</li>
            <li>Very nice shampoo and conditioner for my color treated hair,&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair soft and shines.</li>
            <li>When she first recommended Schwarzkopf, my stylist had asked what products I had been using; when I told her she said that maybe the Schwarzkopf products would be more appropriate.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the money and Amazon offers it a great price.</li>
            <li>Sulfate Free.  </li>
            <li>My hair is smooth.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s tippy top that Amazon has the large size bottles (with pumps) for such a great price.  </li>
            <li>Schwarzkopf was recommended by my stylist and she was absolutely right!  </li>
            <li>Good shampoo, last forever!  </li>
            <li>great deal, extra large bottles that came with pumps.</li>
            <li>This was a fantastic deal plus it came in a cute pink reusable cloth bag.</li>
            <li>Very prompt shipping!</li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t have extra time for deep treatment (same brand), these products together are wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Unimpressed with the results; haven&#x27;t noticed that much of an improvement in the blondeness of my hair.</li>
            <li>However, this shampoo/conditioner is very drying.  </li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t use the straight iron too often though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always asked my hairdresser about the new shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
            <li>he&#x27;s been using on my hair, and he&#x27;s always said that he only had GALLON sizes, which was too much!  </li>
            <li>And leave my hair soft and it shines.</li>
            <li>My high lights and low lights last so much longer and my hair is soft.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my fine, delicate hair feeling stronger.</li>

            <li> The conditioner makes my hair a little too soft</li>
            <li> I have used it for a long time and feel it is doing what claims to do.</li>
            <li> However, the actual product was extremely watery.</li>

            <li> My hair color has kept and I noticed a lot less hair in the drain after months of using this product.  </li>
            <li> so be careful to use a small amount.  </li>
            <li> but can tell there is a difference in color (a lighter pink than whay I bought from my salon) and less thick.  </li>
            <li> I always order this stuff, and this time around it was watered down!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it is meant for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> BUT ITS REALLY HARD TO PUT THE SHAMPOO</li>
            <li> A salon would charge approximately $40.00 each.  </li>
            <li> I asked him why people would claim this is fake</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve always asked my hairdresser about the new shampoo &amp; conditioner he&#x27;s been using on my hair, and he&#x27;s always said that he only had GALLON sizes, which was too much!  Last week at the local hair salon, I seen these duo liters on sale!  Both for $45, and it&#x27;s the same stuff that my hairdresser uses!  **Alone, they are $45 and $42 each.  The smell is soooooo good!  That is also important to me, is the smell, it leaves your hair silky soft, smelly and healthy!!!!!!!!  A must try!</li>
            <li> Good shampoo, last forever!  Does come with the pump but the product itself is not the same as what you buy at the salon.  Name and bottle matches but can tell there is a difference in color (a lighter pink than whay I bought from my salon) and less thick.  Still works good and recommend it but it you are buying it because it is cheaper than the same product from your salon shelf you will be disapointed.</li>
            <li> The package came on time and it was packaged nicely. However, the actual product was extremely watery. I have used the product before and it never felt that way.</li>
            <li> Unimpressed with the results; haven&#x27;t noticed that much of an improvement in the blondeness of my hair. Purple shampoos are much better than this for maintaining the &amp;#34;cleanness&amp;#34; of color.</li>
            <li> Schwarzkopf was recommended by my stylist and she was absolutely right!  When she first recommended Schwarzkopf, my stylist had asked what products I had been using; when I told her she said that maybe the Schwarzkopf products would be more appropriate.  She reminded me that my monthly color treatments were somewhat pricey and why not use products that would not only enhance my hair but insure that the color lasts.  My salon color lasts and stays bright and shiny much longer with these products!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that works on my hair. I have used it for a long time and feel it is doing what claims to do.</li>
            <li> Excellent! This was a fantastic deal plus it came in a cute pink reusable cloth bag. The bottles of product will last a very long time. Very prompt shipping!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great.  I have tried everything under the sun. I have finally found this and I am totally sold.  Try it, you will see what I am talking about.  Great for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt better!!!  The color lasts.  My hairdresser has even been impressed how great my hair looks an feels.  Ladies, if you have colored, frizzy hair, this product is for you!!!</li>
            <li> I never believed that shampoo an conditioners made a big difference in preserving hair coloring. I was wrong and this product has reduced the fading tremendously. It is worth the money and Amazon offers it a great price.</li>
            <li> Great product and responsive delivery!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  The conditioner makes my hair a little too soft so be careful to use a small amount.  All in all great products from Schwarzkopf.  Great for your colored-treated hair as it helps to keep it from fading.</li>
            <li> These is not what I thought I was buying.  I thought I was buying the purple colored shampoo and conditioner, but I think I just didn&#x27;t read the description well enough.  Anyways, I went ahead and tried it because I am a fan of the purple shampoo.  However, this shampoo/conditioner is very drying.  It leaves my hair feeling like hay.  I&#x27;m not sure how it is meant for color treated hair.  It does smell good though.</li>
            <li> Love this Shampoo. A purple shampoo that smells GOOD!!! And leave my hair soft and it shines.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t ship with pumps, but no problem I had the pumps from a prior order.  Sulfate Free.  My high lights and low lights last so much longer and my hair is soft.  Arrived on time and well packaged.  thanks.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I think it&#x27;s tippy top that Amazon has the large size bottles (with pumps) for such a great price.  I used to buy these 8 oz bottles from a beauty supply store and pay about $30 per bottle.  The formula here is identical to the one I get from the beauty supply store and as my hairstylist uses in his salon.  I asked him why people would claim this is fake and he said that the consistency of the shampoo and conditioner has changed over the years so it feels thinner now, but the product still works just as well.  My hair color has kept and I noticed a lot less hair in the drain after months of using this product.  I also like the repair therapy to change up for Winter months.</li>
            <li> IT DID HAVE THE CAP ON THE BOTTLE. BUT ITS REALLY HARD TO PUT THE SHAMPOO ON YOU HAIR WITH OUT THE LIP OF THE SHAMPOO</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this item from Amazon for a while and I had some suspicions. When I recently got a travel kit of the same products from my hair salon, I notice the products were vastly different from what I purchase at Amazon - which has a significantly different consistency and smell from the products I purchased at the hair salon. Of course it is possible the company changed their formula. If so, the change was not for the better!</li>
            <li> I always order this stuff, and this time around it was watered down! The shampoo was thicker than the conditioner! My hair also felt very dry after using it and the scent changed. I love this product, just not from this seller.</li>
            <li> great deal, extra large bottles that came with pumps.</li>
            <li> I have the feeling that this shampoo is not the same I got from my saloon. It leaves my hair dry.</li>
            <li> Very nice shampoo and conditioner for my color treated hair,&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair soft and shines.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t have extra time for deep treatment (same brand), these products together are wonderful!  Leaves my fine, delicate hair feeling stronger.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and leaves my hair smelling nice. Since these are larger bottles, I wish this product would have come with a pump.</li>
            <li> Its good. My hair is smooth.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner! My hairdressor is always telling me how healthy my hair is, even after not going in for 3 months...I also don&#x27;t use the straight iron too often though and when I do I use a heat protectant on my hair. But you can&#x27;t beat the price on these hair products to start with!</li>
            <li> So far so good. To my surprise, these came with their own pumps (I had just purchased separate ones as they were not included in the description) and they look to be of good quality. I have yet to use the products, but look forward to trying them out. I am also pleased that the shampoo is Sulfate Free, which is also not listed in the product details. I hope I like this - because I sure have a lot of it!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> These products are the best of the best and the price is right!!  A salon would charge approximately $40.00 each.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and wouldn&#x27;t change for anything.  Excellent product for colored hair!!</li>
            <li> It dries out your hair so you can not use it every day but it does hold the color and does smell good</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so smooth and silky. I love the smell too. I would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Great hair care product.  Came timely.  Very happy withit.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t come with any pumps!!!</li>
