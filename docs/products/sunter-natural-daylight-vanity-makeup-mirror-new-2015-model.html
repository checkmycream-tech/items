            <li>Nice design and size for a vanity.  </li>
            <li>Nice looking,</li>
            <li>Light is a good brightness.</li>
            <li>As others have posted, the light is not that bright</li>
            <li>This mirror puts out a good amount of light compared to others I tried.</li>
            <li>The magnification is good and the overall size is ideal.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>

            <li>Great price, fast delivery</li>
            <li>I gave this as a gift and the recipient was pleased with it.</li>
            <li>; 50 for basic fluorescent lights, to 90 for the best tr-phosphor type)))&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I had to use an extension cord to be able to place it where I wanted to on my dresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a $100+ makeup mirror that I love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I don&#x27;t have to keep searching.</li>
            <li>Light is clean but not as bright as I would like</li>
            <li>When it first arrived, I loved this mirror.</li>
            <li>My wife likes the way it looks and seems happy with the whole arrangement which is most important of all, because you can&#x27;t put a price on not being nagged.</li>
            <li>Great mirror love the 10x magnification,it has a nice satin nickel finish not clear in pictures.  </li>
            <li>I have used it as well and love the amount of light it emits.</li>
            <li>mirror rotates easily -</li>
            <li>Very pleased, shipped fast.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this mirror if you want to be able to pluck your eyebrows perfectly without missing a hair, applying a makeup flawlessly and being able to see every single blackhead, pore or imperfection on your face.  </li>
            <li>My husband uses the light</li>
            <li>I never use the light as it makes your eyeballs look like you are from outer space.</li>
            <li>I had to remove the mirror and tape the ceramic part to the housing to make the light bulb stay.if</li>
            <li>the ceramic brakes and the light bulb becomes unfastened.</li>
            <li>I can see everything with the light and 10x zoom.</li>
            <li>light bulb is replaceable, just unscrew the two screws and remove the mirror&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>It is just a 13-watt daylight compact fluorescent light bulb.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The light burned out.</li>
            <li>When I try to see with the light on.</li>
            <li>and it feels cheap.</li>
            <li>The flimsy feeling switch was my primary cause for concern.</li>
            <li>It looks cheap.</li>
            <li>This mirror functions well, the light is excellent and the stand is heavy.</li>
            <li>even though the packaging stated that the light was lifetime guaranteed, the warranty was only for 1 year and the mirror light conveniently died 2 months after the warranty expired!!!</li>
            <li>I have since upgraded the lighting in our master bath so this mirror and its light have since become outmoded for the purpose it was originally intended to fill.</li>
            <li>I use this for my YouTube makeup room for filming and it works well and looks very modern and stylish.</li>
            <li>This is the accuracy of the ability of the bulbs light to show colors in their true color.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; 100 being the highest number, &#x3D;</li>
            <li>It is worth it!  </li>
            <li>The lighting is great also and I was surprised that the mirror is as large as it is.</li>
            <li>The size is great and I like that the mirror rotates 360 degrees to easily change from one side to the other.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big, sturdy, gives off good light</li>
            <li>I did not find the light was good and the mirror was not clear.</li>
            <li>Magnification is good but only one lighting setting</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a gorgeous mirror and big.  </li>
            <li>Nice natural lighting.</li>
            <li>The light which is produced by the element in this thing is much more like natural light</li>
            <li>The 10x side is amazing; I can see every tiny flaw without the need for glasses, and is very useful for putting on eye makeup and tweezing brows.</li>
            <li>As far as that goes the light on this mirror doesn&#x27;t seem to be quite as bright as it should be; it seems adequate to the bare minimum to me.</li>
            <li>Magnification on this mirror is fantastic; I see much more than I actually would like to see.</li>
            <li>this 80 CRI - fluorescent is pretty true to life color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It had the right height and lighting.</li>
            <li>FSL&#x27; &#x3D; full spectrum light is engineered to simulate natural daylight indoors, for reducing eye strain &amp; glare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The micro side shows every tiny detail and the regular side works great too.  </li>
            <li>, This shows all your face and makeup flaws in bright daylight, with 1x and 10 x magnification  you will not  look like tammy fay baker with this, and the price was extremely well with fast shipping 1 day</li>
            <li>Yeah you can buy a replacement bulb for $17 only from Conair but why would I give them any more $$.</li>
            <li>Better standard bulb.  </li>
            <li>your skin holds when you see yourself under a natural light zoomed in at 10X magnification.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If someone buys this at the current price of over 80$, they deserve more than that.</li>
            <li>She said it was not representative of natural light and that this could result in the &#x27;misapplication&#x27; of makeup; an unacceptable situation indeed.</li>
            <li>The thing is still going, my wife still likes it and while the light output is still less than optimum, it gets a fourth star.</li>
            <li>mirror frame is an attractive 2 3/4&amp;#34; thick which adds a balanced and rich appearance to the overall design.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Now waiting to see if the light will last the 10,000 hours as promised on the package.</li>
            <li>Very well made.  </li>
            <li>He had melanoma so he examines his face very closely.</li>
            <li>I like the 8x as you can see your whole face.</li>
            <li>Not enough light.</li>
            <li>It shipped fast and is priced well compared to others I looked at.</li>
            <li>The 10 times side &#x3D; which is harder to find, will bring a feeling of freedom to many folks with glasses.&lt;br /&gt;For me &#x3D;</li>
            <li>I kept it though because it was to much of a pain to return .</li>
            <li>you turn it too much</li>
            <li>It allows me to see my whole face and it magnifies to my expectations.</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t see spending that much for my daughter to take to college.  </li>
            <li>So this was a reasonably priced alternative.  </li>
            <li>However, I got to use it only TWICE before the light just died on me.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The incandescent bulbs used in other makeup mirrors can be flattering, but don&#x27;t you want to see what you really look like when you go outside in bright sunlight or when you go to work at an office with fluorescent lighting?</li>
            <li>The natural light is great too as it helps to me to control my makeup application so that it is not too dark or heavy for the office.</li>
            <li>Why spend up to or more than $100 for a natural light mirror, when the Sunter Natural Daylight Mirror can do everything those others can for a lot less.  </li>
            <li>My only criticism, and this is true of all 10x mirrors, is that you need to lean in very close to it; otherwise you will get a lot of distortion.</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the light doesn&#x27;t really project at all, it only works well if you are right up close to the mirror (on either side).</li>
            <li>The mirror is beautiful, however the magnified side is so magnified that it is difficult to adjust to it.</li>
            <li>The zoom is incredible and it is amazing (and sad) to see all the flaws and deep down dirt</li>
            <li>I had previously purchased another brand and this one was much better.</li>
            <li>Bought  this because I have an older model</li>
            <li>Still I don&#x27;t find that it is ok to sell a product in which the bult lasts only two short uses.</li>
            <li>Not quite what I expected, but just fine.</li>
            <li>BUT that does not mean it is a had product.</li>
            <li>The light can be a little harsh, but if you really want to see fine details, it works very well.</li>
            <li>I do agree with other reviews that the light is not like daylight</li>
            <li>Hopefully I can learn to live with it.</li>
            <li>Oh by the way, I paid only $35 for it from a third party seller with free shipping.</li>
            <li>I really had to search high and low for a new replacement.</li>
            <li>The only thing is when using the magnifying side you have to be real close for it to be clear.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I will bring out my old one that this was supposed to replace.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift for my 17 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>Much taller and bigger than it looked in the photo .</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the quality for the price.</li>
            <li>The lighting is too dim.</li>
            <li>for a black body (incandescent lamps are effectively black-bodies)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; 80 plus for typical LED.</li>
            <li>This is larger than I expected, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing.  </li>
            <li>And no guarantee that the new one would last any longer.</li>
            <li>Hard to change light bulb</li>
            <li>but the magnification is a little much for me.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Yeah you can buy a replacement bulb for $17 only from Conair but why would I give them any more $$.</li>
            <li> Better standard bulb.  </li>
            <li> your skin holds when you see yourself under a natural light zoomed in at 10X magnification.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If someone buys this at the current price of over 80$, they deserve more than that.</li>

            <li> Very well made.  </li>

            <li> I like the 8x as you can see your whole face.</li>
            <li> Not enough light.</li>
            <li> It shipped fast and is priced well compared to others I looked at.</li>
            <li> The 10 times side &#x3D; which is harder to find, will bring a feeling of freedom to many folks with glasses.&lt;br /&gt;For me &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I kept it though because it was to much of a pain to return .</li>
            <li> you turn it too much</li>
            <li> It allows me to see my whole face and it magnifies to my expectations.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t see spending that much for my daughter to take to college.  </li>
            <li> So this was a reasonably priced alternative.  </li>
            <li> However, I got to use it only TWICE before the light just died on me.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The incandescent bulbs used in other makeup mirrors can be flattering, but don&#x27;t you want to see what you really look like when you go outside in bright sunlight or when you go to work at an office with fluorescent lighting?</li>
            <li> The natural light is great too as it helps to me to control my makeup application so that it is not too dark or heavy for the office.</li>
            <li> Why spend up to or more than $100 for a natural light mirror, when the Sunter Natural Daylight Mirror can do everything those others can for a lot less.  </li>
            <li> My only criticism, and this is true of all 10x mirrors, is that you need to lean in very close to it; otherwise you will get a lot of distortion.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the light doesn&#x27;t really project at all, it only works well if you are right up close to the mirror (on either side).</li>
            <li> The mirror is beautiful, however the magnified side is so magnified that it is difficult to adjust to it.</li>
            <li> The zoom is incredible and it is amazing (and sad) to see all the flaws and deep down dirt</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased another brand and this one was much better.</li>
            <li> Bought  this because I have an older model</li>
            <li> Still I don&#x27;t find that it is ok to sell a product in which the bult lasts only two short uses.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected, but just fine.</li>
            <li> BUT that does not mean it is a had product.</li>
            <li> The light can be a little harsh, but if you really want to see fine details, it works very well.</li>
            <li> I do agree with other reviews that the light is not like daylight</li>
            <li> Hopefully I can learn to live with it.</li>
            <li> Oh by the way, I paid only $35 for it from a third party seller with free shipping.</li>
            <li> I really had to search high and low for a new replacement.</li>
            <li> The only thing is when using the magnifying side you have to be real close for it to be clear.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I will bring out my old one that this was supposed to replace.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my 17 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> Much taller and bigger than it looked in the photo .</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the quality for the price.</li>
            <li> The lighting is too dim.</li>
            <li> for a black body (incandescent lamps are effectively black-bodies)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; 80 plus for typical LED.</li>
            <li> This is larger than I expected, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> And no guarantee that the new one would last any longer.</li>
            <li> Hard to change light bulb</li>
            <li> but the magnification is a little much for me.</li>
            <li> It loses another star because I&#x27;m willing to bet the purchase price, three times over, that the switch on this will go out before very long.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife who was never very wild about the lighting in our bathroom.</li>
            <li> but I have seen some other mirrors that do several different lights</li>
            <li> I can now see facial details without my glasses in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base (7 1/2&amp;#34; dia) is weighted so the mirror isn&#x27;t top heavy, making it right at 4</li>
            <li> it has a 5 ft long cord for moving around, plus the cord comes with a Velcro strap for wrapping it up</li>
            <li> /&gt;The 10,000 hour bulb at an hour a day is expected to last over 27 years.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> From what I hear, there is no way to change the bulb (please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong on this one) and if I want a new one, it costs almost three time as much now.</li>
            <li> I have no need of such things, thusly, I&#x27;m no expert on the subject.</li>
            <li> If the mirror is your only light source, you&#x27;re likely to be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> lb.&lt;br /&gt;The mirrored center of each side is 6 1/2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and she was ticked pink and did not even know the difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Purchased this makeup mirror as a christmas present and it did not light up.  </li>
            <li> But the light is not nearly as bright as my previous makeup mirror which makes tweezing hard for me to see.</li>
            <li> read other reviews to see if anyone else had this problem, no one seemed to.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m doing something wrong could you please send me a note to let me know what I can do because with light on, I just can&#x27;t see my reflection hardly at all.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have to bend down to look in it .</li>
            <li> Apparently it was broken or defective.  </li>
            <li> Too dark!</li>
            <li> The way it is handled during shipping is not relevant to the product itself.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t failed yet, as we&#x27;ve only just got it and</li>
            <li> It has a small footprint and stores well in what space we have.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t hardly see to do anything.  </li>
            <li> There very small (a pin prick) &amp; not an issue for me but may be for some.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price if you get it under $75.&lt;br /&gt;People who gave a one starred negative review due to broken products are unfair.</li>
            <li> Mirror was broken.</li>
            <li> The rest of the unit seems sturdy enough with sufficient weight in the base to make it stable.</li>
            <li> It looks expensive.</li>
            <li> if it does fail in an untimely manner I&#x27;ll dock it in the ratings and edit this review.</li>
            <li> So disappointing as it was given as a gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sorry I decided to buy this mirror. :(</li>
            <li> It never turned on again worthless buyer beware</li>
            <li> The base is not what is pictured.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great light. Mirror is perfect height. Light is clean but not as bright as I would like</li>
            <li> Wish I could give it no stars !!! I brought this product took it out the box, it turned on and then that was it !!!! It never turned on again worthless buyer beware</li>
            <li> I would have liked the light to be brighter, but very good for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I did not find the light was good and the mirror was not clear. Also it was way too tall .</li>
            <li> After having a Remington makeup mirror for 16 years(now discontinued &amp; never having to replace lights with daily use!!) I really had to search high and low for a new replacement. In 2014 I replaced it with Conair&#x27;s Reflections Mirror model BE116T for $75, even though the packaging stated that the light was lifetime guaranteed, the warranty was only for 1 year and the mirror light conveniently died 2 months after the warranty expired!!! Yeah you can buy a replacement bulb for $17 only from Conair but why would I give them any more $$. So after stressing out and researching again this Dec, I went with the Sunter and I love it! Great Lighting and Magnification at a reasonable price. Now waiting to see if the light will last the 10,000 hours as promised on the package.</li>
            <li> Probably a good product but mine arrived with scratches all over one side of the mirror and I&#x27;m returning it.  Don&#x27;t have a warm fuzzy feeling about the quality.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Love this mirror.</li>
            <li> Great buy for the price! The micro side shows every tiny detail and the regular side works great too.  Light is a good brightness.</li>
            <li> Magnification is good but only one lighting setting</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give a review on this product, it was not working when it arrived, as soon as I turned it on it made a sizzling noise and burned out, when I flipped the mirror over I heard things rattling inside. The seller was great and immediately issued a refund I did not reorder.</li>
            <li> This mirror is very bright and well made. The magnified side of the mirror takes some getting use to but my wife says it is great.; It was as advertised and will serve your needs.</li>
            <li> Hard to change light bulb</li>
            <li> The size is great and I like that the mirror rotates 360 degrees to easily change from one side to the other. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the light doesn&#x27;t really project at all, it only works well if you are right up close to the mirror (on either side). It&#x27;s a great mirror for the price!</li>
            <li> Very well made.  Better standard bulb.  Very good for ladies to pick and pluck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and good lighting. I use the non-magnified side and the magnification is distorted unless you&#x27;re up close. I use this for my YouTube makeup room for filming and it works well and looks very modern and stylish.</li>
            <li> The mirror is beautiful, however the magnified side is so magnified that it is difficult to adjust to it. You can&#x27;t see your entire face in the magnified side; you have to keep moving your face to see another section of it, all the while adjusting your eyes. Hopefully I can learn to live with it. Otherwise I will bring out my old one that this was supposed to replace.</li>
            <li> I give a three as I like the 8x magnification but my husband gives it a 5 as he likes the 10x magnification. He had melanoma so he examines his face very closely. I like the 8x as you can see your whole face. They are great mirrors as we have 2 of them and have purchased for granddaughter and daughter, Will buy another if I find one on sale at a good price. My husband uses the light I never use the light as it makes your eyeballs look like you are from outer space. Anyway I love the mirror but the magnification is a little much for me. Bought an extra one to keep on hand in case one breaks.</li>
            <li> Mirror was broken. Sent back</li>
            <li> Too dark! Not enough light. REturned it.</li>
            <li> Great mirror but can&#x27;t find the replacement bulbs. Regular 13watt bulbs are not the same lighting. Any suggestions on where to find the bulbs for this mirror?</li>
            <li> Always wanted on of these mirrors. Great price, fast delivery</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my 17 year old daughter. This mirror is amazing. I have used it as well and love the amount of light it emits.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected, but just fine. I am short and stand is way too tall</li>
            <li> Magnification on this mirror is fantastic; I see much more than I actually would like to see. The lighting is great also and I was surprised that the mirror is as large as it is.</li>
            <li> This is a good looking, sturdy mirror. The magnification is good and the overall size is ideal. I do agree with other reviews that the light is not like daylight BUT that does not mean it is a had product. I gave this as a gift and the recipient was pleased with it. I had previously purchased another brand and this one was much better. You can&#x27;t beat the price if you get it under $75.&lt;br /&gt;People who gave a one starred negative review due to broken products are unfair. The way it is handled during shipping is not relevant to the product itself.</li>
            <li> The magnification is supper good. I wear reading glasses (1.50 strength) and this is the perfect makeup mirror for me but my husband says it is too magnified for him (he uses it when he trims his goatee). The natural light is great too as it helps to me to control my makeup application so that it is not too dark or heavy for the office. It shipped fast and is priced well compared to others I looked at.</li>
            <li> The 10 times side &#x3D; which is harder to find, will bring a feeling of freedom to many folks with glasses.&lt;br /&gt;For me &#x3D; I can now see facial details without my glasses in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base (7 1/2&amp;#34; dia) is weighted so the mirror isn&#x27;t top heavy, making it right at 4 lb.&lt;br /&gt;The mirrored center of each side is 6 1/2&amp;#34; diameter, with 1/2&amp;#34; circle of light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s 18 1/2&amp;#34; tall, so if by the bathroom sink it will likely be somewhat in front of the vanity mirror.&lt;br /&gt;But it has a 5 ft long cord for moving around, plus the cord comes with a Velcro strap for wrapping it up tidy.&lt;br /&gt;If at a vanity / or table, the cord is a good length to reach an outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror frame is an attractive 2 3/4&amp;#34; thick which adds a balanced and rich appearance to the overall design.&lt;br /&gt;The bulb is 13 watt / 6500 Kelvin / 80 CRI - fluorescent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;((((CRI). This is the accuracy of the ability of the bulbs light to show colors in their true color.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; 100 being the highest number, &#x3D; for a black body (incandescent lamps are effectively black-bodies)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; 80 plus for typical LED. (some manufacturers say their LEDs are up to 98 CRI)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; 50 for basic fluorescent lights, to 90 for the best tr-phosphor type)))&lt;br /&gt;So given this scale &#x3D; this 80 CRI - fluorescent is pretty true to life color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror rotates easily - it&#x27;s glare &amp; fog free.&lt;br /&gt;The 10,000 hour bulb at an hour a day is expected to last over 27 years.&lt;br /&gt;This &#x27;FSL&#x27; &#x3D; full spectrum light is engineered to simulate natural daylight indoors, for reducing eye strain &amp; glare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only one con &#x3D; one mirror had several specks that appeared to be manufacture defects,&lt;br /&gt;but lighter fluid on a cloth removed them all but two. There very small (a pin prick) &amp; not an issue for me but may be for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; 1st photo &#x3D; bathroom lights on, 2nd photo lights out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; LOVE it !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bulb is replaceable &#x3D; 13 watt bare-spiral self ballast compact fluorescent bulb.see these online prices. However &#x3D;  the mirror does look and feel the quality and price of the on line up-charge.  Bulb is replaceable &#x3D; 13 watt bare-spiral self ballast compact fluorescent bulb.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this mirror!</li>
            <li> Much taller and bigger than it looked in the photo . I kept it though because it was to much of a pain to return .</li>
            <li> Bought  this because I have an older model and I couldn&#x27;t see my makeup because it was night time lighting, This shows all your face and makeup flaws in bright daylight, with 1x and 10 x magnification  you will not  look like tammy fay baker with this, and the price was extremely well with fast shipping 1 day</li>
            <li> I brought this for christmas and it came broke. I had to remove the mirror and tape the ceramic part to the housing to make the light bulb stay.if you turn it too much the ceramic brakes and the light bulb becomes unfastened.</li>
            <li> I can see everything with the light and 10x zoom. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Why spend up to or more than $100 for a natural light mirror, when the Sunter Natural Daylight Mirror can do everything those others can for a lot less.  My daughter wanted from a famous well known store seen at the malls that sells muscle relaxers, massaging chairs, electronic gadgets and expensive mirrors.  So for Christmas instead of buying her the $200 mirror I purchased this one and she was ticked pink and did not even know the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a gorgeous mirror and big.  The zoom is incredible and it is amazing (and sad) to see all the flaws and deep down dirt your skin holds when you see yourself under a natural light zoomed in at 10X magnification.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light bulb is replaceable, just unscrew the two screws and remove the mirror&#x27;s face.  It is just a 13-watt daylight compact fluorescent light bulb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror rotates easily, and the on and off switch works flawlessly.  The only thing I did not like is that the power cord is very short and I had to use an extension cord to be able to place it where I wanted to on my dresser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this mirror if you want to be able to pluck your eyebrows perfectly without missing a hair, applying a makeup flawlessly and being able to see every single blackhead, pore or imperfection on your face.  It is worth it!  Oh by the way, I paid only $35 for it from a third party seller with free shipping.</li>
            <li> I did not like the product. It worked for 5 minutes. The light burned out. It lead me believe that it was a used product that I had purchased. I payed postage to mail back. I did not get a refund for the postage I paid. Every dissatified</li>
            <li> Use it every morning. Helps in putting on makeup when you can&#x27;t wear your glasses.</li>
            <li> This is larger than I expected, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing.  It allows me to see my whole face and it magnifies to my expectations. But the light is not nearly as bright as my previous makeup mirror which makes tweezing hard for me to see.</li>
            <li> Very pleased, shipped fast.</li>
            <li> As others have posted, the light is not that bright but if you&#x27;re using it in a bathroom, it still works.  If the mirror is your only light source, you&#x27;re likely to be disappointed.  The magnifying side is awesome.  You can see EVERYTHING.  My eyebrows have never looked better!  This is truly a case of you get what you pay for.  I have a $100+ makeup mirror that I love but I couldn&#x27;t see spending that much for my daughter to take to college.  So this was a reasonably priced alternative.  It arrived on time and in one piece.  So we were both happy.</li>
            <li> Great product! Nice natural lighting. The only thing is when using the magnifying side you have to be real close for it to be clear. But, everything else is great. My husband even uses it!</li>
            <li> purchased for daughter and she seems happy with it</li>
            <li> This mirror is everything I&#x27;ve been looking for. It had the right height and lighting. I&#x27;m so glad I don&#x27;t have to keep searching.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror to replace a similar fluorescent one made by Conair, because the Conair mirror did not swivel. This mirror puts out a good amount of light compared to others I tried. The 10x side is amazing; I can see every tiny flaw without the need for glasses, and is very useful for putting on eye makeup and tweezing brows. My only criticism, and this is true of all 10x mirrors, is that you need to lean in very close to it; otherwise you will get a lot of distortion. When you want to step back and see your entire face without distortion, just flip the mirror over and use the 1x side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to add a word about fluorescent bulbs. The light can be a little harsh, but if you really want to see fine details, it works very well. The incandescent bulbs used in other makeup mirrors can be flattering, but don&#x27;t you want to see what you really look like when you go outside in bright sunlight or when you go to work at an office with fluorescent lighting?</li>
            <li> Just what my wife wanted.  Uses it every day and finds the double-sided feature very handy.  Nice design and size for a vanity.  Good seller!</li>
            <li> When it first arrived, I loved this mirror. It&#x27;s big, sturdy, gives off good light and I got it for 32$. However, I got to use it only TWICE before the light just died on me. How is that even possible???? From what I hear, there is no way to change the bulb (please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong on this one) and if I want a new one, it costs almost three time as much now. And no guarantee that the new one would last any longer. I&#x27;m very sorry I decided to buy this mirror. :( 13/3/2015-I am editing this review because I have since found out that indeed, the ligt bulb can be changed, so I added another 2 stars to my initial rating. Still I don&#x27;t find that it is ok to sell a product in which the bult lasts only two short uses. If someone buys this at the current price of over 80$, they deserve more than that.</li>
            <li> Nice looking, magnification good. I had one problem though. When I try to see with the light on. I couldn&#x27;t hardly see to do anything.  It&#x27;s like the mirror is to dim.&lt;br /&gt;I read other reviews to see if anyone else had this problem, no one seemed to.  If I&#x27;m doing something wrong could you please send me a note to let me know what I can do because with light on, I just can&#x27;t see my reflection hardly at all.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This mirror functions well, the light is excellent and the stand is heavy. It looks expensive. I was surprised by the quality for the price. It&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> Purchased this makeup mirror as a christmas present and it did not light up.  Apparently it was broken or defective.  So disappointing as it was given as a gift.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife who was never very wild about the lighting in our bathroom. She said it was not representative of natural light and that this could result in the &#x27;misapplication&#x27; of makeup; an unacceptable situation indeed. Well, this mirror was to suffice in lieu of a lighting and rewiring job in the powder room. As far as that goes the light on this mirror doesn&#x27;t seem to be quite as bright as it should be; it seems adequate to the bare minimum to me. Being naturally gorgeous I have no need of such things, thusly, I&#x27;m no expert on the subject. With that said, it seems underpowered. It loses another star because I&#x27;m willing to bet the purchase price, three times over, that the switch on this will go out before very long. It&#x27;s got a bunch of play in it and it feels cheap. It hasn&#x27;t failed yet, as we&#x27;ve only just got it and if it does fail in an untimely manner I&#x27;ll dock it in the ratings and edit this review. The rest of the unit seems sturdy enough with sufficient weight in the base to make it stable. It has a small footprint and stores well in what space we have. The light which is produced by the element in this thing is much more like natural light so it fits the bill there. My wife likes the way it looks and seems happy with the whole arrangement which is most important of all, because you can&#x27;t put a price on not being nagged. Three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/13/16: I have since upgraded the lighting in our master bath so this mirror and its light have since become outmoded for the purpose it was originally intended to fill. This was a stopgap measure from the start. That said, my wife still uses it and it has held up. The flimsy feeling switch was my primary cause for concern. Well, if anyone had taken me up on my bet, I would have lost. The thing is still going, my wife still likes it and while the light output is still less than optimum, it gets a fourth star.</li>
            <li> Sent it back. It&#x27;s huge--not in a good way. The base is not what is pictured. The lighting is too dim. It looks cheap. And, it wobbles.</li>
            <li> Great mirror love the 10x magnification,it has a nice satin nickel finish not clear in pictures.  I had to put it on a couple books on my dresser so I didn&#x27;t have to bend down to look in it . A practical wall mount version would be great. Daylight is great but I have seen some other mirrors that do several different lights but I wonder how well they work.</li>
