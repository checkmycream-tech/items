            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>, i love it</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my favorite of all.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend even if it was free!</li>
            <li>I love GOT2Be.</li>
            <li>My hair is always way softer and much more manageable when I use it.</li>

            <li>Pretty fast shipping and great product</li>
            <li>Wish it was sleek and not so huge.</li>
            <li>later i am happy bye</li>
            <li>I use John Frieda&#x27;s smooth creme and have been for years.</li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron oil.</li>
            <li>everything its ok thank you very much</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, sweet smell, glides through the hair smoothly, and doesn&#x27;t really give me any undesired side effects when used properly.</li>
            <li>Sexy short hair products are much better and do work.  </li>
            <li>my only concern was the handling time but everything else was ok!</li>
            <li>After reading many customer reviews on different blow dryer/flat iron lotions, I chose this one, and I&#x27;m not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>Made my hair sticky and did hot protect my hair at all.</li>
            <li>other economical straightening product has ever really done the trick as effectively as this one, at least for me, and my hair tends to frizz very easily.</li>
            <li>I used this product as directed, but my results weren&#x27;t very sleek.  </li>
            <li>Rusk temperature products really make your hair shiny and protect your hair.</li>
            <li>but after that, everything&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product if you want something efficient and are on a budget!</li>
            <li>really helps keep my curly hair straighter and smoother.</li>
            <li>I really like this product it really works.</li>
            <li>It is far better than several salon products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>They leave my fine hair feeling dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my othewise dry, thin air feel great</li>
            <li>Do not waste you money on this.</li>
            <li>When I use this product before I blow dry my hair, it actually helps straighten it enough and take enough frizz out that most of the time, I dont even have a need to straighten my hair with my straightener afterwards.</li>
            <li>, i have thick wavy hair and when i use this with my flat iron it leaves my hair straight, shiny, and it smells amazing people actually compliment me on my perfume and its actually this product</li>
            <li>Because i live in south Florida, i deal with humidity and sweat a lot, and so i do have to occasionally flat iron the roots again in the mornings after having worn the product the day before,</li>
            <li>Perhaps it protected my hair form the damaging effects of the heat of the blow dryer, but other than that, It didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li>After following the directions, this product left my hair soft, shiny, and maneageable.  </li>
            <li>After just one use of this with my regular blow dry and flat iron routine, my hair is back to feeling soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I flat iron after every wash and after a while not using anything while flat ironing my hair was getting fairly dry.</li>

            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the bottle it comes in, the shape is hard to hold and the spray handle is really small.</li>
            <li> I put it in just after my hair is towel dried.  </li>
            <li> wasted 6 bucks on this at Walgreens.</li>

            <li> The bottle is a little awkward to use, sometimes hard to squeez the product out.</li>

            <li> I picked up this product randomly from my local CVS around 4 years back. I&#x27;ve tried every other brand on the market include bed head, CHI, fekkai, Redken/ Joico but i always come back to this. My only complaint is the size of the bottle. Wish it was sleek and not so huge.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time! Its amazing, i have thick wavy hair and when i use this with my flat iron it leaves my hair straight, shiny, and it smells amazing people actually compliment me on my perfume and its actually this product so yeah its a great product and its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> this stuff is wonderful!  It makes my othewise dry, thin air feel great and it does not look/feel greasy!  It is far better than several salon products I have tried.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair. I bought this after seeing a review for it on YouTube so I thought I would give it a shot. When I use this product before I blow dry my hair, it actually helps straighten it enough and take enough frizz out that most of the time, I dont even have a need to straighten my hair with my straightener afterwards. This works great!</li>
            <li> It was a very good product at a very nice price. my only concern was the handling time but everything else was ok!</li>
            <li> I used this product as directed, but my results weren&#x27;t very sleek.  Perhaps it protected my hair form the damaging effects of the heat of the blow dryer, but other than that, It didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because there&#x27;s always room for improvement and I haven&#x27;t tried everything else out there.  My hair is very fine and prone to flyaways.  After following the directions, this product left my hair soft, shiny, and maneageable.  It also smells nice and citrusy.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other products out there, but they just don&#x27;t compare.  They leave my fine hair feeling dry and brittle.  Not this little beauty!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair silky and thicker!  I put it in just after my hair is towel dried.  Adds a nice sheen and protects hair from dryer and straightener.</li>
            <li> After reading many customer reviews on different blow dryer/flat iron lotions, I chose this one, and I&#x27;m not disappointed at all. I have super processed hair, so it&#x27;s pretty frizzy on a good day and needs all the help it can get. I flat iron after every wash and after a while not using anything while flat ironing my hair was getting fairly dry. After just one use of this with my regular blow dry and flat iron routine, my hair is back to feeling soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the bottle it comes in, the shape is hard to hold and the spray handle is really small. I&#x27;ll be getting a different spray bottle to put it in to fix that. But this isn&#x27;t enough of an issue for me to drop my rating.</li>
            <li> Great product.  At a good price. I am very glad that I purchased this item.  I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very soft. helped keep away my frizz. I don&#x27;t know how well it worked for protecting it, but it made my hair look very nice</li>
            <li> everything its ok thank you very much, i love it i will recommend see you later i am happy bye</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. Made my hair sticky and did hot protect my hair at all. Sexy short hair products are much better and do work.  Rusk temperature products really make your hair shiny and protect your hair. That&#x27;s my favorite of all. Good luck. Hope this helped</li>
            <li> I have really thick, unruly hair and i gotta say, when i need that extra sleek look for my relaxed hair (especially in between relaxers when my hair starts going curly) i turn to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No other economical straightening product has ever really done the trick as effectively as this one, at least for me, and my hair tends to frizz very easily. It has a pleasant, sweet smell, glides through the hair smoothly, and doesn&#x27;t really give me any undesired side effects when used properly. Because i live in south Florida, i deal with humidity and sweat a lot, and so i do have to occasionally flat iron the roots again in the mornings after having worn the product the day before, but after that, everything&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product if you want something efficient and are on a budget!</li>
            <li> I like the smell of the product and I like the concept but it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave my hair any straighter after flat-ironing than it was before.  It does help with the frizz a bit.</li>
            <li> Great product....really helps keep my curly hair straighter and smoother.</li>
            <li> I threw mine out.  It made my hair feel sticky and dry.  I use John Frieda&#x27;s smooth creme and have been for years. I went back to it.  Would not recommend even if it was free!</li>
            <li> Made my skull itchy and my hair dry. It does nothing to protect against humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasted 6 bucks on this at Walgreens. Do not waste you money on this.</li>
            <li> Pretty fast shipping and great product - this stuff helps me flat iron my daughter&#x27;s hair brilliantly. I love this stuff! Thx!</li>
            <li> very good benefit/price ratio excellent deal good product. Design and quality are great, so far very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love GOT2Be. This is a great flat iron oil. My hair is always way softer and much more manageable when I use it. I would recommend it to anyone who heat styles their hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product it really works. Although I wish I could find a flat iron that works with larger amounts of hair.</li>
            <li> I like this product and it works well for my long, thick, coarse hair.  I would compare it to its a 10 miracle leave in treatment.  The bottle is a little awkward to use, sometimes hard to squeez the product out.</li>
            <li> it helps with volume and puffiness</li>
            <li> The container is not easy to spray and after brushing your hair it leaves white scams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not very charming for your look.</li>
