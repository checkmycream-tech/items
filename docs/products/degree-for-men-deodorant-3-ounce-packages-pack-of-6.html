            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d like to give it 1.5 stars because it may be great for some people</li>
            <li>Everything was great and without problem.</li>
            <li>great price &amp; great product</li>
            <li>One thing it doesn&#x27;t have, that&#x27;s all to the good, is aluminum chlorhydrate</li>
            <li>Really good product for the price.</li>
            <li>Good deodorant, lasts a while.</li>
            <li>Though it did arrive on time and it was in good shape.</li>

            <li>, I am very glad I did.</li>
            <li>The ease of ordering these was so easy, and the price was great.</li>
            <li>I was cautiously optimistic but I had to give this an honest try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not knocking the product, or the fact that amazon sells these things in bundles now (since I can&#x27;t find this kind in the stores anyway), but when you give the impression that $14.82 is a \\&quot;steal\\&quot;, one stick of these at Walmart costs $2.47.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice, I don&#x27;t sweat and it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li>is effective.</li>
            <li>and i haven&#x27;t smelled my own body odor since i started using it</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, but not too over powering.</li>
            <li>And it works good too, not as effective as aluminum, but okay by me.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have time to get more from the store in the morning ever again! :)</li>
            <li>Price is so good, like buy 3 get 3 free.</li>
            <li>This deodorant offers excellent odor and perspiration protection.</li>
            <li>This is ideal for the guy that just wants to have deodorant on hand.  </li>
            <li>Degree for Men Fresh Deodorant, Cool Impact - Nice product!!</li>
            <li>This is a great product and it REALLY works on my Army husband who sweats NON-STOP!</li>
            <li>he was really excited because it works really well and smells great!</li>
            <li>most people dont&#x27; know you can buy it like this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good, useful deodorant that does what it promises.</li>
            <li>When I smelled that dress the next day it smelled great!</li>
            <li>love this stuff and would confidently recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>anyone can tell me what to put on this rash to stop the itching, I&#x27;ll buy you a case of your favorite beer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better yet it won&#x27;t be interfering with your cologne if you happen to wear some.</li>
            <li>Cheap!</li>
            <li>I am allergic to most deodorants, but this one works and does not itch me.  </li>
            <li>I love this deodorant because it works as it should.</li>
            <li>I would probably consider ordering more of these, too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many before finding this one about two years ago.</li>
            <li>It ruined more shirts than I can say.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not generally attracted to stick deodorants but this one was offered as a multipack at a very attractive price.</li>
            <li>But nonetheless I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still available somewhere.</li>
            <li>, this is a case of a technology that sounds good on paper (silver molecules to kill odor causing bacteria) but that does not work in the real world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was easy to work with this shipper.</li>
            <li>It has strong scent</li>
            <li>its good to feel refresh smelling like a new  men  </li>
            <li>It has a cool refreshing feeling when you put it on, Last all day and also great when doing all sorts of activities.</li>
            <li>product also smells good, goes on easily with no flakes, and, to my knowledge thus far, hasn&#x27;t stained any of my clothing at all.</li>
            <li>Also wish they would make a fragrant free one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve probably used every brand on the market (I&#x27;m cheap, so I buy whatever&#x27;s on sale).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works all day for us, I suppose there is something to the silver ion component, and we are reluctant to use aluminum filled antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>I have used this brand before and it was a white powder which worked great.</li>
            <li>My husband &amp; I  went aluminum free in April.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>This was as cheap as Costco and I didn&#x27;t have to drive anywhere to get it.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite kind of deodorant, and this particular scent (Cool Impact) isn&#x27;t available in the stores near us.</li>
            <li>Design on this compound is full of air so that one swipe requires advancing the stick</li>
            <li>I also like the sense of cool.</li>
            <li>Although your pit will smell good, no one will have to smell the \\&quot;cool impact\\&quot; scent standing next to you.</li>
            <li>One person rated this as a one star product due to a rash but I am happy to say that I have not gotten any rashes and i have been using it for about six months now.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is just my PH, but I travel a lot and have consequently been stuck buying deodorant in many places and using many different brands....</li>
            <li>The deodorant has a mild scent.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, my girlfriend was meeting me out here, so she brought me the six pack.</li>
            <li>That said, this is still a solid product and you may find it works better for you (seems some deodorants work better on some people).</li>
            <li>This goes on easily and lasts all day, it&#x27;s perfect for anytime of the year, and even better during hard physical labor and summer heat...</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite deodorant, keeps me fresh and cool all day.  </li>
            <li>I shower, get fresh to death and put on some Degree</li>
            <li>Works well, but is not as good as I had expected.  </li>
            <li>Old spice would carry me from 7am through to the evening, but this stuff wears out by 3pm or so, and for someone who spends most of his work days at a computer desk, this is unacceptable.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon was great at actually comes in the full 3 ounce size, not the 2.7ounce size that Costco sells for around the same price.</li>
            <li>If you wanna make this a good deal, you should probably bump it down a couple dollars because once Walmart decides to restock on this specific kind (if they do at all)</li>
            <li>I have thrown out so many beautiful tops and bras because I have been unable to remove the lingering odor in them even after laundering.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this keeps me dry and smelling great, no irritation.  </li>
            <li>I have used multiple variations of their deodorants and honestly so far can recommend them all as good.</li>
            <li>tried Degree Dry Protection and found it effective and affordable.</li>
            <li>The price is equivalent to Walmart&#x27;s, if you live in one of the states that charges Amazon sales tax (boo!!!</li>
            <li>Being able to buy several at once, at a substantial discount and have them delivered with no cost, raises its value.</li>
            <li>Put it on for the first time after taking a shower in morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many regular deodorants</li>
            <li>I used this deodorant recently with one of my favorite dresses to my company&#x27;s Christmas party.</li>
            <li>, I might be better off taking my business back to them.</li>
            <li>This helps me stay smelling fresh, even though it doesn&#x27;t really keep me from sweating.  </li>
            <li>He tried many different deodorants  before going to an an aluminum free version of his old deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Left stains on favorite shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to see that Amazon is stocking this as I can not find it in my local stores.</li>
            <li>I have used degree on several occasions, but more often then night</li>
            <li>I formed a huge red rash wherever the product touched.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like to smell like pine boughs or sandal wood or whatever flavour the manufacturer feels</li>
            <li>Thanks guys.    </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to move on with my day.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it smells and the fact that I don&#x27;t have to feel the pain and discomfort associated with the antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it uses silver instead of aluminum.</li>
            <li>This caused an allergic reaction with a very itchy rash.&lt;br /&gt;(If</li>
            <li>Okay, but Old Spice is much better at least for me.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like it.  </li>
            <li>and it really lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>but I am very displeased.  </li>
            <li>Then powder your underarms and this will hold you until you can get home and take a shower and apply a real deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I came home I noticed that my dress had that all too familiar \\&quot;smell\\&quot; to it that told me the deodorant was on its last leg.</li>
            <li>It applies clean without leaving white &amp;#34;globby&amp;#34; build-up.</li>
            <li>Thankfully the odor is not entirely masculine, as they do not make an aluminum free version for the ladies.</li>
            <li>Only reason I purchased this pack on here is because like I said, it seems they&#x27;ve discontinued the Cool Impact in every store.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing degree for close to 7 years and needed to get some Cool Impact for my armpits as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>my pits are stinking to high heaven.</li>
            <li>get it and you wont have to waste time going to the store when you run out like most people would...</li>
            <li>I normally use Degree&amp;#34;dry protection&amp;#34; and that stuff keeps my pits frsh ALL day.</li>
            <li>In an effort to become more green, I decided to dump the aerosol can and go with this product.</li>
            <li>Degree Dry Protection kept me odor free for 36 hours on those days where I worked double shifts, and kept me odor free through my daily workouts.</li>
            <li>My husband used this and noticed right away that it wasn&#x27;t lasting all day and felt that he stunk.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to drive to get it, or traipse over to the other side of the huge store.</li>
            <li>After realizing that Degree was not sold in stores where I live, I was devastated.</li>
            <li>As far as its sweat protection, I haven&#x27;t had any issues during my daily routine and it keeps the smell fresh even when I am working out.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The reason I wanted to try this version was that the Dry Protection left residue on my clothing that was difficult to wash out, and the new Degree promised to be more effective and with no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I live in a hot part of the country and a little sweat actually helps my system keep my core temperature cool.</li>
            <li>I meant to buy Antiperspirant and when this arrived I was almost ready to return it as I&#x27;ve never had good luck with plain deodorant in the past.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about their claims for a \\&quot;cool impact\\&quot; but I am certain it worked well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though many people say that it works for them, I find that hard to believe.</li>
            <li>I got tired of paying 3-5 bucks, I saw it here as a 6 pack together for an amazing price.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for a person with sensitive skin and it is working well and not causing any sort of problematic reactions.</li>
            <li>As far as longevity, it&#x27;s not up to par with Old Spice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing that the \\&quot;Time Releasing Molecules\\&quot; are timed to completely dissolve the product and leave you stinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never had any problem with deodorants but this one is very itchy for my skin and last up to</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the old powder-fresh mens degree semi-solid is made anymore.  </li>
            <li>it stands, this product gets ZERO stars for being completely ineffective and for selling an untried technology in their silver time release molecules.</li>
            <li>I have been using old spice for years and wanted to change it up.</li>
            <li>five hours later I could not lift my arms up without knocking myself nearly unconscious with the stench!!!  </li>
            <li>(I perspire a fair amount); and it is so hard to find any deodorant-only (I&#x27;m not interested in an antiperspirant).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I actually had to go out and buy another brand of deodorant with a full bottle left of the Degree, because it simply wasn&#x27;t doing its job.</li>
            <li>The main reason I bought this is because using antiperspirant makes my underarm red &amp; irritated.  </li>
            <li>Last long, worth the money.</li>
            <li>Despite the promise &amp;#34;Leaves absolutely zero blue or green stains,&amp;#34; this left a blue stain on one of my favorite shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Prior to purchasing this, I had been buying a different scent of this Degree silver ion deodorant from a local retail chain which lasted much longer and did a better job of eliminating odors, especially when active.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a big guy, so I can live with that.</li>
            <li>When you get to the end of the product the threaded feed mechanism comes apart before you have used it all up, exacerbating what I believe is less useful product.</li>
            <li>I will try out old spice next.</li>
            <li>works well for people who sweat alot or work n play hard every day please buy this item  thanks !!!</li>
            <li>I have little occasion for heavy sweating, so,this product that makes the claim that it increases protection when your body heat rises, should be able to handle my situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used other brands but when the other brands changed their formulations, the deodorant stopped working for me, and caused me to try out many other products, looking for one that worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a bluish clear solid (similar to Mennen Speed Stick) not a white solid.</li>
            <li>I used to use Old Spice brand, white powdered stick deodorant for a long time.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and not over the top, no more white crap on my shirts</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It ruined more shirts than I can say.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not generally attracted to stick deodorants but this one was offered as a multipack at a very attractive price.</li>
            <li> But nonetheless I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still available somewhere.</li>
            <li> , this is a case of a technology that sounds good on paper (silver molecules to kill odor causing bacteria) but that does not work in the real world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was easy to work with this shipper.</li>
            <li> It has strong scent</li>
            <li> its good to feel refresh smelling like a new  men  </li>
            <li> It has a cool refreshing feeling when you put it on, Last all day and also great when doing all sorts of activities.</li>
            <li> product also smells good, goes on easily with no flakes, and, to my knowledge thus far, hasn&#x27;t stained any of my clothing at all.</li>
            <li> Also wish they would make a fragrant free one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably used every brand on the market (I&#x27;m cheap, so I buy whatever&#x27;s on sale).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works all day for us, I suppose there is something to the silver ion component, and we are reluctant to use aluminum filled antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand before and it was a white powder which worked great.</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I  went aluminum free in April.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This was as cheap as Costco and I didn&#x27;t have to drive anywhere to get it.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite kind of deodorant, and this particular scent (Cool Impact) isn&#x27;t available in the stores near us.</li>
            <li> Design on this compound is full of air so that one swipe requires advancing the stick</li>
            <li> I also like the sense of cool.</li>
            <li> Although your pit will smell good, no one will have to smell the \\&quot;cool impact\\&quot; scent standing next to you.</li>
            <li> One person rated this as a one star product due to a rash but I am happy to say that I have not gotten any rashes and i have been using it for about six months now.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is just my PH, but I travel a lot and have consequently been stuck buying deodorant in many places and using many different brands....</li>
            <li> The deodorant has a mild scent.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, my girlfriend was meeting me out here, so she brought me the six pack.</li>
            <li> That said, this is still a solid product and you may find it works better for you (seems some deodorants work better on some people).</li>
            <li> This goes on easily and lasts all day, it&#x27;s perfect for anytime of the year, and even better during hard physical labor and summer heat...</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite deodorant, keeps me fresh and cool all day.  </li>
            <li> I shower, get fresh to death and put on some Degree</li>
            <li> Works well, but is not as good as I had expected.  </li>
            <li> Old spice would carry me from 7am through to the evening, but this stuff wears out by 3pm or so, and for someone who spends most of his work days at a computer desk, this is unacceptable.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon was great at actually comes in the full 3 ounce size, not the 2.7ounce size that Costco sells for around the same price.</li>
            <li> If you wanna make this a good deal, you should probably bump it down a couple dollars because once Walmart decides to restock on this specific kind (if they do at all)</li>
            <li> I have thrown out so many beautiful tops and bras because I have been unable to remove the lingering odor in them even after laundering.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this keeps me dry and smelling great, no irritation.  </li>
            <li> I have used multiple variations of their deodorants and honestly so far can recommend them all as good.</li>
            <li> tried Degree Dry Protection and found it effective and affordable.</li>
            <li> The price is equivalent to Walmart&#x27;s, if you live in one of the states that charges Amazon sales tax (boo!!!</li>
            <li> Being able to buy several at once, at a substantial discount and have them delivered with no cost, raises its value.</li>
            <li> Put it on for the first time after taking a shower in morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many regular deodorants</li>
            <li> I used this deodorant recently with one of my favorite dresses to my company&#x27;s Christmas party.</li>
            <li> , I might be better off taking my business back to them.</li>
            <li> This helps me stay smelling fresh, even though it doesn&#x27;t really keep me from sweating.  </li>
            <li> He tried many different deodorants  before going to an an aluminum free version of his old deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Left stains on favorite shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to see that Amazon is stocking this as I can not find it in my local stores.</li>
            <li> I have used degree on several occasions, but more often then night</li>
            <li> I formed a huge red rash wherever the product touched.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like to smell like pine boughs or sandal wood or whatever flavour the manufacturer feels</li>
            <li> Thanks guys.    </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to move on with my day.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it smells and the fact that I don&#x27;t have to feel the pain and discomfort associated with the antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it uses silver instead of aluminum.</li>
            <li> This caused an allergic reaction with a very itchy rash.&lt;br /&gt;(If</li>
            <li> Okay, but Old Spice is much better at least for me.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like it.  </li>
            <li> and it really lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> but I am very displeased.  </li>
            <li> Then powder your underarms and this will hold you until you can get home and take a shower and apply a real deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I came home I noticed that my dress had that all too familiar \\&quot;smell\\&quot; to it that told me the deodorant was on its last leg.</li>
            <li> It applies clean without leaving white &amp;#34;globby&amp;#34; build-up.</li>
            <li> Thankfully the odor is not entirely masculine, as they do not make an aluminum free version for the ladies.</li>
            <li> Only reason I purchased this pack on here is because like I said, it seems they&#x27;ve discontinued the Cool Impact in every store.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing degree for close to 7 years and needed to get some Cool Impact for my armpits as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> my pits are stinking to high heaven.</li>
            <li> get it and you wont have to waste time going to the store when you run out like most people would...</li>
            <li> I normally use Degree&amp;#34;dry protection&amp;#34; and that stuff keeps my pits frsh ALL day.</li>
            <li> In an effort to become more green, I decided to dump the aerosol can and go with this product.</li>
            <li> Degree Dry Protection kept me odor free for 36 hours on those days where I worked double shifts, and kept me odor free through my daily workouts.</li>
            <li> My husband used this and noticed right away that it wasn&#x27;t lasting all day and felt that he stunk.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to drive to get it, or traipse over to the other side of the huge store.</li>
            <li> After realizing that Degree was not sold in stores where I live, I was devastated.</li>
            <li> As far as its sweat protection, I haven&#x27;t had any issues during my daily routine and it keeps the smell fresh even when I am working out.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The reason I wanted to try this version was that the Dry Protection left residue on my clothing that was difficult to wash out, and the new Degree promised to be more effective and with no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I live in a hot part of the country and a little sweat actually helps my system keep my core temperature cool.</li>
            <li> I meant to buy Antiperspirant and when this arrived I was almost ready to return it as I&#x27;ve never had good luck with plain deodorant in the past.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about their claims for a \\&quot;cool impact\\&quot; but I am certain it worked well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though many people say that it works for them, I find that hard to believe.</li>
            <li> I got tired of paying 3-5 bucks, I saw it here as a 6 pack together for an amazing price.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for a person with sensitive skin and it is working well and not causing any sort of problematic reactions.</li>
            <li> As far as longevity, it&#x27;s not up to par with Old Spice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that the \\&quot;Time Releasing Molecules\\&quot; are timed to completely dissolve the product and leave you stinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never had any problem with deodorants but this one is very itchy for my skin and last up to</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the old powder-fresh mens degree semi-solid is made anymore.  </li>
            <li> it stands, this product gets ZERO stars for being completely ineffective and for selling an untried technology in their silver time release molecules.</li>
            <li> I have been using old spice for years and wanted to change it up.</li>
            <li> five hours later I could not lift my arms up without knocking myself nearly unconscious with the stench!!!  </li>
            <li> (I perspire a fair amount); and it is so hard to find any deodorant-only (I&#x27;m not interested in an antiperspirant).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I actually had to go out and buy another brand of deodorant with a full bottle left of the Degree, because it simply wasn&#x27;t doing its job.</li>
            <li> The main reason I bought this is because using antiperspirant makes my underarm red &amp; irritated.  </li>
            <li> Last long, worth the money.</li>
            <li> Despite the promise &amp;#34;Leaves absolutely zero blue or green stains,&amp;#34; this left a blue stain on one of my favorite shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing this, I had been buying a different scent of this Degree silver ion deodorant from a local retail chain which lasted much longer and did a better job of eliminating odors, especially when active.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a big guy, so I can live with that.</li>
            <li> When you get to the end of the product the threaded feed mechanism comes apart before you have used it all up, exacerbating what I believe is less useful product.</li>
            <li> I will try out old spice next.</li>
            <li> works well for people who sweat alot or work n play hard every day please buy this item  thanks !!!</li>
            <li> I have little occasion for heavy sweating, so,this product that makes the claim that it increases protection when your body heat rises, should be able to handle my situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used other brands but when the other brands changed their formulations, the deodorant stopped working for me, and caused me to try out many other products, looking for one that worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a bluish clear solid (similar to Mennen Speed Stick) not a white solid.</li>
            <li> I used to use Old Spice brand, white powdered stick deodorant for a long time.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and not over the top, no more white crap on my shirts</li>
            <li> I developed an allergy to Aluminum and tried all the other deodorants on the market and Silver Ion is the only one that works.  </li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to the other brands extra strength, I would probably stay away from this one.</li>
            <li> Other deodorant brands like adidas, old spice, axe etc just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> This deodorant does not last long enough to get me through a day at my desk.</li>
            <li> While I have not measured it, the product does not seem to last as long as Mennen brands I have used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to open and use, has a wide swath to get your whole under arm at one time and-this may strike  some as vulgar-</li>
            <li> Whereas I put the Dry version on at 0500 one morning, and could work without stopping to shower until well into the night the following day, with this Degree</li>
            <li> The ingredients, applicator, composition of the actual deodorant solid, smell and other factors are all inferior to the Dry Protection \\&quot;solid\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have been for a long time</li>
            <li> and I am still fresh into my 3 or 4 game.</li>
            <li> down fall is that this is a blue gel (not a solid powder)</li>
            <li> and they just never lasted very long.</li>
            <li> but i dont mind because it keeps my arm pits dry</li>
            <li> Were it not for the residue the Dry Protection leaves, I would give THAT product five</li>
            <li> I will probably go back to the one I had been buying previously once I have used up this 6 pack.  </li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, I can wear my socks for a couple of days with absolutely no problem.</li>
            <li> It has become harder to find this deodorant with out Anti-Perspirant.  </li>
            <li> The scent only lasts for a few hours.</li>
            <li> but I have not had any wet stains.</li>
            <li> Certainly not deodorant.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is not good enough to purchase a second time.</li>
            <li> but, if your an active man, I would have to say this is not strong enough at all.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant seems to have alcohol or some other ingredient that irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the other stuff.  </li>
            <li> But I was out of my regular stuff and was feeling lazy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this happen to my armpit with any other Degree products, or even any other deodorant.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, if you have allergies or skin irritation due to silver, you&#x27;ll have some problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing something other than Old Spice (using it for as long as I can remember)</li>
            <li> I immediately put the dress in the washing machine&#x27;s gentle cycle with cold water, laid it out to dry, and crossed my fingers.</li>
            <li> This product has no aluminum, so if you have allergies or skin irritation due to aluminium, this product can help!</li>
            <li> Degree version, especially compared to the Dry Protection, is useless.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sweat abnormally heavy, so I can&#x27;t make a recommendation for a person who&#x27;s sweating</li>
            <li> It usually fails in the early afternoon and by evening time it is as if I had nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other then a random personal reaction to the product, it does work.</li>
            <li> I think that a fragrance is not strong from the commodity until now.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t randomly drip like some of the other brands might and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is not a good product for an active man.  </li>
            <li> I was almost out  of my usual deodorant and had to make a purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the product or my skin, but my armpit has become puffy and flakes as if I&#x27;m recovering from sunburn.</li>
            <li> And I am usually a fan of Degree.</li>
            <li> Hope they continue to make it, as it is hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> when out of the shower &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; after a hard days work .... this does works</li>
            <li> I always buy this Deoderant -- as I was an Athlete, I used to sweat like crazy, but then this Deoderant would last the sweat</li>
            <li> /&gt;The fact that I bought a six pack of these things is the least of my worries now.</li>
            <li> My son is using it now and it has not affected him in a negative way yet though.</li>
            <li> This actually makes me smell bad and gave me a rash.</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks!</li>
            <li> My first thought was to describe this product as \\&quot;one of the worst deodorants</li>
            <li> &quot; but I realized that would be unfair - unfair to the other deodorants that are not as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I speak of an itch so irritating that it felt as if I had rubbed poison Ivy under my arms.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find a deodorant without antiperspirant properties.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> When I contacted the company regarding their bad product, they sent me coupons rather than issuing a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to try this out and am EXTREMELY disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> This crap does not work!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not one of the worst deodorants I have ever used, it IS the worst deodorant I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was terrible for us!</li>
            <li> My underarms hated it!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> most people dont&#x27; know you can buy it like this, I do....get it and you wont have to waste time going to the store when you run out like most people would...I get the every six month sub thing where they send you another 6 every six months...great stuff...I will never run into a situation where I run out and I don&#x27;t have time to get more from the store in the morning ever again! :)</li>
            <li> Ever since Degree came out with the silver ion technology, I can snuggle in bed with my husband without the smell driving me away!  This is a great product and it REALLY works on my Army husband who sweats NON-STOP!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not generally attracted to stick deodorants but this one was offered as a multipack at a very attractive price. I&#x27;m not sure about their claims for a \\&quot;cool impact\\&quot; but I am certain it worked well. One thing it doesn&#x27;t have, that&#x27;s all to the good, is aluminum chlorhydrate the ingredient that will make your arm pit look like your mouth just took a bite of alum. I live in a hot part of the country and a little sweat actually helps my system keep my core temperature cool. It&#x27;s easy to open and use, has a wide swath to get your whole under arm at one time and-this may strike  some as vulgar-it doesn&#x27;t mat the hair under your arms. You could go to any big box store where deodorants are sold and this would be one you might consider. Being able to buy several at once, at a substantial discount and have them delivered with no cost, raises its value. It&#x27;s unscented-which is probably why they say it&#x27;s for men-and that&#x27;s a plus to me. I don&#x27;t really like to smell like pine boughs or sandal wood or whatever flavour the manufacturer feels is manly. It&#x27;s a good, useful deodorant that does what it promises. And that&#x27;s quite enough.</li>
            <li> I always buy this Deoderant -- as I was an Athlete, I used to sweat like crazy, but then this Deoderant would last the sweat and I still wouldn&#x27;t stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the formula changed or something and now it doesn&#x27;t last. My arm pits get wet (it didn&#x27;t before with the old formula), and the smell isn&#x27;t lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would look to something else. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Put it on for the first time after taking a shower in morning. Then I sat inside studying, air conditioning at 72, five hours later I could not lift my arms up without knocking myself nearly unconscious with the stench!!!  Maybe it is just my PH, but I travel a lot and have consequently been stuck buying deodorant in many places and using many different brands....never a reaction like this before.</li>
            <li> Leaves me itching all day...</li>
            <li> I developed an allergy to Aluminum and tried all the other deodorants on the market and Silver Ion is the only one that works.  It isn&#x27;t as good as the aluminum based ones, but still the best alternative.  Hope they continue to make it, as it is hard to find in stores.  Also wish they would make a fragrant free one.</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks! I normally use Degree&amp;#34;dry protection&amp;#34; and that stuff keeps my pits frsh ALL day. I picked up this stuff because it was on sale after my regular Degree ran out. I take a shower and slather this on and an hour later my pits are stinking to high heaven. This crap does not work! learned my lesson...will stick to the version that works.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Degree, but this deodorant is faulty.  I thought it was just my skin, but when I gave the product to my son, he had the same experience. I speak of an itch so irritating that it felt as if I had rubbed poison Ivy under my arms. Avoid this stuff like the plague.</li>
            <li> Some of us have issues with smelly feet. Not me. As a matter of fact, I can wear my socks for a couple of days with absolutely no problem. But when it comes to my pits I have been cursed! I have thrown out so many beautiful tops and bras because I have been unable to remove the lingering odor in them even after laundering. I had resigned myself to this and just made the best of it. I&#x27;ve tried so many regular deodorants and they just never lasted very long. It was embarrassing!&lt;br /&gt;My husband heard about Degree&#x27;s Silver Ion Technology and bought a two-pack. Both he and I avoid using antiperspirant as much as possible because of its aluminum content. I was cautiously optimistic but I had to give this an honest try. Wow! I am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Because I move around alot on the job, I do bring my Degree to work with me and reapply about two-thirds of the way into my workday if I sense that the \\&quot;clean\\&quot; smell is fading. I used this deodorant recently with one of my favorite dresses to my company&#x27;s Christmas party. I danced and danced and worked up a bit of a sweat. When I came home I noticed that my dress had that all too familiar \\&quot;smell\\&quot; to it that told me the deodorant was on its last leg. I immediately put the dress in the washing machine&#x27;s gentle cycle with cold water, laid it out to dry, and crossed my fingers. When I smelled that dress the next day it smelled great! No lingering B.O. odor whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff and would confidently recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not knocking the product, or the fact that amazon sells these things in bundles now (since I can&#x27;t find this kind in the stores anyway), but when you give the impression that $14.82 is a \\&quot;steal\\&quot;, one stick of these at Walmart costs $2.47. You do that times 6 sticks and you&#x27;re back at the price you&#x27;re paying for on here, and you still gotta cover shipping, which takes you to 21 and some change. If you wanna make this a good deal, you should probably bump it down a couple dollars because once Walmart decides to restock on this specific kind (if they do at all), I might be better off taking my business back to them. Only reason I purchased this pack on here is because like I said, it seems they&#x27;ve discontinued the Cool Impact in every store. But nonetheless I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still available somewhere.</li>
            <li> It has become harder to find this deodorant with out Anti-Perspirant.  Amazon came through for me once again.  Thanks guys.    BTW: My daughter uses it too.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, when I wake up in the morning, my pits are kicking. I shower, get fresh to death and put on some Degree and I&#x27;m ready to move on with my day. I don&#x27;t think about smelling halfway through the day, and that&#x27;s the way it should be. This deodorant works.</li>
            <li> The main reason I bought this is because using antiperspirant makes my underarm red &amp; irritated.  This helps me stay smelling fresh, even though it doesn&#x27;t really keep me from sweating.  I really like the way it smells and the fact that I don&#x27;t have to feel the pain and discomfort associated with the antiperspirant.  I really like the fact that it uses silver instead of aluminum.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t need to go out and hunt for deodorant on sale for months.  Great product since I do a lot of workouts and sweat.</li>
            <li> This caused an allergic reaction with a very itchy rash.&lt;br /&gt;(If anyone can tell me what to put on this rash to stop the itching, I&#x27;ll buy you a case of your favorite beer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not allergic to anything. Certainly not deodorant. I&#x27;ve probably used every brand on the market (I&#x27;m cheap, so I buy whatever&#x27;s on sale).&lt;br /&gt;Degree products have always worked well so when I find a &amp;#34;good deal&amp;#34;, I stock up.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that I bought a six pack of these things is the least of my worries now. I just want the itching to stop.</li>
            <li> Works all day for us, I suppose there is something to the silver ion component, and we are reluctant to use aluminum filled antiperspirants. Thankfully the odor is not entirely masculine, as they do not make an aluminum free version for the ladies. If we could find that, it would be five star.  The price is equivalent to Walmart&#x27;s, if you live in one of the states that charges Amazon sales tax (boo!!! hiss!!!) for online sales, and you don&#x27;t have to drive to get it, or traipse over to the other side of the huge store.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for a person with sensitive skin and it is working well and not causing any sort of problematic reactions.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand before and it was a white powder which worked great. This deodorant seems to have alcohol or some other ingredient that irritates my skin. Had to stop using it</li>
            <li> I mainly only use Degree deodorant.  I have been for a long time and I have never had any complaints with them.  I have used multiple variations of their deodorants and honestly so far can recommend them all as good.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the degree men deodorant and have been for some time now. They don&#x27;t put overbearing scents in this product. Although your pit will smell good, no one will have to smell the \\&quot;cool impact\\&quot; scent standing next to you. Better yet it won&#x27;t be interfering with your cologne if you happen to wear some. As far as its sweat protection, I haven&#x27;t had any issues during my daily routine and it keeps the smell fresh even when I am working out. I don&#x27;t sweat abnormally heavy, so I can&#x27;t make a recommendation for a person who&#x27;s sweating is a medical issue. The price on Amazon was great at actually comes in the full 3 ounce size, not the 2.7ounce size that Costco sells for around the same price.</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I  went aluminum free in April.  He tried many different deodorants  before going to an an aluminum free version of his old deodorant.  He loves  it</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing something other than Old Spice (using it for as long as I can remember) but I have to say, it&#x27;s not that bad. The scent is nice, I don&#x27;t sweat and it was inexpensive. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase. As far as longevity, it&#x27;s not up to par with Old Spice. For me, it lasts between 10-12 hours and I&#x27;m a big guy, so I can live with that. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Design on this compound is full of air so that one swipe requires advancing the stick and voila it&#x27;s gone! NOT RECOMMENDED...</li>
            <li> The only deodorant my husband will use. We buy it in packages of 6 on Amazon. Cheap! You can&#x27;t miss.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most deodorants, but this one works and does not itch me.  I was having problems finding it in the local stores</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Degree for years.  The deodorant has a mild scent.  The best features are: no staining of shirts; seems to protect against odor (I perspire a fair amount); and it is so hard to find any deodorant-only (I&#x27;m not interested in an antiperspirant).</li>
            <li> Degree for Men Fresh Deodorant, Cool Impact - Nice product!! Last long, worth the money. Would recommend for sure!!! !</li>
            <li> This deodorant simply stops working in the middle of the day. I&#x27;m guessing that the \\&quot;Time Releasing Molecules\\&quot; are timed to completely dissolve the product and leave you stinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work in an air conditioned office. I have little occasion for heavy sweating, so,this product that makes the claim that it increases protection when your body heat rises, should be able to handle my situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually had to go out and buy another brand of deodorant with a full bottle left of the Degree, because it simply wasn&#x27;t doing its job. When I contacted the company regarding their bad product, they sent me coupons rather than issuing a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never purchase Degree products again.</li>
            <li> Okay, but Old Spice is much better at least for me.</li>
            <li> I think that a fragrance is not strong from the commodity until now. I also like the sense of cool.</li>
            <li> Works - it is deodorant - and I can sweat a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down fall is that this is a blue gel (not a solid powder) and I sometimes get a reaction to the blue gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other then a random personal reaction to the product, it does work.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this keeps me dry and smelling great, no irritation.  Recommend it to any man with skin problems or irritation issues.</li>
            <li> I like this fragrance and the deodorant is effective. While I have not measured it, the product does not seem to last as long as Mennen brands I have used. When you get to the end of the product the threaded feed mechanism comes apart before you have used it all up, exacerbating what I believe is less useful product.</li>
            <li> I moved to southeast Asia and discovered that my armpits sweat quite a bit so close to the equator. After realizing that Degree was not sold in stores where I live, I was devastated. I have been wearing degree for close to 7 years and needed to get some Cool Impact for my armpits as soon as possible. Luckily, my girlfriend was meeting me out here, so she brought me the six pack. My family and friends (and neighbors on the train) couldn&#x27;t have been happier! This deodorant kills the BO while lasting for hours. No need for anti-perspirant, that stuff just stains your shirts yellow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Degree!</li>
            <li> Really good product for the price. I was almost out  of my usual deodorant and had to make a purchase. This was as cheap as Costco and I didn&#x27;t have to drive anywhere to get it. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This actually makes me smell bad and gave me a rash. If you are sensitive to the other brands extra strength, I would probably stay away from this one. My son is using it now and it has not affected him in a negative way yet though.</li>
            <li> Other deodorant brands like adidas, old spice, axe etc just did not work for me. I love this deodorant because it works as it should. It has strong scent but i dont mind because it keeps my arm pits dry and i haven&#x27;t smelled my own body odor since i started using it haha. I will exclusively continue to use this specific deodorant. It doesn&#x27;t randomly drip like some of the other brands might and it lasts a long time. I only have to apply once a day. One person rated this as a one star product due to a rash but I am happy to say that I have not gotten any rashes and i have been using it for about six months now. I am really happy with this awesome product!</li>
            <li> The ease of ordering these was so easy, and the price was great. I would probably consider ordering more of these, too.</li>
            <li> Good deodorant, lasts a while. What else could you ask for. The smell is nice, but not too over powering.</li>
            <li> This is not the one that I needed. I need the white stick. This just does nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I like this Degree for the simple reason it&#x27;s just a deodorant and doesn&#x27;t contain an antiperspirant - which I don&#x27;t need.  Since this contains 6 units the price is very good as well.  A good value!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to find a deodorant without antiperspirant properties. I&#x27;ve tried many before finding this one about two years ago. It works great, smells good without being overwhelming, and I haven&#x27;t built up any sort of tolerance to it. Great product!</li>
            <li> I never had any problem with deodorants but this one is very itchy for my skin and last up to about 4-6 hours depends on the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;still great deal.</li>
            <li> Works well, but is not as good as I had expected.  Prior to purchasing this, I had been buying a different scent of this Degree silver ion deodorant from a local retail chain which lasted much longer and did a better job of eliminating odors, especially when active.  It&#x27;s basically the same product but with a different scent.  I will probably go back to the one I had been buying previously once I have used up this 6 pack.  That said, this is still a solid product and you may find it works better for you (seems some deodorants work better on some people).</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. The scent only lasts for a few hours. Very disappointed in this product. I had to buy another deodorant to replace this one.</li>
            <li> I have used Degree for years, but do not buy this at all.  It ruined more shirts than I can say.  Stick with the power version.</li>
            <li> I used to use Old Spice brand, white powdered stick deodorant for a long time. I saw this, and thought I would order and try it, I am very glad I did. This goes on easily and lasts all day, it&#x27;s perfect for anytime of the year, and even better during hard physical labor and summer heat...</li>
            <li> It has a cool refreshing feeling when you put it on, Last all day and also great when doing all sorts of activities. Sports, workouts and/or just relaxing.</li>
            <li> This is just deoderant.  Doesn&#x27;t have the other stuff.  I don&#x27;t really like it.  Though it did arrive on time and it was in good shape.</li>
            <li> I meant to buy Antiperspirant and when this arrived I was almost ready to return it as I&#x27;ve never had good luck with plain deodorant in the past.  But I was out of my regular stuff and was feeling lazy so I decided to give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really good.  The smell is nice and not over the top, no more white crap on my shirts and it really lasts all day.  I&#x27;ve been converted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the product or my skin, but my armpit has become puffy and flakes as if I&#x27;m recovering from sunburn. I&#x27;ve never had this happen to my armpit with any other Degree products, or even any other deodorant.</li>
            <li> where oh where did that stink go? It works. I put it on and I forget about it since it does the job</li>
            <li> ordered this for my boyfriend as a christmas present, because he couldn&#x27;t find this scent at any store in town. he was really excited because it works really well and smells great! the product arrived on time and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Left stains on favorite shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Degree (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ECQ4US/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3) for about 2 years.  I decided to try this out and am EXTREMELY disappointed.  Despite the promise &amp;#34;Leaves absolutely zero blue or green stains,&amp;#34; this left a blue stain on one of my favorite shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to give it 1.5 stars because it may be great for some people but I am very displeased.  I hope future versions can fulfill the promise but as for me I don&#x27;t plan on buying this every again.</li>
            <li> When I saw it had no aluminum, I wanted it. And it works good too, not as effective as aluminum, but okay by me. Price is so good, like buy 3 get 3 free. And no tax! Amazon, can you hear us? Keep it tax free baby!!!!!</li>
            <li> The men&#x27;s white solid version of this is (semi-solid, comes out thru holes in cap) was the bomb.  This one is a bit &#x27;greasy&#x27; when it comes out.  But, it works the same.  I don&#x27;t think the old powder-fresh mens degree semi-solid is made anymore.  Think it&#x27;s a women&#x27;s product now.</li>
            <li> My first thought was to describe this product as \\&quot;one of the worst deodorants ever\\&quot; but I realized that would be unfair - unfair to the other deodorants that are not as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not one of the worst deodorants I have ever used, it IS the worst deodorant I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a fan of Degree products for a while. I have used other brands but when the other brands changed their formulations, the deodorant stopped working for me, and caused me to try out many other products, looking for one that worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Degree Dry Protection and found it effective and affordable. So when I saw the \\&quot;new\\&quot; Degree, with bacteria fighting silver molecules, I thought this would be a step up. Then when I saw this was an invisible solid, and time-released, I took the plunge and bought an 8 pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Degree Dry Protection kept me odor free for 36 hours on those days where I worked double shifts, and kept me odor free through my daily workouts. The reason I wanted to try this version was that the Dry Protection left residue on my clothing that was difficult to wash out, and the new Degree promised to be more effective and with no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this is a case of a technology that sounds good on paper (silver molecules to kill odor causing bacteria) but that does not work in the real world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Degree version, especially compared to the Dry Protection, is useless. Whereas I put the Dry version on at 0500 one morning, and could work without stopping to shower until well into the night the following day, with this Degree I apply it at 0500 and by noon I am already smelling like I did not shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though many people say that it works for them, I find that hard to believe. The ingredients, applicator, composition of the actual deodorant solid, smell and other factors are all inferior to the Dry Protection \\&quot;solid\\&quot;. Were it not for the residue the Dry Protection leaves, I would give THAT product five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a trick for you. Once this deodorant stops working, if you are in a private place, splash isopropyl alcohol under your arms and any odor will vanish instantly. Then powder your underarms and this will hold you until you can get home and take a shower and apply a real deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it stands, this product gets ZERO stars for being completely ineffective and for selling an untried technology in their silver time release molecules.</li>
            <li> This deodorant offers excellent odor and perspiration protection. I work outside and am a profuse sweater. This product keeps me protected from body odor and embarrassing sweat circles. It applies clean without leaving white &amp;#34;globby&amp;#34; build-up. It does not irritate my underarm skin. Has not stained my clothes. This is a bluish clear solid (similar to Mennen Speed Stick) not a white solid. I am pleased with this product. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite deodorant, keeps me fresh and cool all day.  I&#x27;m glad to see that Amazon is stocking this as I can not find it in my local stores.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite kind of deodorant, and this particular scent (Cool Impact) isn&#x27;t available in the stores near us.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is not good enough to purchase a second time. And I am usually a fan of Degree. This deodorant does not last long enough to get me through a day at my desk. It usually fails in the early afternoon and by evening time it is as if I had nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt; - Smells nice&lt;br /&gt; - Goes on clear/Does not stain&lt;br /&gt; - Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt; - Lasts only 5-6 hours with total inactivity</li>
            <li> This product has no aluminum, so if you have allergies or skin irritation due to aluminium, this product can help! On the other hand, if you have allergies or skin irritation due to silver, you&#x27;ll have some problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also smells good, goes on easily with no flakes, and, to my knowledge thus far, hasn&#x27;t stained any of my clothing at all. I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> My husband used this and noticed right away that it wasn&#x27;t lasting all day and felt that he stunk.  He then started to notice a rash in his pits.  He has stopped using this.  It was terrible for us!</li>
            <li> works well for people who sweat alot or work n play hard every day please buy this item  thanks !!!</li>
            <li> It was easy to work with this shipper. I have no complaints about them. Everything was great and without problem.</li>
            <li> Does not work for me. I have been using old spice for years and wanted to change it up. This stuff was cheaper, and now I know why. Old spice would carry me from 7am through to the evening, but this stuff wears out by 3pm or so, and for someone who spends most of his work days at a computer desk, this is unacceptable. Add a lunchtime workout and you can forget it.</li>
            <li> I have used degree on several occasions, but more often then night I use the aerosol cans. In an effort to become more green, I decided to dump the aerosol can and go with this product. My underarms hated it! First it is not the white powder type of stick deodorant-instead it is the blue (not sure what they call it) stick. If anyone has seen Police Academy where the Captain has to keep sticks under his arms to air out his pits you&#x27;ll know what I&#x27;m talking about. I formed a huge red rash wherever the product touched. I can no recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got tired of paying 3-5 bucks, I saw it here as a 6 pack together for an amazing price. Excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> This is ideal for the guy that just wants to have deodorant on hand.  I order the 6 pack and leave it under the sink, so when I run out of one, I just grab the next.</li>
            <li> great price &amp; great product I sweat alot so I know  its good to feel refresh smelling like a new  men  when out of the shower &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; after a hard days work .... this does works</li>
            <li> The merchandise arrived  on time and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is not a good product for an active man.  Everyone is different when it comes to underarm odor/sweating etc but, if your an active man, I would have to say this is not strong enough at all.  I will try out old spice next.</li>
            <li> I like to play basketball and I am still fresh into my 3 or 4 game. I also sweat a lot but I have not had any wet stains.</li>
