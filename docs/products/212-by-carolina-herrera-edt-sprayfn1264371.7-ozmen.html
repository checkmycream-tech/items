            <li> Bought it for my dad and he loved it! Smells really good!</li>
            <li> This cologne is really bad.  I thought it was okay when I bought it blind, but I started to hate it.  It smells like a cloud of grass with urine rain.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing cologne!  I&#x27;ve received compliments on it most places I&#x27;ve been.</li>
            <li> The smell is awesome...Sporty yet manly. But, i doubt about the authenticity of the product because it does not lasts long. Vanishes within an hour atfter sprayed several times.This is not what I expect from a Carolina Herrera as its a premium brand in the perfume line..</li>
            <li> Girls will love how you smell.&lt;br /&gt;I get asked all the time what am I wearing because it smells so good</li>
