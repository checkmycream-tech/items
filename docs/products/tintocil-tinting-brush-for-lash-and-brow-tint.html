            <li>what a great idea to help with tint application.</li>
            <li>was hoping bristles would be like a good make-up brush.</li>
            <li>It is a good size to work with.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for the job and better priced than a lot I saw on here.</li>
            <li>I give good reviews for good, worth it products I receive, which this one wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t sure what I would get</li>
            <li>The Tintocil tinting brush is ok.  </li>
            <li>The fine tip makes application very easy</li>
            <li>I have received free brushes with products that are much, much better than this.  </li>
            <li>Makes application easy.</li>
            <li>Product washes out easily after each use.</li>
            <li>Color goes on easy.</li>
            <li>it goes on easy just to light</li>
            <li>This was flimsy like a children&#x27;s cheap paintbrush.</li>
            <li>You cannot tell from the photo, but you are paying a lot for a craft paint brush available at any Michael&#x27;s for under a dollar.</li>
            <li>This tint is great; very natural looking, did not sting, burn or irritate my skin, looks very natural, the brush just makes it go on so much more evenly and easier to work with.  </li>
            <li>Just the right size for eyebrows!</li>
            <li>Bristles are not firm but wash up nicely with a drop of soap and reshapes well.</li>
            <li>Worth about 50 cents.</li>
            <li>It works fine if you&#x27;re going in a straight motion but for longer thicker eyebrows the hair has to be moved for even coverage and this brush doesn&#x27;t life the brows very well</li>
            <li>This was a brush that the brush came out  of the holder very cheaply made it was not worth the money I paid for it when I could have went and bought a cheap brush</li>
            <li>I really like this brush!  </li>
            <li>For Amazon, it should be more specific in its description and illustration.</li>
            <li>It is more meant for painting on a flat surface.</li>
            <li>and I would rate them as positive with 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Can not use it, picks up so much dye</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Brush is very cheap, hairs are bushy, not fine at all, looks as if it came from a kids paint kit.</li>
            <li>This does not appear to be anything other than a cheap craft paint brush.  </li>
            <li>For me, it is a live and learn thing.</li>
            <li>but at the same time when doing detail work on your face the long stick can get in the way easily.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and I have been using it since I bought it.</li>
            <li>Much easier than the wooden stick they sometimes give you.</li>
            <li>My problem with this brush is the bristles are too soft.</li>
            <li>When I first received the brush the stem was broken, since then the shipper contacted me and indicated they would send me a new brush free of charge.  </li>

            <li> I like that it is long</li>
            <li> With proper care (using brush cleaner after a few uses) it should last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> There is nothing special about this brush for tinting eyebrows, and it is a silly purchase.</li>
            <li> Not worth the time to send back, add to craft paint brushes I already have.  </li>
            <li> cheap and cheesy not worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about a big mess.</li>
            <li> Works as expected for tinting eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Other then that, use what you have.</li>
            <li> It was not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not really needed to use the tint, was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> When you try to brush the tinting color on your eyebrow the bristles can barely move the now wet eyebrow hairs making it difficult to get underneath of them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> The Tintocil Tinting Brush was just a small brush and not particularly special.  </li>
            <li> A small paintbrush would work just as well, but this is made for the purpose</li>
            <li> However, a small paint brush or makeup brush could be used just as well.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to control.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my eyebrows for quite a while now and was getting tired of using the sticks or small brushes that came with the coloring kits.</li>
            <li> I was shocked when the package came.</li>
            <li> Disappointing!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Can not use it, picks up so much dye it&#x27;s hard to control. Brush is very cheap, hairs are bushy, not fine at all, looks as if it came from a kids paint kit.</li>
            <li> This brush is a BIT FLOPPY...I would appreciate one that is a bit stiffer to put on the tint.  Disappointing!!!</li>
            <li> I use this brush with the Tintocil product to lighten my eyebrows.The fine tip makes application very easy and I don&#x27;t have to worry about a big mess.</li>
            <li> I actually think the brush is meant to do what it was designed for. The bristles are soft and I have been using it since I bought it.</li>
            <li> Works as expected for tinting eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Works great to apply eyebrow color to eyelids.  Much easier than the wooden stick they sometimes give you. Makes application easy.</li>
            <li> This was a brush that the brush came out  of the holder very cheaply made it was not worth the money I paid for it when I could have went and bought a cheap brush</li>
            <li> I was shocked when the package came. You can buy one of these at any craft supply or drug store - save your money.</li>
            <li> This was flimsy like a children&#x27;s cheap paintbrush. It was not worth the money.  Use a q-tip to apply dye instead!</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush for tinting my eyelashes. It&#x27;s good for the job and better priced than a lot I saw on here. With proper care (using brush cleaner after a few uses) it should last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> it goes on easy just to light</li>
            <li> I really like this brush!  Works great!  I highly recommend this product. Just the right size for eyebrows! Great quality!</li>
            <li> A small paintbrush would work just as well, but this is made for the purpose so I didn&#x27;t mind spending the extra dollars.</li>
            <li> but reminded me of a paint brush. was hoping bristles would be like a good make-up brush. wasn&#x27;t sure what I would get</li>
            <li> Goes with the eyebrow tint</li>
            <li> Costly. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not really needed to use the tint, was a waste of money. You could use a q&#x27;tip instead of this.</li>
            <li> Excellent for using Godefroy eyebrow tint. Helps sculpure eyebrows when applying tint. Product washes out easily after each use. Papertowel dries it out.</li>
            <li> When I first received the brush the stem was broken, since then the shipper contacted me and indicated they would send me a new brush free of charge.  They have excellent customer service and I would rate them as positive with 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The brush is great for shaping eyebrows with tint.  Bristles are not firm but wash up nicely with a drop of soap and reshapes well.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my eyebrows for quite a while now and was getting tired of using the sticks or small brushes that came with the coloring kits. I bought this and tried it out. I like that it is long but at the same time when doing detail work on your face the long stick can get in the way easily. My problem with this brush is the bristles are too soft. It is more meant for painting on a flat surface. When you try to brush the tinting color on your eyebrow the bristles can barely move the now wet eyebrow hairs making it difficult to get underneath of them. It works fine if you&#x27;re going in a straight motion but for longer thicker eyebrows the hair has to be moved for even coverage and this brush doesn&#x27;t life the brows very well, I tend to use a cotton swab to get areas the brush can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I use the brush with the Roux Lash Brow kit.  Color goes on easy.</li>
            <li> cheap and cheesy not worth the money. Don&#x27;t waste your time. Worth about 50 cents.</li>
            <li> The Tintocil Tinting Brush was just a small brush and not particularly special.  I had several I could have used and saved the money.</li>
            <li> Works well for applying the color to eyelashes and brows.  I would recommend this product for anyone who wishes to apply color to eyes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with the brush. You cannot tell from the photo, but you are paying a lot for a craft paint brush available at any Michael&#x27;s for under a dollar. There is nothing special about this brush for tinting eyebrows, and it is a silly purchase. For me, it is a live and learn thing. For Amazon, it should be more specific in its description and illustration. For the Tintocil folks, shame on you!</li>
            <li> This tint is great; very natural looking, did not sting, burn or irritate my skin, looks very natural, the brush just makes it go on so much more evenly and easier to work with.  Would definitely recommend purchasing the brush if you are going to purchase the tint.</li>
            <li> This does not appear to be anything other than a cheap craft paint brush.  I have received free brushes with products that are much, much better than this.  Not worth the time to send back, add to craft paint brushes I already have.  I give good reviews for good, worth it products I receive, which this one wasn&#x27;t.  Not worth it.</li>
            <li> The Tintocil tinting brush is ok.  It is a good size to work with.  However, a small paint brush or makeup brush could be used just as well.  I would reccommend this if you just want one.  Other then that, use what you have.</li>
            <li> Look forward to using this tinting brush and like the idea.  what a great idea to help with tint application.</li>
