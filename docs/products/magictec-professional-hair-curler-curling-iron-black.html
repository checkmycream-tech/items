            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li>I love to go out now!</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and gives great curls.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and great results.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>watching nice curls come out.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the great product!</li>
            <li>She loves the fact that she can do her own hair now.</li>
            <li>I recommended that they get their own, and one of them was like, \\&quot;I&#x27;ll get two, when payday comes, one for me and my sister.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This curler is one of a kind.</li>
            <li>is.&lt;br /&gt;- I always test on my own hair before I would dare use it on a client.</li>
            <li>A good 1\\&quot; or 1.5\\&quot; curling iron does a better job</li>
            <li>Once I showed her how to use it, she took charge and started curling her hair on her own.</li>
            <li>The internet is really a girl&#x27;s best friend.</li>
            <li>and she liked it because  </li>
            <li>MY CURLS LOOK AWESOME AND VERY BOUNCY.</li>
            <li>I just love how good this curler is.</li>
            <li>I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>so she looks nice when she goes</li>
            <li>and she really liked it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best to produce these really nice curls that you can&#x27;t believe are real.</li>
            <li>I could never make curls like this on my own, and even if I could, they would fall out in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>In any case, we both end up with really nice curls.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best styling product I&#x27;ve ever purchased</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter and she loves it - it works like magic, creating beautiful curls so easily.  </li>
            <li>This Magic Tec is fabulous, works beautifully providing you read the directions for your hair style.</li>
            <li>She love loved loved how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li>The design is very advanced for a curler, and the rate at which it produces curls is phenomenal!</li>
            <li>The Magictec infini-swirl is a fascinating product that utilizes advanced technology to produce some amazing curls.</li>
            <li>We love this curler and would absolutely recommend it to anyone wanting to save time and get the perfect curl!</li>
            <li>Very easy navigation screen for option selection.</li>
            <li>I tried and tried to perfect my curling techniques and I became very good, but I was not able to reproduce symmetry on both sides as did my co-worker.</li>
            <li>So far, this is the best curling iron I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I thought it was be a more effective and faster way to curl her</li>
            <li>My 15 year old is in love!!!!!</li>
            <li>I wanted a really good curler since I wanted to look good while in college since I hear there&#x27;s a lot of hot guys who go there.</li>
            <li>This gives me beautiful soft curls and is wonderful for &amp;#34;woman of a certain age&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many curling irons, but this is by far the best one!</li>
            <li>The curler itself is very light, and easy to use!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, safe from burning my hand!</li>
            <li>It makes curls fast and beautiful.</li>
            <li>It make me feel really good and full of confidence.</li>
            <li>The heat adjustments are super good.</li>
            <li>All my curls are so fine and nice.</li>
            <li>That combined with the same amount of time on both sides will allow for perfect curls.</li>
            <li>Nor, are there many automatic curlers out there either.</li>
            <li>I was quite impressed that I could curl my entire head without a mirror (and burning myself)!</li>
            <li>They seem to come over a lot more just to use my curler.</li>
            <li>but I love her and this curler to death.</li>
            <li>I just went to a salon, which gives my confidence a boost, helping me feel better about myself all day.</li>
            <li>The grand kids love it.its a mut have for my family</li>
            <li>Being a hair stylist for over 20 years, I always buy the latest \\&quot;toys\\&quot; and test them.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I cannot ask for much more.</li>
            <li>she wasn&#x27;t worried about me burning her. :)</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sure I will get better with practice though.)  </li>
            <li>I chose Magic Tec, because you can choose to switch the directions of the curls with it, and I couldn&#x27;t confirm whether Conair&#x27;s iron could do that as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll have a different, but awesome outcome every time.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>You can reinsert your hair or use a hair straighter for better results.</li>
            <li>favorite part about using this curler is watching my hair go in and out.</li>
            <li>I love this curler because it works.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this</li>
            <li>She also loves the ability to have alternating curls, which adds more depth.  </li>
            <li>I love using automatic things.</li>
            <li>I love it when I don&#x27;t have to do much for great hair</li>
            <li>It was only a matter of time before someone invented this wonderful device.</li>
            <li>The precision of each curl is so precise!</li>
            <li>I get so many people staring at me and commenting on them.</li>
            <li>I would gladly buy another for a friend who is like me.</li>
            <li>This is a really magical device.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t want to look like I am trying to be a teenager again, I do want to curl my hair and have it look cute and \\&quot;age appropriate.\\</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to keep using this as I&#x27;m sure as I get more comfortable with it</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s light and has many options for you to choose.</li>
            <li>I did put too much hair in one time and it quit winding which was good</li>
            <li>This product is good and really can curl.</li>
            <li>The product is very cool when it works, but my hair gets stuck easily and too often.</li>
            <li>I often visit this nursing home that has very nice old ladies who are permanent residents.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the curls are perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a worth while purchase, just make sure your hair is good and ready to go!</li>
            <li>Love that it gets hot fast and the curls are great....</li>
            <li>This thing is as easy to use as saying my A, B, C&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I just followed instructions and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li>I gave it 5 stars because of how easy it is to use and how well the curls stay in my hair.</li>
            <li>The handle is easy to hold and release.</li>
            <li>This curler is so easy to use</li>
            <li>My hair curls so easy with curler.</li>
            <li>Took me a minute or two to get the hang of it, but once I did, it was easy as pie.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy.  </li>
            <li>so easy.  </li>
            <li>It produces a strong long-lasting curl and leaves my old-fashioned curlers in the dust.  </li>
            <li>The curls comes out nice and hot and stays curly for miles.</li>
            <li>My curls are really nice and comes out in a consistent manner.</li>
            <li>This is my first curler of any kind</li>
            <li>If you have hair like me that doesn&#x27;t like to curl and you&#x27;ve always wanted beautiful waves that can last for days, GET IT!</li>
            <li>This product gave my hair beautiful curl that actually held, even without hairspray!</li>
            <li>I love that it gave a consistent curl from top to bottom.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe her hair is too fine.</li>
            <li>I have had this curling iron for about a month and a half now, and it works great!</li>
            <li>but I thought that was because my hair was too fine.</li>
            <li>Besides that, it works fine.</li>
            <li>It is so safe to use and works so quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now let&#x27;s see how quick and honorable on their refund guarantee!</li>
            <li>I shower at night and am able to quickly curl my hair to perfection in the morning.</li>
            <li>Luckily I was able to get it out</li>
            <li>was very excited to try this \\&quot;brand\\&quot; of hair curler after reading so many positive reviews about it.</li>
            <li>I easily taught my boyfriend to learn how to use this curler on me and he thinks it&#x27;s fun!</li>
            <li>Now, I look fabulous.</li>
            <li>I managed to free my hair and try again on another strand...</li>
            <li>I am happy I got her this present</li>
            <li>so the low level works great for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seriously a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t expect much from this product.</li>
            <li>My friends love the curls and waves that I make on occasion using the curlers, and it&#x27;s nice to have the option to create so many different styles every once in a while.  </li>
            <li>I have to get a perm to keep my hair straight, but I want to have nice curls too sometimes.</li>
            <li>I can easily see what my settings are, and I like being able to pick the exact temperature that I want too.</li>
            <li>I love being fashionable, and part of it is getting hair and makeup done right.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use and give my long hair beautiful wavy curls.</li>
            <li>My once straight hair became a mountain of curls within minutes!!!</li>
            <li>So wicked fast!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a problem since it still works great after I used the flat iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy, and I can&#x27;t burn myself.</li>
            <li>It curls my hair quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>This product is better constructed than alot of simular products and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>It is a great product for the price, and she find it more effective than more expensive hair curlers that she has purchased.</li>
            <li>My hair did get caught, but all I did was stay calm and just unwind my hair from the spiral (it didn&#x27;t even hurt!).</li>
            <li>That is why this curler is unique.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>When I gave it to her, she acted enthused and kinda pretended to be excited.</li>
            <li>The company suggested that she straighten the hair first to allow for better results.</li>
            <li>I am never disappointed with outcome of my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit steep in price, but definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>but it was so worth it!  </li>
            <li>She had originally asked for the InStyler curler</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a curler that was so unique.</li>
            <li>Even though I have never used a curler like this before, I was able to use this on the first try.</li>
            <li>I am into unique product designs.</li>
            <li>My neighbor bought this and was excited the day it arrived.  </li>
            <li>I wasso excited about this.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight, hair</li>
            <li>This is a pretty cool gadget, and is quick and easy to use!</li>

            <li>this magic tec curling iron is terrific, its easy to use, n the curl lasts , glad I ordered this n</li>
            <li>Other curlers don&#x27;t curl on their own for you to make those really nice curls.</li>
            <li>This is the right instrument for that!</li>
            <li>I will outright promote for them whenever I can because it&#x27;s such a good product.</li>
            <li>It sucks in your hair and spits out a perfect spiral curl.</li>
            <li>There are so many pros to this curler that anyone should really consider getting it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is just way cool people.</li>
            <li>I love this curler solely for the reason that it is fast.</li>
            <li>They are a one of a kind, inexpensive, and durable even though they are made out of soft material.</li>
            <li>the only thing I am good at: typing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cool to watch the hair go into the rotary part.</li>
            <li>You really have to make sure you dont have any tangles or else</li>
            <li>let it cool and tried again.</li>
            <li>Really this is one of the most fun Hair Tools I have ever bought, and I am excited to share a demo/review with you.  </li>

            <li>She is able to have great curly hair with little to no fuss, and has enjoyed using it thus far.  </li>
            <li>When I first picked the curler up, I noticed that it was lightweight and easily maneuverable.</li>
            <li>it is so easy and fast!</li>
            <li>It gets too hot for her fine hair, and it didn&#x27;t hold the curl as well as this one.</li>
            <li>As long as you comb out each portion and not too much you will achieve beautiful ringlets in seconds.</li>
            <li>I recieved the product quickly and with no problems from the seller</li>
            <li>This is an extraordinary product.</li>
            <li>My sister is pregnant, and she doesn&#x27;t want to use a lot of chemicals on her hair.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo14SFOT6NMBZXC]]This video provides a quick demonstration of the MagicTec Infiniswirl hair curler (including a description of what the switches do).  </li>
            <li>Lucky me, my hair type conforms to the shape I put it in, so</li>
            <li>It seems to be well built and is probably most suitable for medium to long hair.  </li>
            <li>I started using this product on on high heat and my hair is shiny and looks so much better</li>
            <li>The very first time I put my hair into this, it sucked it up, and I couldnt get it out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Maybe a shiner mist on my hair to make it even more shiney, but I dont really have to use it since the curls are pretty as they are and</li>
            <li>packaging was pretty good, instruction don&#x27;t match with this model so that was a BIG</li>
            <li>Thanks MagicTec for making me the best husband ever this past Christmas.</li>
            <li>It really is that easy.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m pretty fond of them myself, as well)!</li>
            <li>It really saves a lot of time too!!</li>
            <li>had to be familiar with it first.</li>
            <li>to my wife, this Magic Professional Hair Curler is good for the beginner, and she wanted me to return it because taking so long to do her</li>
            <li>They all love it and think its a new and fun way of curling hair.</li>
            <li>and you should be able to complete your hair style quickly.</li>
            <li>I have fine, hard to curl hair and this gave me great spiral curls.</li>
            <li>It was so simple and easy, even a person who rarely curls her hair was able to curl it.</li>
            <li>usualy straighten up real fast, but with this machine they lasted fine without looking to much puffed like</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really rare in a curler.</li>
            <li>The purchase is worth it.</li>
            <li>Not only do I get these really nice curls every time</li>
            <li>I like to look like a lion, and my friends all laugh at me for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just having so much fun with this curler.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>but I thought it was worth a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We had fun trying it, but it didn&#x27;t work on her like it did in the video.</li>
            <li>and you can make different kind curl by controling the time.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that really is more frizz than anything.</li>
            <li>I am an elementary school teacher and mom of 4.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She loves using the Magic Tec Professional Hair Curler.</li>
            <li>She said it was fun to see her hair curly made by something like this [curler].</li>
            <li>, I used to only borrow from my sister or mother and now that I&#x27;m heading off to college, I need my own.</li>
            <li>She likes to do it for me too, since it&#x27;s really fun.</li>
            <li>I had a headful of soft, lovely curls.</li>
            <li>We both set our own temperatures, but keep the timer the same.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really fun to show off my hair to my friends and family.</li>
            <li>was so much fun</li>
            <li>I looked at the description and thought that it would be worth a try to test it out since I could always return it.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this curler out, and I definitely think it was worth a try, but I am confident that it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li>even flat ironed my hair afterwards, just to make sure it was \\&quot; frizz free \\&quot; thinking that might have been the problem.</li>
            <li>There is nothing more in this world that I love other than this curler.</li>
            <li>The MagicTec Professional Hair Curler is very easy to use on straight hair.  </li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>Let me tell you right now – customers have every right to worship this curler.</li>
            <li>My curls are just right.</li>
            <li>Once you get use to the right amount of hair to use, the process gets easier.</li>
            <li>I know I was doing it right</li>
            <li>I took it out of the box and tried it right away</li>
            <li>It is light, it saves my wrists from twisting, the hottest part is on the inside so it would be hard to burn yourself (which makes curling my kids hair nice and easy)...</li>
            <li>I decided to return it, and Amazon sent me a pre-paid label to send it back, which made it very easy.</li>
            <li>No other curling iron has made me this satisfied.</li>
            <li>This has been happening less often as I have used the product more and learned better how it works.</li>
            <li>Could this tool really be that cool?  </li>
            <li>Price was higher than we thought it would be but well worth it.</li>
            <li>Got the Magic Tec Professional Hair Curler today &amp; have really- seriously enjoyed getting to see the different results.</li>
            <li>My shortest layer of hair is an inch or two past my chin--I had no problems on this section, which makes me think this product might work great for anyone with shorter hair.</li>
            <li>Its a very decently made tool!</li>
            <li>I chose this product based on the video reviews of youtube, I got it yesterday and inmediatly tried it, from the first curl i got it right</li>
            <li>My first impression of this curler is that it was launched with the right marketing finesse.</li>
            <li>I was so excited that there was finally going to be a curling iron that would work on my fine hair and hold a curl.</li>
            <li>It is durable, works great, and is definitely worth the initial price you pay, because the time alone that it saves you in the long run is invaluable.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you look at the controls and switch it to right or left curl when you use it.</li>
            <li>It is very fast and it times all of my curls to perfection.</li>
            <li>This curler is very fast.</li>
            <li>Better than Most curling irons on the market, it took me less than 30 minutes to do my whole head</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I finally got my credit card to order this.</li>
            <li>It definately works better with a smaller portion of hair (tighter curl), otherwise it gave me a looser wavey look.</li>
            <li>It works great on my thick hair.</li>
            <li>I really love how this curler makes it easier to work on younger kids.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t exactly accomplish this.</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been tellin people to get this curler since it REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I wanted in every way.</li>
            <li>I love it because the curls actually hold.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks so much MagicTec!</li>
            <li>It allows you to have many different styles.</li>
            <li>At first she didn&#x27;t know what it was since the box it came in looked so sleek.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to do much for them!</li>
            <li>so, so much easier!</li>
            <li>I wrap my hair in, and then my hair gets all funny looking</li>
            <li>It gives me consistent curls I can count on.</li>
            <li>I really recommend peeps to try this thing out!</li>
            <li>I was scared the first time that happened, but I just stopped clamping it, and pulled my hair out.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my wife for the holidays and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>My curls look shiny and pretty.</li>
            <li>the problem then, is it looks even more frizzy, especially the ends.</li>
            <li>I got it as a Christmas gift and for the first time it was a disaster</li>
            <li>After using the curlers, I noticed that not only was I able to get the look that I wanted to achieve but the curls were silky, bouncy, and longer</li>
            <li>Really pleases!</li>
            <li>the pink one is nice too</li>
            <li>You can learn how to use this automatic curler fast!</li>
            <li>Of course I had to try it out first</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just that fast to use this curler!</li>
            <li>plus, the curls are so uniform and pretty.</li>
            <li>First I need to say that my hair does not like to hold curl.</li>
            <li>First...</li>
            <li>I have fairly healthy hair as I have never colored it and only use heating tools sporadically.</li>
            <li>My mom said she has never seen my hair look so pretty</li>
            <li>But it really can be used by everyone!</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved it even though my hair got caught a few times.</li>
            <li>It was so much fun to use, extremely easy to work with and made such pretty curls.</li>
            <li>No curl is out of line, or doesn&#x27;t curl right unless I accidentally used too much hair</li>
            <li>I do not usually write reviews.. especially when it comes to hair products of any kind.</li>
            <li>I ordered this curler a week ago and from what I can tell so far, this curler is... unique.</li>
            <li>We were excited about the MagicTec Professional Hair Curler after seeing the reviews and purchased it for our teenager.</li>
            <li>I used this curler on clean, dry hair that was free of tangles.</li>
            <li>the next morning I brush it out for a really like sexy wavy look.</li>
            <li>I sometimes iron my hair straight out just to recurl my hair again, because it really is that fun to use.</li>
            <li>Not too good because I actually didn&#x27;t get the digital one.  </li>
            <li>None the less, I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use and the curls last much longer than they did with my curling iron!</li>
            <li>Other people with super straight hair might need more spray.</li>
            <li>I take way too long using curling irons that it&#x27;ll be more curly on the side</li>
            <li>need to do more than one for long hair.</li>
            <li>It is pretty automatic, and you can adjust the size of the curls or waves by how much hair you put in at a time.</li>
            <li>Didnt believe I could achieve the same great results and speed with other curling irons.</li>
            <li>(I say medium because I just had it cut, but most would probably consider it long.</li>
            <li>I went with this product specifically because it had a 5 star rating--higher than any other similar product on Amazon, which impressed me, as well as the sheer novelty of it--I&#x27;ve never tried one like it.</li>
            <li>If one such as yourself would want an easy curler that curls well</li>
            <li>I cannot stress enough how easy it is to do my daughter&#x27;s hair now.</li>
            <li>but because it is very quick and simple to use as well.</li>
            <li>It is really easy to use and takes only minutes to do all your hair.</li>
            <li>I have to wake up super early to get my family moving and out the door.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, simple and self explanatory</li>
            <li>The cord was super long which was good because only the far outlet in my bathroom works.</li>
            <li>, I have thick long frizzy hair and had effortless beautiful curls in no time!!!!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t encountered a single problem with it, and its one of my favorite hair products.</li>
            <li>It works hard to keep my fill of gorgeous curls.</li>
            <li>When it comes to curlers, they break easily, get old fast, and most of the time just plain don&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>All I really have to do is wait for the beeps, indicating that it is done.</li>
            <li>It really works like a charm.</li>
            <li>As much as I like it in the shower, I don&#x27;t like the afterparty when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much hair to begin with, but this curler works fast.</li>
            <li>My response- \\&quot;very carefully.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I like it when my hair gets steamy and really curly.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much, Magictec.</li>
            <li>It really curls  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s much quicker and doesn&#x27;t chewup your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered one straight away</li>
            <li>My hair comes out looking neat, soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>As much as people say it&#x27;s jewelry or gold.</li>
            <li>I was just searching on amazon and came across it, and goodness, it&#x27;s really thought out and well made.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, the results from this curler were not poor, and the quality of the product is as described.</li>
            <li>I was very intrigued by this item, so I ordered it for my daughter.</li>
            <li>I think it would be a lot of work to do your whole head.</li>
            <li>The heat setting can go up really high!</li>
            <li>It is the highlight of my mornings before I get ready for work.</li>
            <li>I really like the design</li>
            <li>Thanks for fast shipment also</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair really shiny.</li>
            <li>This was definitely a gift she&#x27;ll enjoy for while.</li>
            <li>My curls hold really well.</li>
            <li>your hair will go into it really fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind since it makes my life so much easier.</li>
            <li>It really gives anybody a confidence boost.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the makers of this curler.  </li>
            <li>I only spray a light array of hairspray on it</li>
            <li>my hair doesn&#x27;t need too much for it to stay in.</li>
            <li>spend so much money on hair products.</li>
            <li>NEVER saw my hair curl so fast.</li>
            <li>Really reliable speeds and heats up so fast.</li>
            <li>I have medium length hair and it is extremely straight</li>
            <li>heats up fast.</li>
            <li>I got this curler because I know that it will really help my wrists.</li>
            <li>It is also very convenient as it saves time.</li>
            <li>Even with this speed, you only need one hand free.</li>
            <li>You can go to YouTube and type in Magictec Curle to see how it is done, that was very helpful to me.</li>
            <li>I have very wavy hair</li>
            <li>I make my curls so fast, I forget I even started.</li>
            <li>I saved so much time using this&lt;br /&gt;curler</li>
            <li>Try straightening your hair before using this product or brushing it really well.</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>It air dries straight.</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t think I was using it incorrectly (not to mention</li>
            <li>It is very versatile for someone that likes to change their hair up from day to day.</li>
            <li>It is really fast and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
            <li>I adore this wand so much</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to pit too much hair spray either.</li>
            <li>This is a real winner.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely come back here to buy my own.</li>
            <li>but it seems the MagicTec Professional Hair Curler may prove to be the &amp;#34;Golden Ticket!&amp;#34; Thank You!!!</li>
            <li>It curls my ends perfectly and has made doing my hair much faster over the past few months.</li>
            <li>After reading all the problems with the other name brands, and also buying the Conair, I decided to give Magic Tec at a fraction of the price a try.  </li>
            <li>The different heat settings make this Magictec great for families because my mother who has thinner hair can use a lower heat setting while I can use a higher heat setting for my thick hair.  </li>
            <li>The other residents got jealous and wanted to have appointments with me more often now.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t look limp anymore since I have super fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>but it certainly damaged that small piece of hair and imagine my panic when this hot motor was gripping my hair.</li>
            <li>This magictec curler gives me really nice bouncy curls, that last a very long time.</li>
            <li>Will my hair even all fit in it since it&#x27;s long?  </li>
            <li>After watching America&#x27;s next top model, boys and girls edition, I saw how hot this one guy looked with long and wavy/curlyish hair (after his make over).</li>
            <li>I have had those super cheap, traditional curling irons for who knows how long now.</li>
            <li>I work for a salon two blocks down the road, and I visit this nursing home to give its residents new hair styles to boost happiness and energy and cut back on depression.</li>
            <li>She could only effectively fit a small group of hairs in the clamp for it to bring results as good as a traditional hair curler.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s now had it for over 3 weeks and loves it a lot more than her previous hair curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I love the sleek and black design and</li>
            <li>but I am surprised at how light it actually is.</li>
            <li>This product is super simple.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and sometimes enjoy adding some larger curls with an iron.</li>
            <li>The device is super simple to understand how to use.</li>
            <li>and I cannot find instructions for the older model anywhere.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight, shoulder length hair that does not hold a curl without tons of hairspray (and usually that doesn&#x27;t help either).</li>
            <li>I like to put the settings on really high, like all the way.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that you try it out.</li>
            <li>I do high recommend this product.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I use it nearly every day: the product is a very high quality curler.  </li>
            <li>My 13 year old daughter likes it so much</li>
            <li>I recommend this not only to people with long nails, but to everyone who just needs a better hair curler.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot and is able to curl my thick hair.</li>
            <li>Her hair is long, wavy and thick and the MagicTec works great every time.  </li>
            <li>Use very small sections, clean, smooth hair.</li>
            <li>I normally curl my hair using hot rollers, but this curler beats having to look funny and wait long periods of time!</li>
            <li>Took me a few trys to get the curls right, but after that, my curls became consistent and really pretty.</li>
            <li>so when I saw this nifty little gadget I was pretty excited.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too big of a deal though;  I will just have to experiment with it to find the right time/heat setting for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got thick Asian hair and it does wonders for me, but my sister has thin and very fine hair and it makes it look like she&#x27;s got more hair than many people out there.</li>
            <li>ALL OTHER CURLERS ARE TOO CHEAP TO EVEN HOLD 15 MINS.</li>
            <li>Other then turning on the power and the light coming on...</li>
            <li>This product is something completely new to me.</li>
            <li>I used in on Christmas day to go to our new in-law&#x27;s house.</li>
            <li>This curler is professional and fun at the same time.</li>
            <li>She did not tell me at first, but after constant nagging, she told me about this product.</li>
            <li>This is my first curling iron and definitely.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>This is the first product that actually works!!</li>
            <li>matter what curler you are thinking about getting, this one will most likely beat it to a bloody pulp lol.  </li>
            <li>I did notice that if I clamped my hair lower, say half way, then it seemed to curl/suck up fine.  </li>
            <li>First I separated my hair into multiple layers and sections and ran a brush through each section repeatedly before inserting into this torture device.</li>
            <li>Your hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck, just make sure you curl your hair in small sections.</li>
            <li>Even my 9 year old granddaughter can use it!</li>
            <li>My old one didn&#x27;t get hot enough to heat the hair wrapped around it.</li>
            <li>She finally admit embarrassingly that she really loves her new gift...</li>
            <li>So I washed my hair and applied a light conditioner and regular blow dry.</li>
            <li>They come out pretty hot if you have high settings on, but that&#x27;s alright since the curls stay curly for a very long long time!</li>
            <li>I got it, plugged it in and just used it really quick to see how it worked since I had to run to the store and do other errands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rate it 4.5 stars but there is no &#x27;half&#x27; here to do so...thanks!</li>
            <li>I love the look of curls, but have always had a hard time using a curling iron.</li>
            <li>Took me a bunch of google searches to figure out I had the older model but the instructions in the box were for the new model with digital instructions.</li>
            <li>So, I grew out my hair, and got this automatic curler because those old curling irons look like a bit</li>
            <li>Never had I used such a curler before, but I was very astonished at the ease at which I could curl my hair.</li>
            <li>natural looks are in.</li>
            <li>I will also note that I am a licensed professional, but do not work for this company.  </li>
            <li>Really, anything I do puts me at risk for breaking my nails and immense pain.</li>
            <li>This curling iron can work wonders, and I far from regret my decision to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Frankly it does not take an expert stylist to give professional curls anymore.</li>
            <li>I received the MagicTec Professional Hair Curler 2 days ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love how everyone has been asking about my hair as of late.</li>
            <li>There has yet been a curler that allows you to change the direction of the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, most curling irons require you to manually do it and it gets confusing after a while, when you start doing your hair with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, I love the fact that it sucks my hair in and curls it, and all I have to do is hold it.</li>
            <li>She likes that she doesn&#x27;t burn her fingers and scalp like the old curling iron she was using.  </li>
            <li>and she has not had any problems so far.  </li>
            <li>But I was happily surprised when it worked.</li>
            <li>&amp; so I have been very sceptical about a a curler that would actually curl &amp; remain curled</li>
            <li>It has saved me from being late on more than one occasion.</li>
            <li>So fast yet so simple; It makes life easier.</li>
            <li>It took about 30 to 45 minutes the first time curling it, but now that I know how to do it , curling my hair shouldn&#x27;t take as long.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s natural, so to get the curls</li>
            <li>Let me preface this review by saying I am a frequent Amazon shopper, however, I have never reviewed any product until now.</li>
            <li>After trying it, though, I am completely baffled as to how it has earned 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly, but has lost a lot of it&#x27;s curl as I age.  </li>
            <li>As far as the curls lasting a long time, that part isn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li>It would be better if it is waterproof and can allow to curl thick portion of hair.</li>
            <li>How could I go wrong when everyone else loved</li>
            <li>They are easy to fasten and very compact to keep in small places like a purse especially if a person needs to use them in emergency cases.</li>
            <li>I tested my older curler on one side and this new one on the other, and in my opinion, you really shouldn&#x27;t pass this one up.</li>
            <li>I mean they were ok to use.</li>
            <li>And over the years, parts of it have grown out straight, while other parts are still very curly.</li>
            <li>I have very straight hair, that used to never curl and have always wanted loose wavy curls.</li>
            <li>So one of my close friends has had the same old hair style since junior high.</li>
            <li>This is such a new idea!</li>
            <li>When I say hot, I mean how hot I look with these curls!</li>
            <li>This curling iron would be best suited for those with serious hair-styling goals of consistent and high-quality and is not necessarily for the casual self-stylist.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too expensive to keep buying coffee, more cheaper to curl hair fast!</li>
            <li>My daughter looks like a little angel when she&#x27;s in full curls after using this product.</li>
            <li>Conversely, I rely heavily on product reviews when making my purchasing decisions, which is why I feel so strongly about giving my personal feedback on this item.</li>
            <li>My straight hair curls like a charm and doesn&#x27;t get undone at all for a long time.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take long to get my curls ready with this curler.</li>
            <li>At the end of this entire process, I was horrified to see my sink full of broken, ripped strands of hair, along with several huge knotted wads and a pile of hair at my feet.</li>
            <li>You may be thinking this is due to user error, and perhaps there are better methods, but as I was curling my hair for over an hour and a half, you&#x27;d think that would allow for plenty of opportunity to improve my technique.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unless you have shoulder length, Asian silky straight hair or left handed... STAY AWAY!</li>
            <li>I have long hair [past my waist] and I love to curl just my ends and my bangs.  </li>
            <li>It curls right, it doesn&#x27;t burn your hands since there&#x27;s no extremely hot surface to touch, AND it has a neat timer and alarm to tell you when your hair is done!</li>
            <li>My wife had never heard of this product before but after using it for the first time (and the 10 other times already after that)</li>
            <li>By using such tiny sections, you can only achieve a certain type of curl, and for me, it was not the look</li>
            <li>The curling mechanism is very consistent in that there is little to no room for error other than putting too much hair into it.</li>
            <li>I gave up on using curling irons, and also curling in general until I found this tool.</li>
            <li>My hair generally has no problem holding a curl.</li>
            <li>I really like this not only because I have long nails</li>
            <li>And just let me reiterate: I was using exceedingly small sections of smooth hair, but it would still tangle all the same.</li>
            <li>I might even go as far as saying that this might be the future of hair curling.</li>
            <li>Professional is the key word here!</li>
            <li>She would spend nearly an hour curling her hair with the traditional curler.  </li>
            <li>So much easier than I expected</li>
            <li>So much easier than I expected</li>
            <li>I did have to learn to be careful and not put too much hair in it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not good at expressing myself, so using this curler helped me create a new look and new person that is a little bit more outspoken.</li>
            <li>Most of the time the machine would release my hair with a little tugging, but the worst part was the dozen or so times that a section of hair would become so entangled that I feared it was stuck for good!</li>
            <li>generally write reviews for children&#x27;s novels on other sites, since I like to read, but this peculiar curler has caught my utmost attention after my first initial use.</li>
            <li>this cute curler seriously does what everyone else says!</li>
            <li>Now though, it takes less than 15 minutes and the curls are extremely consistent.  </li>
            <li>I would have given up after completing the first half of my head, but I kept going just to see if it would get easier as I went along and found my groove</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited to play around with the other settings (e.g., shorter time) of the MagticTec to see what other types of curls can be achieved.</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron, I&#x27;ve only used it once, and didn&#x27;t have any real problems other than lack of coordination and short arms that have a hard time curling the back of my head</li>
            <li>Then I realized that this tool besides being heavy, is impossible to use if you are RIGHT HANDED, if you hold it with your right hand, and want the side pointing to your head it flips the unit upside down..No matter what you do.&lt;br /&gt;- After contortioning myself and managed to put my first strand of hair in the unit, It swallowed my hair and right away the smell of burnt motor.</li>
            <li>I was able to get a few pieces to kind of curl...but not impressive and not easily.</li>
            <li>It took me 25-30 mins to curl my hair with an old standard clip curling iron and this one takes me only about 10 mins.</li>
            <li>No other curler works with the same ease.</li>
            <li>I only have to press a few buttons to get the thing going; which is a lot better than having to spin all of my hair around a little rod.</li>
            <li>I have extremely long nails which makes pretty much any task (including typing) really hard for me.</li>
            <li>I am a 55 year old woman with long hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter is not inexperienced in doing her hair with different tools.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to fix any mistakes, say, if you sectioned out too much hair, or too little, or if you curled the wrong direction.</li>
            <li>However, the previous customer reviews on this curling iron seemed very approving .</li>
            <li>Wrapping hair around typical irons is too much of a hassle and hazard.</li>
            <li>I have long hair making it hard to curl with any other curling iron, and on top of that I have no idea</li>
            <li>When I first thought of purchasing the curlers, I was a little bit apprehensive!</li>
            <li>Even when you think you&#x27;re using a very small section of hair, it&#x27;s still too much for this thing, which means it takes an exceedingly long time to finish your whole head.</li>
            <li>I learned a little earlier that if you hair spray the strand you want to curl before putting it into the machine that curls last much, much longer than just curling it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Thank you so much for the great product!</li>
            <li> She loves the fact that she can do her own hair now.</li>
            <li> I recommended that they get their own, and one of them was like, \\&quot;I&#x27;ll get two, when payday comes, one for me and my sister.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This curler is one of a kind.</li>
            <li> is.&lt;br /&gt;- I always test on my own hair before I would dare use it on a client.</li>
            <li> A good 1\\&quot; or 1.5\\&quot; curling iron does a better job</li>
            <li> Once I showed her how to use it, she took charge and started curling her hair on her own.</li>
            <li> The internet is really a girl&#x27;s best friend.</li>
            <li> and she liked it because  </li>
            <li> MY CURLS LOOK AWESOME AND VERY BOUNCY.</li>
            <li> I just love how good this curler is.</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> so she looks nice when she goes</li>
            <li> and she really liked it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s best to produce these really nice curls that you can&#x27;t believe are real.</li>
            <li> I could never make curls like this on my own, and even if I could, they would fall out in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> In any case, we both end up with really nice curls.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best styling product I&#x27;ve ever purchased</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it - it works like magic, creating beautiful curls so easily.  </li>
            <li> This Magic Tec is fabulous, works beautifully providing you read the directions for your hair style.</li>
            <li> She love loved loved how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li> The design is very advanced for a curler, and the rate at which it produces curls is phenomenal!</li>
            <li> The Magictec infini-swirl is a fascinating product that utilizes advanced technology to produce some amazing curls.</li>
            <li> We love this curler and would absolutely recommend it to anyone wanting to save time and get the perfect curl!</li>
            <li> Very easy navigation screen for option selection.</li>
            <li> I tried and tried to perfect my curling techniques and I became very good, but I was not able to reproduce symmetry on both sides as did my co-worker.</li>
            <li> So far, this is the best curling iron I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought it was be a more effective and faster way to curl her</li>
            <li> My 15 year old is in love!!!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted a really good curler since I wanted to look good while in college since I hear there&#x27;s a lot of hot guys who go there.</li>
            <li> This gives me beautiful soft curls and is wonderful for &amp;#34;woman of a certain age&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many curling irons, but this is by far the best one!</li>
            <li> The curler itself is very light, and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, safe from burning my hand!</li>
            <li> It makes curls fast and beautiful.</li>
            <li> It make me feel really good and full of confidence.</li>
            <li> The heat adjustments are super good.</li>
            <li> All my curls are so fine and nice.</li>
            <li> That combined with the same amount of time on both sides will allow for perfect curls.</li>
            <li> Nor, are there many automatic curlers out there either.</li>
            <li> I was quite impressed that I could curl my entire head without a mirror (and burning myself)!</li>
            <li> They seem to come over a lot more just to use my curler.</li>
            <li> but I love her and this curler to death.</li>
            <li> I just went to a salon, which gives my confidence a boost, helping me feel better about myself all day.</li>
            <li> The grand kids love it.its a mut have for my family</li>
            <li> Being a hair stylist for over 20 years, I always buy the latest \\&quot;toys\\&quot; and test them.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I cannot ask for much more.</li>
            <li> she wasn&#x27;t worried about me burning her. :)</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m sure I will get better with practice though.)  </li>
            <li> I chose Magic Tec, because you can choose to switch the directions of the curls with it, and I couldn&#x27;t confirm whether Conair&#x27;s iron could do that as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll have a different, but awesome outcome every time.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> You can reinsert your hair or use a hair straighter for better results.</li>
            <li> favorite part about using this curler is watching my hair go in and out.</li>
            <li> I love this curler because it works.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this</li>
            <li> She also loves the ability to have alternating curls, which adds more depth.  </li>
            <li> I love using automatic things.</li>
            <li> I love it when I don&#x27;t have to do much for great hair</li>
            <li> It was only a matter of time before someone invented this wonderful device.</li>
            <li> The precision of each curl is so precise!</li>
            <li> I get so many people staring at me and commenting on them.</li>
            <li> I would gladly buy another for a friend who is like me.</li>
            <li> This is a really magical device.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t want to look like I am trying to be a teenager again, I do want to curl my hair and have it look cute and \\&quot;age appropriate.\\</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.</li>

            <li> Maybe her hair is too fine.</li>
            <li> I have had this curling iron for about a month and a half now, and it works great!</li>
            <li> but I thought that was because my hair was too fine.</li>
            <li> Besides that, it works fine.</li>
            <li> It is so safe to use and works so quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now let&#x27;s see how quick and honorable on their refund guarantee!</li>
            <li> I shower at night and am able to quickly curl my hair to perfection in the morning.</li>
            <li> Luckily I was able to get it out</li>
            <li> was very excited to try this \\&quot;brand\\&quot; of hair curler after reading so many positive reviews about it.</li>
            <li> I easily taught my boyfriend to learn how to use this curler on me and he thinks it&#x27;s fun!</li>
            <li> Now, I look fabulous.</li>
            <li> I managed to free my hair and try again on another strand...</li>
            <li> I am happy I got her this present</li>
            <li> so the low level works great for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t expect much from this product.</li>
            <li> My friends love the curls and waves that I make on occasion using the curlers, and it&#x27;s nice to have the option to create so many different styles every once in a while.  </li>
            <li> I have to get a perm to keep my hair straight, but I want to have nice curls too sometimes.</li>
            <li> I can easily see what my settings are, and I like being able to pick the exact temperature that I want too.</li>
            <li> I love being fashionable, and part of it is getting hair and makeup done right.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use and give my long hair beautiful wavy curls.</li>
            <li> My once straight hair became a mountain of curls within minutes!!!</li>
            <li> So wicked fast!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a problem since it still works great after I used the flat iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, easy, and I can&#x27;t burn myself.</li>
            <li> It curls my hair quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> This product is better constructed than alot of simular products and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> It is a great product for the price, and she find it more effective than more expensive hair curlers that she has purchased.</li>
            <li> My hair did get caught, but all I did was stay calm and just unwind my hair from the spiral (it didn&#x27;t even hurt!).</li>
            <li> That is why this curler is unique.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> When I gave it to her, she acted enthused and kinda pretended to be excited.</li>
            <li> The company suggested that she straighten the hair first to allow for better results.</li>
            <li> I am never disappointed with outcome of my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit steep in price, but definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> but it was so worth it!  </li>
            <li> She had originally asked for the InStyler curler</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a curler that was so unique.</li>
            <li> Even though I have never used a curler like this before, I was able to use this on the first try.</li>
            <li> I am into unique product designs.</li>
            <li> My neighbor bought this and was excited the day it arrived.  </li>
            <li> I wasso excited about this.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight, hair</li>

            <li> this magic tec curling iron is terrific, its easy to use, n the curl lasts , glad I ordered this n</li>
            <li> Other curlers don&#x27;t curl on their own for you to make those really nice curls.</li>
            <li> This is the right instrument for that!</li>
            <li> I will outright promote for them whenever I can because it&#x27;s such a good product.</li>
            <li> It sucks in your hair and spits out a perfect spiral curl.</li>
            <li> There are so many pros to this curler that anyone should really consider getting it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is just way cool people.</li>
            <li> I love this curler solely for the reason that it is fast.</li>
            <li> They are a one of a kind, inexpensive, and durable even though they are made out of soft material.</li>
            <li> the only thing I am good at: typing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cool to watch the hair go into the rotary part.</li>
            <li> You really have to make sure you dont have any tangles or else</li>
            <li> let it cool and tried again.</li>

            <li> She is able to have great curly hair with little to no fuss, and has enjoyed using it thus far.  </li>
            <li> When I first picked the curler up, I noticed that it was lightweight and easily maneuverable.</li>
            <li> it is so easy and fast!</li>
            <li> It gets too hot for her fine hair, and it didn&#x27;t hold the curl as well as this one.</li>
            <li> As long as you comb out each portion and not too much you will achieve beautiful ringlets in seconds.</li>
            <li> I recieved the product quickly and with no problems from the seller</li>
            <li> This is an extraordinary product.</li>
            <li> My sister is pregnant, and she doesn&#x27;t want to use a lot of chemicals on her hair.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo14SFOT6NMBZXC]]This video provides a quick demonstration of the MagicTec Infiniswirl hair curler (including a description of what the switches do).  </li>
            <li> Lucky me, my hair type conforms to the shape I put it in, so</li>
            <li> It seems to be well built and is probably most suitable for medium to long hair.  </li>
            <li> I started using this product on on high heat and my hair is shiny and looks so much better</li>
            <li> The very first time I put my hair into this, it sucked it up, and I couldnt get it out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Maybe a shiner mist on my hair to make it even more shiney, but I dont really have to use it since the curls are pretty as they are and</li>
            <li> packaging was pretty good, instruction don&#x27;t match with this model so that was a BIG</li>
            <li> Thanks MagicTec for making me the best husband ever this past Christmas.</li>
            <li> It really is that easy.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m pretty fond of them myself, as well)!</li>
            <li> It really saves a lot of time too!!</li>
            <li> had to be familiar with it first.</li>
            <li> to my wife, this Magic Professional Hair Curler is good for the beginner, and she wanted me to return it because taking so long to do her</li>
            <li> They all love it and think its a new and fun way of curling hair.</li>
            <li> and you should be able to complete your hair style quickly.</li>
            <li> I have fine, hard to curl hair and this gave me great spiral curls.</li>
            <li> It was so simple and easy, even a person who rarely curls her hair was able to curl it.</li>
            <li> usualy straighten up real fast, but with this machine they lasted fine without looking to much puffed like</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really rare in a curler.</li>
            <li> The purchase is worth it.</li>
            <li> Not only do I get these really nice curls every time</li>
            <li> I like to look like a lion, and my friends all laugh at me for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just having so much fun with this curler.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> but I thought it was worth a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We had fun trying it, but it didn&#x27;t work on her like it did in the video.</li>
            <li> and you can make different kind curl by controling the time.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that really is more frizz than anything.</li>
            <li> I am an elementary school teacher and mom of 4.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She loves using the Magic Tec Professional Hair Curler.</li>
            <li> She said it was fun to see her hair curly made by something like this [curler].</li>
            <li> , I used to only borrow from my sister or mother and now that I&#x27;m heading off to college, I need my own.</li>
            <li> She likes to do it for me too, since it&#x27;s really fun.</li>
            <li> I had a headful of soft, lovely curls.</li>
            <li> We both set our own temperatures, but keep the timer the same.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really fun to show off my hair to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> was so much fun</li>
            <li> I looked at the description and thought that it would be worth a try to test it out since I could always return it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this curler out, and I definitely think it was worth a try, but I am confident that it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> even flat ironed my hair afterwards, just to make sure it was \\&quot; frizz free \\&quot; thinking that might have been the problem.</li>
            <li> There is nothing more in this world that I love other than this curler.</li>
            <li> The MagicTec Professional Hair Curler is very easy to use on straight hair.  </li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> Let me tell you right now – customers have every right to worship this curler.</li>
            <li> My curls are just right.</li>
            <li> Once you get use to the right amount of hair to use, the process gets easier.</li>
            <li> I know I was doing it right</li>
            <li> I took it out of the box and tried it right away</li>
            <li> It is light, it saves my wrists from twisting, the hottest part is on the inside so it would be hard to burn yourself (which makes curling my kids hair nice and easy)...</li>
            <li> I decided to return it, and Amazon sent me a pre-paid label to send it back, which made it very easy.</li>
            <li> No other curling iron has made me this satisfied.</li>
            <li> This has been happening less often as I have used the product more and learned better how it works.</li>
            <li> Could this tool really be that cool?  </li>
            <li> Price was higher than we thought it would be but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Got the Magic Tec Professional Hair Curler today &amp; have really- seriously enjoyed getting to see the different results.</li>
            <li> My shortest layer of hair is an inch or two past my chin--I had no problems on this section, which makes me think this product might work great for anyone with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> Its a very decently made tool!</li>
            <li> I chose this product based on the video reviews of youtube, I got it yesterday and inmediatly tried it, from the first curl i got it right</li>
            <li> My first impression of this curler is that it was launched with the right marketing finesse.</li>
            <li> I was so excited that there was finally going to be a curling iron that would work on my fine hair and hold a curl.</li>
            <li> It is durable, works great, and is definitely worth the initial price you pay, because the time alone that it saves you in the long run is invaluable.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you look at the controls and switch it to right or left curl when you use it.</li>
            <li> It is very fast and it times all of my curls to perfection.</li>
            <li> This curler is very fast.</li>
            <li> Better than Most curling irons on the market, it took me less than 30 minutes to do my whole head</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I finally got my credit card to order this.</li>
            <li> It definately works better with a smaller portion of hair (tighter curl), otherwise it gave me a looser wavey look.</li>
            <li> It works great on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I really love how this curler makes it easier to work on younger kids.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t exactly accomplish this.</li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tellin people to get this curler since it REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I wanted in every way.</li>
            <li> I love it because the curls actually hold.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks so much MagicTec!</li>
            <li> It allows you to have many different styles.</li>
            <li> At first she didn&#x27;t know what it was since the box it came in looked so sleek.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to do much for them!</li>
            <li> so, so much easier!</li>
            <li> I wrap my hair in, and then my hair gets all funny looking</li>
            <li> It gives me consistent curls I can count on.</li>
            <li> I really recommend peeps to try this thing out!</li>
            <li> I was scared the first time that happened, but I just stopped clamping it, and pulled my hair out.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife for the holidays and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> My curls look shiny and pretty.</li>
            <li> the problem then, is it looks even more frizzy, especially the ends.</li>
            <li> I got it as a Christmas gift and for the first time it was a disaster</li>
            <li> After using the curlers, I noticed that not only was I able to get the look that I wanted to achieve but the curls were silky, bouncy, and longer</li>
            <li> Really pleases!</li>
            <li> the pink one is nice too</li>
            <li> You can learn how to use this automatic curler fast!</li>
            <li> Of course I had to try it out first</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that fast to use this curler!</li>
            <li> plus, the curls are so uniform and pretty.</li>
            <li> First I need to say that my hair does not like to hold curl.</li>
            <li> First...</li>
            <li> I have fairly healthy hair as I have never colored it and only use heating tools sporadically.</li>
            <li> My mom said she has never seen my hair look so pretty</li>
            <li> But it really can be used by everyone!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it even though my hair got caught a few times.</li>
            <li> It was so much fun to use, extremely easy to work with and made such pretty curls.</li>
            <li> No curl is out of line, or doesn&#x27;t curl right unless I accidentally used too much hair</li>
            <li> I do not usually write reviews.. especially when it comes to hair products of any kind.</li>
            <li> I ordered this curler a week ago and from what I can tell so far, this curler is... unique.</li>
            <li> We were excited about the MagicTec Professional Hair Curler after seeing the reviews and purchased it for our teenager.</li>
            <li> I used this curler on clean, dry hair that was free of tangles.</li>
            <li> the next morning I brush it out for a really like sexy wavy look.</li>
            <li> I sometimes iron my hair straight out just to recurl my hair again, because it really is that fun to use.</li>
            <li> Not too good because I actually didn&#x27;t get the digital one.  </li>
            <li> None the less, I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use and the curls last much longer than they did with my curling iron!</li>
            <li> Other people with super straight hair might need more spray.</li>
            <li> I take way too long using curling irons that it&#x27;ll be more curly on the side</li>
            <li> need to do more than one for long hair.</li>
            <li> It is pretty automatic, and you can adjust the size of the curls or waves by how much hair you put in at a time.</li>
            <li> Didnt believe I could achieve the same great results and speed with other curling irons.</li>
            <li> (I say medium because I just had it cut, but most would probably consider it long.</li>
            <li> I went with this product specifically because it had a 5 star rating--higher than any other similar product on Amazon, which impressed me, as well as the sheer novelty of it--I&#x27;ve never tried one like it.</li>
            <li> If one such as yourself would want an easy curler that curls well</li>
            <li> I cannot stress enough how easy it is to do my daughter&#x27;s hair now.</li>
            <li> but because it is very quick and simple to use as well.</li>
            <li> It is really easy to use and takes only minutes to do all your hair.</li>
            <li> I have to wake up super early to get my family moving and out the door.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, simple and self explanatory</li>
            <li> The cord was super long which was good because only the far outlet in my bathroom works.</li>
            <li> , I have thick long frizzy hair and had effortless beautiful curls in no time!!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t encountered a single problem with it, and its one of my favorite hair products.</li>
            <li> It works hard to keep my fill of gorgeous curls.</li>
            <li> When it comes to curlers, they break easily, get old fast, and most of the time just plain don&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> All I really have to do is wait for the beeps, indicating that it is done.</li>
            <li> It really works like a charm.</li>
            <li> As much as I like it in the shower, I don&#x27;t like the afterparty when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much hair to begin with, but this curler works fast.</li>
            <li> My response- \\&quot;very carefully.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I like it when my hair gets steamy and really curly.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much, Magictec.</li>
            <li> It really curls  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s much quicker and doesn&#x27;t chewup your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered one straight away</li>
            <li> My hair comes out looking neat, soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> As much as people say it&#x27;s jewelry or gold.</li>
            <li> I was just searching on amazon and came across it, and goodness, it&#x27;s really thought out and well made.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, the results from this curler were not poor, and the quality of the product is as described.</li>
            <li> I was very intrigued by this item, so I ordered it for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I think it would be a lot of work to do your whole head.</li>
            <li> The heat setting can go up really high!</li>
            <li> It is the highlight of my mornings before I get ready for work.</li>
            <li> I really like the design</li>
            <li> Thanks for fast shipment also</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair really shiny.</li>
            <li> This was definitely a gift she&#x27;ll enjoy for while.</li>
            <li> My curls hold really well.</li>
            <li> your hair will go into it really fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind since it makes my life so much easier.</li>
            <li> It really gives anybody a confidence boost.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the makers of this curler.  </li>
            <li> I only spray a light array of hairspray on it</li>
            <li> my hair doesn&#x27;t need too much for it to stay in.</li>
            <li> spend so much money on hair products.</li>
            <li> NEVER saw my hair curl so fast.</li>
            <li> Really reliable speeds and heats up so fast.</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair and it is extremely straight</li>
            <li> heats up fast.</li>
            <li> I got this curler because I know that it will really help my wrists.</li>
            <li> It is also very convenient as it saves time.</li>
            <li> Even with this speed, you only need one hand free.</li>
            <li> You can go to YouTube and type in Magictec Curle to see how it is done, that was very helpful to me.</li>
            <li> I have very wavy hair</li>
            <li> I make my curls so fast, I forget I even started.</li>
            <li> I saved so much time using this&lt;br /&gt;curler</li>
            <li> Try straightening your hair before using this product or brushing it really well.</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> It air dries straight.</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t think I was using it incorrectly (not to mention</li>
            <li> It is very versatile for someone that likes to change their hair up from day to day.</li>
            <li> It is really fast and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
            <li> I adore this wand so much</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to pit too much hair spray either.</li>
            <li> This is a real winner.</li>
            <li> and I will definitely come back here to buy my own.</li>
            <li> but it seems the MagicTec Professional Hair Curler may prove to be the &amp;#34;Golden Ticket!&amp;#34; Thank You!!!</li>
            <li> It curls my ends perfectly and has made doing my hair much faster over the past few months.</li>
            <li> After reading all the problems with the other name brands, and also buying the Conair, I decided to give Magic Tec at a fraction of the price a try.  </li>
            <li> The different heat settings make this Magictec great for families because my mother who has thinner hair can use a lower heat setting while I can use a higher heat setting for my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The other residents got jealous and wanted to have appointments with me more often now.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t look limp anymore since I have super fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> but it certainly damaged that small piece of hair and imagine my panic when this hot motor was gripping my hair.</li>
            <li> This magictec curler gives me really nice bouncy curls, that last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Will my hair even all fit in it since it&#x27;s long?  </li>
            <li> After watching America&#x27;s next top model, boys and girls edition, I saw how hot this one guy looked with long and wavy/curlyish hair (after his make over).</li>
            <li> I have had those super cheap, traditional curling irons for who knows how long now.</li>
            <li> I work for a salon two blocks down the road, and I visit this nursing home to give its residents new hair styles to boost happiness and energy and cut back on depression.</li>
            <li> She could only effectively fit a small group of hairs in the clamp for it to bring results as good as a traditional hair curler.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s now had it for over 3 weeks and loves it a lot more than her previous hair curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I love the sleek and black design and</li>
            <li> but I am surprised at how light it actually is.</li>
            <li> This product is super simple.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and sometimes enjoy adding some larger curls with an iron.</li>
            <li> The device is super simple to understand how to use.</li>
            <li> and I cannot find instructions for the older model anywhere.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight, shoulder length hair that does not hold a curl without tons of hairspray (and usually that doesn&#x27;t help either).</li>
            <li> I like to put the settings on really high, like all the way.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that you try it out.</li>
            <li> I do high recommend this product.</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I use it nearly every day: the product is a very high quality curler.  </li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter likes it so much</li>
            <li> I recommend this not only to people with long nails, but to everyone who just needs a better hair curler.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot and is able to curl my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Her hair is long, wavy and thick and the MagicTec works great every time.  </li>
            <li> Use very small sections, clean, smooth hair.</li>
            <li> I normally curl my hair using hot rollers, but this curler beats having to look funny and wait long periods of time!</li>
            <li> Took me a few trys to get the curls right, but after that, my curls became consistent and really pretty.</li>
            <li> so when I saw this nifty little gadget I was pretty excited.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too big of a deal though;  I will just have to experiment with it to find the right time/heat setting for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick Asian hair and it does wonders for me, but my sister has thin and very fine hair and it makes it look like she&#x27;s got more hair than many people out there.</li>
            <li> ALL OTHER CURLERS ARE TOO CHEAP TO EVEN HOLD 15 MINS.</li>
            <li> Other then turning on the power and the light coming on...</li>
            <li> This product is something completely new to me.</li>
            <li> I used in on Christmas day to go to our new in-law&#x27;s house.</li>
            <li> This curler is professional and fun at the same time.</li>
            <li> She did not tell me at first, but after constant nagging, she told me about this product.</li>
            <li> This is my first curling iron and definitely.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> This is the first product that actually works!!</li>
            <li> matter what curler you are thinking about getting, this one will most likely beat it to a bloody pulp lol.  </li>
            <li> I did notice that if I clamped my hair lower, say half way, then it seemed to curl/suck up fine.  </li>
            <li> First I separated my hair into multiple layers and sections and ran a brush through each section repeatedly before inserting into this torture device.</li>
            <li> Your hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck, just make sure you curl your hair in small sections.</li>
            <li> Even my 9 year old granddaughter can use it!</li>
            <li> My old one didn&#x27;t get hot enough to heat the hair wrapped around it.</li>
            <li> She finally admit embarrassingly that she really loves her new gift...</li>
            <li> So I washed my hair and applied a light conditioner and regular blow dry.</li>
            <li> They come out pretty hot if you have high settings on, but that&#x27;s alright since the curls stay curly for a very long long time!</li>
            <li> I got it, plugged it in and just used it really quick to see how it worked since I had to run to the store and do other errands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rate it 4.5 stars but there is no &#x27;half&#x27; here to do so...thanks!</li>
            <li> I love the look of curls, but have always had a hard time using a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Took me a bunch of google searches to figure out I had the older model but the instructions in the box were for the new model with digital instructions.</li>
            <li> So, I grew out my hair, and got this automatic curler because those old curling irons look like a bit</li>
            <li> Never had I used such a curler before, but I was very astonished at the ease at which I could curl my hair.</li>
            <li> natural looks are in.</li>
            <li> I will also note that I am a licensed professional, but do not work for this company.  </li>
            <li> Really, anything I do puts me at risk for breaking my nails and immense pain.</li>
            <li> This curling iron can work wonders, and I far from regret my decision to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Frankly it does not take an expert stylist to give professional curls anymore.</li>
            <li> I received the MagicTec Professional Hair Curler 2 days ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love how everyone has been asking about my hair as of late.</li>
            <li> There has yet been a curler that allows you to change the direction of the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, most curling irons require you to manually do it and it gets confusing after a while, when you start doing your hair with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, I love the fact that it sucks my hair in and curls it, and all I have to do is hold it.</li>
            <li> She likes that she doesn&#x27;t burn her fingers and scalp like the old curling iron she was using.  </li>
            <li> and she has not had any problems so far.  </li>
            <li> But I was happily surprised when it worked.</li>
            <li> &amp; so I have been very sceptical about a a curler that would actually curl &amp; remain curled</li>
            <li> It has saved me from being late on more than one occasion.</li>
            <li> So fast yet so simple; It makes life easier.</li>
            <li> It took about 30 to 45 minutes the first time curling it, but now that I know how to do it , curling my hair shouldn&#x27;t take as long.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s natural, so to get the curls</li>
            <li> Let me preface this review by saying I am a frequent Amazon shopper, however, I have never reviewed any product until now.</li>
            <li> After trying it, though, I am completely baffled as to how it has earned 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, but has lost a lot of it&#x27;s curl as I age.  </li>
            <li> As far as the curls lasting a long time, that part isn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li> It would be better if it is waterproof and can allow to curl thick portion of hair.</li>
            <li> How could I go wrong when everyone else loved</li>
            <li> They are easy to fasten and very compact to keep in small places like a purse especially if a person needs to use them in emergency cases.</li>
            <li> I tested my older curler on one side and this new one on the other, and in my opinion, you really shouldn&#x27;t pass this one up.</li>
            <li> I mean they were ok to use.</li>
            <li> And over the years, parts of it have grown out straight, while other parts are still very curly.</li>
            <li> I have very straight hair, that used to never curl and have always wanted loose wavy curls.</li>
            <li> So one of my close friends has had the same old hair style since junior high.</li>
            <li> This is such a new idea!</li>
            <li> When I say hot, I mean how hot I look with these curls!</li>
            <li> This curling iron would be best suited for those with serious hair-styling goals of consistent and high-quality and is not necessarily for the casual self-stylist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive to keep buying coffee, more cheaper to curl hair fast!</li>
            <li> My daughter looks like a little angel when she&#x27;s in full curls after using this product.</li>
            <li> Conversely, I rely heavily on product reviews when making my purchasing decisions, which is why I feel so strongly about giving my personal feedback on this item.</li>
            <li> My straight hair curls like a charm and doesn&#x27;t get undone at all for a long time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to get my curls ready with this curler.</li>
            <li> At the end of this entire process, I was horrified to see my sink full of broken, ripped strands of hair, along with several huge knotted wads and a pile of hair at my feet.</li>
            <li> You may be thinking this is due to user error, and perhaps there are better methods, but as I was curling my hair for over an hour and a half, you&#x27;d think that would allow for plenty of opportunity to improve my technique.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless you have shoulder length, Asian silky straight hair or left handed... STAY AWAY!</li>
            <li> I have long hair [past my waist] and I love to curl just my ends and my bangs.  </li>
            <li> It curls right, it doesn&#x27;t burn your hands since there&#x27;s no extremely hot surface to touch, AND it has a neat timer and alarm to tell you when your hair is done!</li>
            <li> My wife had never heard of this product before but after using it for the first time (and the 10 other times already after that)</li>
            <li> By using such tiny sections, you can only achieve a certain type of curl, and for me, it was not the look</li>
            <li> The curling mechanism is very consistent in that there is little to no room for error other than putting too much hair into it.</li>
            <li> I gave up on using curling irons, and also curling in general until I found this tool.</li>
            <li> My hair generally has no problem holding a curl.</li>
            <li> I really like this not only because I have long nails</li>
            <li> And just let me reiterate: I was using exceedingly small sections of smooth hair, but it would still tangle all the same.</li>
            <li> I might even go as far as saying that this might be the future of hair curling.</li>
            <li> Professional is the key word here!</li>
            <li> She would spend nearly an hour curling her hair with the traditional curler.  </li>
            <li> So much easier than I expected</li>
            <li> So much easier than I expected</li>
            <li> I did have to learn to be careful and not put too much hair in it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good at expressing myself, so using this curler helped me create a new look and new person that is a little bit more outspoken.</li>
            <li> Most of the time the machine would release my hair with a little tugging, but the worst part was the dozen or so times that a section of hair would become so entangled that I feared it was stuck for good!</li>
            <li> generally write reviews for children&#x27;s novels on other sites, since I like to read, but this peculiar curler has caught my utmost attention after my first initial use.</li>
            <li> this cute curler seriously does what everyone else says!</li>
            <li> Now though, it takes less than 15 minutes and the curls are extremely consistent.  </li>
            <li> I would have given up after completing the first half of my head, but I kept going just to see if it would get easier as I went along and found my groove</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited to play around with the other settings (e.g., shorter time) of the MagticTec to see what other types of curls can be achieved.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron, I&#x27;ve only used it once, and didn&#x27;t have any real problems other than lack of coordination and short arms that have a hard time curling the back of my head</li>
            <li> Then I realized that this tool besides being heavy, is impossible to use if you are RIGHT HANDED, if you hold it with your right hand, and want the side pointing to your head it flips the unit upside down..No matter what you do.&lt;br /&gt;- After contortioning myself and managed to put my first strand of hair in the unit, It swallowed my hair and right away the smell of burnt motor.</li>
            <li> I was able to get a few pieces to kind of curl...but not impressive and not easily.</li>
            <li> It took me 25-30 mins to curl my hair with an old standard clip curling iron and this one takes me only about 10 mins.</li>
            <li> No other curler works with the same ease.</li>
            <li> I only have to press a few buttons to get the thing going; which is a lot better than having to spin all of my hair around a little rod.</li>
            <li> I have extremely long nails which makes pretty much any task (including typing) really hard for me.</li>
            <li> I am a 55 year old woman with long hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter is not inexperienced in doing her hair with different tools.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to fix any mistakes, say, if you sectioned out too much hair, or too little, or if you curled the wrong direction.</li>
            <li> However, the previous customer reviews on this curling iron seemed very approving .</li>
            <li> Wrapping hair around typical irons is too much of a hassle and hazard.</li>
            <li> I have long hair making it hard to curl with any other curling iron, and on top of that I have no idea</li>
            <li> When I first thought of purchasing the curlers, I was a little bit apprehensive!</li>
            <li> Even when you think you&#x27;re using a very small section of hair, it&#x27;s still too much for this thing, which means it takes an exceedingly long time to finish your whole head.</li>
            <li> I learned a little earlier that if you hair spray the strand you want to curl before putting it into the machine that curls last much, much longer than just curling it.</li>
            <li> My hair is super thick and fairly long and does not hold a curl, ever.</li>
            <li> Actually, it wasn&#x27;t until I got this curler that I started experimenting with curling styles; mean curls vs cute curls vs lazy curls.</li>
            <li> I have medium to long hair, 4-5 inches past my shoulders, that is smooth in texture, straight and very thick</li>
            <li> Hot rollers are so hard to use, and those foamy clip ons just dont work at all.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much luck in the past with curling my hair using rollers, it seemed to just kink and the curls would fall out,</li>
            <li> but I usually end up not doing it just because I think of how much time and effort is takes.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse grey hair.  </li>
            <li> The curls come out hot to the touch when put on the highest setting, but I like it on max heat, since my thick hair can take it.  </li>
            <li> I let me little sister who&#x27;s only 10 years old try it on me</li>
            <li> And I mean FAST!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using them are easy and when I am sleeping, I do not have to worry about them being uncomfortable or falling out in the bed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- When I pulled the curler out of the box, I was very surprised how HEAVY it</li>
            <li> So I usually blow dry my whole head to straighten it all..</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;re limited to smaller strands if you have long hair, thus it takes longer to curl your hair.</li>
            <li> directions are vague with no pictures to demonstrate how to use this product like most other hair devices.  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is straight and hard to curl.</li>
            <li> My hair will sometimes get caught in the twisting mechanism and I will have to jerk it out to free it which is scary, but has not damaged my hair.</li>
            <li> So, you can imagine how long I take when I&#x27;m in the shower.</li>
            <li> They hold really long and well.</li>
            <li> was surprised that there were so few reports of hair getting stuck in the reviews, considering it happened to us about 25% of the time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, despite the few mishaps, I doubt I will use my old curling iron again</li>
            <li> I was asked how I did my hair by my co-worker with my long nails.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair get this.</li>
            <li> ( I have long wavy, medium/fine hair )</li>
            <li> Your hair will get caught if it&#x27;s long.</li>
            <li> My hair is about 24inches long.  </li>
            <li> It took some time since coarse hair is harder to curl</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take that long, either.</li>
            <li> The reason I only give 4 stars is because, if you do have frizzy hair.. you definitely have to put some product in still to keep the frizz down.</li>
            <li> Now, I ask myself why I waited so long to get one!</li>
            <li> this video, I compare this product with other similar products and address the issue of getting hair caught in the curling iron.</li>
            <li> After looking at other hair curling devices such as this one and comparing prices, product weight, ect...</li>
            <li> But, they took way too long to heat up!</li>
            <li> I tried to section off very small portions of hair to curl, because if you put too much in, it will tangle and get snarled into the curling chamber while your hair fries.</li>
            <li> So, I opt in to get this curler and my curls stay for so long!</li>
            <li> Her hair isn&#x27;t very long</li>
            <li> Got this curling iron for my daughter who has very long hair and likes to curl it every now again.  </li>
            <li> A few days later, I finally decided to purchase this curler.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> and it holds all day long without a single ounce of hairspray to hold it in place!</li>
            <li> This is the first curler I&#x27;ve purchased in several years, and I&#x27;m super shocked at the results!</li>
            <li> Once I bushed through the curls and ran my fingers through repeatedly, the final look was not too shabby, but it was absolutely not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> The only time it isn&#x27;t down is when she is working out.</li>
            <li> And it looks less damage to hair than regular iron.</li>
            <li> , my sister in law was with me and tried it as well and ordered one in that moment, the curls lasted the whole night wich is wierd for me because i have long thin hair and curls</li>
            <li> The one thing every single review said you didn&#x27;t need to worry about!</li>
            <li> Well, it helped a little bit because I could manage to curl about 4 inches at the end, but when I tried again close to the head same thing happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The thing that really surprised me, is I dropped it on my hard bathroom floor, and it still works..</li>
            <li> This MagicTec curler has been in production for longer than other similar curlers, it is slightly lighter weight, and it was $10 cheaper....</li>
            <li> I have naturally thin, straight hair</li>
            <li> There are minimal instructions on how to use the device and as I sat there with my hair stuck, I was wishing there was a Reverse button on the curler.</li>
            <li> What I expected to be at least a three pound dumbbell amounted to only a third of that.</li>
            <li> For the last few years my beauty appliance obsession has been my trusty hair straightener.</li>
            <li> but i returned it the next day, its heavy and my hair got tangled in it.</li>
            <li> Well, I bit the bullet and bought it anyway because I was curious.</li>
            <li> I want to give it minus 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It took me only a few minutes to get use to the functions.</li>
            <li> Once in a while, a younger woman or two would be admitted but they would get released a few weeks after.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but I think it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> It took a bit of time so don&#x27;t get impatient and cut your hair, that should be last resort.</li>
            <li> There is really no learning curve.</li>
            <li> Well I am not much of a writer</li>
            <li> I have been curling my hair every other morning because there is really no need to curl every day since the curls stay for longer than a day.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product after receiving the infinity secret curl for Christmas and was so disappointed with that I returned it and then purchased this one.  </li>
            <li> She always wears her long black hair down.</li>
            <li> And my other friend was like, \\&quot;I&#x27;ll get one, but still bring it over so you can do it for me.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> One other problem, is that the instructions that it comes with doesn&#x27;t match my model.  </li>
            <li> My curler only has 3 switches, and none of them are explained in the small instruction booklet.  </li>
            <li> I would my other curling irons.</li>
            <li> It was weird at first, not having to manually wrap the hair around, like as in curling irons.</li>
            <li> and I think other should try it out too.</li>
            <li> I watched the video, and also went to YouTube to see if there were any other demonstrations.</li>
            <li> I had read reviews that other brands had issues such as being too heavy to hold up for an extended period of time and also that they would get users hair caught inside the device!</li>
            <li> The small plastic arm on the inner chamber broke off.</li>
            <li> i tried other curler</li>
            <li> The other neat part is that you can get tighter curls by upping the time and/or heat setting and looser curls by lower the heat</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first...</li>
            <li> She also has other kids, so she doesn&#x27;t have a lot of time and patience for fixing her hair these days.</li>
            <li> I thought that maybe the curlers would produce the same type of curls that all of the other curlers that I had used in the past would produce.</li>
            <li> Usually, I get frizzy curls that don&#x27;t last!</li>
            <li> I feel like it is faster than any other curling iron I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that the heat settings are easier on my hair than other curling irons.</li>
            <li> After this process, the section of hair would be gnarled and fried and frizzy, and would only get tangled worse the next time I tried to insert it, even after carefully brushing it out again.</li>
            <li> I just wished that I had another one that I can keep at my office...and another one for my friend...and another one for my mom....and another one in my other bathroom....</li>
            <li> forward to other items for my hair from this company</li>
            <li> You can make your curl as loose or as tight as you would like</li>
            <li> You can make it tight and curly or loose and wavy.</li>
            <li> It does take a little getting used to, but after a few attempts it becomes second nature.  </li>
            <li> I guess all that hard training with my old wand went to waste.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair and lots of it, so it takes me about 30 minutes to curl it and only from about half of its length.</li>
            <li> Infini-swirl makes my curls stay in for a long time, something I&#x27;ve tried with every curling iron and any other curling invention and it doesn&#x27;t usually work but with this it did.</li>
            <li> The curler can be very finicky and, since my hair is so thick, I have to feed very small portions of it in order for them to curl correctly.</li>
            <li> After reading certain reviews about this product and seeing the price, I was a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> when I picked it up, I expected something a little heavier.</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical that it would do well with her length, but it really gives a lot of body and fullness.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, but I usually get it done in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> This curler is really not that heavy.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s Asian, and has thick, wiry hair.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t matter if I had hair in it or was just holding it down to test it.</li>
            <li> that said, this thing tangled and tore my hair like none other!</li>
            <li> It curls faster than any other curler I&#x27;ve had!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First I was extremely disappointed with the \\&quot;cheap box\\&quot; and lack of instructions documents ( I&#x27;ve used 2 other brands</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t finish my whole head of hair because of it (and I have very thin hair and not a lot of it).</li>
            <li> Much less curl it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time in the morning to use a typical curling iron.</li>
            <li> It takes me less than 15 minutes to curl all of my hair.</li>
            <li> I had owned one previously that I didn&#x27;t like using.</li>
            <li> She has cut her curling time in half (about 10-15 minutes) vs. 30 minutes before.  </li>
            <li> but I decided to just get the black one.</li>
            <li> so maybe it works for people with less hair.  </li>
            <li> A hair-do that would normally take hours (and quite a few burns and annoying tangles) now takes me mere minutes and looks even better.</li>
            <li> Each time this happened, I unplugged the curler and carefully pulled the hair as hard as I could, literally afraid I was going to rip the hair right in half.</li>
            <li> I purchased a regular curling iron from babyliss, found im not good at use that, and got burn sometime.</li>
            <li> My hair is all mess.</li>
            <li> Simply put, other curling irons are outdated.</li>
            <li> My big sister has super-duper hard to curl hair and we adjusted the heat, and it curled!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend wanted this curling iron for a while, but I was a little concerned about the price.</li>
            <li> It takes little effort on my part to fix my hair in the morning now because I use this curler.</li>
            <li> Her hair came out looking a little stringy.</li>
            <li> You can choose to put in a lot of hair or a little bit.</li>
            <li> It does take a little getting use to -</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve already done four little girls&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After a little while, the machine just didn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> little background info:</li>
            <li> but on days where I&#x27;m a little sleepy, she might beat me.</li>
            <li> It looks really heavy in pictures</li>
            <li> I have thin, utterly lifeless hair that refuses to hold a curl from my iron.</li>
            <li> I would get uneven curls or it would fall out while I&#x27;m sleeping.</li>
            <li> had to remove one star because there were a few times when my hair got sucked in and would not come out without yanking it out.</li>
            <li> I always had trouble using curling irons since I keep accidentally burning myself.</li>
            <li> have a few people in mind that I will buy this curler as a gift for them.</li>
            <li> My mom has been using it for a few weeks now and LOVES it.</li>
            <li> The beauty of using it is I&#x27;d never need to spend over two hours and a few tens of dollars at the barber&#x27;s any longer.</li>
            <li> So, there are a few things on the controls I don&#x27;t understand and have nothing I can look at to find out what they do.</li>
            <li> I curled my hair yesterday and even after sleeping on it, a few of my curls still reside.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that usually take over an hour to curl</li>
            <li> I have noticed that if I go back over the curls for some reason a few times.. it frizzes out worse.</li>
            <li> It usually gets stuck when I use the iron closer to my head, when I use it about 4-5 inches down, it tends not to get stuck.</li>
            <li> This is a very worth while purchase, especially if you are terrible at curling hair with curling irons.</li>
            <li> I got the curls that I wanted in less than 15min!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is so unbelievably easy to use you will be shocked!</li>
            <li> I have thin, long hair</li>
            <li> She was getting a little hysterical by the time we were able to get all the hair out - some of which just broke off from the damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being black, it&#x27;s hard to do your hair.</li>
            <li> Children these days rarely bother visiting their chronically ill parents or grandparents and it makes them sad.</li>
            <li> My sisters hair is a few inches past her shoulders, and it got stuck on her 3rd curl attempt and it was really difficult to get it out.</li>
            <li> Of course, I still watch her for her safety but with this curler, there is very little</li>
            <li> Not many curlers have a LED screen like this one.</li>
            <li> Gosh, she&#x27;s so lazy</li>
            <li> As she was almost finished, a small piece came out of the inside and it would no longer work.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to grow my hair longer - like past my booty.</li>
            <li> No more burnt fingers, can customize the size of the curls too.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is anything wrong with this one as opposed to a different brand.</li>
            <li> (I did select small sections of hair at a time)</li>
            <li> Hopefully boring straight hair will come back in style&lt;</li>
            <li> She had a bad experience with normal curling irons that she refuses to get her hair curled, but when I explained it to her that it wont burn her</li>
            <li> It feels tedious to even blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> so I am having a hard time figuring out how to use it.....</li>
            <li> At least her face showed it this time.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> Not once has anyone said anything negative about my hair.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR TOO THICK</li>
            <li> BUT if I were inexperienced I would have been very confused by the lack of directions ).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean, who has ever heard of an automatic curler before,</li>
            <li> I hated doing that since I sometimes accidentally touch the hot iron.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to curl with any lasting effect.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews and watch video had had serious doubts.  </li>
            <li> I lovee doing my hair up in different styles and this bad boy allows me to do just that.</li>
            <li> There is no release button (bad design), and therefore I had to pull my hair out of the curling iron which was very difficult because you cant see where exactly its stuck.  </li>
            <li> I have been skeptical in the past to buy one of these automatic curlers.</li>
            <li> Hands down this is the winner!!!!</li>
            <li> For instance I have medium length or shoulder length very thick dense</li>
            <li> It made it on time and when she opened it, she was confused</li>
            <li> (and she doesn&#x27;t give false compliments).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously wayyy to obsessed with using this product.</li>
            <li> Ah, silly, me...comparing food to hair.</li>
            <li> AND.... a bit skeptical.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scary when it happens.</li>
            <li> When it gets stuck, it&#x27;s not too difficult to yank out.</li>
            <li> The curler gave a weird beep, indicating an error, but I had no clue</li>
            <li> what I did wrong.</li>
            <li> I see that can go wrong.</li>
            <li> I once got such a terrible burn that took 3 months to heal on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Curls are kept in my hair even if I accidentally brush it with the wrong brush.</li>
            <li> It takes mere seconds to heat up and curling is a breeze.</li>
            <li> I decided to order it even though it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had mediocre results</li>
            <li> Replacing them time and time again and always looking for alternatives gets expensive for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, we cannot give it the rave review we were hoping for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;very scary experience.</li>
            <li> Usually because I am disappointed in them.</li>
            <li> or if there is something wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Sadly i don&#x27;t have this iron.</li>
            <li> Eventually the it would come out, looking fried and knotted and sad.</li>
            <li> Worthless and confusing directions.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, this process was PAINFUL, frightening and frustrating!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also sick and tired of burning my fingers on curling irons too.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want it to be disappointing.  </li>
            <li> This curler is soooo crazy</li>
            <li> I was unhappy.</li>
            <li> your hair gets caught in there, it will be very difficult to get it out!&lt;br</li>
            <li> You did the impossible.</li>
            <li> The people who have bad reviews of there hair getting ripped out probably didn&#x27;t read the directions.</li>
            <li> but I read a lot of bad reviews on it.  </li>
            <li> She uses it all the time and has not had one bad thing to say about it.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> It was just too painful.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s already tried the Conair version, but she hated the way it tapers to a point.</li>
            <li> The temperature I want is there, and there&#x27;s nothing bad about it!!</li>
            <li> And then the worst thing happened!..</li>
            <li> It was horrible and I struggled from start to finish.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> There is a lady whom works at my office and she would always have perfectly symmetrical curls on both sides of her head. Up until a month ago, I had no idea how she was able to curl her hair so perfectly and precisely on both sides. I tried and tried to perfect my curling techniques and I became very good, but I was not able to reproduce symmetry on both sides as did my co-worker. Fed up, I confronted her. She did not tell me at first, but after constant nagging, she told me about this product. Up until this point, I had no idea that such a hair wand existed. That evening, I went home and purchased this product online. About a week later, it came in the mail and I played around with it. It has a reversible curling feature which basically allows curls to be spun in both directions. That combined with the same amount of time on both sides will allow for perfect curls. I guess all that hard training with my old wand went to waste.</li>
            <li> this cute curler seriously does what everyone else says! It curls right, it doesn&#x27;t burn your hands since there&#x27;s no extremely hot surface to touch, AND it has a neat timer and alarm to tell you when your hair is done! Like an oven that cooks food to perfection. Ah, silly, me...comparing food to hair. If my curls were edible, I&#x27;d eat it! It&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> Not many curlers have a LED screen like this one. Nor, are there many automatic curlers out there either. Having a screen is soo convenient. I can easily see what my settings are, and I like being able to pick the exact temperature that I want too. That&#x27;s really rare in a curler. The purchase is worth it. I&#x27;ll get another one just to leave at my work place so I can do my hair, and maybe my co-worker&#x27;s hair during break or something.</li>
            <li> This curler is really not that heavy. It looks really heavy in pictures but I am surprised at how light it actually is. This product is something completely new to me. I mean, who has ever heard of an automatic curler before, right? It is very fast and it times all of my curls to perfection. All I really have to do is wait for the beeps, indicating that it is done.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nobody that says that a guy can&#x27;t use a hair curler. After watching America&#x27;s next top model, boys and girls edition, I saw how hot this one guy looked with long and wavy/curlyish hair (after his make over). Like, since I sort of look like him, I figured, why not. So, I grew out my hair, and got this automatic curler because those old curling irons look like a bit** to use. This thing is as easy to use as saying my A, B, C&#x27;s. Now, I look fabulous.</li>
            <li> I got it, plugged it in and just used it really quick to see how it worked since I had to run to the store and do other errands. It really works like a charm. I made two curls and then went out to do my errands. Came back home 5 hours later and those two curls were still curly without any hairgel or spray and I was shocked. This curler is really good. I decided to finish the rest of my head and I probably could have done all of it when I tested it out since it didn&#x27;t take any time at all.</li>
            <li> I take great care of my hair, I shampoo twice and let conditioner sit in my hair for 15+minutes. So, you can imagine how long I take when I&#x27;m in the shower. As much as I like it in the shower, I don&#x27;t like the afterparty when I get out of the shower. It feels tedious to even blow dry my hair. Much less curl it. I thought that this curler would change that, and it did, I now like drying my hair or straightening it just so I can just use the curler since it&#x27;s so therapeutic watching nice curls come out.</li>
            <li> Dear review readers,&lt;br /&gt;I am writing this review to inform you on what I have experienced while using this curler.&lt;br /&gt;I generally write reviews for children&#x27;s novels on other sites, since I like to read, but this peculiar curler has caught my utmost attention after my first initial use. Never had I used such a curler before, but I was very astonished at the ease at which I could curl my hair. I tested the curls to see if they would withstand tugging and pulling, and they passed my tests with flying colors. The curls would stay curled even if I did not use my Garnier hairspray. If one such as yourself would want an easy curler that curls well, I suggest you get this curler.</li>
            <li> like, I love how strong my curls are. They hold really long and well. I don;t bother with using any additional hair products. Maybe a shiner mist on my hair to make it even more shiney, but I dont really have to use it since the curls are pretty as they are and natural looks are in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I finally got my credit card to order this. This is a very worth while purchase, especially if you are terrible at curling hair with curling irons. I take way too long using curling irons that it&#x27;ll be more curly on the side I just finished than the side I started with. This curler allows me to finish all my hair and will look even all over! Very good!</li>
            <li> I have thin, utterly lifeless hair that refuses to hold a curl from my iron. I started using this product on on high heat and my hair is shiny and looks so much better than it does before I use it! My curls last all night and the next morning I brush it out for a really like sexy wavy look. It doesn&#x27;t frizz my hair or anything. Its a very decently made tool!</li>
            <li> This is a genuinely solid product. The design is very advanced for a curler, and the rate at which it produces curls is phenomenal! I have yet to see anything like this before, and this product deserves all the stars.</li>
            <li> I have been skeptical in the past to buy one of these automatic curlers. Now, I ask myself why I waited so long to get one! This curler exhibits the best technology and functionality I have ever experienced in a curler. MagicTec did a wonderful job with coming out with this! I salute to you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that will replace my foam curlers since they literally suck balls. I would get uneven curls or it would fall out while I&#x27;m sleeping. I don&#x27;t have time in the morning to use a typical curling iron. All that changed when I bought me one of these! It does a magnificent job on my hair, and my curls are soooo pretty. I curl my hair in like 5 minutes. I don&#x27;t have much hair to begin with, but this curler works fast. And I mean FAST!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo28YIAXU302AKS]]I stumbled onto this product when a Facebook friend shared their demo video.  I was so excited!  AND.... a bit skeptical.  Won&#x27;t my hair get all tangled in it?  Will my hair even all fit in it since it&#x27;s long?  I didn&#x27;t want it to be disappointing.  Could this tool really be that cool?  IT IS!  It is light, it saves my wrists from twisting, the hottest part is on the inside so it would be hard to burn yourself (which makes curling my kids hair nice and easy)... I could go on and on.  Really this is one of the most fun Hair Tools I have ever bought, and I am excited to share a demo/review with you.  I will also note that I am a licensed professional, but do not work for this company.  This is an independent review.  Infini-Swirl by MagicTec rocks!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first curling iron and definitely. the best! I did my research for while in order to get the best one. I got the curls that I wanted in less than 15min! Wow! Definitely. gets the job done! I love it and would recommend it to anyone! Thank you so much for the great product!</li>
            <li> The product is very cool when it works, but my hair gets stuck easily and too often. It&#x27;s scary when it happens. My hair is shoulder length, and I followed the instructions about using the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; side close to the head. When it gets stuck, it&#x27;s not too difficult to yank out. It usually gets stuck when I use the iron closer to my head, when I use it about 4-5 inches down, it tends not to get stuck. My sisters hair is a few inches past her shoulders, and it got stuck on her 3rd curl attempt and it was really difficult to get it out. She was getting a little hysterical by the time we were able to get all the hair out - some of which just broke off from the damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that there were so few reports of hair getting stuck in the reviews, considering it happened to us about 25% of the time. I&#x27;m wondering if we just got a lemon. In any case, I&#x27;m planning on returning the iron and buying the Miracurl.</li>
            <li> I saw this product had great reviews so I was excited when I got it for Christmas! I have naturally thin, straight hair and I don&#x27;t curl my hair often because it requires a lot of effort and it never curls the way I want it to. I was quite impressed that I could curl my entire head without a mirror (and burning myself)! I love that it gave a consistent curl from top to bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to remove one star because there were a few times when my hair got sucked in and would not come out without yanking it out. The curler gave a weird beep, indicating an error, but I had no clue what I did wrong. There are minimal instructions on how to use the device and as I sat there with my hair stuck, I was wishing there was a Reverse button on the curler. After repeating this mistake a few times, I found out that it was because I was putting too much hair in the curler. This would have been helpful in the instructions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, despite the few mishaps, I doubt I will use my old curling iron again and I&#x27;m excited to play around with the other settings (e.g., shorter time) of the MagticTec to see what other types of curls can be achieved.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend wanted this curling iron for a while, but I was a little concerned about the price. She&#x27;s already tried the Conair version, but she hated the way it tapers to a point. It gets too hot for her fine hair, and it didn&#x27;t hold the curl as well as this one. With this one, she gets the beachy waves of her dreams (I&#x27;m pretty fond of them myself, as well)! Lovin&#x27; it!</li>
            <li> I have fine, hard to curl hair and this gave me great spiral curls. It definately works better with a smaller portion of hair (tighter curl), otherwise it gave me a looser wavey look. I just followed instructions and it was easy to use. I definately recommend!</li>
            <li> This product is super simple. I cannot stress enough how easy it is to do my daughter&#x27;s hair now. Basically, my hair curling job has been reduced to stranding my daughter&#x27;s hair through the device. After that, I let her sit there the timer goes off. She loves the fact that she can do her own hair now. Of course, I still watch her for her safety but with this curler, there is very little I see that can go wrong. Actually, the only problem I have had with this curler is that she keeps wanting to take the curler without my permission. Mommy then proceeded to hide the thing in a place where she has no access to. None the less, I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and sometimes enjoy adding some larger curls with an iron. I gave it 5 stars because of how easy it is to use and how well the curls stay in my hair.This works well, but I haven&#x27;t figured out how to change the size of the curl.</li>
            <li> I have extremely long nails which makes pretty much any task (including typing) really hard for me. Really, anything I do puts me at risk for breaking my nails and immense pain. I was asked how I did my hair by my co-worker with my long nails. My response- \\&quot;very carefully.\\&quot; He told me that they have a curler on the market that can curl my hair automatically. I asked him what he meant. He said that all I have to do is put my hair in the device and it will spin it like a dryer would spin your clothes. I went online and found this thing. A few days later, I finally decided to purchase this curler.&lt;br /&gt;Now when I picked it up, I expected something a little heavier. The cord was super long which was good because only the far outlet in my bathroom works. I only have to press a few buttons to get the thing going; which is a lot better than having to spin all of my hair around a little rod. I really like this not only because I have long nails but because it is very quick and simple to use as well. I recommend this not only to people with long nails, but to everyone who just needs a better hair curler. This is the one.</li>
            <li> Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in the longest time. Not only do I get these really nice curls every time, I get to bond with my friends when ever they come over. They seem to come over a lot more just to use my curler. I recommended that they get their own, and one of them was like, \\&quot;I&#x27;ll get two, when payday comes, one for me and my sister.\\&quot; And my other friend was like, \\&quot;I&#x27;ll get one, but still bring it over so you can do it for me.\\&quot; Gosh, she&#x27;s so lazy but I love her and this curler to death. I like to put the settings on really high, like all the way. I like it when my hair gets steamy and really curly. I like to look like a lion, and my friends all laugh at me for it. I just roar at them back. It&#x27;s alright, I&#x27;m just having so much fun with this curler. Anyone would too, if they got one!</li>
            <li> The Magictec infini-swirl is a fascinating product that utilizes advanced technology to produce some amazing curls. It is so safe to use and works so quickly. A hair-do that would normally take hours (and quite a few burns and annoying tangles) now takes me mere minutes and looks even better. I haven&#x27;t encountered a single problem with it, and its one of my favorite hair products. I come out of the bathroom looking like I just went to a salon, which gives my confidence a boost, helping me feel better about myself all day. This curling iron can work wonders, and I far from regret my decision to purchase it. Thanks so much, Magictec.</li>
            <li> Great but you&#x27;re limited to smaller strands if you have long hair, thus it takes longer to curl your hair.</li>
            <li> This is a must have. If you have long hair get this. It really curls  you r hair. It&#x27;s worth the money. The grand kids love it.its a mut have for my family</li>
            <li> WOOOOO HOOOOOOOOO BABY!!! I&#x27;m seriously wayyy to obsessed with using this product. I will outright promote for them whenever I can because it&#x27;s such a good product. I tell all my friends and family, and make them tell their friends and family too. It&#x27;s such a neat product to just overlook and pass on. My curls are overly perfect. The handle is easy to hold and release. The temperature I want is there, and there&#x27;s nothing bad about it!!</li>
            <li> I am now a hugeee fan of magictec. This curler is one of a kind. I have very straight hair, that used to never curl and have always wanted loose wavy curls. This is the one product that helped me achieve those results. No other curling iron has made me this satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is such a new idea! Who would have thought that curling irons can become automatic?! I normally curl my hair using hot rollers, but this curler beats having to look funny and wait long periods of time! It really saves a lot of time too!! It is really easy to use and takes only minutes to do all your hair. I love it!</li>
            <li> When I say hot, I mean how hot I look with these curls! They come out pretty hot if you have high settings on, but that&#x27;s alright since the curls stay curly for a very long long time! It works great on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter looks like a little angel when she&#x27;s in full curls after using this product. She loves to show off to her friends at school. I really love how this curler makes it easier to work on younger kids. Since the iron isn&#x27;t exposed, I don&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally burning my child when she squirms around. Very safe for usage on children!</li>
            <li> I ordered this curler a week ago and from what I can tell so far, this curler is... unique. Online pictures do this curling iron no justice – presenting a product that appears bulky and head-heavy... Do not let but an image sway your judgment upon anything. However, the previous customer reviews on this curling iron seemed very approving . That is why, despite what I imagined it to be, I purchased this product. Let me tell you right now – customers have every right to worship this curler. When I first picked the curler up, I noticed that it was lightweight and easily maneuverable. What I expected to be at least a three pound dumbbell amounted to only a third of that. The curling mechanism is very consistent in that there is little to no room for error other than putting too much hair into it. The timer is an added bonus so you don&#x27;t have to worry about burning your hair. So far, this is the best curling iron I have ever owned. Simply put, other curling irons are outdated. This iron has current technology infused into its design. I might even go as far as saying that this might be the future of hair curling. It takes humanistic error and replaces it with technological precision. Frankly it does not take an expert stylist to give professional curls anymore. That is why this curler is unique.</li>
            <li> I always read the reviews to help decide the item to buy and then compare the price on ebay and Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I try to use Amazon because they have very good returns even though I don&#x27;t take advantage of it.&lt;br /&gt;This item have VERY good reviews that I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;My wife just asked me to buy $20~30 regular curler and I decided to surprise her with this.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was pretty good, instruction don&#x27;t match with this model so that was a BIG minus.&lt;br /&gt;According to my wife, this Magic Professional Hair Curler is good for the beginner, and she wanted me to return it because taking so long to do her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite all the 5star reviews, I think they deserve 3 stars on my wife&#x27;s point of view.</li>
            <li> Great! This curler is so easy to use and we love it! Price was higher than we thought it would be but well worth it. Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I have tried many curling irons, but this is by far the best one! It sucks in your hair and spits out a perfect spiral curl. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I received the MagicTec Professional Hair Curler 2 days ago.&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited to try this \\&quot;brand\\&quot; of hair curler after reading so many positive reviews about it. Being a hair stylist for over 20 years, I always buy the latest \\&quot;toys\\&quot; and test them. I&#x27;ve bought 2 similar tools recently but I thought it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;First I was extremely disappointed with the \\&quot;cheap box\\&quot; and lack of instructions documents ( I&#x27;ve used 2 other brands so of course I knew how to use it BUT if I were inexperienced I would have been very confused by the lack of directions ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- When I pulled the curler out of the box, I was very surprised how HEAVY it is.&lt;br /&gt;- I always test on my own hair before I would dare use it on a client. So I washed my hair and applied a light conditioner and regular blow dry. ( I have long wavy, medium/fine hair ) Of course I made sure my hair was tangle-free and smooth. Applied my heat-protector product etc... Then I realized that this tool besides being heavy, is impossible to use if you are RIGHT HANDED, if you hold it with your right hand, and want the side pointing to your head it flips the unit upside down..No matter what you do.&lt;br /&gt;- After contortioning myself and managed to put my first strand of hair in the unit, It swallowed my hair and right away the smell of burnt motor. I managed to free my hair and try again on another strand... Again, burnt smell, chewed up hair etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can view pictures I took here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even flat ironed my hair afterwards, just to make sure it was \\&quot; frizz free \\&quot; thinking that might have been the problem. Well, it helped a little bit because I could manage to curl about 4 inches at the end, but when I tried again close to the head same thing happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you have shoulder length, Asian silky straight hair or left handed... STAY AWAY! A good 1\\&quot; or 1.5\\&quot; curling iron does a better job, it&#x27;s much quicker and doesn&#x27;t chewup your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let&#x27;s see how quick and honorable on their refund guarantee!</li>
            <li> For the last few years my beauty appliance obsession has been my trusty hair straightener. That was until I found the magictec. I haven&#x27;t had much luck in the past with curling my hair using rollers, it seemed to just kink and the curls would fall out, so when I saw this nifty little gadget I was pretty excited. I ordered one straight away and I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s so easy to use and the curls last much longer than they did with my curling iron!</li>
            <li> This curler styles my hair with ease. It takes little effort on my part to fix my hair in the morning now because I use this curler. My hair comes out looking neat, soft and fresh. I cannot ask for much more.</li>
            <li> The curler hit all of my expectations. I especially love the duo rotary function. This lets the user choose the direction that the motor spins my hair. This is especially important for styling my hair. I always wear my curls differently and this product allows me to do so. Actually, it wasn&#x27;t until I got this curler that I started experimenting with curling styles; mean curls vs cute curls vs lazy curls. Well every day since I got this thing, I have had a different style of hair to match how I felt that day.</li>
            <li> So one of my close friends has had the same old hair style since junior high. She always wears her long black hair down. The only time it isn&#x27;t down is when she is working out. Well, I decided to get this curling iron for her birthday. When I gave it to her, she acted enthused and kinda pretended to be excited. Now, I probably would have given the same reaction had I not known what this curler could do. I actually helped her open the box and set up the iron at her place so that my friends and I could use it on her. Once I showed her how to use it, she took charge and started curling her hair on her own. It was so simple and easy, even a person who rarely curls her hair was able to curl it. She finally admit embarrassingly that she really loves her new gift... At least her face showed it this time. I am happy I got her this present and I will definitely come back here to buy my own.</li>
            <li> The internet is really a girl&#x27;s best friend. As much as people say it&#x27;s jewelry or gold. I think that&#x27;s overrated. I can shop and find everything online, and this amazing curler is one of them. I was just searching on amazon and came across it, and goodness, it&#x27;s really thought out and well made. Never seen anything like it before either. I&#x27;m so happy it comes with a rebate.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend. She&#x27;s Asian, and has thick, wiry hair. I bought this because I thought it was be a more effective and faster way to curl her hair- but it didn&#x27;t exactly accomplish this. She could only effectively fit a small group of hairs in the clamp for it to bring results as good as a traditional hair curler. It would take longer to do this. The company suggested that she straighten the hair first to allow for better results. This added time was not what I had in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, the results from this curler were not poor, and the quality of the product is as described. However, I was mistaken in believing that it would produce faster results (which are not advertised by MagicTec). This curling iron would be best suited for those with serious hair-styling goals of consistent and high-quality and is not necessarily for the casual self-stylist. This is the only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars because it does what it advertises. Professional is the key word here!</li>
            <li> I just got this today and I love it!! I was nervous about getting my hair stuck in it but I didn&#x27;t have any issues. I did put too much hair in one time and it quit winding which was good and I was able to release my hair fine. I even used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair (7 yrs) and she liked it because  she wasn&#x27;t worried about me burning her. :)</li>
            <li> I got this as a christmas present from my daughter and I really like it! I use it practically every day before I need to go somewhere. It&#x27;s quick, easy, and I can&#x27;t burn myself. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> She is 12. Worthless and confusing directions. No warnings. Big disappointment. I think most of those glowing recommendations are fake.</li>
            <li> I was very intrigued by this item, so I ordered it for my daughter. I was trying to convince her not to get a perm. We had fun trying it, but it didn&#x27;t work on her like it did in the video. Her hair came out looking a little stringy. Maybe her hair is too fine. I think it would be a lot of work to do your whole head. I guess she&#x27;ll get a perm. I decided to return it, and Amazon sent me a pre-paid label to send it back, which made it very easy. Great customer service!</li>
            <li> Magic Tec, where have you been all my life?!  I love this curling iron, I&#x27;ve only used it once, and didn&#x27;t have any real problems other than lack of coordination and short arms that have a hard time curling the back of my head (I&#x27;m sure I will get better with practice though.)  One other problem, is that the instructions that it comes with doesn&#x27;t match my model.  The instructions talk about an M button and a timer.  My curler only has 3 switches, and none of them are explained in the small instruction booklet.  It&#x27;s not too big of a deal though;  I will just have to experiment with it to find the right time/heat setting for me.  In any case, the curler worked great!  I absolutely love the design and how easy it is to use.  I did a lot of research on this curling iron and compared it with Conair&#x27;s similar curling iron.  I chose Magic Tec, because you can choose to switch the directions of the curls with it, and I couldn&#x27;t confirm whether Conair&#x27;s iron could do that as well.  I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 because the instruction manual wasn&#x27;t helpful to me.</li>
            <li> Infini-swirl makes my curls stay in for a long time, something I&#x27;ve tried with every curling iron and any other curling invention and it doesn&#x27;t usually work but with this it did. I applaud you! You did the impossible.</li>
            <li> This Magic Tec is fabulous, works beautifully providing you read the directions for your hair style. For instance I have medium length or shoulder length very thick dense and I use the 230 degrees. As long as you comb out each portion and not too much you will achieve beautiful ringlets in seconds. I am so happy with this product after receiving the infinity secret curl for Christmas and was so disappointed with that I returned it and then purchased this one.  Hands down this is the winner!!!!</li>
            <li> The curls comes out nice and hot and stays curly for miles. I&#x27;ve been tellin people to get this curler since it REALLY WORKS! Nothing else I&#x27;ve tried can hold my hair longer than this curler! Go get yourself one and see for yourself!</li>
            <li> Never had a problem using this curler! It curls my hair quickly and easily. You can choose to put in a lot of hair or a little bit. It&#x27;ll have a different, but awesome outcome every time. And it LASTS!!</li>
            <li> I always had trouble using curling irons since I keep accidentally burning myself. I once got such a terrible burn that took 3 months to heal on my scalp. I gave up on using curling irons, and also curling in general until I found this tool. It revived my hopes of curling hair. I can now curl my hair without being scared of getting burnt. I can have the curls I&#x27;ve longed for now!</li>
            <li> I got this product last week and I LOVE IT. It takes me less than 15 minutes to curl all of my hair. The curls stay until you wash it. I have tried it on my friends hair that range in ethnicity. Amazing!</li>
            <li> The quality of the product has exceeded my expectations. I am delighted to say that I endorse this product. Curls are kept in my hair even if I accidentally brush it with the wrong brush. It is very easy to fix any mistakes, say, if you sectioned out too much hair, or too little, or if you curled the wrong direction. You can reinsert your hair or use a hair straighter for better results.</li>
            <li> I love how everyone has been asking about my hair as of late. It make me feel really good and full of confidence. Not once has anyone said anything negative about my hair. My curls are just right.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t had a curler like this before and am so happy with my purchase. Like, REALLLY HAPPY!!! It made my day!!!!! My straight hair curls like a charm and doesn&#x27;t get undone at all for a long time. Or until I wash it.</li>
            <li> I am ecstatic to say that this is a great curler to own and use! My curls are really nice and comes out in a consistent manner. My curls don&#x27;t get damaged either! Definitely recommend this product x 1000!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this curling iron and it came on time but i returned it the next day, its heavy and my hair got tangled in it. I returned it and just getting my money back.</li>
            <li> I am never disappointed with outcome of my hair. It does exactly what I wanted in every way. I had owned one previously that I didn&#x27;t like using. My old one didn&#x27;t get hot enough to heat the hair wrapped around it. This one, I don&#x27;t have to worry! The heat setting can go up really high!</li>
            <li> There are so many pros to this curler that anyone should really consider getting it!&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part about using this curler is watching my hair go in and out. It never ceases to amuse me. I sometimes get sad and wish I had more hair because I want to keep curling it. I sometimes iron my hair straight out just to recurl my hair again, because it really is that fun to use.</li>
            <li> There is nothing more in this world that I love other than this curler. It is the highlight of my mornings before I get ready for work. I love being fashionable, and part of it is getting hair and makeup done right. This is the right instrument for that!</li>
            <li> I love this curler because it works. After reading certain reviews about this product and seeing the price, I was a bit skeptical. Well, I bit the bullet and bought it anyway because I was curious. This curler works wonders. It gets really hot and is able to curl my thick hair. I love it because the curls actually hold. Best of all, it saves time. You will make up for the price with all of the time you will save. Just a great product.</li>
            <li> I got this curler from MagicTec a day after I ordered it and let me tell you, it has my mind blown! I really like the design, it&#x27;s very clean looking and easy to hold. I have yet dropped this curler, and even if I did, I wouldn&#x27;t burn myself like I would my other curling irons. Two Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moFY4HTVTP3P9F]]This thing is absolutely amazing! I just got it today and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it! I thought my hair would get tangled, but it didn&#x27;t at all! The curler itself is very light, and easy to use! I LOVE that you can change the direction of the curl, as well! I LOVE this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did a video review on my YouTube channel, britneysbeautyblog14, if you want to check it out, and see how this thing works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much MagicTec! I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo390DSXKD1U8G7]]In this video, I compare this product with other similar products and address the issue of getting hair caught in the curling iron.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. My daughter&#x27;s hair is straight and hard to curl. This product does it with ease. Thanks for fast shipment also</li>
            <li> I have had this curling iron for about a month and a half now, and it works great! The curls are perfect It allows you to have many different styles. It leaves your hair really shiny. The heat adjustments are super good. My big sister has super-duper hard to curl hair and we adjusted the heat, and it curled! I&#x27;m so glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> great product and great service! I used a different brand iron that did not work as well as this one.I recieved the product quickly and with no problems from the seller</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got this curling iron and I absolutely love it! It takes mere seconds to heat up and curling is a breeze. You can make your curl as loose or as tight as you would like and it holds all day long without a single ounce of hairspray to hold it in place! I&#x27;ve got thick Asian hair and it does wonders for me, but my sister has thin and very fine hair and it makes it look like she&#x27;s got more hair than many people out there. It&#x27;s a bit steep in price, but definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my wife for her birthday.  At first she didn&#x27;t know what it was since the box it came in looked so sleek.  We were quite impressed with the build quality.  It felt solid, yet was light enough to maneuver it around without getting tired of holding it up.  She&#x27;s now had it for over 3 weeks and loves it a lot more than her previous hair curling iron.  It does take a little getting used to, but after a few attempts it becomes second nature.  She has cut her curling time in half (about 10-15 minutes) vs. 30 minutes before.  She also loves the ability to have alternating curls, which adds more depth.  This was definitely a gift she&#x27;ll enjoy for while.</li>
            <li> THANK GOD! I FINALLY HAVE A CURLER THAT CURLS MY HAIR. ALL OTHER CURLERS ARE TOO CHEAP TO EVEN HOLD 15 MINS. THIS ONE HOLD WELL INTO THE NEXT DAY. MY CURLS LOOK AWESOME AND VERY BOUNCY. MY HAIR TOO THICK AND IT STILL WORKS!</li>
            <li> I love using automatic things. This curler makes it perfect for me. Wrapping hair around typical irons is too much of a hassle and hazard. I have thin, long hair so the low level works great for me. My curls hold really well.</li>
            <li> This is the first curler I&#x27;ve purchased in several years, and I&#x27;m super shocked at the results! The machine keeps popping out these curls and I don&#x27;t have to do much for them! You just need to have the handle up to your side and then place your hair into the head and your hair will go into it really fast. Depending on the timer you set, it will beep when it&#x27;s done. I love it when I don&#x27;t have to do much for great hair</li>
            <li> and I love it! It was weird at first, not having to manually wrap the hair around, like as in curling irons. I don&#x27;t mind since it makes my life so much easier. I hated doing that since I sometimes accidentally touch the hot iron. I enjoy this greatly and I think other should try it out too.</li>
            <li> My hair curls so easy with curler. I have not run into any issues with using it. This is the first product that actually works!! REALLY!&lt;br /&gt;I have a few people in mind that I will buy this curler as a gift for them. I&#x27;m pretty sure they will like it too!!!!</li>
            <li> This is just way cool people. I adore the curls that spring to life! How awesome is it to be able to use an a curler that automatically curls hair? There&#x27;s no other curler better than this! I highly recommend that you try it out.</li>
            <li> This iron is probably the most awesome piece of equipment I have ever found in my years as a cosmetologist. It was only a matter of time before someone invented this wonderful device. I&#x27;m impressed at how well it works. It makes my life so, so, so much easier!</li>
            <li> There has yet been a curler that allows you to change the direction of the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, most curling irons require you to manually do it and it gets confusing after a while, when you start doing your hair with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would forget which direction I wrap my hair in, and then my hair gets all funny looking and either I have to redo all my hair or just end up straightening it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curler keeps tract for me and I can change the direction anytime! It&#x27;s so handyy!!</li>
            <li> I have tried countless numbers of curling irons as well as straighteners but they just DONT work! This curler was my one and last hope, and it has suceeededd!! I don&#x27;t have to hide my hair under hats anymore! I can show of my amazing curls like they are ment to be shown off!</li>
            <li> The precision of each curl is so precise! It gives me consistent curls I can count on. No curl is out of line, or doesn&#x27;t curl right unless I accidentally used too much hair or I wasn&#x27;t being neat about my hair input.</li>
            <li> This curler is soooo crazy I Love it!!!! All my curls are so fine and nice. I get so many people staring at me and commenting on them. I love all the attention! It really gives anybody a confidence boost. I really recommend peeps to try this thing out!</li>
            <li> My girl&#x27;s b-day was coming up and I kno she likes being all beautied up and whatnot so I got this curler for her and had to rush deliver it since I was kinda procrastinating. It made it on time and when she opened it, she was confused but I explained it to her that it was an automatic curler and she said she had to use it to get it. After she did, she fell in love with it and that made me happy to kno I got her something good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good at expressing myself, so using this curler helped me create a new look and new person that is a little bit more outspoken. I would gladly buy another for a friend who is like me. I tried it on her and it works on her hair too. She told me not to worry and that she will just get one for herself. I just love how good this curler is.</li>
            <li> This is a really magical device. It&#x27;ll turn your hair into beautiful curls, just like Cinderella&#x27;s fairy god mother turning her into a princess. There are truly no words to describe how amazing this curler is! You just have to get it and see for yourself!</li>
            <li> I am a 55 year old woman with long hair. While I don&#x27;t want to look like I am trying to be a teenager again, I do want to curl my hair and have it look cute and \\&quot;age appropriate.\\&quot; This curler gives me a cute look, and I don&#x27;t burn my fingers! I have the curling wand that is seen in the mall. It gives the same spiral curl look, but I was burning my fingers, dropping it and burning my arms and decided I didn&#x27;t want to use it anymore. It was just too painful. I came across this hair curler while browsing the \\&quot;movers and shakers\\&quot; in health and beauty. I decided to order it even though it&#x27;s expensive. I thought if it didn&#x27;t work like it was supposed to, I would send it back. There definately is a learning curve to using it. I watched the video, and also went to YouTube to see if there were any other demonstrations. Just make sure you look at the controls and switch it to right or left curl when you use it. Your hair will get caught if it&#x27;s long. I was scared the first time that happened, but I just stopped clamping it, and pulled my hair out. Use very small sections, clean, smooth hair. My 13 year old daughter likes it so much, she had me curl her hair last night for a school dance instead of using the curling wand we just bought at the mall kiosk. Again, I love the fact that it sucks my hair in and curls it, and all I have to do is hold it. It doesn&#x27;t get easier than that. As far as the curls lasting a long time, that part isn&#x27;t true. Spray the curls with hair spray after each curl to keep it curled.</li>
            <li> I purchased a regular curling iron from babyliss, found im not good at use that, and got burn sometime. My friend got this iron from conair, after reading review I decided to get this brand. This is a pretty good product, it has three level degrees and you can make different kind curl by controling the time. So dont need worry it will be over curled. And it looks less damage to hair than regular iron.</li>
            <li> My daughter received this on Christmas morning and decided to use it that day. She love loved loved how easy it was to use. As she was almost finished, a small piece came out of the inside and it would no longer work. I put in an exchange claim that day and received an email from the company Christmas afternoon. They replaced the hair curler immediately and even upgraded us to the digital model. It&#x27;s seriously a fantastic product. My 15 year old is in love!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife for the holidays and she absolutely loves it!  She would spend nearly an hour curling her hair with the traditional curler.  Now though, it takes less than 15 minutes and the curls are extremely consistent.  We love this curler and would absolutely recommend it to anyone wanting to save time and get the perfect curl!</li>
            <li> After looking at other hair curling devices such as this one and comparing prices, product weight, ect... I decided to go with this item as a gift for my mom. I had read reviews that other brands had issues such as being too heavy to hold up for an extended period of time and also that they would get users hair caught inside the device! This MagicTec curler has been in production for longer than other similar curlers, it is slightly lighter weight, and it was $10 cheaper.... all were reasons that I chose this curler and I am glad I did. My mom has been using it for a few weeks now and LOVES it. I have to say, it makes her hair look very healthy. Her hair isn&#x27;t very long and I was skeptical that it would do well with her length, but it really gives a lot of body and fullness. It is a great product and we are very happy with it.</li>
            <li> this magic tec curling iron is terrific, its easy to use, n the curl lasts , glad I ordered this n the price was great too,</li>
            <li> Purchased this product after a friend did my hair.  I didn&#x27;t just buy 1 I bought 2.  One as a Christmas present.  As always using Amazon is a pleasure.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight, hair so I&#x27;ve always had a problem with keeping curls in my hair. I&#x27;ve used conair, revlon, and remington. I&#x27;ve always had mediocre results but I thought that was because my hair was too fine. I was literally amazed when I tried this iron! I didn&#x27;t realize that my hair could have these beautiful bouncy curls that make a wonderful hair style. This is an extraordinary product.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the makers of this curler.  The design is flawless, and so are the curls.  The curls come out hot to the touch when put on the highest setting, but I like it on max heat, since my thick hair can take it.  It then stays curly until the next day, even if I don&#x27;t wash my hair that night.  I only spray a light array of hairspray on it my hair doesn&#x27;t need too much for it to stay in. Other people with super straight hair might need more spray.</li>
            <li> A Good Investment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend so much money on hair products. When it comes to curlers, they break easily, get old fast, and most of the time just plain don&#x27;t work well. Replacing them time and time again and always looking for alternatives gets expensive for me. But the MagicTec is such a money-saver. It is durable, works great, and is definitely worth the initial price you pay, because the time alone that it saves you in the long run is invaluable. This is a genius product, and I recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> It was a breeze to use this curler. No other curler works with the same ease. How can it? Other curlers don&#x27;t curl on their own for you to make those really nice curls. Can&#x27;t wait to grow my hair longer - like past my booty. I think the result would be even better!</li>
            <li> Alright. So. I have had those super cheap, traditional curling irons for who knows how long now. I mean they were ok to use. But, they took way too long to heat up! However, the Magictec Infini-swirl takes seconds to heat up!</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s girl friend was using this product to put curls in her hair one morning at school before classes started.  Its convenience, size and usefulness were very impressive.  My wife learned about it and was so impressed, she bought one for herself.  She is able to have great curly hair with little to no fuss, and has enjoyed using it thus far.  She (through my account) recommends this product for a cute curly hair style.</li>
            <li> I fell in love immediately with this automatic curler after using it. My once straight hair became a mountain of curls within minutes!!! I absolutely love it! You have to try it out!!!</li>
            <li> I have long hair [past my waist] and I love to curl just my ends and my bangs.  This magictec curler gives me really nice bouncy curls, that last a very long time. I am thankful that I no longer feel like I have to use [chemical-filled] hair spray to keep my hair &#x27;set&#x27;. I don&#x27;t have to worry about losing my curls at all, with this I get lots of compliments-people think I slept overnite in rollers...ha!&lt;br /&gt;No matter what curler you are thinking about getting, this one will most likely beat it to a bloody pulp lol.  It produces a strong long-lasting curl and leaves my old-fashioned curlers in the dust.  I tested my older curler on one side and this new one on the other, and in my opinion, you really shouldn&#x27;t pass this one up. My curls look shiny and pretty. I&#x27;d rate it 4.5 stars but there is no &#x27;half&#x27; here to do so...thanks!</li>
            <li> NEVER saw my hair curl so fast. Really reliable speeds and heats up so fast. I get done in minutes! I have time to make coffee in the morning now instead of going out and buying some from star bucks. It&#x27;s too expensive to keep buying coffee, more cheaper to curl hair fast!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my grand daughter and it arrived undamaged and is just what I. wanted.  This product is better constructed than alot of simular products and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, safe from burning my hand! The beauty of using it is I&#x27;d never need to spend over two hours and a few tens of dollars at the barber&#x27;s any longer. Great design for fair dollars. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Got this curling iron for my daughter who has very long hair and likes to curl it every now again.  She likes that she doesn&#x27;t burn her fingers and scalp like the old curling iron she was using.  The MagicTec works just like it describes and she has not had any problems so far.  It has only been a week and will update review if needed.</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas present from my husband and am impressed by the ease of using this curler.  It does take a little getting use to - you have to use smaller sections of hair than you do with traditional curling irons.  Once my hair is curled, I run my fingers through it and go.  Even after exercising or sleeping, the curls stay.  I have never gotten more compliments on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love this thing!</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and gives great curls. It took me a few minutes to figure out how to use and how much hair it could take, but once I figured it out I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> Great product. A gift for my mom and she loves it. She said this is the best curling iron she ever used</li>
            <li> We were excited about the MagicTec Professional Hair Curler after seeing the reviews and purchased it for our teenager. We only had it for three weeks when she dropped it by accident. The small plastic arm on the inner chamber broke off. Unfortunately, we cannot give it the rave review we were hoping for.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that usually take over an hour to curl I can curl my hair in 30 minutes now! I have perfect curls and everybody complements on how good my hair looks!</li>
            <li> it is a great curler and very easy to use i tried other curler and i found that magic tec is the best. i love it.</li>
            <li> I received the curling iron on Christmas Eve and read the instructions thoroughly before trying to curl my hair.  My hair is about 24inches long.  I started by trying with a small section of the back of my hair (combed out any tangles), and on the first clamp (about 3 inches from the scalp) my hair got stuck in the motor.  There is no release button (bad design), and therefore I had to pull my hair out of the curling iron which was very difficult because you cant see where exactly its stuck.  Stubborn of me, I tried again and the same thing happened.  Hair stuck once again.  I did notice that if I clamped my hair lower, say half way, then it seemed to curl/suck up fine.  But obviously this defeats the purpose.  Stick to the traditional curling irons please or risk having to shave your head off.</li>
            <li> It just arrived . I followed the instructions and watched the video as well. I tried it 3 times. Each time, my hair got stuck and got burned . I had to release it with the help of a pair of scissors. My hair is all mess. I want to give it minus 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The very first time I put my hair into this, it sucked it up, and I couldnt get it out.&lt;br /&gt;I had to go to the salon and ultimately, they had to crack it open.&lt;br /&gt;Beware of this product!&lt;br /&gt;If your hair gets caught in there, it will be very difficult to get it out!&lt;br /&gt;very scary experience.</li>
            <li> I do not usually write reviews.. especially when it comes to hair products of any kind. Usually because I am disappointed in them. I have naturally curly hair that really is more frizz than anything. And over the years, parts of it have grown out straight, while other parts are still very curly. So I usually blow dry my whole head to straighten it all.. the problem then, is it looks even more frizzy, especially the ends. I have used straighteners and every curling iron and curler out there. It always took forever to do my hair or it made my hair actually more frizzy. I honestly didn&#x27;t expect much from this product. But I was happily surprised when it worked. It curls my ends perfectly and has made doing my hair much faster over the past few months. The thing that really surprised me, is I dropped it on my hard bathroom floor, and it still works.. (I m a bit of a klutz) I thought sure I broke it. The reason I only give 4 stars is because, if you do have frizzy hair.. you definitely have to put some product in still to keep the frizz down. I have noticed that if I go back over the curls for some reason a few times.. it frizzes out worse. Also, as others have said.. The instructions that came with mine where for a different unit. So, there are a few things on the controls I don&#x27;t understand and have nothing I can look at to find out what they do.</li>
            <li> I chose this product based on the video reviews of youtube, I got it yesterday and inmediatly tried it, from the first curl i got it right, my sister in law was with me and tried it as well and ordered one in that moment, the curls lasted the whole night wich is wierd for me because i have long thin hair and curls usualy straighten up real fast, but with this machine they lasted fine without looking to much puffed like 80s hair do. I love it and recomend. I just have an issue with mine because i cant make it go on alternate curls, i dont do if i hage to learn how to do it or if there is something wrong with it.

            <li> I am incredibly uncoordinated when it comes to all things hair styling but even after my first use I was super pleased with my wavy &#x27;do. So much easier than I expected and my hair was never tugged or tangled by the curler. I can&#x27;t wait to keep using this as I&#x27;m sure as I get more comfortable with it I&#x27;ll be even more pleased with the results.</li>

            <li> it was really difficult for me to curl my hair myself before I found this, but now not anymore, I really love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Not too good because I actually didn&#x27;t get the digital one.  The instructions are for a digital one so I am having a hard time figuring out how to use it.....</li>
            <li> I have long hair making it hard to curl with any other curling iron, and on top of that I have no idea what way to curl your hair or how to do it with it looking cute so with the MAGICTEC it makes curling soooooo easy and fun to do. Defiantly one of my favorite Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> Got the Magic Tec Professional Hair Curler today &amp; have really- seriously enjoyed getting to see the different results. I have medium length hair and it is extremely straight &amp; so I have been very sceptical about a a curler that would actually curl &amp; remain curled but it seems the MagicTec Professional Hair Curler may prove to be the &amp;#34;Golden Ticket!&amp;#34; Thank You!!!</li>
            <li> had to be familiar with it first. I got it as a Christmas gift and for the first time it was a disaster and I had to cut my hair since it was stuck inside.&lt;br /&gt;but after that everything went well. The curl is unique.&lt;br /&gt;might need to do more than one for long hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with trepidation.  After reading all the problems with the other name brands, and also buying the Conair, I decided to give Magic Tec at a fraction of the price a try.  I love it!  It works great.  I did have to learn to be careful and not put too much hair in it.  When done properly, it works like Magic!!! :-)</li>
            <li> I love it! I recommend it to anyone over age  10 (for safety issues - burning, etc.). It makes perfect curls. My hair did get caught, but all I did was stay calm and just unwind my hair from the spiral (it didn&#x27;t even hurt!). Works well. BUT MAKE SURE YOU READ THE DIRECTIONS! The people who have bad reviews of there hair getting ripped out probably didn&#x27;t read the directions. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I have to say I LOVE THIS AUTOMATIC CURLER! My hair looked so good! Sometimes I think about curling my hair but I usually end up not doing it just because I think of how much time and effort is takes. This one gives me zero effort, I swear.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse grey hair.  It is very difficult to curl with any lasting effect.  This was the solution.  I originally got it for my daughter&#x27;s hair, but gave it a shot on my own.  Incredible!  It took some time since coarse hair is harder to curl but it was so worth it!  Curls stayed in for days! Great product!</li>
            <li> I did a lot researching about these types of products and chose the MagicTec.  She had originally asked for the InStyler curler but I read a lot of bad reviews on it.  My wife had never heard of this product before but after using it for the first time (and the 10 other times already after that) she fell in love with it.  She uses it all the time and has not had one bad thing to say about it.  Her hair is long, wavy and thick and the MagicTec works great every time.  No more burnt fingers, can customize the size of the curls too.  Thanks MagicTec for making me the best husband ever this past Christmas.</li>
            <li> I love this curler solely for the reason that it is fast. It takes me only 5 minutes for the curler to heat up and for me to curl my hair. It has been so convenient for my daily routine. It has saved me from being late on more than one occasion. This curler is amazing!</li>
            <li> I am an elementary school teacher and mom of 4. I have to wake up super early to get my family moving and out the door. The Magictec was the BEST investment I have made in regards to time management this school year! I shower at night and am able to quickly curl my hair to perfection in the morning. I spend about 15 minutes curling my hair and then have plenty of time to get my family fed, dressed and out the door. My hair stays curly throughout the entire day. I love this product!</li>
            <li> The Magictec Curler is a wonder.  It has different heat settings.  It also comes with and different timer settings.  The different heat settings make this Magictec great for families because my mother who has thinner hair can use a lower heat setting while I can use a higher heat setting for my thick hair.  The other neat part is that you can get tighter curls by upping the time and/or heat setting and looser curls by lower the heat and/or decreasing the time.  This hair curler is perfect for families, groups of friends, and/or people preparing for a group event.  It has so many customizable features.</li>
            <li> Love it. Makes the best curls. Took me a minute or two to get the hang of it, but once I did, it was easy as pie. The curls are beautiful and if I decide I don&#x27;t don&#x27;t want the curls, just brush out and you have beautiful waves.... I do high recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first... but I love this curler! Super easy to use and give my long hair beautiful wavy curls.</li>
            <li> My sister is pregnant, and she doesn&#x27;t want to use a lot of chemicals on her hair. She also has other kids, so she doesn&#x27;t have a lot of time and patience for fixing her hair these days. Still, she likes to fix up her hair so she looks nice when she goes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves using the Magic Tec Professional Hair Curler. It is a great product for the price, and she find it more effective than more expensive hair curlers that she has purchased. It is pretty automatic, and you can adjust the size of the curls or waves by how much hair you put in at a time.</li>
            <li> When I first thought of purchasing the curlers, I was a little bit apprehensive! I thought that maybe the curlers would produce the same type of curls that all of the other curlers that I had used in the past would produce. Usually, I get frizzy curls that don&#x27;t last! After using the curlers, I noticed that not only was I able to get the look that I wanted to achieve but the curls were silky, bouncy, and longer lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using them are easy and when I am sleeping, I do not have to worry about them being uncomfortable or falling out in the bed. They are easy to fasten and very compact to keep in small places like a purse especially if a person needs to use them in emergency cases. I&#x27;ve never used a curler that was so unique. They are a one of a kind, inexpensive, and durable even though they are made out of soft material. This is an investment that anyone that has the responsibility of curling their own hair would be happy to make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victoria Sheffield</li>
            <li> Really pleases! It doesn&#x27;t take long to get my curls ready with this curler. heats up fast. My daughters also love to use it after I finish curling my hair. They want to have one for them selves so I told them I&#x27;ll get them one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> So wicked fast!!! It comes in and out of the curler just like that. Didnt believe I could achieve the same great results and speed with other curling irons. Hot rollers are so hard to use, and those foamy clip ons just dont work at all. I&#x27;m also sick and tired of burning my fingers on curling irons too. This is the one to use for all my curling needs!</li>
            <li> Good product! Easy to use..curls perfectly. Better than Most curling irons on the market, it took me less than 30 minutes to do my whole head</li>
            <li> This curler is literally the best thing ever! My mom got this curler last week and I have been stealing it ever since. It took me only a few minutes to get use to the functions. I have been curling my hair every other morning because there is really no need to curl every day since the curls stay for longer than a day. I definitely love this curler.</li>
            <li> Even nursing home residents need hair care. I often visit this nursing home that has very nice old ladies who are permanent residents. Once in a while, a younger woman or two would be admitted but they would get released a few weeks after. I work for a salon two blocks down the road, and I visit this nursing home to give its residents new hair styles to boost happiness and energy and cut back on depression. Children these days rarely bother visiting their chronically ill parents or grandparents and it makes them sad. I got this curler and it works perfectly on me, so I figured I could use it on the grannies. I tried it one day on a regular grannie I visit and she really liked it. She said it was fun to see her hair curly made by something like this [curler]. The other residents got jealous and wanted to have appointments with me more often now. I&#x27;m glad I bought this curler.</li>
            <li> I learned a little earlier that if you hair spray the strand you want to curl before putting it into the machine that curls last much, much longer than just curling it. I curled my hair yesterday and even after sleeping on it, a few of my curls still reside.</li>
            <li> I received last November 21, 2013. This product is good and really can curl. It would be better if it is waterproof and can allow to curl thick portion of hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never curled my hair on my own before, so I am very happy that I have something that makes it as easy as this product does. I have very long, thick hair and lots of it, so it takes me about 30 minutes to curl it and only from about half of its length. The curler can be very finicky and, since my hair is so thick, I have to feed very small portions of it in order for them to curl correctly. My hair will sometimes get caught in the twisting mechanism and I will have to jerk it out to free it which is scary, but has not damaged my hair. This has been happening less often as I have used the product more and learned better how it works. I would definitely recommend it from its results and I think it is a good product. It is expensive, but I think it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> The MagicTec Professional Hair Curler is very easy to use on straight hair.  It makes curls fast and beautiful. Wonderful!</li>
            <li> Gave it to my daughter for Christmas yesterday and she used it only to get her hair sucked into the motor!  We had to break it apart and remove more than a dozen screws before we could separate the pieces enought to unwind her hair from the motor.  My daughter is not inexperienced in doing her hair with different tools.  She is 14 and can style and curl hair like a stylist.  There is no release mechanism nor is there any directions or help if your hair get&#x27;s stuck.  NO reverse NOTHING!  I am currently trying to find the website and and/or somehow to get my money back!</li>
            <li> I have strait blonde hair and I can never get any hair styles to stay in my hair. I didn&#x27;t even use hair spray and it stayed in for 2 days! Sadly i don&#x27;t have this iron. I borrowed my friend&#x27;s, but I&#x27;m planning on getting one.</li>
            <li> I got this curler because I know that it will really help my wrists. I have carpal tunnel syndrome because I work at a desk all day doing nothing but the only thing I am good at: typing. I found this curler online and thought I would give it a try. I bought it and I am still impressed at the quality and ease of this device. I do not understand why more people have this curler.</li>
            <li> SO SO simple to use. Very easy navigation screen for option selection. It is also very convenient as it saves time. Even though I have never used a curler like this before, I was able to use this on the first try. It is that simple. Awesome curler.</li>
            <li> This curler is very fast. It takes a maximum of 12 seconds for each curl. That&#x27;s 5 curls a minute! Even with this speed, you only need one hand free. The timer is also a great help. So fast yet so simple; It makes life easier.</li>
            <li> This product is so different, yet so very good! This is my first curler of any kind, I used to only borrow from my sister or mother and now that I&#x27;m heading off to college, I need my own. I wanted a really good curler since I wanted to look good while in college since I hear there&#x27;s a lot of hot guys who go there. It&#x27;s really cool to watch the hair go into the rotary part. I&#x27;m glad that I&#x27;m born in an age of technological advancement. Automatic curlers are the coolest!</li>
            <li> The Magictec Curler came in today. I absolutely loved it even though my hair got caught a few times. When my hair got caught in the curler, I made sure to unplug the it so I could work on getting my hair out. It took a bit of time so don&#x27;t get impatient and cut your hair, that should be last resort. It took about 30 to 45 minutes the first time curling it, but now that I know how to do it , curling my hair shouldn&#x27;t take as long. I love the results and would post you a picture if I could. You can go to YouTube and type in Magictec Curle to see how it is done, that was very helpful to me.</li>
            <li> It works, but sometimes my hair gets stuck. Besides that, it works fine. I have long hair, but I usually get it done in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and the curls are gorgeous. Once you get use to the right amount of hair to use, the process gets easier.</li>
            <li> I use it nearly every day: the product is a very high quality curler.  My friends love the curls and waves that I make on occasion using the curlers, and it&#x27;s nice to have the option to create so many different styles every once in a while.  Easy to use, simple and self explanatory, I highly recommend it.  Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> The only way to get compliments is to work for them, but this curler works for you, so you don&#x27;t have to dish out any extra effort. You just need to collect the compliments as they come. The curler works at it&#x27;s best to produce these really nice curls that you can&#x27;t believe are real.</li>
            <li> I lovee doing my hair up in different styles and this bad boy allows me to do just that. It works hard to keep my fill of gorgeous curls. My hair doesn&#x27;t look limp anymore since I have super fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> Used it on all my friends! They all love it and think its a new and fun way of curling hair. They all have different kinds of hair, and it worked for all of their hair types! A great investment!</li>
            <li> Received the product yesterday morning and let me tell you people how I feel about it. My first impression of this curler is that it was launched with the right marketing finesse. I am into unique product designs. The product&#x27;s design shows that the manufacturer cares about quality. I love the sleek and black design and the pink one is nice too but I decided to just get the black one.</li>
            <li> You can learn how to use this automatic curler fast! There is really no learning curve. The device is super simple to understand how to use. Hair goes in and curl comes out. It really is that easy. I let me little sister who&#x27;s only 10 years old try it on me and she was able to curl my hair fine. She likes to do it for me too, since it&#x27;s really fun. She&#x27;s also not scared of me using the device on her. She had a bad experience with normal curling irons that she refuses to get her hair curled, but when I explained it to her that it wont burn her, she let me use it on her.</li>
            <li> Just purchased this hair curler as a Christmas gift for my daughter. Of course I had to try it out first (when she wasn&#x27;t home.) It was so much fun to use, extremely easy to work with and made such pretty curls. My daughter is going to love it.  ;)</li>
            <li> This tool is amazing, I purchased the infini swirl and the curls are just beautiful. I have very wavy hair that&#x27;s natural, so to get the curls I want I have to straighten it. It&#x27;s not a problem since it still works great after I used the flat iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s time to step it up and buy something you can use a lot that works like a devil on crack. I make my curls so fast, I forget I even started. It&#x27;s just that fast to use this curler! I saved so much time using this&lt;br /&gt;curler that I got to do more things in the morning.</li>
            <li> Took me a few trys to get the curls right, but after that, my curls became consistent and really pretty. You really have to make sure you dont have any tangles or else your hair will have curls that are fuzzy. Try straightening your hair before using this product or brushing it really well. Other than that, the curls are perfect. It&#x27;s a worth while purchase, just make sure your hair is good and ready to go!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo14SFOT6NMBZXC]]This video provides a quick demonstration of the MagicTec Infiniswirl hair curler (including a description of what the switches do).  This is a pretty cool gadget, and is quick and easy to use!</li>
            <li> My neighbor bought this and was excited the day it arrived.  She had to do my daughter&#x27;s hair.  I was sold!  I just got mine today and I&#x27;ve already done four little girls&#x27; hair.  It&#x27;s easy to use and makes the hair beautiful!!!</li>
            <li> This is pretty awesome.  I suck at curling my hair so this just does it for you.  Very simple to use.</li>
            <li> I am in shock how well this works. I read the reviews and watch video had had serious doubts.  It really does work. It&#x27;s so easy.  It&#x27;s light and has many options for you to choose. My hair never holds a curl but with this curling iron it does. Even the next day it had a curl to it.  I feel like it is faster than any other curling iron I have tried. I love the  My hair never got caught, which I thought would happen.  All my friends bought it the next day after see how well it works.  It is the best thing I have bought all year.</li>
            <li> I love the look of curls, but have always had a hard time using a curling iron. inevitably, I would burn myself and it would take forever to do. I got this for Christmas and love it! it is so easy and fast! plus, the curls are so uniform and pretty. I&#x27;ve also noticed that the heat settings are easier on my hair than other curling irons. I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough.</li>
            <li> First I need to say that my hair does not like to hold curl. It air dries straight. I love this curling iron. It took me 25-30 mins to curl my hair with an old standard clip curling iron and this one takes me only about 10 mins. These curls last for days.And please don&#x27;t be intimidated by this curler. This curling iron is so unbelievably easy to use you will be shocked! If you have hair like me that doesn&#x27;t like to curl and you&#x27;ve always wanted beautiful waves that can last for days, GET IT!</li>
            <li> The Magic Tec hair curler saves time as you don&#x27;t have to wind each curl.  It does the work for you.  There is a learning curve .....so practice with it and you should be able to complete your hair style quickly.</li>
            <li> I watched many YouTube videos and read all of the instructions on how to use this thing but I still got it tangled in my hair like 5 times! I couldn&#x27;t finish my whole head of hair because of it (and I have very thin hair and not a lot of it). It kept pulling my hair. I know I was doing it right and I gave it tons of chances, trying it again and again, but eventually I just had to give up on it. Returned it today. I was going to try out another automatic curler but just a different brand but then I decided to just get a curling wand instead.</li>
            <li> I only purchased this after reading all the 5 star reviews. I was so excited that there was finally going to be a curling iron that would work on my fine hair and hold a curl. How could I go wrong when everyone else loved it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I had to say something about my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I got a &amp;#34;lemon&amp;#34; a defective item or what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But from the moment I opened the box I was unhappy. First...the instructions made NO sense. I could NOT figure out what any of the buttons meant. Other then turning on the power and the light coming on...I could not figure out what settings to put it on. Took me a bunch of google searches to figure out I had the older model but the instructions in the box were for the new model with digital instructions. Not helpful and I cannot find instructions for the older model anywhere. Its a bunch of buttons with lines on them...I have no idea what the lines mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless. I let it heat up and hoped for the best. In the hour I tried to use it....I was able to get a few pieces to kind of curl...but not impressive and not easily. And then the worst thing happened!..my hair was caught in the machine! The one thing every single review said you didn&#x27;t need to worry about! Luckily I was able to get it out but it certainly damaged that small piece of hair and imagine my panic when this hot motor was gripping my hair. I almost grabbed for the scissors! I had watched the videos so I really don&#x27;t think I was using it incorrectly (not to mention...not using it correctly should NOT be a reason for the hair to get caught and fried in it...it is SUPPOSED to stop and release your hair so that does NOT happen)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a little while, the machine just didn&#x27;t work...the motor would turn for a second..then stop...didn&#x27;t matter if I had hair in it or was just holding it down to test it. I turned it off...let it cool and tried again. Nothing..nadda...won&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im so bummed. I wasso excited about this. I have never been able to curl my hair and reading a ton of 5 star reviews encouraged me to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am retuning this asap. Hopefully boring straight hair will come back in style&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:-(</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it you can do just about anything. You can make it tight and curly or loose and wavy. It is very versatile for someone that likes to change their hair up from day to day.</li>
            <li> I love this hair curler!!! It is really fast and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. The curls last for 2 days! I love it. Just make sure you section off your hair appropriately for the length and thickness and it works great!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it - it works like magic, creating beautiful curls so easily.  Even though I bought it for my daughter, I like it myself, too!</li>
            <li> I would recommend it as a good beginner device that works like a salon quality curling iron. It&#x27;s beginner because it doesn&#x27;t require much learning to get used to, but it still gives you some nice curls!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I took it out of the box and tried it right away and it worked just as it said!! beautiful curls! Obviously, I still need some practice with it but it actually curled my hair! My hair is super thick and fairly long and does not hold a curl, ever. This product gave my hair beautiful curl that actually held, even without hairspray! Love it! Try it!!!</li>
            <li> Let me preface this review by saying I am a frequent Amazon shopper, however, I have never reviewed any product until now. Conversely, I rely heavily on product reviews when making my purchasing decisions, which is why I feel so strongly about giving my personal feedback on this item. I went with this product specifically because it had a 5 star rating--higher than any other similar product on Amazon, which impressed me, as well as the sheer novelty of it--I&#x27;ve never tried one like it. After trying it, though, I am completely baffled as to how it has earned 5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little background info: I have medium to long hair, 4-5 inches past my shoulders, that is smooth in texture, straight and very thick (I say medium because I just had it cut, but most would probably consider it long. It&#x27;s not super-long, though). I have fairly healthy hair as I have never colored it and only use heating tools sporadically. I always use a heat protecting spray before applying heat. I used this curler on clean, dry hair that was free of tangles. My hair generally has no problem holding a curl. I watched multiple demo videos of the product online before using, and even talked to my friend about it who is a hairstylist in a high-end salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, this thing tangled and tore my hair like none other! It was horrible and I struggled from start to finish. First I separated my hair into multiple layers and sections and ran a brush through each section repeatedly before inserting into this torture device. I tried to section off very small portions of hair to curl, because if you put too much in, it will tangle and get snarled into the curling chamber while your hair fries. Even when you think you&#x27;re using a very small section of hair, it&#x27;s still too much for this thing, which means it takes an exceedingly long time to finish your whole head. By using such tiny sections, you can only achieve a certain type of curl, and for me, it was not the look I was going for. I would have given up after completing the first half of my head, but I kept going just to see if it would get easier as I went along and found my groove--it didn&#x27;t get easier and I never found my groove. You may be thinking this is due to user error, and perhaps there are better methods, but as I was curling my hair for over an hour and a half, you&#x27;d think that would allow for plenty of opportunity to improve my technique. Well, it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was getting tangled repeatedly, and I would have to pull it out and brush the tangles that were now in it as a result of yanking it out of the machine. After this process, the section of hair would be gnarled and fried and frizzy, and would only get tangled worse the next time I tried to insert it, even after carefully brushing it out again. Most of the time the machine would release my hair with a little tugging, but the worst part was the dozen or so times that a section of hair would become so entangled that I feared it was stuck for good! Each time this happened, I unplugged the curler and carefully pulled the hair as hard as I could, literally afraid I was going to rip the hair right in half. Eventually the it would come out, looking fried and knotted and sad. Needless to say, this process was PAINFUL, frightening and frustrating! And just let me reiterate: I was using exceedingly small sections of smooth hair, but it would still tangle all the same. Once a section became tangled and I had to re-do it, it was a lost cause because the hair was now frizzy and jacked up. At the end of this entire process, I was horrified to see my sink full of broken, ripped strands of hair, along with several huge knotted wads and a pile of hair at my feet. Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I finished my entire head, and I must say that the process improved dramatically once I got to a shorter section of hair. My shortest layer of hair is an inch or two past my chin--I had no problems on this section, which makes me think this product might work great for anyone with shorter hair. For me, however, it was a disaster. Once I bushed through the curls and ran my fingers through repeatedly, the final look was not too shabby, but it was absolutely not worth the effort. I was so excited to try this curler out, and I definitely think it was worth a try, but I am confident that it&#x27;s not for me. It&#x27;s not time-saving, it&#x27;s not a prettier curl--it&#x27;s a pain in the butt and I know I wont want to use it again, which is why I&#x27;m sending it back. I don&#x27;t think there is anything wrong with this one as opposed to a different brand. I am going to go with a clipless wand instead. My hair will thank me!</li>
            <li> directions are vague with no pictures to demonstrate how to use this product like most other hair devices.  It just tangled my hair.  I have a lot of hair so maybe it works for people with less hair.  (I did select small sections of hair at a time)</li>
            <li> I asked for and received this for Christmas. Everyone laughed when they saw it on my list. I have very fine, straight, shoulder length hair that does not hold a curl without tons of hairspray (and usually that doesn&#x27;t help either). I used in on Christmas day to go to our new in-law&#x27;s house. It works great! I could never make curls like this on my own, and even if I could, they would fall out in 10 minutes. I had a headful of soft, lovely curls. I also tried it on a day when I was staying home without hairspray. The curls still lasted all day! My mom said she has never seen my hair look so pretty (and she doesn&#x27;t give false compliments). It doesn&#x27;t take that long, either. Very pleased with it! Received it in a timely manner and was packaged well with an instruction booklet.</li>
            <li> I love this hair curler. The curls look perfect and it&#x27;s so easy! Your hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck, just make sure you curl your hair in small sections.</li>
            <li> This curler is professional and fun at the same time. My mom got my sister and I one, and every day, my sister and I would get into a competition where we see who can curl hair the fastest. We both set our own temperatures, but keep the timer the same. Otherwise it would be cheating if one of us had a shorter time. Then the race is off and I typically win, since I&#x27;m better than her, but on days where I&#x27;m a little sleepy, she might beat me. In any case, we both end up with really nice curls.</li>
            <li> I have been using Conair products, but this Magictec curling iron beats it by a mile! I adore this wand so much I take it with me everywhere.</li>
            <li> Brought this item and it was great. I get great curls every time. Just makes my life a lot easier. Fantastic! Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li> I love to go out now! It&#x27;s really fun to show off my hair to my friends and family. EVERYONE LOVES IT! I just wished that I had another one that I can keep at my office...and another one for my friend...and another one for my mom....and another one in my other bathroom....and my room.....and the kitchen....I could have this product anywhere!</li>
            <li> Time for everyone to buy this curler! I believe it will become very popular! Especially for teens to mid twenty somethings! But it really can be used by everyone! I easily taught my boyfriend to learn how to use this curler on me and he thinks it&#x27;s fun!</li>
            <li> Got it basically the next day. Great, cause I&#x27;ve been waiting to try this new curler out. It truly curls just the way I like it. I&#x27;m so happy I have a really great curler! It curls faster than any other curler I&#x27;ve had!</li>
            <li> Being black, it&#x27;s hard to do your hair. I have to get a perm to keep my hair straight, but I want to have nice curls too sometimes. So, I opt in to get this curler and my curls stay for so long! Lucky me, my hair type conforms to the shape I put it in, so I didn&#x27;t have to pit too much hair spray either.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1UVYNAWHF22K9]]This is a great product.  It seems to be well built and is probably most suitable for medium to long hair.  It works wonderfully and is lots of fun too!</li>
            <li> This is a supurb styling tool.  My hair is naturally curly, but has lost a lot of it&#x27;s curl as I age.  This gives me beautiful soft curls and is wonderful for &amp;#34;woman of a certain age&amp;#34;.  This is a real winner.</li>
            <li> Well I am not much of a writer but I have to say this is a great iron. Love that it gets hot fast and the curls are great....&lt;br /&gt;16:03  December 04, 2013</li>
            <li> What a pleasure to use....so easy.  I wish all things to do my  hair was so much fun&lt;br /&gt;looking forward to other items for my hair from this company</li>
            <li> I discovered this curler through my friend&#x27;s friend and she told me to go on amazon to check it out. I looked at the description and thought that it would be worth a try to test it out since I could always return it. After using it....I AM NOT RETURNING this curler ever. I&#x27;m keeping this curler because it&#x27;s WAY TOO GOOD!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.  So much better than a curling iron.  Easy to use and great results. Even my 9 year old granddaughter can use it!</li>
            <li> Loved it!!! Absolutely the best styling product I&#x27;ve ever purchased, I have thick long frizzy hair and had effortless beautiful curls in no time!!!!</li>
