            <li>This lip gloss is very nice, except the size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so great when it gets all over your drinking glass and gets things( like your own hair, if your hair is longer than chin-length) stuck in it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so great when it gets all over your drinking glass and gets things( like your own hair, if your hair is longer than chin-length) stuck in it!</li>
            <li>it works the best because it irritates the most.</li>
            <li>within 5 minutes of applying this product my lips felt warm and tingly but nothing unbearable, infact the tingling was kind of soothing to me along with the wonderful cinnamon smell.</li>
            <li>And it smells good- tastes cinnamony</li>
            <li>its a good gloss, but you can get gloss at the drugstore for 1/3 of the price</li>
            <li>This is a kind of product I would be happy to go out and get again when I run out.</li>
            <li>I dont think it would feel good on chapped lips.</li>
            <li>It does smell good and the texture is good</li>
            <li>I bought this after hearing how good it works on stimulating blood flow and adding color and plump to your lips.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not totally bad, just not the best!</li>
            <li>I guess the best way to describe it would be to say it is a mild burning tingle.  </li>
            <li>I was also very, very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>it makes you feel very sexy</li>
            <li>My sister and I (along with our very adventurous husbands) all tried this out one night.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to make my lips any fuller though, but I think it is the glossiest lip gloss I own, and I own a good amount of lip gloss.  </li>
            <li>I love the tingly feeling!</li>
            <li>I love the way this stuff smells!</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s so shiny/glossy!</li>
            <li>Oh, and your partner will just love the globby look too!</li>
            <li>Oh, and your partner will just love the globby look too!</li>
            <li>within is potent!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff!</li>
            <li>With a $15 price tag, I sort of hoped for more than that!  </li>
            <li>I love the shine, the color, and the tingle!  </li>
            <li>The illusion of sexy sensuality will all be shot as your kisser declares, \\&quot;What&#x27;s that!?</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Although I realize the color was because of an irritation, I actually liked the resulting blushing of my lips.     </li>
            <li>And I didnt expect those kind of results</li>
            <li>I found that the Lip Venom does give my lips some nice color by bringing the blood to my lips -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too goopy, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>All in all, a nice lip gloss, but not a must-have.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>Yet, there are hundrends of glosses out there for that kind of money.  </li>
            <li>or you can wear it on its own.</li>
            <li>Very strong stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I felt like I was chewing very strong cinnamon gum.  </li>
            <li>I wear this stuff mostly because of the amazing shine it gives, and because I *love*</li>
            <li>I love this lip gloss, it&#x27;s excellent as a gloss and does give your lips some natural color and shape.</li>
            <li>The price at first is a bit off-putting but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I doubt that they really swelled at all, but they felt good, and they had a nice sheen.  </li>
            <li>I like Too Face &#x27;Fat Kiss&#x27; better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I have to hand it to the Lip Venom PR team; they are excellent corporate soldiers.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous marketing strategy!  </li>
            <li>The best part is, the effects actually get better with more use.</li>
            <li>Mostly?</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t just give the illusion of fuller, poutier lips.</li>
            <li>but i like this better than lip infusion</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know who to be more ashamed of?</li>
            <li>this product is not going to magically give them to you, BUT it does make a difference.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t thing i&#x27;d buy it agian because I am sure I will find a better one.</li>
            <li>I personally love the cinnamon taste and tingling sensation</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just looking for some sexy lip gloss for a date then go for the Lip Venom.</li>
            <li>I love the spicy feeling and</li>
            <li>but I have not found anything that&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>but it goes away after five minutes and as for the plumping effect it does make them a bit fuller but its more of a state of mind, that when u have it on</li>
            <li>and I should add, they didn&#x27;t try to push something more pricey on me</li>
            <li>I take pains with making my lips look outstanding,</li>
            <li>I just love the look and it gives my self-confidence a boost).</li>
            <li>I just love the look and it gives my self-confidence a boost).</li>
            <li>My lips are OKAY in size - my top lip being thinner than my bottom.  </li>
            <li>Even if it&#x27;s pricy, it&#x27;s a perfect present for your bud, or parents,</li>
            <li>Truly, I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is nice as a light gloss, but don&#x27;t expect it to replace fillers that plump up your lips.  </li>
            <li>I get better plumping results with Lip Injection but</li>
            <li>You may be pleased.</li>
            <li>but it sure made them feel that way.</li>
            <li>However, I was eventually able to rationalize myself into buying the stuff.  </li>
            <li>After about 5 minutes, my lips felt lovely.  </li>
            <li>Most lip plumpers on the market today work to &#x27;plump&#x27; your lips through this process of irritation.     </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It gets warm, but I really enjoy the sensation.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the smell.</li>
            <li>not as sure about the plumping</li>
            <li>Make sure your lips are moisturized...</li>
            <li>Some people find the tingling/burning sensation enjoyable while others want to peel their lips off.</li>
            <li>I think the colored squeeze tube glosses are a better deal.</li>
            <li>You get more product AND its colored.</li>
            <li>Love that.  </li>
            <li>love the regular venom, which can be worn over your favorite color for a wonderful shine, the flash, with silver or gold shimmer in it, and the gel gloss as well.</li>
            <li>Like most people, I bought this product to have fuller plumper lips.</li>
            <li>, I have used this product as well as Lancomes Juicy Tubes and find that Lancomes gloss does a better job at giving me poutier lips.  </li>
            <li>OK, I know it was foolish to believe that a gloss can pump my lips up</li>
            <li>As a gloss it is Ok; there&#x27;s no flavour, no stickiness whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>have let most of my friends try it</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying i love this stuff.</li>
            <li>personally i love lips</li>
            <li>Using this wonderful gloss will help not only your view of your lips</li>
            <li>I love the stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, it tastes pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that just the smallest bit is perfect, and as long as I don&#x27;t kiss my boyfriend immediately after I put it on, he doesn&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>overall, it makes your lips feel good, and look good.    </li>
            <li>As a general gloss it is good, nice and shiny and not at all goopy or sticky.</li>
            <li>okay, then stick with the cheap stuff then....  </li>
            <li>It also works great alone for those that like a natural look.</li>
            <li>and i think they are one of the most important parts of your body.  </li>
            <li>yeah, right!!</li>
            <li>This lip gloss is really cool!</li>
            <li>Because of the consistency, it doesn&#x27;t wipe off easily.</li>
            <li>So much so that I laughed when I saw it, since it comes in a HUGE box.  </li>
            <li>Before I applied, I wiped my lips to make sure that they were clean and to be able to receive the full effect.  </li>
            <li>When you first put it on it gives you a beautiful high glass shine.</li>
            <li>When you first put it on it gives you a beautiful high glass shine.  </li>
            <li>It makes my lips super shiny and sexy.</li>
            <li>The plumping effects, for me, were more mild.</li>
            <li>Within 5 minutes I could tell a complete difference in my lips, they were fuller, very smooth, and gave my lips a nice color.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in the size of my lips when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Plus the tubes are huge, the gloss stays on your lips longer and the burn lasts longer.</li>
            <li>Since it wasn&#x27;t (and still isn&#x27;t) available in my country, I ordered it online.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sorry if it sounds like I&#x27;m taking all the fun out of it, I love to get playful with make-up too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sorry if it sounds like I&#x27;m taking all the fun out of it, I love to get playful with make-up too.</li>
            <li>The discomfort reminded me of the term \\&quot;slave to beauty,\\&quot; and I broke free when I tossed the Venom in the trash.</li>
            <li>Your lips feel \\&quot;bee-stung\\&quot; (I love that expression), which the marketing people know is the look you are going for, so it must be working, right?</li>
            <li>Although I enjoyed this product, I cannot give it more than three stars for two main reasons.</li>
            <li>I know having \\&quot;venom\\&quot; in the name makes it sound kinda cool and glamourous, hey, I dug it and fell for it too.</li>
            <li>I know having \\&quot;venom\\&quot; in the name makes it sound kinda cool and glamourous, hey, I dug it and fell for it too.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>The shine is nice, and I like the fact that it can be easily mixed with your favorite lipstick shade.</li>
            <li>Sweet but bearable -</li>
            <li>I actually have 2 good friends who work at Sephora and even though they work on commission, went out of their way to talk me out of buying this product (</li>
            <li>It does tingle, but it&#x27;s not painful or distracting.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skinny lizzard lips look full.</li>
            <li>Also, the gloss, although appearing nearly colorless in the tube, seemed to bring a nice color into my lips.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that it made my lips fuller, but I already have full lips.</li>
            <li>The gloss has a sweet cinnamon taste and isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li>everyone around you wonders where you get thisese full lips.</li>
            <li>(though then you have to like the glossy/sparkly look, which you do need to be either pretty young, or of ethic origin (most African-American women are born with such a beautiful genetic makeup that they can get away with any lip look they want except maybe bright blue) to pull off.</li>
            <li>the tingly-ness doesn&#x27;t sting, it actually feels good in a very \\&quot;I&#x27;m aware of my lips</li>
            <li>Other than that GREAT.</li>
            <li>Other than that GREAT.</li>
            <li>though I guess applying the product outside the lipline can make that area appear more colored, so that can create the illusion of more lip.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The gloss also comes off rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Super shiny lips.  </li>
            <li>Do it right, do it the original way.</li>
            <li>Some great things that you can do is put the venom over lined lips (nude color, nothing that&#x27;s too dark for your complexion) and you will be amazed with the results</li>
            <li>It looks good over lipstains, lipsticks or by itself and my lips stay shiny for a long time.</li>
            <li>Ok, so this lip gloss doesn&#x27;t really plump your lips, but do you really think it would give you Angelina Jolie lips?!</li>
            <li>GREAT PLUMPING EFFECT .. PLEASANT TASTE .. AND NOT TOO THICK AND GOOPY !!!</li>
            <li>It plumps up your lips, and when you first put it on, it makes your lips tingle for a linute or two!</li>
            <li>This lip gloss is AMAZING, but if all your looking is for the redness, then try goin with bonibell strawberry that is my second fav lip gloss.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t need this product - I have huge lips as it is.</li>
            <li>Benefit&#x27;s Lip Plump is a far better product.</li>
            <li>all in all it is definitely worth the somewhat steep price because of all the benefits it provides.</li>
            <li>This might be useful for a 15 minute photo shoot or something</li>
            <li>For $15 this product isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll just have to decide for yourself if trying this is worth the money.</li>
            <li>But, if you think you might want to try one of these lip-plumper products, make it worth your effort and try Lip Venon, rather than skimping on a cheaper brand.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working or not, but I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff.</li>
            <li>From my own experience, this did not make my lips bigger.  </li>
            <li>This irritation is amplified when placed on one of the thinnest skinned, and most sensitive areas of your body -- your lips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s up to you to decide if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>, I thought the shine it gave was nice too, but I didn&#x27;t expect my lips to get that much bigger, and they did.</li>
            <li>It may be a rip off but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a nice gloss, with sweet &amp; hot flavor (cinnamon) and a touch of glitter (all be it very SLIGHT touch), then you may love this product.  </li>
            <li>I even love the packaging (the cute orange-ish tube thingy that you have to unscrew to get the pink tube out)!</li>
            <li>other bonus, you can mix it with your favorite gloss to create a tingly gloss in your favorite color..</li>
            <li>I am overall quite pleased with the product and found that it does, for the greater part, live up to it&#x27;s proclimation.</li>
            <li>Usually, the glossy clear/nude look is more popular with caucasian teens.</li>
            <li>Reviewing it as simply a lip gloss, it&#x27;s very good, possibly the best I&#x27;ve encountered; but it&#x27;s difficult to get over</li>
            <li>dont expect major results with it, it nothing like getting your lips injected with a filler thats for sure.</li>
            <li>venom is high shine, it is not sticky at all, which is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>It is high shine which is good, but it also stings (especially the first time you use it).</li>
            <li>I used to wear it when my husband and I first dated...and every time he kissed me - he&#x27;d laugh at the tingle.  </li>
            <li>I am a fan of spicy foods, hot sauce, fresh ginger, Altoids, and the like, so I would not call myself a spice wimp.</li>
            <li>I noticed quite an enhancement in natural color on my lips and as it sat for a few minutes my lips became a bit more pouty (I have fairly pouty lips in the first place).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I certainly would have told the truth!</li>
            <li>Sovage has less bite and doesn&#x27;t make my lips pinker, but seems just as good of a lip gloss.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this would be posted if I told you which one actually DOES work, but I can tell you that you can do much better than thi, and without breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, the price is right.</li>
            <li>Aside from giving you a non-sticky shine, it enhances your natural lip color (perfect since I don&#x27;t like lipstick) and it feels like the tingling actually helps to penetrate the skin to moisturize my dry lips!</li>
            <li>after long time usage, it really does make your lips feel amazing  2.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any changes that the product claims and was mostly bothered by the constant irritation.</li>
            <li>then a smidge on top of my regular gloss.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been married 3 1/2 years now - and every once in a while...</li>
            <li>I already have pretty plump lips</li>
            <li>It was an interesting experience that is similar to getting Crest cinammon rush toothpaste or tobasco sauce on my lips.</li>
            <li>The reaction gave my lips a nice deeper pink color without the need of lipstick.</li>
            <li>&quot; was the first) about 4-5 years ago.</li>
            <li>Your lips end up feeling like you&#x27;ve just eaten a couple of hot wings...</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t hurt, and it&#x27;s not scary, so don&#x27;t get all wimpy on me and go buy the lip venom lite.</li>
            <li>, I would use this product again - but I most likely won&#x27;t buy another tube when this one runs out, unless it was given to me.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I get the same effects (and better i think) from the tinted glosses.</li>
            <li>but I was willing to suffer some if it did some plumping.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the way it plumps up your lips and makes them red, but I get the feeling it has more to do with</li>
            <li>I waited patiently for my birthday and Christmas to arrive and was gifted with not one - but 5 different Lip Venom products.</li>
            <li>this product is ok, it gives you a tiny bit of size for about 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Plus, the swelling did not last more that 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>When I first got this, I put it on over lipstick and it didn&#x27;t do anything but add a lot of shine.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell that my lips puffed up any, but they are a nice pink color.</li>
            <li>Next time you buy lip gloss, try M.A.C. Lip glass because you get more for your money.</li>
            <li>I bought it and the first time I put it on it stung.</li>
            <li>If your new lip look generates some amorous advances and you find yourself kissed, you will transfer all this wonderful stuff, and all the irritating side effects, to your kissing partner.</li>
            <li>Feels very cool when you put on your lips, and has a nice shine, but it was very small.</li>
            <li>OK I&#x27;m just old enough to wants my lips to be fuller, but I&#x27;m not crazy enough to submit to any kind of plastic surgery or even injections.</li>
            <li>The immediate effect is no different than any other top quality lip gloss, it left an attractive, glossy shine.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s been 10 minutes and my lips are full, though I have noticed a decrease in fullness from the time I first applied.    </li>
            <li>But I tried it at Urban Outfitters, and became so addicted to the warm, pleasant tingling</li>
            <li>They seem to plump up a bit more when first applied but then go back to normal.</li>
            <li>but it certainly doesn&#x27;t puff up or even redden my lips.</li>
            <li>(Although I do have rather large hands...)  </li>
            <li>my niece would use some rose balm under it and then a little DuWop.</li>
            <li>Lip Venom will also thicken fairly quickly, and hey girls, we all love that thick gloopy feel, right?</li>
            <li>A few days later I felt brave and tried the stuff again</li>
            <li>Mine tend to be pale-ish like the rest of my complexion, but this product really made them rosier.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice that much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so much about this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read so much about this stuff.</li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t notice much difference in the size and color of my lips after applying.  </li>
            <li>, the gloss is very shiny and adheres well to the lips (it won&#x27;t survive a meal, of course), it smells pleasent.</li>
            <li>DuWop Lip Venom is one of those products that I decided to buy because I had heard so much about it and figured I would give it a go.</li>
            <li>and then I take my middle finger and lightly patt the excess off.</li>
            <li>the gloss is very shiny and not sticky</li>
            <li>You enjoy constantly worrying it will smear!</li>
            <li>You enjoy constantly worrying it will smear!</li>
            <li>Oh, and it&#x27;s really really shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is all very well</li>
            <li>Which isn&#x27;t much to me..  </li>
            <li>I waited five minutes, and still nothing really changed.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this really made my lips look fuller</li>
            <li>I suppose some people might not like it, but I really found it invigorating.  </li>
            <li>Try it if you want something that will really work, just be forewarned.     </li>
            <li>It is really adddicting.</li>
            <li>I really tried to like this lip gloss.</li>
            <li>for the &#x27;lip plumping effects&#x27; they are real.</li>
            <li>The picture is very misleading.  </li>
            <li>While I really like the color Lip Venom brings to my lips, I can&#x27;t ignore the fact that they a) don&#x27;t look any poutier, and b) sting continuously.</li>
            <li>haha)</li>
            <li>this gloss really was.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>they are a great confidence booster for people that have thin lips.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go again.</li>
            <li>The shine is amazing and it is not at all sticky or gross tasting like many other similar products on the market today.   </li>
            <li>i will give it 4 stars since it proved to be better than a lot of other lip plumpers i used.</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;d end up writhing on my floor in agony, a victim of my own vanity - reduced to crawling across the floor to reach the phone and dial 911 as my chemically scalded lips swelled as anaphylactic shock nearly snuffed me out at the ripe old age of forty-one.  </li>
            <li>Or maybe it&#x27;s because we&#x27;re supposed to reapply to our lips often, thereby keeping them full of moisture, which also makes it seem our lips are larger because of the moisture that&#x27;s being sealed in.     </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive lips I would recommend putting something under it first.</li>
            <li>It really does work, if you are looking for Angelina Jolie lips, I doubt this will work for you, but if you want a little more shape and a nifty tingly sensation.. this IS the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Wearing an uncomfortable cosmetic that doesn&#x27;t exactly deliver any spectacular results isn&#x27;t really my idea of fun.</li>
            <li>because it is a semi-thick gloss, applied with a brush, it won&#x27;t last you more than a couple weeks if you are using it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I was first made aware of Lip Venom by an online friend and became instantly intrigued.</li>
            <li>I believe this product works psychologically; because it leaves a tingly sensation, the user is more likely to feel/believe that her lips are plumper/poutier.    </li>
            <li>So, I decided it was high time</li>
            <li>Not even a little bit more pout.</li>
            <li>AT ALL!!!! I thought, ok, maybe my lips will get a little rosy.</li>
            <li>It does feel a little spicy, but I find it refreshing.</li>
            <li>I was prepared for the strong stinging/ tingling sensation that the other reviewers had told me about.</li>
            <li>far as whether it works...I found that it really did improve the color of my lips.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re about to kiss someone i&#x27;d warn them first or they might me pretty shocked lol.</li>
            <li>This product comes with lofty claims of lush full lips and that is simply not the case.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes, a lovely tingly sensation began.  </li>
            <li>I already have full lips, but using this makes me feel like Angelina Jolie&#x27;s long lost sister.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;burn\\&quot; was more like a heavy tingle.  </li>
            <li>I found myself enjoying the slight stinging feeling and when it wore off, I wanted to re-apply and experience it again!</li>
            <li>Once the stinging wears off, I put it right back on.</li>
            <li>I am not completely disapponted in this product, due to the price, and the fact that it IS a nice brush-on gloss, but as a plumper I am still not convinced.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever eaten good hot and sour soup, or one of those dried hot red peppers in szechuan cooking, that is the level of &#x27;spice&#x27; I attribute to Lip Venom.</li>
            <li>Only little problem as with most lip glosses if its sunny and hot it&#x27;ll feel like its leaking all over your mouth.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes, it started to warm up and sting a little, but it was not painful.</li>
            <li>Only little problem as with most lip glosses if its sunny and hot it&#x27;ll feel like its leaking all over your mouth.  </li>
            <li>do recommend at least trying the lip venom because I have seen it work nicely on others with very little \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; factor on most.  </li>
            <li>With lip plumers being the seemingly new rage, I decided it was about time</li>
            <li>On the up side it&#x27;s not terribly sticky and lasts a while (mostly becaue you&#x27;re afraid to lick your lips).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because of the low price, you could try this out for fun, to experiment with, or again, if you like the clear gloss look.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Because of the low price, you could try this out for fun, to experiment with, or again, if you like the clear gloss look.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that if I use this regularly it moisturizes and softens my lips and makes them feel better than any other regiem that I have tried.</li>
            <li>and I am extremely sensitive!  </li>
            <li>my lips DO look more \\&quot;pillowy\\&quot; than usual.</li>
            <li>, the first thing I noticed about the product was that it is tiny.  </li>
            <li>At first I was a bit nervous about ordering this product after reading some of the reviews, but finally I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>Like everyone is saying, the key to the hot lips is irritation.</li>
            <li>It comes in an almost mini-bottle which actually makes it easy to stuff in small places like a tiny pocket in your skirt, etc, which makes reapplications easy.</li>
            <li>Plus, as many people have said, the tube is tiny and really not worth the price.</li>
            <li>It tingles a little, but I almost enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It does give you a very high shine, but I wish the container was larger.</li>
            <li>The tingle is definitely not that strong, I would equate it to spicy foods and cinnamon gum like some other reviewers did.  </li>
            <li>I did find that it created a burning sensation on the lips, but I found the sensation more interesting than painful.</li>
            <li>Even when I was a teenager I didn&#x27;t go for the clear gloss look.</li>
            <li>stuff goes really fast, and it&#x27;s kind of expensive...</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading the reviews here, I was curious as to just how much it would sting...but being a lover of szechuan cuisine and all things spicy, I knew it wouldn&#x27;t be too much of a problem.</li>
            <li>I have naturally plump lips</li>
            <li>Just a warning - - NOT for those with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The glossy shine really makes them appear to be bigger and pouty though.</li>
            <li>The stinging sensation, which is considerable in this product, is your lip letting you know there is an irritant on your lips.</li>
            <li>IVE TRIED EVERY THING AND LIP VENOM IS BY FAR</li>
            <li>would really recommend a different product and to save your money.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is how sticky it can be when I first apply it, and how I feel like I have to sit with my lips sticking out for a while after I put it on (kind of like when you paint your nails and they completely dry</li>
            <li>For $15, you get a big, fancy package with a tiny tube of cinnamon gloss inside of it that doesn&#x27;t make any more difference in the size of your lips than any other quality gloss.  </li>
            <li>I had such high, high hopes for this product; some of the reviewers actually had me mildly frightened (I have a low pain threshold, very low)</li>
            <li>You do feel a slight tingling sensation, but it was not painful at all.</li>
            <li>I decided it would be a special little treat, just this once</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin, a lot of things break me out and even certain moisturizers and lip glosses will dry my skin out...</li>
            <li>DO NOT put this product on a dry or sensitive lip or the sensation will move from irritation to pure pain.</li>
            <li>It tingles a little (not painful or anything).  </li>
            <li>The high cost inspired me to check out similar products.</li>
            <li>The package is fairly large but the actual product container is VERY TINY.  </li>
            <li>I love the taste and the feeling of this \\&quot;plumper\\&quot;, however, it does not stay on the lips long, usually no more than an hour.</li>
            <li>I naturally have fair/ sensitive skin and products such as nair and tanning lotions have irriated my skin</li>
            <li>I was dismayed at the tiny size of this lip gloss and the rather expensive price, but I wanted to try it because I&#x27;d heard good things about it.  </li>
            <li>I find that you have to pretty much apply a little outside of your lip line in order to get the plumpiest and poutiest look.  </li>
            <li>I personally like to apply a super thin layer of Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve first onto my lips, letting it sit for a few minutes and then lightly tissuing it off to ensure that lips are moisturized.</li>
            <li>but if you like spicy food, or even those fiery Atomic fireballs, you are in for a major fizzle with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I put this product on my bare lips, and did it ever sting!</li>
            <li>Hopefully it wasn&#x27;t a total waste if I can save someone money by telling you my experience!ly, and hey girls, we all love that thick gloopy feel, right?</li>
            <li>far as this burning your lips:  it totally depends on your skin type, I guess.  </li>
            <li>but I barely felt anything at all.</li>
            <li>Your body&#x27;s natural response to this irritant is to send extra blood to the area of irritation to try to protect it from harm.</li>
            <li>At any rate, I decided at once that I really liked the product, despite the fact that it failed to make my lips look like pillows.  </li>
            <li>The tube, excluding the cap, is a little bit more than an inch and a half.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not certain that it really works on me,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fun to try to get on the applicator after half is used up!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fun to try to get on the applicator after half is used up!  </li>
            <li>It brings a mild, sexy color, and it doesn&#x27;t taste nor smell bad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also less heavy than most glosses</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t get me wrong, but you can get a very similar type of consistency, shine and a more intense flavor from your local Walgreen&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>This really dosent burn your lips like you read from the other reviews.</li>
            <li>I thought this product was fantastic.. gave a subtle gloss look but lasted ages.</li>
            <li>thinking that my first go round was a fluke.</li>
            <li>This product did sting quite a bit the first few times I used it</li>
            <li>Because DuWop Venom Flash has a relatively large amount of the cinnamon oil as an ingredient, it will make your lips look fuller in addition to causing above average irritation for this product category.</li>
            <li>A slight improvement but not that much...</li>
            <li>If you can chronically dry lips or sensitive skin, you might want to stay away.  </li>
            <li>There is a slight burn, but I like the way it tingles, and if you don&#x27;t cake it on, it doesn&#x27;t burn as much.</li>
            <li>It has a long nail polish like wand with a soft white brush on the end.</li>
            <li>My roommate finds it downright painful, but I find the spicy sting to be somewhat pleasant.</li>
            <li>felt like I should weigh in on this product because I&#x27;ve tried nearly every single lip plumper out there since they started coming out</li>
            <li>it does make your lips plump a bit, but its not long lasting...</li>
            <li>I have thin lips and Lip Venom plumps ever so slightly and shines nicely.</li>
            <li>As a combo with the lip venom, I usually use a little super spicy hot sauce on my lips, careful not to get it on my tongue.</li>
            <li>If you are over 25 and your lips look fantastic with only a transparent sheen (a thick one), then you probably don&#x27;t need this product!</li>
            <li>The container is very small, so you go through it rather quickly.</li>

            <li> This lip gloss is very nice, except the size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so great when it gets all over your drinking glass and gets things( like your own hair, if your hair is longer than chin-length) stuck in it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so great when it gets all over your drinking glass and gets things( like your own hair, if your hair is longer than chin-length) stuck in it!</li>
            <li> it works the best because it irritates the most.</li>
            <li> within 5 minutes of applying this product my lips felt warm and tingly but nothing unbearable, infact the tingling was kind of soothing to me along with the wonderful cinnamon smell.</li>
            <li> And it smells good- tastes cinnamony</li>
            <li> its a good gloss, but you can get gloss at the drugstore for 1/3 of the price</li>
            <li> This is a kind of product I would be happy to go out and get again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I dont think it would feel good on chapped lips.</li>
            <li> It does smell good and the texture is good</li>
            <li> I bought this after hearing how good it works on stimulating blood flow and adding color and plump to your lips.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not totally bad, just not the best!</li>
            <li> I guess the best way to describe it would be to say it is a mild burning tingle.  </li>
            <li> I was also very, very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> it makes you feel very sexy</li>
            <li> My sister and I (along with our very adventurous husbands) all tried this out one night.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to make my lips any fuller though, but I think it is the glossiest lip gloss I own, and I own a good amount of lip gloss.  </li>
            <li> I love the tingly feeling!</li>
            <li> I love the way this stuff smells!</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s so shiny/glossy!</li>
            <li> Oh, and your partner will just love the globby look too!</li>
            <li> Oh, and your partner will just love the globby look too!</li>
            <li> within is potent!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff!</li>
            <li> With a $15 price tag, I sort of hoped for more than that!  </li>
            <li> I love the shine, the color, and the tingle!  </li>
            <li> The illusion of sexy sensuality will all be shot as your kisser declares, \\&quot;What&#x27;s that!?</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Although I realize the color was because of an irritation, I actually liked the resulting blushing of my lips.     </li>
            <li> And I didnt expect those kind of results</li>
            <li> I found that the Lip Venom does give my lips some nice color by bringing the blood to my lips -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too goopy, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> All in all, a nice lip gloss, but not a must-have.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> Yet, there are hundrends of glosses out there for that kind of money.  </li>
            <li> or you can wear it on its own.</li>
            <li> Very strong stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I felt like I was chewing very strong cinnamon gum.  </li>
            <li> I wear this stuff mostly because of the amazing shine it gives, and because I *love*</li>
            <li> I love this lip gloss, it&#x27;s excellent as a gloss and does give your lips some natural color and shape.</li>
            <li> The price at first is a bit off-putting but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I doubt that they really swelled at all, but they felt good, and they had a nice sheen.  </li>
            <li> I like Too Face &#x27;Fat Kiss&#x27; better.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have to hand it to the Lip Venom PR team; they are excellent corporate soldiers.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous marketing strategy!  </li>
            <li> The best part is, the effects actually get better with more use.</li>
            <li> Mostly?</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t just give the illusion of fuller, poutier lips.</li>
            <li> but i like this better than lip infusion</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who to be more ashamed of?</li>
            <li> this product is not going to magically give them to you, BUT it does make a difference.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t thing i&#x27;d buy it agian because I am sure I will find a better one.</li>
            <li> I personally love the cinnamon taste and tingling sensation</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just looking for some sexy lip gloss for a date then go for the Lip Venom.</li>
            <li> I love the spicy feeling and</li>
            <li> but I have not found anything that&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> but it goes away after five minutes and as for the plumping effect it does make them a bit fuller but its more of a state of mind, that when u have it on</li>
            <li> and I should add, they didn&#x27;t try to push something more pricey on me</li>
            <li> I take pains with making my lips look outstanding,</li>
            <li> I just love the look and it gives my self-confidence a boost).</li>
            <li> I just love the look and it gives my self-confidence a boost).</li>
            <li> My lips are OKAY in size - my top lip being thinner than my bottom.  </li>
            <li> Even if it&#x27;s pricy, it&#x27;s a perfect present for your bud, or parents,</li>
            <li> Truly, I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is nice as a light gloss, but don&#x27;t expect it to replace fillers that plump up your lips.  </li>
            <li> I get better plumping results with Lip Injection but</li>
            <li> You may be pleased.</li>
            <li> but it sure made them feel that way.</li>
            <li> However, I was eventually able to rationalize myself into buying the stuff.  </li>
            <li> After about 5 minutes, my lips felt lovely.  </li>
            <li> Most lip plumpers on the market today work to &#x27;plump&#x27; your lips through this process of irritation.     </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It gets warm, but I really enjoy the sensation.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the smell.</li>
            <li> not as sure about the plumping</li>
            <li> Make sure your lips are moisturized...</li>
            <li> Some people find the tingling/burning sensation enjoyable while others want to peel their lips off.</li>
            <li> I think the colored squeeze tube glosses are a better deal.</li>
            <li> You get more product AND its colored.</li>
            <li> Love that.  </li>
            <li> love the regular venom, which can be worn over your favorite color for a wonderful shine, the flash, with silver or gold shimmer in it, and the gel gloss as well.</li>
            <li> Like most people, I bought this product to have fuller plumper lips.</li>
            <li> , I have used this product as well as Lancomes Juicy Tubes and find that Lancomes gloss does a better job at giving me poutier lips.  </li>
            <li> OK, I know it was foolish to believe that a gloss can pump my lips up</li>
            <li> As a gloss it is Ok; there&#x27;s no flavour, no stickiness whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> have let most of my friends try it</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying i love this stuff.</li>
            <li> personally i love lips</li>
            <li> Using this wonderful gloss will help not only your view of your lips</li>
            <li> I love the stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, it tastes pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that just the smallest bit is perfect, and as long as I don&#x27;t kiss my boyfriend immediately after I put it on, he doesn&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> overall, it makes your lips feel good, and look good.    </li>
            <li> As a general gloss it is good, nice and shiny and not at all goopy or sticky.</li>
            <li> okay, then stick with the cheap stuff then....  </li>
            <li> It also works great alone for those that like a natural look.</li>
            <li> and i think they are one of the most important parts of your body.  </li>
            <li> yeah, right!!</li>
            <li> This lip gloss is really cool!</li>
            <li> Because of the consistency, it doesn&#x27;t wipe off easily.</li>
            <li> So much so that I laughed when I saw it, since it comes in a HUGE box.  </li>
            <li> Before I applied, I wiped my lips to make sure that they were clean and to be able to receive the full effect.  </li>
            <li> When you first put it on it gives you a beautiful high glass shine.</li>
            <li> When you first put it on it gives you a beautiful high glass shine.  </li>
            <li> It makes my lips super shiny and sexy.</li>
            <li> The plumping effects, for me, were more mild.</li>
            <li> Within 5 minutes I could tell a complete difference in my lips, they were fuller, very smooth, and gave my lips a nice color.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in the size of my lips when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Plus the tubes are huge, the gloss stays on your lips longer and the burn lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Since it wasn&#x27;t (and still isn&#x27;t) available in my country, I ordered it online.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry if it sounds like I&#x27;m taking all the fun out of it, I love to get playful with make-up too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry if it sounds like I&#x27;m taking all the fun out of it, I love to get playful with make-up too.</li>
            <li> The discomfort reminded me of the term \\&quot;slave to beauty,\\&quot; and I broke free when I tossed the Venom in the trash.</li>
            <li> Your lips feel \\&quot;bee-stung\\&quot; (I love that expression), which the marketing people know is the look you are going for, so it must be working, right?</li>
            <li> Although I enjoyed this product, I cannot give it more than three stars for two main reasons.</li>
            <li> I know having \\&quot;venom\\&quot; in the name makes it sound kinda cool and glamourous, hey, I dug it and fell for it too.</li>
            <li> I know having \\&quot;venom\\&quot; in the name makes it sound kinda cool and glamourous, hey, I dug it and fell for it too.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> The shine is nice, and I like the fact that it can be easily mixed with your favorite lipstick shade.</li>
            <li> Sweet but bearable -</li>
            <li> I actually have 2 good friends who work at Sephora and even though they work on commission, went out of their way to talk me out of buying this product (</li>
            <li> It does tingle, but it&#x27;s not painful or distracting.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skinny lizzard lips look full.</li>
            <li> Also, the gloss, although appearing nearly colorless in the tube, seemed to bring a nice color into my lips.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that it made my lips fuller, but I already have full lips.</li>
            <li> The gloss has a sweet cinnamon taste and isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li> everyone around you wonders where you get thisese full lips.</li>
            <li> (though then you have to like the glossy/sparkly look, which you do need to be either pretty young, or of ethic origin (most African-American women are born with such a beautiful genetic makeup that they can get away with any lip look they want except maybe bright blue) to pull off.</li>
            <li> the tingly-ness doesn&#x27;t sting, it actually feels good in a very \\&quot;I&#x27;m aware of my lips</li>
            <li> Other than that GREAT.</li>
            <li> Other than that GREAT.</li>
            <li> though I guess applying the product outside the lipline can make that area appear more colored, so that can create the illusion of more lip.  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The gloss also comes off rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Super shiny lips.  </li>
            <li> Do it right, do it the original way.</li>
            <li> Some great things that you can do is put the venom over lined lips (nude color, nothing that&#x27;s too dark for your complexion) and you will be amazed with the results</li>
            <li> It looks good over lipstains, lipsticks or by itself and my lips stay shiny for a long time.</li>
            <li> Ok, so this lip gloss doesn&#x27;t really plump your lips, but do you really think it would give you Angelina Jolie lips?!</li>
            <li> GREAT PLUMPING EFFECT .. PLEASANT TASTE .. AND NOT TOO THICK AND GOOPY !!!</li>
            <li> It plumps up your lips, and when you first put it on, it makes your lips tingle for a linute or two!</li>
            <li> This lip gloss is AMAZING, but if all your looking is for the redness, then try goin with bonibell strawberry that is my second fav lip gloss.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t need this product - I have huge lips as it is.</li>
            <li> Benefit&#x27;s Lip Plump is a far better product.</li>
            <li> all in all it is definitely worth the somewhat steep price because of all the benefits it provides.</li>
            <li> This might be useful for a 15 minute photo shoot or something</li>
            <li> For $15 this product isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll just have to decide for yourself if trying this is worth the money.</li>
            <li> But, if you think you might want to try one of these lip-plumper products, make it worth your effort and try Lip Venon, rather than skimping on a cheaper brand.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working or not, but I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff.</li>
            <li> From my own experience, this did not make my lips bigger.  </li>
            <li> This irritation is amplified when placed on one of the thinnest skinned, and most sensitive areas of your body -- your lips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s up to you to decide if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> , I thought the shine it gave was nice too, but I didn&#x27;t expect my lips to get that much bigger, and they did.</li>
            <li> It may be a rip off but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a nice gloss, with sweet &amp; hot flavor (cinnamon) and a touch of glitter (all be it very SLIGHT touch), then you may love this product.  </li>
            <li> I even love the packaging (the cute orange-ish tube thingy that you have to unscrew to get the pink tube out)!</li>
            <li> other bonus, you can mix it with your favorite gloss to create a tingly gloss in your favorite color..</li>
            <li> I am overall quite pleased with the product and found that it does, for the greater part, live up to it&#x27;s proclimation.</li>
            <li> Usually, the glossy clear/nude look is more popular with caucasian teens.</li>
            <li> Reviewing it as simply a lip gloss, it&#x27;s very good, possibly the best I&#x27;ve encountered; but it&#x27;s difficult to get over</li>
            <li> dont expect major results with it, it nothing like getting your lips injected with a filler thats for sure.</li>
            <li> venom is high shine, it is not sticky at all, which is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> It is high shine which is good, but it also stings (especially the first time you use it).</li>
            <li> I used to wear it when my husband and I first dated...and every time he kissed me - he&#x27;d laugh at the tingle.  </li>
            <li> I am a fan of spicy foods, hot sauce, fresh ginger, Altoids, and the like, so I would not call myself a spice wimp.</li>
            <li> I noticed quite an enhancement in natural color on my lips and as it sat for a few minutes my lips became a bit more pouty (I have fairly pouty lips in the first place).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I certainly would have told the truth!</li>
            <li> Sovage has less bite and doesn&#x27;t make my lips pinker, but seems just as good of a lip gloss.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this would be posted if I told you which one actually DOES work, but I can tell you that you can do much better than thi, and without breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, the price is right.</li>
            <li> Aside from giving you a non-sticky shine, it enhances your natural lip color (perfect since I don&#x27;t like lipstick) and it feels like the tingling actually helps to penetrate the skin to moisturize my dry lips!</li>
            <li> after long time usage, it really does make your lips feel amazing  2.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any changes that the product claims and was mostly bothered by the constant irritation.</li>
            <li> then a smidge on top of my regular gloss.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been married 3 1/2 years now - and every once in a while...</li>
            <li> I already have pretty plump lips</li>
            <li> It was an interesting experience that is similar to getting Crest cinammon rush toothpaste or tobasco sauce on my lips.</li>
            <li> The reaction gave my lips a nice deeper pink color without the need of lipstick.</li>
            <li> &quot; was the first) about 4-5 years ago.</li>
            <li> Your lips end up feeling like you&#x27;ve just eaten a couple of hot wings...</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t hurt, and it&#x27;s not scary, so don&#x27;t get all wimpy on me and go buy the lip venom lite.</li>
            <li> , I would use this product again - but I most likely won&#x27;t buy another tube when this one runs out, unless it was given to me.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I get the same effects (and better i think) from the tinted glosses.</li>
            <li> but I was willing to suffer some if it did some plumping.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the way it plumps up your lips and makes them red, but I get the feeling it has more to do with</li>
            <li> I waited patiently for my birthday and Christmas to arrive and was gifted with not one - but 5 different Lip Venom products.</li>
            <li> this product is ok, it gives you a tiny bit of size for about 15 minutes</li>
            <li> Plus, the swelling did not last more that 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> When I first got this, I put it on over lipstick and it didn&#x27;t do anything but add a lot of shine.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell that my lips puffed up any, but they are a nice pink color.</li>
            <li> Next time you buy lip gloss, try M.A.C. Lip glass because you get more for your money.</li>
            <li> I bought it and the first time I put it on it stung.</li>
            <li> If your new lip look generates some amorous advances and you find yourself kissed, you will transfer all this wonderful stuff, and all the irritating side effects, to your kissing partner.</li>
            <li> Feels very cool when you put on your lips, and has a nice shine, but it was very small.</li>
            <li> OK I&#x27;m just old enough to wants my lips to be fuller, but I&#x27;m not crazy enough to submit to any kind of plastic surgery or even injections.</li>
            <li> The immediate effect is no different than any other top quality lip gloss, it left an attractive, glossy shine.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s been 10 minutes and my lips are full, though I have noticed a decrease in fullness from the time I first applied.    </li>
            <li> But I tried it at Urban Outfitters, and became so addicted to the warm, pleasant tingling</li>
            <li> They seem to plump up a bit more when first applied but then go back to normal.</li>
            <li> but it certainly doesn&#x27;t puff up or even redden my lips.</li>
            <li> (Although I do have rather large hands...)  </li>
            <li> my niece would use some rose balm under it and then a little DuWop.</li>
            <li> Lip Venom will also thicken fairly quickly, and hey girls, we all love that thick gloopy feel, right?</li>
            <li> A few days later I felt brave and tried the stuff again</li>
            <li> Mine tend to be pale-ish like the rest of my complexion, but this product really made them rosier.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice that much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read so much about this stuff.</li>
            <li> but I really didn&#x27;t notice much difference in the size and color of my lips after applying.  </li>
            <li> , the gloss is very shiny and adheres well to the lips (it won&#x27;t survive a meal, of course), it smells pleasent.</li>
            <li> DuWop Lip Venom is one of those products that I decided to buy because I had heard so much about it and figured I would give it a go.</li>
            <li> and then I take my middle finger and lightly patt the excess off.</li>
            <li> the gloss is very shiny and not sticky</li>
            <li> You enjoy constantly worrying it will smear!</li>
            <li> You enjoy constantly worrying it will smear!</li>
            <li> Oh, and it&#x27;s really really shiny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is all very well</li>
            <li> Which isn&#x27;t much to me..  </li>
            <li> I waited five minutes, and still nothing really changed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this really made my lips look fuller</li>
            <li> I suppose some people might not like it, but I really found it invigorating.  </li>
            <li> Try it if you want something that will really work, just be forewarned.     </li>
            <li> It is really adddicting.</li>
            <li> I really tried to like this lip gloss.</li>
            <li> for the &#x27;lip plumping effects&#x27; they are real.</li>
            <li> The picture is very misleading.  </li>
            <li> While I really like the color Lip Venom brings to my lips, I can&#x27;t ignore the fact that they a) don&#x27;t look any poutier, and b) sting continuously.</li>
            <li> haha)</li>
            <li> this gloss really was.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> they are a great confidence booster for people that have thin lips.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go again.</li>
            <li> The shine is amazing and it is not at all sticky or gross tasting like many other similar products on the market today.   </li>
            <li> i will give it 4 stars since it proved to be better than a lot of other lip plumpers i used.</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;d end up writhing on my floor in agony, a victim of my own vanity - reduced to crawling across the floor to reach the phone and dial 911 as my chemically scalded lips swelled as anaphylactic shock nearly snuffed me out at the ripe old age of forty-one.  </li>
            <li> Or maybe it&#x27;s because we&#x27;re supposed to reapply to our lips often, thereby keeping them full of moisture, which also makes it seem our lips are larger because of the moisture that&#x27;s being sealed in.     </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive lips I would recommend putting something under it first.</li>
            <li> It really does work, if you are looking for Angelina Jolie lips, I doubt this will work for you, but if you want a little more shape and a nifty tingly sensation.. this IS the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Wearing an uncomfortable cosmetic that doesn&#x27;t exactly deliver any spectacular results isn&#x27;t really my idea of fun.</li>
            <li> because it is a semi-thick gloss, applied with a brush, it won&#x27;t last you more than a couple weeks if you are using it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I was first made aware of Lip Venom by an online friend and became instantly intrigued.</li>
            <li> I believe this product works psychologically; because it leaves a tingly sensation, the user is more likely to feel/believe that her lips are plumper/poutier.    </li>
            <li> So, I decided it was high time</li>
            <li> Not even a little bit more pout.</li>
            <li> AT ALL!!!! I thought, ok, maybe my lips will get a little rosy.</li>
            <li> It does feel a little spicy, but I find it refreshing.</li>
            <li> I was prepared for the strong stinging/ tingling sensation that the other reviewers had told me about.</li>
            <li> far as whether it works...I found that it really did improve the color of my lips.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re about to kiss someone i&#x27;d warn them first or they might me pretty shocked lol.</li>
            <li> This product comes with lofty claims of lush full lips and that is simply not the case.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes, a lovely tingly sensation began.  </li>
            <li> I already have full lips, but using this makes me feel like Angelina Jolie&#x27;s long lost sister.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;burn\\&quot; was more like a heavy tingle.  </li>
            <li> I found myself enjoying the slight stinging feeling and when it wore off, I wanted to re-apply and experience it again!</li>
            <li> Once the stinging wears off, I put it right back on.</li>
            <li> I am not completely disapponted in this product, due to the price, and the fact that it IS a nice brush-on gloss, but as a plumper I am still not convinced.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever eaten good hot and sour soup, or one of those dried hot red peppers in szechuan cooking, that is the level of &#x27;spice&#x27; I attribute to Lip Venom.</li>
            <li> Only little problem as with most lip glosses if its sunny and hot it&#x27;ll feel like its leaking all over your mouth.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes, it started to warm up and sting a little, but it was not painful.</li>
            <li> Only little problem as with most lip glosses if its sunny and hot it&#x27;ll feel like its leaking all over your mouth.  </li>
            <li> do recommend at least trying the lip venom because I have seen it work nicely on others with very little \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; factor on most.  </li>
            <li> With lip plumers being the seemingly new rage, I decided it was about time</li>
            <li> On the up side it&#x27;s not terribly sticky and lasts a while (mostly becaue you&#x27;re afraid to lick your lips).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the low price, you could try this out for fun, to experiment with, or again, if you like the clear gloss look.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Because of the low price, you could try this out for fun, to experiment with, or again, if you like the clear gloss look.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that if I use this regularly it moisturizes and softens my lips and makes them feel better than any other regiem that I have tried.</li>
            <li> and I am extremely sensitive!  </li>
            <li> my lips DO look more \\&quot;pillowy\\&quot; than usual.</li>
            <li> , the first thing I noticed about the product was that it is tiny.  </li>
            <li> At first I was a bit nervous about ordering this product after reading some of the reviews, but finally I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> Like everyone is saying, the key to the hot lips is irritation.</li>
            <li> It comes in an almost mini-bottle which actually makes it easy to stuff in small places like a tiny pocket in your skirt, etc, which makes reapplications easy.</li>
            <li> Plus, as many people have said, the tube is tiny and really not worth the price.</li>
            <li> It tingles a little, but I almost enjoy it.</li>
            <li> It does give you a very high shine, but I wish the container was larger.</li>
            <li> The tingle is definitely not that strong, I would equate it to spicy foods and cinnamon gum like some other reviewers did.  </li>
            <li> I did find that it created a burning sensation on the lips, but I found the sensation more interesting than painful.</li>
            <li> Even when I was a teenager I didn&#x27;t go for the clear gloss look.</li>
            <li> stuff goes really fast, and it&#x27;s kind of expensive...</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading the reviews here, I was curious as to just how much it would sting...but being a lover of szechuan cuisine and all things spicy, I knew it wouldn&#x27;t be too much of a problem.</li>
            <li> I have naturally plump lips</li>
            <li> Just a warning - - NOT for those with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The glossy shine really makes them appear to be bigger and pouty though.</li>
            <li> The stinging sensation, which is considerable in this product, is your lip letting you know there is an irritant on your lips.</li>
            <li> IVE TRIED EVERY THING AND LIP VENOM IS BY FAR</li>
            <li> would really recommend a different product and to save your money.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is how sticky it can be when I first apply it, and how I feel like I have to sit with my lips sticking out for a while after I put it on (kind of like when you paint your nails and they completely dry</li>
            <li> For $15, you get a big, fancy package with a tiny tube of cinnamon gloss inside of it that doesn&#x27;t make any more difference in the size of your lips than any other quality gloss.  </li>
            <li> I had such high, high hopes for this product; some of the reviewers actually had me mildly frightened (I have a low pain threshold, very low)</li>
            <li> You do feel a slight tingling sensation, but it was not painful at all.</li>
            <li> I decided it would be a special little treat, just this once</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin, a lot of things break me out and even certain moisturizers and lip glosses will dry my skin out...</li>
            <li> DO NOT put this product on a dry or sensitive lip or the sensation will move from irritation to pure pain.</li>
            <li> It tingles a little (not painful or anything).  </li>
            <li> The high cost inspired me to check out similar products.</li>
            <li> The package is fairly large but the actual product container is VERY TINY.  </li>
            <li> I love the taste and the feeling of this \\&quot;plumper\\&quot;, however, it does not stay on the lips long, usually no more than an hour.</li>
            <li> I naturally have fair/ sensitive skin and products such as nair and tanning lotions have irriated my skin</li>
            <li> I was dismayed at the tiny size of this lip gloss and the rather expensive price, but I wanted to try it because I&#x27;d heard good things about it.  </li>
            <li> I find that you have to pretty much apply a little outside of your lip line in order to get the plumpiest and poutiest look.  </li>
            <li> I personally like to apply a super thin layer of Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve first onto my lips, letting it sit for a few minutes and then lightly tissuing it off to ensure that lips are moisturized.</li>
            <li> but if you like spicy food, or even those fiery Atomic fireballs, you are in for a major fizzle with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I put this product on my bare lips, and did it ever sting!</li>
            <li> Hopefully it wasn&#x27;t a total waste if I can save someone money by telling you my experience!ly, and hey girls, we all love that thick gloopy feel, right?</li>
            <li> far as this burning your lips:  it totally depends on your skin type, I guess.  </li>
            <li> but I barely felt anything at all.</li>
            <li> Your body&#x27;s natural response to this irritant is to send extra blood to the area of irritation to try to protect it from harm.</li>
            <li> At any rate, I decided at once that I really liked the product, despite the fact that it failed to make my lips look like pillows.  </li>
            <li> The tube, excluding the cap, is a little bit more than an inch and a half.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not certain that it really works on me,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fun to try to get on the applicator after half is used up!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fun to try to get on the applicator after half is used up!  </li>
            <li> It brings a mild, sexy color, and it doesn&#x27;t taste nor smell bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also less heavy than most glosses</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get me wrong, but you can get a very similar type of consistency, shine and a more intense flavor from your local Walgreen&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> This really dosent burn your lips like you read from the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was fantastic.. gave a subtle gloss look but lasted ages.</li>
            <li> thinking that my first go round was a fluke.</li>
            <li> This product did sting quite a bit the first few times I used it</li>
            <li> Because DuWop Venom Flash has a relatively large amount of the cinnamon oil as an ingredient, it will make your lips look fuller in addition to causing above average irritation for this product category.</li>
            <li> A slight improvement but not that much...</li>
            <li> If you can chronically dry lips or sensitive skin, you might want to stay away.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight burn, but I like the way it tingles, and if you don&#x27;t cake it on, it doesn&#x27;t burn as much.</li>
            <li> It has a long nail polish like wand with a soft white brush on the end.</li>
            <li> My roommate finds it downright painful, but I find the spicy sting to be somewhat pleasant.</li>
            <li> felt like I should weigh in on this product because I&#x27;ve tried nearly every single lip plumper out there since they started coming out</li>
            <li> it does make your lips plump a bit, but its not long lasting...</li>
            <li> I have thin lips and Lip Venom plumps ever so slightly and shines nicely.</li>
            <li> As a combo with the lip venom, I usually use a little super spicy hot sauce on my lips, careful not to get it on my tongue.</li>
            <li> If you are over 25 and your lips look fantastic with only a transparent sheen (a thick one), then you probably don&#x27;t need this product!</li>
            <li> The container is very small, so you go through it rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I got the Too Faced Lip Injection and its a little less tingly and makes my lips look full</li>
            <li> And yes, you can see a minor difference, but the effects for me were not long lasting--</li>
            <li> /&gt;Venom comes in a tiny vial about 1 inch long.</li>
            <li> (i guess because it&#x27;s pretty thick)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed other reviewers were concerned about the amount, but when one considers how little gloss is actually in a tube of Rimmel or Revlon lip gloss and how much if it is really the tube and applicator, I didn&#x27;t consider this to be an issue.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how little this product irritated my lips.  </li>
            <li> It will save you money and possibly a little pain - especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> it gives your lips some slight color; it deepens your natural lip tone.</li>
            <li> You may not realize you have tiny, dry cracks in your lips until this stuff gets in there.</li>
            <li> I personally can&#x27;t stand the burn of altoids but this is quite nice...almost addictive as other posters have said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You only have to use a very small amount, otherwise the shine is just too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll brush a little on, just for old time&#x27;s sake.  </li>
            <li> I was a little surprised at just how tingly</li>
            <li> And if you are on a low budget, please just save your money, as you could get the same effect with a little clove-oil and petroleum jelly, and save it for something that not only works but lasts.  </li>
            <li> And if you are on a low budget, please just save your money, as you could get the same effect with a little clove-oil and petroleum jelly, and save it for something that not only works but lasts.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive for how small the tube is , but overall good product.</li>
            <li> Ill start off by saying, You will not get huge collagen injected looking lips by using lip venom.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I wanted to weigh in because I&#x27;ve been sampling and using all varieties and brands of plumper for so long.</li>
            <li> Firstly, it&#x27;s not as big as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> But I opened the tube, which has a long brush sort of like a nail polish wand, and smeared on some Venom.  </li>
            <li> , if you want pouty lips, Juicy Tubes does a better job and its less expensive.  </li>
            <li> Your lips will swell ever so slightly but (1) it won&#x27;t last but 5-10 minutes and (2) you&#x27;d get the same effect from biting on your lips.</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t think it actually made them swell as much as other reviewers seem to think, or as the product claims.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s one very small container for a whole lot of money.</li>
            <li> The extra blood flow in the lip area, due to the irritation, is what makes your lips appear &#x27;fuller.&#x27;</li>
            <li> All i had felt was a small tingling [[ which i could barely feel, which made me skeptical that it was actually working]], but when i opened my eyes i dicovered that my lips were actually significantly plumper</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on your lips very long.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dry lipsbut</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s decent lipgloss,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: not worth 15.00 and based on the overall results</li>
            <li> I normally do not wear lip gloss because of the sticky factor.   </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the low down: &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> The amount in the vile is so small that you&#x27;d have to use a third of it for it to actually work.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;I am slightly concerned about potiental allergic reactions to Lip Venom, however, as I have several friends who&#x27;re allergic to some of the ingrediants</li>
            <li> It seems the slight tingling sensation is a big part of the selling point.</li>
            <li> Also, they&#x27;re only slightly darker, it DOES NOT look as though I&#x27;d just put on a layer of lipstick, as some users have been stating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still use it because it was so expensive for something so small - and I&#x27;ll hope that it gives me a little bit more upper lip -</li>
            <li> Not even a little tiny bit.</li>
            <li> but I use this to give them a little extra \\&quot;oomph\\&quot;.)</li>
            <li> The only thing i could ask for is for it to make my lips a little plumper.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t hate this product, I certainly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I was totally let down!</li>
            <li> In fact, some of the ones I see now are expensive enough that for the price of a 6-month supply, you could get the real thing from a plastic surgeon.</li>
            <li> I too was curious about the hype surrounding this product, so I was eager to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Save that sparkle for the center of your lower lip to highlight it.  </li>
            <li> Had I read the ingredients carefully I would have bought cinnamon oil and probably saved $15.    </li>
            <li> My lips werent as plump as what i expected them to be.</li>
            <li> Only slight plumping, but gives the lips a glossy shine and a subtle, natural flush.</li>
            <li> After several minutes, I did get a very, very slight heat, and that was it.  </li>
            <li> but in reality it&#x27;s not really as stinging as other have claimed.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that because of the tingling and the feel of a bit of \\&quot;goop\\&quot; on my lips if I fully closed them, I held my lips a little differently (slightly opened and pursed, like how women who get collegen injections hold their lips), which might cause some women to think their lips are larger.</li>
            <li> I waited months before finally buying this because I was afraid of the burn, and was petrified the first time I put it on.   </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way to set your lips tingling.</li>
            <li> the first time I tried this item, I got addicted to it off the bat!    </li>
            <li> You can create an illusion of plumper lips with other products...</li>
            <li> so you can apply your usual lipstick/liner/etc, or blot it for the same reason, then there goes the \\&quot;plumping-pouting\\&quot; effect, because it&#x27;s worn off by then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that using a gloss and a pencil usually makes your lip-line obvious, and the \\&quot;Here, I think you need a napkin\\</li>
            <li> saw other reviews mention the \\&quot;sting\\&quot; effect.</li>
            <li> But when you think about it, if it was any other part of your body, would you use a product for that with \\&quot;venom\\&quot; in the name?</li>
            <li> But when you think about it, if it was any other part of your body, would you use a product for that with \\&quot;venom\\&quot; in the name?</li>
            <li> Hopefully it wasn&#x27;t a total waste if I can save someone money by telling you my experience!</li>
            <li> It does make your lips a shade darker than they usually are, but it doesn&#x27;t last; you have to keep reapplying.  </li>
            <li> I put it on an was bracing myself for the extreme burning people</li>
            <li> I hope that happens to other people and not just me</li>
            <li> It actually does make my lips fuller and gives my naturally pale lips some color!</li>
            <li> I did not have to use a lot of it to get the full effect and the sensation is not completely unbearable unless you find the sensation of putting lip balm on chapped lips incredibly painful.</li>
            <li> 15.00 is soooo not worth it.  </li>
            <li> If you either wait long enough for it to thin out</li>
            <li> Sorry, it really doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> NOT WORTH IT for the money.</li>
            <li> Just not worth it.</li>
            <li> But its definitely a love it or hate it product.  </li>
            <li> Sadly nothing I have tried has given me thick full lips.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll either love it or hate it.</li>
            <li> At $21, it is rather expensive for such a small container -- $16 + $5 for shipping (and tax depending on where you live).    </li>
            <li> Always eager for Angelina Jolie lips, I plunked down $15 for a tube of DuWop Lip Venom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to sound  rude, but please just chill!</li>
            <li> I have used a few other products, and am not convinced of the hype in gloss plumpers.</li>
            <li> This stuff seriously plumped them up, that now I have semi-decent lips (at last!).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s half the price, sometimes lip infusion gets too gunky and sticky for me.</li>
            <li> Does slightly burn?</li>
            <li> I tried the Sovage Lip Plumper trio for a bit less money.</li>
            <li> &quot; photos we took of each other wearing plain gloss.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to try it at first</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;re still the slightest bit worried that if you start using your hands again the polish will mess up.</li>
            <li> Yes it is a bit irritating at first but not as irritating as injections.</li>
            <li> So I thought it could do with a little plumping up.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t even see a little bit of noticeable difference in size.  </li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t get the Lindsey Lohan or Angelina looking lips, there is definitely a little plump.</li>
            <li> Little -</li>
            <li> There was a little tingling</li>
            <li> Wait a little bit and then check out your lips in the mirror.</li>
            <li> But, I was a little put off by the price tag.  </li>
            <li> There is a little tingle.  </li>
            <li> got it in and was a little scared when I applied it because I was expecting a burning sensation, but that never occured.</li>
            <li> My lips turned a little pinker and poutier.</li>
            <li> This time it took a little while to feel anything.  </li>
            <li> and it wakes me up, gives my lips a little shine</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have thin lips, and I don&#x27;t have Angelina Jolie lips either, but to see any effect (even a tiny result)</li>
            <li> warned me it was a waste.</li>
            <li> warned me it was a waste.</li>
            <li> I have extrememly colorless lips (paler than my face, so I look like the walking dead without lipstick)</li>
            <li> I guess it must work for some people because I don&#x27;t see a motive for dozens of women to lie about their experience, however, it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this again.</li>
            <li> but after a while it dried in a crusty-type way.</li>
            <li> I put it on my lips when I&#x27;m feeling tired in the middle of the day</li>
            <li> I am not sure if that is due to the blood rushing to them or what!  </li>
            <li> At first, I found it to be painful, but then something odd happened.</li>
            <li> The only down side to this product is the fact that if you put on too much, your lips start to sting extremely badly!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I only felt a slight, barely-there tingle.</li>
            <li> If you are not bothered by a little spice or heat on your lips, you too, can become a Lip Venom addict - and look fab too!</li>
            <li> Any claims that this product&#x27;s effects last all night are just plain wrong.  </li>
            <li> Any claims that this product&#x27;s effects last all night are just plain wrong.  </li>
            <li> God forbid you get this stuff in a cold sore, split lip, or any other open mouth wound or you will want to slice your lips off.</li>
            <li> , i mean it does sting a little</li>
            <li> The tube is exceptionally small.   </li>
            <li> I usually prefer to wear color underneath it, though.  </li>
            <li> , I learned this the hard way too-</li>
            <li> &quot; look is hard to pull off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was irritating and it hurt a little</li>
            <li> But this lip gloss is shiny, not gloppy, and sparkly (well at least the Lip Venom Flash).</li>
            <li> The way this product works is the cinnamon oils and ginger contained in the ingredients are common irritants to the skin.</li>
            <li> I am completely addicted to the spicy taste and stinging feel after a few seconds of it being on your lips.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t feel like your putting some thick glop on your lips.</li>
            <li> But really, chances are you&#x27;ll just be mad at yourself for wasting your money on it, and finding out that unfortunately,  Jessica Simpson can get away with it, you can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> But really, chances are you&#x27;ll just be mad at yourself for wasting your money on it, and finding out that unfortunately,  Jessica Simpson can get away with it, you can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a brush wand, which I prefer over the fuzzy/felt-like wands because the product goes on easier without disturbing whatever other color you may already have on your lips.</li>
            <li> I mean nothing.  </li>
            <li> the tube is shockingly small!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing on this, but I assume women looking for a lip-plumper with serious effects are at least in their mid-20s and up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I recommend this product, though it is very small- about the size of my pinky.</li>
            <li> Very small.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is very small, I didn&#x27;t see any difference in the size of my lips, but I like the way it makes my lips feel.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to apply this product and then put on your regular lipstick.</li>
            <li> If they say you can use it over your regular lipstick, sorry, they&#x27;re wrong.</li>
            <li> And it truly does inhance the size of your lips subtly.</li>
            <li> Lip Venom does subtly plump the lips.</li>
            <li> I mean use your common sense!</li>
            <li> Be careful, if you slather on an excessive amount, it becomes almost too painful to speak.</li>
            <li> Do I ever feel like a sucker!  </li>
            <li> Too small of a tube..too expensive for the size and does not work.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be disappointed by the tiny tube it comes in.</li>
            <li> Not recommended unless you are really, really tough.</li>
            <li> only thing that saves me from feeling like the biggest idiot in Wisconsin is that I know I am not alone.  </li>
            <li> A thin application</li>
            <li> Take the brush and apply a thin layer over lips.</li>
            <li> I then take the Lip Venom and apply a thin layer onto my lips.</li>
            <li> Then I apply a thin layer of lip gloss</li>
            <li> it plumps lips  (as others have said, if you have thin lips and want Angelina Jolie lips</li>
            <li> But alas I did not, nor did my boyfriend.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it to be irritating or burning at all.  </li>
            <li> They too became addicted.</li>
            <li> I fell for this product becomes of its \\&quot;cool\\&quot; name and false promises - I won&#x27;t buy it again.  </li>
            <li> It did cause my lips to swell a little, but it was very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This product will not give you dramatic results like Angelina Jolie lips</li>
            <li> I found it unpleasant and frankly a little scary.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this product from all the bad reviews, whether its about the irritating sensation or that it has no effect, but i decided to try it myself, actually its not that bad</li>
            <li> but all in all, I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Once bitten, twice shy though, kids.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there was no plumping effect on any of us, as measured by before and after photos, as well as \\&quot;control group\\</li>
            <li> Sorry if this busts anyone&#x27;s bubble</li>
            <li> Depending on your sensitivity, you  may find this product really uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Wrong again.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with having sensual lips...</li>
            <li> It burns TERRIBLY, but it will definitely plump your lips up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too expensive and it hurts.</li>
            <li> But this gloss was frightening and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> And if you don&#x27;t like the tinglie feeling, then sorry!</li>
            <li> Some people note the burning, but i don&#x27;t think its that bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of bad things about lip venom.</li>
            <li> I did not turn into Angelina Jolie or even a bad version of Melanie Griffith or Meg Ryan when they had botox.</li>
            <li> They hurt too badly to talk.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting badly.</li>
            <li> but I did not find it painful.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> and you might be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I give up :(</li>
            <li> I find this especially irritating in the corners of the mouth.     </li>
            <li> Was I disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I too was curious about the hype surrounding this product, so I was eager to give it a try.  The tingle is definitely not that strong, I would equate it to spicy foods and cinnamon gum like some other reviewers did.  I am a bit baffled by the one reviewer&#x27;s \\&quot;fear\\&quot; of the tingle, especially since they said they eat altoids.  I personally can&#x27;t stand the burn of altoids but this is quite nice...almost addictive as other posters have said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as whether it works...I found that it really did improve the color of my lips.  Mine tend to be pale-ish like the rest of my complexion, but this product really made them rosier.  The plumping part left something to be desired however. I didn&#x27;t notice that much of a difference.  A slight improvement but not that much...though I guess applying the product outside the lipline can make that area appear more colored, so that can create the illusion of more lip.  However, I didn&#x27;t think it actually made them swell as much as other reviewers seem to think, or as the product claims. Of course, that could be a personal thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this product, though it is very small- about the size of my pinky. It comes with a brush wand, which I prefer over the fuzzy/felt-like wands because the product goes on easier without disturbing whatever other color you may already have on your lips. As a general gloss it is good, nice and shiny and not at all goopy or sticky. Perfect over lipstick or stains.</li>
            <li> You definately get a tingle feeling, and a bit of a sting...it does make your lips plump a bit, but its not long lasting...so for a night out, you would need to keep re-applying...which is why I gave it a 3. The container is very small, so you go through it rather quickly. It does give you a very high shine, but I wish the container was larger. I like Too Face &#x27;Fat Kiss&#x27; better.</li>
            <li> This gloss is like the kinds that you can buy for a dollar except the constant burning sensation. It almost makes you feel like your lips are chapped all the time. I didn&#x27;t notice any changes that the product claims and was mostly bothered by the constant irritation. On the up side it&#x27;s not terribly sticky and lasts a while (mostly becaue you&#x27;re afraid to lick your lips).</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.  But its definitely a love it or hate it product.  If you can chronically dry lips or sensitive skin, you might want to stay away.  Some people note the burning, but i don&#x27;t think its that bad.  Think the lip version of an Altoid cinnamon mint.</li>
            <li> Wow! Do I ever feel like a sucker!  I had such high, high hopes for this product; some of the reviewers actually had me mildly frightened (I have a low pain threshold, very low) that I&#x27;d end up writhing on my floor in agony, a victim of my own vanity - reduced to crawling across the floor to reach the phone and dial 911 as my chemically scalded lips swelled as anaphylactic shock nearly snuffed me out at the ripe old age of forty-one.  Granted, I have a vivid imagination, but talk about being extremely underwhelmed.  I can&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s a \\&quot;light\\&quot; version of this freakishly overpriced lipgloss. That&#x27;s what it is lipgloss.  I mean, it&#x27;s decent lipgloss, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but you can get a very similar type of consistency, shine and a more intense flavor from your local Walgreen&#x27;s.  On a spicy scale, if a red-hot candy is a ten, then Lip Venom is maybe a three at most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fool and her money are soon parted; well, color me a fool.  This is one purchase that I won&#x27;t be making again.  Benefit&#x27;s Lip Plump is a far better product. If you dig that cinnamon thing, use Lip Plump to prep your lips; follow the directions \\&quot;pat, pat, pat\\&quot; line and color your lips and then apply gloss - voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that saves me from feeling like the biggest idiot in Wisconsin is that I know I am not alone.  I have to hand it to the Lip Venom PR team; they are excellent corporate soldiers.  Fabulous marketing strategy!  Very impressive.  Ya got me. Once bitten, twice shy though, kids.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  Did not see a difference whatsoever.  The amount in the vile is so small that you&#x27;d have to use a third of it for it to actually work. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I agree that it works as an irritant.  A salesperson from Sephora recommended Lip Fusion as a scientific approach to actually getting fuller lips.</li>
            <li> This product works great. When you first put it on it gives you a beautiful high glass shine. About a minute or so after it&#x27;ll give you a burning sensation sort of like big red gum on your lips. It \\&quot;swells\\&quot;/ \\&quot;pumps\\&quot; your lips so they look great. Only little problem as with most lip glosses if its sunny and hot it&#x27;ll feel like its leaking all over your mouth. Other than that GREAT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about this stuff. I&#x27;ve read so much about this stuff. So, I decided it was high time I try it out. Since it wasn&#x27;t (and still isn&#x27;t) available in my country, I ordered it online. It arrived quickly. I was also very, very pleased with the results. I have non-existent lips. This stuff seriously plumped them up, that now I have semi-decent lips (at last!). The best part is, the effects actually get better with more use. I love the tingly feeling! I love the way this stuff smells! I love that it&#x27;s so shiny/glossy! I even love the packaging (the cute orange-ish tube thingy that you have to unscrew to get the pink tube out)! Mostly? I love that it doesn&#x27;t just give the illusion of fuller, poutier lips. It actually plumps up my lips!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of bad things about lip venom. i have sensitive skin, a lot of things break me out and even certain moisturizers and lip glosses will dry my skin out... but i like this better than lip infusion and it&#x27;s half the price, sometimes lip infusion gets too gunky and sticky for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who to be more ashamed of? Me for buying this garbage or DuWop for making it and selling it. Does slightly burn? Yes, but it&#x27;s like getting cinnamon toothpaste all over your lips. I would not say it hurt&#x27;s. Does it plump? NO! Not even a little tiny bit. Too small of a tube..too expensive for the size and does not work.</li>
            <li> the first time I tried this item, I got addicted to it off the bat!    1. its not botox, because its only 17.00!!!  2. its 17.00?! okay, then stick with the cheap stuff then....  3. if you dont like the burning sensation, dont buy an item that has \\&quot;venom\\&quot; in the name.  5. if you have chapped lips etc, um use CHAPSTICK to heal your lips before applying lip venom onto your lips.    and here are the perks on the item itself...    1. after long time usage, it really does make your lips feel amazing  2. if you CAN afford this, buy alot of it! re apply everytime you dont get your desired burning sensation.  3. overall, it makes your lips feel good, and look good.    the only flaw is, they neeeeed to come out with a bigger bottle already!!</li>
            <li> Yes, it does sting...No, it does not plump. The gloss also comes off rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I was dismayed at the tiny size of this lip gloss and the rather expensive price, but I wanted to try it because I&#x27;d heard good things about it.  I like the tingly sensation and yummy scent but I really didn&#x27;t notice much difference in the size and color of my lips after applying.  It looks good over lipstains, lipsticks or by itself and my lips stay shiny for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am overall quite pleased with the product and found that it does, for the greater part, live up to it&#x27;s proclimation. A thin application and I did indeed find that my lips were rosier and pleasingly plumper, the gloss is very shiny and adheres well to the lips (it won&#x27;t survive a meal, of course), it smells pleasent. I did find that it created a burning sensation on the lips, but I found the sensation more interesting than painful. I&#x27;ve noticed other reviewers were concerned about the amount, but when one considers how little gloss is actually in a tube of Rimmel or Revlon lip gloss and how much if it is really the tube and applicator, I didn&#x27;t consider this to be an issue. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am slightly concerned about potiental allergic reactions to Lip Venom, however, as I have several friends who&#x27;re allergic to some of the ingrediants and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want to kiss them (or someone with a simular allergy) while wearing this, but otherwise, great product!</li>
            <li> DuWop Lip Venom is one of those products that I decided to buy because I had heard so much about it and figured I would give it a go. I was browsing Sephora a couple months ago and came across Lip Venom. The price at first is a bit off-putting but this stuff is great. It comes in an almost mini-bottle which actually makes it easy to stuff in small places like a tiny pocket in your skirt, etc, which makes reapplications easy. It has a long nail polish like wand with a soft white brush on the end. Take the brush and apply a thin layer over lips. I personally like to apply a super thin layer of Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve first onto my lips, letting it sit for a few minutes and then lightly tissuing it off to ensure that lips are moisturized. I then take the Lip Venom and apply a thin layer onto my lips. I let that sit until the tingly-ness is gone and then I take my middle finger and lightly patt the excess off. Then I apply a thin layer of lip gloss and I&#x27;m set! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also my observations of Lip Venom: &lt;br /&gt;- the tingly-ness doesn&#x27;t sting, it actually feels good in a very \\&quot;I&#x27;m aware of my lips way\\&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;- it plumps lips  (as others have said, if you have thin lips and want Angelina Jolie lips this product is not going to magically give them to you, BUT it does make a difference. I have naturally plump lips but I use this to give them a little extra \\&quot;oomph\\&quot;.) &lt;br /&gt;- the gloss is very shiny and not sticky &lt;br /&gt;- the cinnamon smell is very nice &lt;br /&gt;- it gives your lips some slight color; it deepens your natural lip tone. But it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm in any way so you can still wear all your glosses over or underneath it. As I have said I prefer under but during touch ups I use it both under and then a smidge on top of my regular gloss.  It also works great alone for those that like a natural look. &lt;br /&gt;- it makes you feel very sexy, it makes you feel as if you have \\&quot;Angelina Jolie\\&quot; lips even if it doesn&#x27;t plump them as big as that. &lt;br /&gt;- I have naturally dry lipsbut I&#x27;ve found that if I use this regularly it moisturizes and softens my lips and makes them feel better than any other regiem that I have tried. &lt;br /&gt;- all in all it is definitely worth the somewhat steep price because of all the benefits it provides. &lt;br /&gt;- once you try it you will be hooked.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen this product since it was sold at Skin Market YEARS ago!  I used to wear it when my husband and I first dated...and every time he kissed me - he&#x27;d laugh at the tingle.  We&#x27;ve been married 3 1/2 years now - and every once in a while...I&#x27;ll brush a little on, just for old time&#x27;s sake.  This product definitely makes an impression.  Just a warning - - NOT for those with sensitive skin.  It definitely delivers on the promised tingle!</li>
            <li> I love the taste and the feeling of this \\&quot;plumper\\&quot;, however, it does not stay on the lips long, usually no more than an hour. I find that you have to pretty much apply a little outside of your lip line in order to get the plumpiest and poutiest look.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shine, smell and taste are awesome! &lt;br /&gt;The plumping effect is not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be. I am going to try POP brand bee stung and see how that works. &lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t thing i&#x27;d buy it agian because I am sure I will find a better one. The only way i&#x27;d buy it agian is if it became cheaper and a larger size tube. &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not totally bad, just not the best!</li>
            <li> My sister and I (along with our very adventurous husbands) all tried this out one night. The immediate effect is no different than any other top quality lip gloss, it left an attractive, glossy shine. After a few minutes, it started to warm up and sting a little, but it was not painful. Unfortunately, there was no plumping effect on any of us, as measured by before and after photos, as well as \\&quot;control group\\&quot; photos we took of each other wearing plain gloss.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift and it is an awesome lip gloss! I personally love the cinnamon taste and tingling sensation (others find that it burns, but not me!). It makes my lips super shiny and sexy. I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in the size of my lips when I wear it. I already have pretty plump lips so I&#x27;m too fixated on it. They seem to plump up a bit more when first applied but then go back to normal. The glossy shine really makes them appear to be bigger and pouty though. All in all, if you&#x27;re looking for a drastic change, get a filler treatment. If you&#x27;re just looking for some sexy lip gloss for a date then go for the Lip Venom.</li>
            <li> This product works great. I love the spicy feeling and what it does is it stimulates the blood flow in the applied area and causes the lips to swell. It&#x27;s not life threatening at all but if you have chapped lips I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it b/c it will definately sting. I think it&#x27;s a bit pricy but I have not found anything that&#x27;s better. Some great things that you can do is put the venom over lined lips (nude color, nothing that&#x27;s too dark for your complexion) and you will be amazed with the results</li>
            <li> I got this after hearing about how WONDERFUL it was and I have to say, I&#x27;m a bit disappointed. This might be useful for a 15 minute photo shoot or something but it certainly doesn&#x27;t puff up or even redden my lips. And it&#x27;s totally gone after about 15 minutes. Maybe it needs to be about three shades hotter. Sorry if this busts anyone&#x27;s bubble but if you like spicy food, or even those fiery Atomic fireballs, you are in for a major fizzle with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this product from all the bad reviews, whether its about the irritating sensation or that it has no effect, but i decided to try it myself, actually its not that bad, i mean it does sting a little but it goes away after five minutes and as for the plumping effect it does make them a bit fuller but its more of a state of mind, that when u have it on u feel ur lips are bigger! all in all i will give it 4 stars since it proved to be better than a lot of other lip plumpers i used.</li>
            <li> I heard that this was the best lip plumping product on the market today so I shelled out the 15.00 to road test it.  Here&#x27;s the low down: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Tingle factor - I was very surprised at how little this product irritated my lips.  I was afraid to try it at first but in reality it&#x27;s not really as stinging as other have claimed.  I&#x27;d liken it to cinnamon flavored gum or red hots.  Sweet but bearable - and I am extremely sensitive!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cost factor - Are you kidding me? 15.00 is soooo not worth it.  The tube is exceptionally small.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Plump factor - I did not turn into Angelina Jolie or even a bad version of Melanie Griffith or Meg Ryan when they had botox. This product comes with lofty claims of lush full lips and that is simply not the case. Your lips will swell ever so slightly but (1) it won&#x27;t last but 5-10 minutes and (2) you&#x27;d get the same effect from biting on your lips. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Shine factor: This was probably the best feature of this product.  The shine is amazing and it is not at all sticky or gross tasting like many other similar products on the market today.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: not worth 15.00 and based on the overall results I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> For $15 this product isn&#x27;t worth it. I recommend trying Too Faced Lip Injection.     It is high shine which is good, but it also stings (especially the first time you use it). And it smells good- tastes cinnamony like- but no one could notice that my lips were \\&quot;plumper.\\&quot; Even I couldn&#x27;t tell. You can create an illusion of plumper lips with other products... try this and you might be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It seems the slight tingling sensation is a big part of the selling point. It was an interesting experience that is similar to getting Crest cinammon rush toothpaste or tobasco sauce on my lips. The reaction gave my lips a nice deeper pink color without the need of lipstick. Although I realize the color was because of an irritation, I actually liked the resulting blushing of my lips.     I noticed that because of the tingling and the feel of a bit of \\&quot;goop\\&quot; on my lips if I fully closed them, I held my lips a little differently (slightly opened and pursed, like how women who get collegen injections hold their lips), which might cause some women to think their lips are larger. Or maybe it&#x27;s because we&#x27;re supposed to reapply to our lips often, thereby keeping them full of moisture, which also makes it seem our lips are larger because of the moisture that&#x27;s being sealed in.     Reviewing it as simply a lip gloss, it&#x27;s very good, possibly the best I&#x27;ve encountered; but it&#x27;s difficult to get over that it&#x27;s one very small container for a whole lot of money. The high cost inspired me to check out similar products. I tried the Sovage Lip Plumper trio for a bit less money. Sovage has less bite and doesn&#x27;t make my lips pinker, but seems just as good of a lip gloss. And I prefer the Sovage sponge-tip applicator to the Lip Venom brush.    Although I enjoyed this product, I cannot give it more than three stars for two main reasons. 1) I believe my lips looked no plumper after using the product than before. 2) At $21, it is rather expensive for such a small container -- $16 + $5 for shipping (and tax depending on where you live).    I can&#x27;t help but flip-flop on recommending this product. You&#x27;ll just have to decide for yourself if trying this is worth the money. But, if you think you might want to try one of these lip-plumper products, make it worth your effort and try Lip Venon, rather than skimping on a cheaper brand.</li>
            <li> Also, in this case, you do get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt like I should weigh in on this product because I&#x27;ve tried nearly every single lip plumper out there since they started coming out (I believe \\&quot;Sovage\\&quot; was the first) about 4-5 years ago. In all fairness I should also state that I have NOT tried anything over 100 bucks (some of these lip products are-but please do yourself a favor, humor me and read this, because you&#x27;ll be grateful later that I saved you some money).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my mid thirties and if I could afford it, would go get collagen injections. In fact, some of the ones I see now are expensive enough that for the price of a 6-month supply, you could get the real thing from a plastic surgeon. Anyway, I wanted to weigh in because I&#x27;ve been sampling and using all varieties and brands of plumper for so long. I don&#x27;t think this would be posted if I told you which one actually DOES work, but I can tell you that you can do much better than thi, and without breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, the price is right. And yes, you can see a minor difference, but the effects for me were not long lasting--re-applying the product every couple hours (and that&#x27;s being generous) just doesn&#x27;t work for me. because it is a semi-thick gloss, applied with a brush, it won&#x27;t last you more than a couple weeks if you are using it on a regular basis. I actually have 2 good friends who work at Sephora and even though they work on commission, went out of their way to talk me out of buying this product (and I should add, they didn&#x27;t try to push something more pricey on me instead).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main problem with Lip Venom? I take pains with making my lips look outstanding, the color matching my outfit/look, shaping them with a liner or brush, etc. Want to use this product? If you wear any type of lipstick? Forget it! It is impossible to apply this product and then put on your regular lipstick. If they say you can use it over your regular lipstick, sorry, they&#x27;re wrong. Not only will it not work, it&#x27;ll screw up your lipstick lines. If you either wait long enough for it to thin out so you can apply your usual lipstick/liner/etc, or blot it for the same reason, then there goes the \\&quot;plumping-pouting\\&quot; effect, because it&#x27;s worn off by then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have thin lips, and I don&#x27;t have Angelina Jolie lips either, but to see any effect (even a tiny result) I had to use a lot of product.  Even when I was a teenager I didn&#x27;t go for the clear gloss look. I&#x27;m guessing on this, but I assume women looking for a lip-plumper with serious effects are at least in their mid-20s and up. Usually, the glossy clear/nude look is more popular with caucasian teens. If you are over 25 and your lips look fantastic with only a transparent sheen (a thick one), then you probably don&#x27;t need this product! If they start making it in colors, that&#x27;s different (though then you have to like the glossy/sparkly look, which you do need to be either pretty young, or of ethic origin (most African-American women are born with such a beautiful genetic makeup that they can get away with any lip look they want except maybe bright blue) to pull off. Save that sparkle for the center of your lower lip to highlight it.  Just remember-hey, I learned this the hard way too- that using a gloss and a pencil usually makes your lip-line obvious, and the \\&quot;Here, I think you need a napkin\\&quot; look is hard to pull off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw other reviews mention the \\&quot;sting\\&quot; effect. Your lips feel \\&quot;bee-stung\\&quot; (I love that expression), which the marketing people know is the look you are going for, so it must be working, right? Well, sort of. This product will plump up your lips, but it doesn&#x27;t last. Sorry, it really doesn&#x27;t.  Products costing up to 75 bucks use that same formula, and it fooled me for a couple years too, until I found the product I use now (which again, I think will cause my review to be yanked if I mention it-and no, I don&#x27;t sell it!). Lip Venom will also thicken fairly quickly, and hey girls, we all love that thick gloopy feel, right? It&#x27;s so fun to try to get on the applicator after half is used up!  Even if you&#x27;re just wearing it for yourself! (by the way, I didn&#x27;t start trying to plump up my lips to get a date, or get men&#x27;s attention, or even for my man-I just love the look and it gives my self-confidence a boost). It&#x27;s so great when it gets all over your drinking glass and gets things( like your own hair, if your hair is longer than chin-length) stuck in it! You enjoy constantly worrying it will smear! Oh, and your partner will just love the globby look too! So kiss-able! (not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the low price, you could try this out for fun, to experiment with, or again, if you like the clear gloss look. Any claims that this product&#x27;s effects last all night are just plain wrong.  And if you are on a low budget, please just save your money, as you could get the same effect with a little clove-oil and petroleum jelly, and save it for something that not only works but lasts.  I know having \\&quot;venom\\&quot; in the name makes it sound kinda cool and glamourous, hey, I dug it and fell for it too. But when you think about it, if it was any other part of your body, would you use a product for that with \\&quot;venom\\&quot; in the name? (\\&quot;Brow Venom!\\&quot; \\&quot;Cleavage Venom!\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry if it sounds like I&#x27;m taking all the fun out of it, I love to get playful with make-up too. But really, chances are you&#x27;ll just be mad at yourself for wasting your money on it, and finding out that unfortunately,  Jessica Simpson can get away with it, you can&#x27;t.  I know it is tempting, look at me!  Like a fool I went and bought it even after not one but two professionals tried to talk me out of it warned me it was a waste. Hopefully it wasn&#x27;t a total waste if I can save someone money by telling you my experience!ly, and hey girls, we all love that thick gloopy feel, right?

            <li> its all hype...all this does is cause your lips to sting...it doesnt plump up your lips at all...its a good gloss, but you can get gloss at the drugstore for 1/3 of the price</li>
            <li> Ill start off by saying, You will not get huge collagen injected looking lips by using lip venom. And I didnt expect those kind of results so I wasn&#x27;t dissapointed. But what I did expect from this product I definately got!! within 5 minutes of applying this product my lips felt warm and tingly but nothing unbearable, infact the tingling was kind of soothing to me along with the wonderful cinnamon smell. It gave my lips a rosie tint which looked great. Also The gloss gives your lips incredible shine without looking unnatural. And it truly does inhance the size of your lips subtly. If you know what to expect out of this product then you will not be dissapointed. &lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this product is Great. Everyone should try it!!! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> OK I&#x27;m just old enough to wants my lips to be fuller, but I&#x27;m not crazy enough to submit to any kind of plastic surgery or even injections. So I put on the lip venom and wait....my lips start to burn. LIKE THEY ARE ON FIRE! They hurt too badly to talk. Because of the consistency, it doesn&#x27;t wipe off easily. I had to wash it off with soap - washing off the rest of my make-up in the process. A few days later I felt brave and tried the stuff again thinking that my first go round was a fluke. Well, it wasn&#x27;t a fluke. They should use this stuff to torture people. I certainly would have told the truth!</li>
            <li> Recently I bought Lip Venom on a whim.  My lips are OKAY in size - my top lip being thinner than my bottom.  So I thought it could do with a little plumping up.  It&#x27;s not as irritating as people make it sound.  It does tingle, but it&#x27;s not painful or distracting.  I found that the Lip Venom does give my lips some nice color by bringing the blood to my lips - but I didn&#x27;t even see a little bit of noticeable difference in size.  I&#x27;ll still use it because it was so expensive for something so small - and I&#x27;ll hope that it gives me a little bit more upper lip - but all in all, I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> This lip gloss is really cool! It plumps up your lips, and when you first put it on, it makes your lips tingle for a linute or two! Even if it&#x27;s pricy, it&#x27;s a perfect present for your bud, or parents, if you&#x27;re reading this, your daughter. It&#x27;s an awesome product for every girl!</li>
            <li> Always eager for Angelina Jolie lips, I plunked down $15 for a tube of DuWop Lip Venom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Venom comes in a tiny vial about 1 inch long. There is no applicator. You apply it to your finger and then across your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the mini size the liquid \\&quot;venom\\&quot; within is potent! A little goes a long way to set your lips tingling. Very strong stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is it does not give you that pouty pucker. No big enhanced lips here. Not even a little bit more pout. Sadly nothing I have tried has given me thick full lips. So I will just have to do my \\&quot;kissin\\&quot; with my medium ones. Happily hubby has not complained!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend saving the $15 and picking up a $2.00 tube of tingling carmex instead.</li>
            <li> I fell for this product becomes of its \\&quot;cool\\&quot; name and false promises - I won&#x27;t buy it again.  For $15, you get a big, fancy package with a tiny tube of cinnamon gloss inside of it that doesn&#x27;t make any more difference in the size of your lips than any other quality gloss.  It does make your lips a shade darker than they usually are, but it doesn&#x27;t last; you have to keep reapplying.  NOT WORTH IT for the money.</li>
            <li> I wear this stuff mostly because of the amazing shine it gives, and because I *love* the way it makes my lips feel! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I kissed someone with this stuff on, and it left his lips burning. He said it was the HOTTEST thing ever. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This stuff goes really fast, and it&#x27;s kind of expensive... but it&#x27;s worth it! I looooooooooooooove the way it feels! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And yes folks, it DOES plump well!</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks. Truly, I LOVE it. I am completely addicted to the spicy taste and stinging feel after a few seconds of it being on your lips. However, I don&#x27;t get the Lindsey Lohan or Angelina looking lips, there is definitely a little plump. Little - or maybe I&#x27;m just making myself believe it&#x27;s working. Honestly, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working or not, but I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff. Once the stinging wears off, I put it right back on. Oh, and it&#x27;s really really shiny. Your lips end up feeling like you&#x27;ve just eaten a couple of hot wings...it doesn&#x27;t hurt, and it&#x27;s not scary, so don&#x27;t get all wimpy on me and go buy the lip venom lite. Do it right, do it the original way. You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> From my own experience, this did not make my lips bigger.  It did however, add some color.  I have extrememly colorless lips (paler than my face, so I look like the walking dead without lipstick) and I can go without lipstick if I wear this.  I usually prefer to wear color underneath it, though.  It seems to add some definition to the lip edges, although this may just be an illusion because of the reflection.  It&#x27;s not too goopy, which is nice.  I normally do not wear lip gloss because of the sticky factor.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As far as this burning your lips:  it totally depends on your skin type, I guess.  I waited months before finally buying this because I was afraid of the burn, and was petrified the first time I put it on.   Then...NOTHING happened.  I mean nothing.  I kept pressing my lips together to see if it would \\&quot;activate\\&quot;.  After several minutes, I did get a very, very slight heat, and that was it.  I accidentally put it on this morning over chapped lips, and it still  didn&#x27;t burn.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is nice as a light gloss, but don&#x27;t expect it to replace fillers that plump up your lips.  For that, fork out a few hundred bucks and get the real thing.</li>
            <li> Lip Venom does subtly plump the lips. It brings a mild, sexy color, and it doesn&#x27;t taste nor smell bad. It&#x27;s also less heavy than most glosses so you don&#x27;t feel like your putting some thick glop on your lips. I do like that fact that it&#x27;s not too sticky. The plumping effects, for me, were more mild. There was a little tingling but I did not find it painful. Some may. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is all very well but I do prefer Too-Faced Lip Injection over DuWop Lip Venom. I get better plumping results with Lip Injection but the only bummer with it is that Lip Injection tends to get gloppy at times. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I do recommend at least trying the lip venom because I have seen it work nicely on others with very little \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; factor on most.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Go to Sephora and sample it. Wait a little bit and then check out your lips in the mirror. You may be pleased.</li>
            <li> Depending on your sensitivity, you  may find this product really uncomfortable.  My roommate finds it downright painful, but I find the spicy sting to be somewhat pleasant. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to make my lips any fuller though, but I think it is the glossiest lip gloss I own, and I own a good amount of lip gloss.  All in all, a nice lip gloss, but not a must-have.  Doesn&#x27;t stay on your lips very long.</li>
            <li> With lip plumers being the seemingly new rage, I decided it was about time I tried some for myself...and after doing my research I picked this one. I was totally let down! It did nothing at all for me! No plumping...no color...the gloss was not glossy enough for my liking (I am a MAC addict) and I was prepared to feel and embrace the \\&quot;tingling\\&quot;, \\&quot;burning\\&quot;, and \\&quot;irritation\\&quot; that all the reviews go on and on about but I barely felt anything at all. I guess it must work for some people because I don&#x27;t see a motive for dozens of women to lie about their experience, however, it was a waste of my money. I am officially turned off to the idea of lip plumpers if this truly is one of the \\&quot;best\\&quot; ones out there.</li>
            <li> Lip Venom delivers color (blood rushing to my lips) with no plumping effect. Had I read the ingredients carefully I would have bought cinnamon oil and probably saved $15.    WAY overpriced. You get a TEENSY vial. Just not worth it.</li>
            <li> Out of curiosity, I just ran to the mall and picked up a tube of lip venom.  Firstly, it&#x27;s not as big as I expected it to be. The tube, excluding the cap, is a little bit more than an inch and a half. Which isn&#x27;t much to me..  Before I applied, I wiped my lips to make sure that they were clean and to be able to receive the full effect.  I keep reading about this \\&quot;burning sensation\\&quot; some users have been experiencing. And knowing that this could be a possible outcome, I applied anyway.  Needless to say, I only felt a slight, barely-there tingle. I waited five minutes, and still nothing really changed.  My lips definitely ARE plumper. But not as if I&#x27;d just seen a plastic surgeon. My lip lines are still visible, butt my lips DO look more \\&quot;pillowy\\&quot; than usual. Also, they&#x27;re only slightly darker, it DOES NOT look as though I&#x27;d just put on a layer of lipstick, as some users have been stating. Perhaps maybe a tinted gloss, if even that. Again, the outcome probably varies from person to person, depending on their sensitivity levels - because this product does contain an irritant.  So far, it&#x27;s been 10 minutes and my lips are full, though I have noticed a decrease in fullness from the time I first applied.    BOTTOM LINE, I would use this product again - but I most likely won&#x27;t buy another tube when this one runs out, unless it was given to me. ;)</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff! It actually does make my lips fuller and gives my naturally pale lips some color! I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend using a lot of it at once, because I did, and my lips &amp;quot;tingled&amp;quot; for a loooong while after that... heh. This is a kind of product I would be happy to go out and get again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Ok, so this lip gloss doesn&#x27;t really plump your lips, but do you really think it would give you Angelina Jolie lips?! I mean use your common sense! But this lip gloss is shiny, not gloppy, and sparkly (well at least the Lip Venom Flash). And if you don&#x27;t like the tinglie feeling, then sorry! Don&#x27;t blame DuWop for your wimpiness! I&#x27;m sorry to sound  rude, but please just chill!</li>
            <li> Perhaps it depends upon your degree of sensitivity, but it stung me!</li>
            <li> I thought this product was fantastic.. gave a subtle gloss look but lasted ages.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a nice gloss, with sweet &amp; hot flavor (cinnamon) and a touch of glitter (all be it very SLIGHT touch), then you may love this product.  However if you are looking for poutier lips, you may need to look elsewhere (possibly doctor 90210).  I have used a few other products, and am not convinced of the hype in gloss plumpers. This product did sting quite a bit the first few times I used it (I got used to it), so I was quite hopeful I would notice a difference. But alas I did not, nor did my boyfriend.  I am not completely disapponted in this product, due to the price, and the fact that it IS a nice brush-on gloss, but as a plumper I am still not convinced.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this really made my lips look fuller but it sure made them feel that way. It has a nice gloss to it and the tingle you get when you put it on is the best. If you have sensitive lips I would recommend putting something under it first. my niece would use some rose balm under it and then a little DuWop.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff !! Yes it is a bit irritating at first but not as irritating as injections. It makes my skinny lizzard lips look full.</li>
            <li> I kept reading all the hype about how this product was supposed to make your lips tingle, appear larger, and shine.  But, I was a little put off by the price tag.  However, I was eventually able to rationalize myself into buying the stuff.  I decided it would be a special little treat, just this once....yeah, right!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the first thing I noticed about the product was that it is tiny.  Very small.  The actual container of gloss is no bigger than my pinky finger.  (Although I do have rather large hands...)  With a $15 price tag, I sort of hoped for more than that!  But I opened the tube, which has a long brush sort of like a nail polish wand, and smeared on some Venom.  After a few minutes, a lovely tingly sensation began.  After about 5 minutes, my lips felt lovely.  I guess the best way to describe it would be to say it is a mild burning tingle.  I suppose some people might not like it, but I really found it invigorating.  I kept checking the mirror, hoping to see that my lips had expanded to Angelina-like plumpness.  No such luck.  Honestly, I doubt that they really swelled at all, but they felt good, and they had a nice sheen.  Also, the gloss, although appearing nearly colorless in the tube, seemed to bring a nice color into my lips.  I am not sure if that is due to the blood rushing to them or what!  At any rate, I decided at once that I really liked the product, despite the fact that it failed to make my lips look like pillows.  I love the shine, the color, and the tingle!  The only thing that prevented me from giving this item 5 stars is the price tag.  For $15, I would like the tube to be a tad bit bigger.</li>
            <li> The way this product works is the cinnamon oils and ginger contained in the ingredients are common irritants to the skin. This irritation is amplified when placed on one of the thinnest skinned, and most sensitive areas of your body -- your lips. The stinging sensation, which is considerable in this product, is your lip letting you know there is an irritant on your lips. Your body&#x27;s natural response to this irritant is to send extra blood to the area of irritation to try to protect it from harm. The extra blood flow in the lip area, due to the irritation, is what makes your lips appear &#x27;fuller.&#x27; Most lip plumpers on the market today work to &#x27;plump&#x27; your lips through this process of irritation.     Because DuWop Venom Flash has a relatively large amount of the cinnamon oil as an ingredient, it will make your lips look fuller in addition to causing above average irritation for this product category. Because of the irritation and subsequent blood flow increase, your lips will also look darker. There is a reason why everyone is talking about this stuff . . . it works the best because it irritates the most. Try it if you want something that will really work, just be forewarned.     DuWop Venom Flash is not for the lighthearted. DO NOT put this product on a dry or sensitive lip or the sensation will move from irritation to pure pain. God forbid you get this stuff in a cold sore, split lip, or any other open mouth wound or you will want to slice your lips off. You may not realize you have tiny, dry cracks in your lips until this stuff gets in there. Ouch! I find this especially irritating in the corners of the mouth.     If your new lip look generates some amorous advances and you find yourself kissed, you will transfer all this wonderful stuff, and all the irritating side effects, to your kissing partner. Whoops! Your gig is up! The illusion of sexy sensuality will all be shot as your kisser declares, \\&quot;What&#x27;s that!? My lips are burning! I think I&#x27;m allergic to you!\\&quot; Angelina Jolie you are not.     It Works but it Hurts. It&#x27;s up to you to decide if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It gets warm, but I really enjoy the sensation. I didn&#x27;t think that it made my lips fuller, but I already have full lips. I enjoyed the smell. It&#x27;s a little expensive for how small the tube is , but overall good product.</li>
            <li> not as sure about the plumping but this does make my lips pinker and appear to be a tad swollen. you&#x27;ll either love it or hate it. Make sure your lips are moisturized...I dont think it would feel good on chapped lips. Some people find the tingling/burning sensation enjoyable while others want to peel their lips off. If you&#x27;re about to kiss someone i&#x27;d warn them first or they might me pretty shocked lol. I think the colored squeeze tube glosses are a better deal. You get more product AND its colored. I don&#x27;t buy the tiny vials anymore. I get the same effects (and better i think) from the tinted glosses. Plus the tubes are huge, the gloss stays on your lips longer and the burn lasts longer.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t hate this product, I certainly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.  My lips didn&#x27;t plump even a tiny bit.  Maybe they turned a bit redder for a minute or so, but only because there is a tiny bit of cinnamon or maybe chili pepper in Lip Venom.  The tube is really, really tiny.  So much so that I laughed when I saw it, since it comes in a HUGE box.  It should be a sample size!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That said, it tastes pretty good.  I didn&#x27;t find it to be irritating or burning at all.  There is a little tingle.  I like the applicator brush, too.  But $15???  You&#x27;ve got to be kidding....</li>
            <li> Great shine and does make lips fuller!!! It is really adddicting. It tingles a little, but I almost enjoy it.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit nervous about ordering this product after reading some of the reviews, but finally I decided to try it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I got it in and was a little scared when I applied it because I was expecting a burning sensation, but that never occured. You do feel a slight tingling sensation, but it was not painful at all. Within 5 minutes I could tell a complete difference in my lips, they were fuller, very smooth, and gave my lips a nice color. I would def. recommend this product. I am hooked!!</li>
            <li> This product will not give you dramatic results like Angelina Jolie lips but it does improve the color of your lips and smoothes out the cracks and creases. I did not have to use a lot of it to get the full effect and the sensation is not completely unbearable unless you find the sensation of putting lip balm on chapped lips incredibly painful.</li>
            <li> I was prepared for the strong stinging/ tingling sensation that the other reviewers had told me about. I naturally have fair/ sensitive skin and products such as nair and tanning lotions have irriated my skin but Duwops Lip Venom does not! It is a very nice product. My lips werent as plump as what i expected them to be. However i did notice a difference. The gloss has a sweet cinnamon taste and isn&#x27;t sticky. My lips turned a little pinker and poutier. I am happy with this product. The only thing i could ask for is for it to make my lips a little plumper. I think they need a lip venom Max.</li>
            <li> I really tried to like this lip gloss. I bought it a year ago and I was horrified when I bought it. It was irritating and it hurt a little but I was willing to suffer some if it did some plumping. It did NO plumping!!!! AT ALL!!!! I thought, ok, maybe my lips will get a little rosy. Wrong again. It does smell good and the texture is good but I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this again. I got the Too Faced Lip Injection and its a little less tingly and makes my lips look full (i guess because it&#x27;s pretty thick) but after a while it dried in a crusty-type way. I give up :(</li>
            <li> Super shiny lips.  Love that.  It tingles a little (not painful or anything).  But I didn&#x27;t see my lips any plumper.  They felt bigger because of the tingling.  But it&#x27;s not noticeable change.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. I put it on an was bracing myself for the extreme burning people had described but i sat there for twenty minutes waiting with my eyes clothes. All i had felt was a small tingling [[ which i could barely feel, which made me skeptical that it was actually working]], but when i opened my eyes i dicovered that my lips were actually significantly plumper, I thought the shine it gave was nice too, but I didn&#x27;t expect my lips to get that much bigger, and they did. If you are skeptacle aout this stuff....buy it. It works.</li>
            <li> This lip gloss is one of my favs, it does make your lips tingle and makes them turn red. However, after awhile your lips might get used to the 1 coat so u might have to use it then re apply in about 30min to get the wanted plumpness. This lip gloss is AMAZING, but if all your looking is for the redness, then try goin with bonibell strawberry that is my second fav lip gloss.</li>
            <li> My addiction to Lip Venom started several months ago, when I tried it on at Sephora. At first, I found it to be painful, but then something odd happened. I purchased it, and reapplied it. Oooh, it burned! But I couldn&#x27;t stop. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I took it to my workplace and had every woman try it out. They too became addicted. The people at DuWop were onto something, because every time I go to Sephora, Lip Venom is sold out. Maybe it&#x27;s the way it plumps up your lips and makes them red, but I get the feeling it has more to do with the endorphin rush one gets when their lips are on fire. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am forever a Lip Venom girl.</li>
            <li> I was first made aware of Lip Venom by an online friend and became instantly intrigued. I waited patiently for my birthday and Christmas to arrive and was gifted with not one - but 5 different Lip Venom products. I am now an addict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews here, I was curious as to just how much it would sting...but being a lover of szechuan cuisine and all things spicy, I knew it wouldn&#x27;t be too much of a problem. If you&#x27;ve ever eaten good hot and sour soup, or one of those dried hot red peppers in szechuan cooking, that is the level of &#x27;spice&#x27; I attribute to Lip Venom. It is cinnamon-y though, so it&#x27;s a yummy heat - like you are lining your lips with a fireball candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the &#x27;lip plumping effects&#x27; they are real. I already have full lips, but using this makes me feel like Angelina Jolie&#x27;s long lost sister. I found myself enjoying the slight stinging feeling and when it wore off, I wanted to re-apply and experience it again! I&#x27;m just grateful I have 4 bottles and a tube of gloss to go through before I&#x27;ll have to run out for my next fix!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the regular venom, which can be worn over your favorite color for a wonderful shine, the flash, with silver or gold shimmer in it, and the gel gloss as well. If you are not bothered by a little spice or heat on your lips, you too, can become a Lip Venom addict - and look fab too!</li>
            <li> you know why your lips look so big after using DuWOP lip venom? because they are irrited by the ingredients in this product. You may like the look of your lips now but over a period of time this will wreak havoc on your lips.</li>
            <li> IVE TRIED EVERY THING AND LIP VENOM IS BY FAR THE BEST ... GREAT PLUMPING EFFECT .. PLEASANT TASTE .. AND NOT TOO THICK AND GOOPY !!! LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> this product is ok, it gives you a tiny bit of size for about 15 minutes or so i do like it though but now i get it because i just use it as a gloss dont expect major results with it, it nothing like getting your lips injected with a filler thats for sure.</li>
            <li> This lip gloss truly does what it claims! After applying one coat of the gloss, my lips began to swell noticeably. The glossy shine also adds to the plumping ability. The only down side to this product is the fact that if you put on too much, your lips start to sting extremely badly! Be careful, if you slather on an excessive amount, it becomes almost too painful to speak. Otherwise, it&#x27;s very nice!</li>
            <li> Like most people, I bought this product to have fuller plumper lips. Was I disappointed! I put this product on my bare lips, and did it ever sting! It did cause my lips to swell a little, but it was very uncomfortable. Plus, the swelling did not last more that 10 minutes. Am I supposed to keep putting Lip Venom on every 5 minutes? I can maybe put up with the stinging, IF the swelling lasted for a while, but...... &lt;br /&gt;I would really recommend a different product and to save your money. Try rubbing cinnamon oil on your lips- then you&#x27;ll understand the stinging that I&#x27;m talking about!</li>
            <li> The picture is very misleading.  The package is fairly large but the actual product container is VERY TINY.  When I first got this, I put it on over lipstick and it didn&#x27;t do anything but add a lot of shine.  I took my lipstick off and tried it again.  This time it took a little while to feel anything.  The \\&quot;burn\\&quot; was more like a heavy tingle.  The cinnamon taste was great.  I felt like I was chewing very strong cinnamon gum.  I can&#x27;t tell that my lips puffed up any, but they are a nice pink color.</li>
            <li> While I really like the color Lip Venom brings to my lips, I can&#x27;t ignore the fact that they a) don&#x27;t look any poutier, and b) sting continuously. Wearing an uncomfortable cosmetic that doesn&#x27;t exactly deliver any spectacular results isn&#x27;t really my idea of fun. Plus, as many people have said, the tube is tiny and really not worth the price. Frankly, if you want to have imperceptibly larger lips, I&#x27;d recommend the Sally Hansen lip plumping stuff, which does not sting, comes in a medium-sized tube, and costs about six dollars. It will save you money and possibly a little pain - especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with having sensual lips... I love this lip gloss, it&#x27;s excellent as a gloss and does give your lips some natural color and shape. It doesn&#x27;t sting badly. It&#x27;s not too noticeable, you won&#x27;t go from being lipless to ANGELINA JOLIE. As a combo with the lip venom, I usually use a little super spicy hot sauce on my lips, careful not to get it on my tongue. It burns TERRIBLY, but it will definitely plump your lips up. Like everyone is saying, the key to the hot lips is irritation.</li>
            <li> this stuff started burning about 3 minutes after I put it on but if there is one thing it DOES do, it&#x27;s give your lips a bit of a reddish tint. If there is one thing it DOESN&#x27;T do, it&#x27;s make them look plumper by any means. So for people who want to buy this simply to get fuller looking lips, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This product works great.  When you first put it on it gives you a beautiful high glass shine.  About a minute or so after it&#x27;ll give you a burning sensation sort of like big red gum on your lips.  It \\&quot;swells\\&quot;/ \\&quot;pumps\\&quot; your lips so they look great.  Only little problem as with most lip glosses if its sunny and hot it&#x27;ll feel like its leaking all over your mouth.  Other than that GREAT.</li>
            <li> I believe this product works psychologically; because it leaves a tingly sensation, the user is more likely to feel/believe that her lips are plumper/poutier.    &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, I have used this product as well as Lancomes Juicy Tubes and find that Lancomes gloss does a better job at giving me poutier lips.  But, the Lip Venom lasts longer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you want pouty lips, Juicy Tubes does a better job and its less expensive.  But Lip Venom stays on longer.</li>
            <li> This lip gloss is very nice, except the size. Feels very cool when you put on your lips, and has a nice shine, but it was very small. Next time you buy lip gloss, try M.A.C. Lip glass because you get more for your money.</li>
            <li> OK, I know it was foolish to believe that a gloss can pump my lips up :-D  I waited for 5 min in front of my bathroom mirror to watch the transformation and NOTHING happened.  I didn&#x27;t even feel any irritation, never mind the plumping effect..  As a gloss it is Ok; there&#x27;s no flavour, no stickiness whatsoever.  Yet, there are hundrends of glosses out there for that kind of money.  I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend it for what it claims to be.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have thin lips and Lip Venom plumps ever so slightly and shines nicely. Don&#x27;t be disappointed by the tiny tube it comes in. You only have to use a very small amount, otherwise the shine is just too much. There is a slight burn, but I like the way it tingles, and if you don&#x27;t cake it on, it doesn&#x27;t burn as much. I&#x27;ve found that just the smallest bit is perfect, and as long as I don&#x27;t kiss my boyfriend immediately after I put it on, he doesn&#x27;t complain. My only complaint is how sticky it can be when I first apply it, and how I feel like I have to sit with my lips sticking out for a while after I put it on (kind of like when you paint your nails and they completely dry but you&#x27;re still the slightest bit worried that if you start using your hands again the polish will mess up. I hope that happens to other people and not just me haha) As someone mentioned, it definitely doesn&#x27;t give you \\&quot;Angelina Jolie lips\\&quot;, but that&#x27;s a plus for me...I don&#x27;t want my lips to be THAT big.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Have purchased several times.  Only slight plumping, but gives the lips a glossy shine and a subtle, natural flush.</li>
            <li> I bought this after hearing how good it works on stimulating blood flow and adding color and plump to your lips. I bought it and the first time I put it on it stung. I was a little surprised at just how tingly this gloss really was. I noticed quite an enhancement in natural color on my lips and as it sat for a few minutes my lips became a bit more pouty (I have fairly pouty lips in the first place).&lt;br /&gt;The venom is high shine, it is not sticky at all, which is a huge plus for me. It really does work, if you are looking for Angelina Jolie lips, I doubt this will work for you, but if you want a little more shape and a nifty tingly sensation.. this IS the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;One other bonus, you can mix it with your favorite gloss to create a tingly gloss in your favorite color.. or you can wear it on its own. It is absolutely fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;I have let most of my friends try it and they are believers in this too.</li>
            <li> This producet delivers on what it promises--rosier, fuller, shinier lips with a \\&quot;tingle.\\&quot; My objection was to the tingle. I found it unpleasant and frankly a little scary. I am a fan of spicy foods, hot sauce, fresh ginger, Altoids, and the like, so I would not call myself a spice wimp. But this gloss was frightening and unpleasant. The discomfort reminded me of the term \\&quot;slave to beauty,\\&quot; and I broke free when I tossed the Venom in the trash. Another thing: the tube is shockingly small! It&#x27;s way too expensive and it hurts. Not recommended unless you are really, really tough.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying i love this stuff. It may be a rip off but it is so worth it. personally i love lips and i think they are one of the most important parts of your body.  Using this wonderful gloss will help not only your view of your lips everyone around you wonders where you get thisese full lips. and whether they are looking out of mockery or just jealosy at leat you can say you are getting attention. I think plumpers like these should be sold everywhere they are a great confidence booster for people that have thin lips. PLEASE GIVE IT A TRY! it will make your lips tingle with pleasure.</li>
            <li> This really dosent burn your lips like you read from the other reviews. It does feel a little spicy, but I find it refreshing. I put it on my lips when I&#x27;m feeling tired in the middle of the day and it wakes me up, gives my lips a little shine and I&#x27;m ready to go again. The bottle is very small, I didn&#x27;t see any difference in the size of my lips, but I like the way it makes my lips feel.</li>
            <li> I love the stuff. Aside from giving you a non-sticky shine, it enhances your natural lip color (perfect since I don&#x27;t like lipstick) and it feels like the tingling actually helps to penetrate the skin to moisturize my dry lips!</li>
            <li> Once you try this, you have to have it in your purse!  Same price as Sephora without the drive.  Stocking stuffer for 3 years plus for myself and my daughters. Buy it!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t need this product - I have huge lips as it is. But I tried it at Urban Outfitters, and became so addicted to the warm, pleasant tingling, I had to have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not certain that it really works on me, but I know that my boyfriend can tell when I&#x27;ve put it on - so I guess it does work. The shine is nice, and I like the fact that it can be easily mixed with your favorite lipstick shade.</li>
            <li> This product delivered none of the advertised benefits for me. I would never buy another DuWop product nor recommend one to anyone. Save your dollars; the chances of your getting \\&quot;bee stung\\&quot; lips are smaller than the size of this overpriced \\&quot;venom.\\&quot;</li>
