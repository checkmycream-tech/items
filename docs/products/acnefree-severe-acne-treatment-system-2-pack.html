    <ol>
            <li>We are now both impressed with his complexion</li>
            <li>and I am thankful for this wonderful product!!</li>
            <li>If done so, works great.</li>
            <li>Great Product</li>
            <li>I am so thankful for the amazing results!</li>
            <li>just make sure I wash my face every morning and night!</li>
            <li>I love the four steps!</li>
            <li>it is not so effective.</li>
            <li>Love the product and the price.</li>
            <li>Works better than Proactive.</li>
            <li>I just love the way it treats my skin.  </li>
            <li>We bought this for our daughter when we were in Florida a couple of years ago and it worked better than anything she had been given in the UK to help with her acne.</li>
            <li>After convincing him that he needed to use this kit, day and night, we noticed a HUGE difference in his complexion.</li>
            <li>My daughter is also using it and for her teenage acne it works absolutely great.  </li>
            <li>It works great when your acne is severe but, when you have moderate acne</li>
            <li>I AM NOT SAYING IT IS FANTASTIC</li>
            <li>I have since combined  the Acne Free Treatments system with an electric micro-abrasion brush (which I also found on Amazon) to wash my face.</li>
            <li>All in all, not bad.  </li>
            <li>I quickly realized that there were still traces of make-up on my face.</li>
            <li>I had him add Noxzema Classic along with Clean &amp; Clear Deep Cleaning Astringent to his dally routine, this seems to be the perfect solution for him .</li>
            <li>One of my new favorite product.  </li>
            <li>I still have small areas of breakouts, but overall very impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li>His face turned clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is the first acne control kit that I have purchased that contained the corrective toner.</li>
            <li>In the morning he uses  Clean &amp; Clear before applying Acnefree once again..</li>
            <li>Yes, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone with acne issues.</li>
            <li>This is the first product has completely cleared my acne without over drying my face.</li>
            <li>IT IS A SOMEWHAT DECENT ACNE SYSTEM.</li>
            <li>Works great but a little harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and the 2 for one price was actually cheaper than buying on set.</li>
            <li>Improved my sons complexion greatly ,but almost clear skin wasn&#x27;t good enough, he was still frustrated with small breakouts.</li>
            <li>Has improved my adult acne, including resolving the cystic areas, so far.  </li>
            <li>It has not cleared completely and have been using for almost 2 weeks now.  </li>
            <li>This electric brush completely removes all of my make up.</li>
            <li>My acne is completely gone</li>
            <li>As with other products, this needs to be used as directed and CONSISTENTLY.</li>
            <li>I have had adult acne for several years.</li>

            <li> I have had adult acne for several years.</li>
            <li> At night, after treating his face with Acneefree &amp; letting it dry, he apply s  Noxzema for bedtime.</li>
            <li> It can really dry out skin so don&#x27;t use a lot.</li>
            <li> But, for the price, I guess that&#x27;s to be expected.  </li>
            <li> As mentioned by other reviewers, the product is close to expiration date and there are some issues with clumping of the creams, etc.  </li>
            <li> I now break out a lot less if not at all maybe a few pimples here or there</li>
            <li> Within just a few days his acne started clearing up.</li>
            <li> Not sure if thats a problem or not.</li>

            <li> Less expensive than other brands.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old son gets really bad acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> it just made my whiteheads appear worse it did not try to stop them.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> 2 for 1 deal!!! Will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Love the product and the price. I got it may 2015 and it expires july 2015. Not sure if thats a problem or not.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and the 2 for one price was actually cheaper than buying on set.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old son gets really bad acne breakouts. Within just a few days his acne started clearing up. I attached a before and after picture of him so you can see. Yes, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone with acne issues.</li>
            <li> I tried different products and they didn&#x27;t work for me. When I tried this product, I was relieved to have found something that finally work.</li>
            <li> As mentioned by other reviewers, the product is close to expiration date and there are some issues with clumping of the creams, etc.  But, for the price, I guess that&#x27;s to be expected.  All in all, not bad.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll re-purchase this, though.</li>
            <li> Improved my sons complexion greatly ,but almost clear skin wasn&#x27;t good enough, he was still frustrated with small breakouts.

We are now both impressed with his complexion</li>
            <li> Has improved my adult acne, including resolving the cystic areas, so far.  It has not cleared completely and have been using for almost 2 weeks now.  My daughter is also using it and for her teenage acne it works absolutely great.  This does work, but it isn&#x27;t a miracle solution to oily or acne prone skin.  I still have small areas of breakouts, but overall very impressed with this product.  Works better than Proactive.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my teenage son who was experiencing &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hormonal changes. After convincing him that he needed to use this kit, day and night, we noticed a HUGE difference in his complexion. His face turned clear and smooth. We did notice that when he got lazy and did not use consistently, his acne came back. As with other products, this needs to be used as directed and CONSISTENTLY. If done so, works great. Give it a try. Less expensive than other brands.</li>
            <li> It works great when your acne is severe but, when you have moderate acne it is not so effective. I have moderate acne and this product did not work for me it just made my whiteheads appear worse it did not try to stop them.</li>
            <li> Great Product I now break out a lot less if not at all maybe a few pimples here or there but they go away within a day or 2, just make sure I wash my face every morning and night! Then I am Aces !!</li>
            <li> One of my new favorite product.  I just love the way it treats my skin.  It can really dry out skin so don&#x27;t use a lot.</li>
            <li> IT IS A SOMEWHAT DECENT ACNE SYSTEM. I AM NOT SAYING IT IS FANTASTIC BUT AN ALRIGHT PRODUCT. WOULD I BUY  THIS AGAIN NO..</li>
            <li> Works great but a little harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our daughter when we were in Florida a couple of years ago and it worked better than anything she had been given in the UK to help with her acne. So we order it when we can.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just the inconsistency</li>
            <li> I am so thankful for the amazing results! I have had adult acne for several years. I have tried almost everything over-the-counter and have seen a dermatologist. This is the first product has completely cleared my acne without over drying my face. I love the four steps! This is the first acne control kit that I have purchased that contained the corrective toner. After washing my face, I would apply the corrective toner with a cotton ball. I quickly realized that there were still traces of make-up on my face. It had never occurred to me that this could have been one of the underlying causes of my acne problem. I have since combined  the Acne Free Treatments system with an electric micro-abrasion brush (which I also found on Amazon) to wash my face. This electric brush completely removes all of my make up. My acne is completely gone and I am thankful for this wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> Bought this product several times. It helps control my kids acne.</li>
