            <li>The package closes easily with the ziploc-type top.  </li>

            <li>with daily use, i go through epsom salts quickly - makes my bath time awesome!</li>
            <li>I use a lot of epsom salt, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to order a large amount.</li>
            <li>And the most economical!</li>
            <li>I originally bought Epsoak Epson Salt for my gardening needs, but the more I read about it</li>
            <li>Putting this in a bath and soaking in it for 20 minutes is an easy way to absorb some.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very mild, but soothing.  </li>
            <li>Epsoak epsom salt works great for epsom salt baths; I take baths with hot water (as hot as I can get it) and about two cups of the epsom salt.</li>
            <li>It came super fast (4 days) and the bag the salt comes in has a good re-sealable top for storage.</li>
            <li>The packaging held up through shipping and the design of the package allows for easy storage.</li>
            <li>This comes in a resealable plastic bag which makes the storage easy.</li>
            <li>My family goes through this stuff very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I use this to make my own scented bath soak and am glad to have found a reliable source at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>We all need to detox and this is one way to easily do just that.  </li>
            <li>I received 20 lbs of epsom salt that easily dissolves.  </li>
            <li>Refreshing, clean and sparkly</li>
            <li>Would happily buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>Good quality and a decent price at approx $1.50 per pound.</li>
            <li>super fast delivery and perfect size because we use to much of this.  </li>
            <li>I strongly suggest you be ware.</li>
            <li>Dissolves quickly in both cool and warm</li>
            <li>He is on the spectrum and I will say this seems to relax him quite nicely - I would say more so then just a regular warm bath.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Throw a cup of this into a nice hot bubble bath, add a glass of wine and you got yourself relaxation and relief that no medicine can come close to, and</li>
            <li>It comes in a giant ziploc-style bag and the grains are beautifully separate.</li>
            <li>These salts are beautiful and don&#x27;t clump like the regular Epsom salts you would buy at the store.</li>
            <li>Just when I am about to be productive, one of their bath salts tempts me and calls me to a nice hot soaking salt bath.  </li>
            <li>These are good things in that it was working and detoxing my body, but I&#x27;ll take more precautions next time like drinking more water/tea, before and after, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also thrown a handful or two into the soil with my tomato plants and man</li>
            <li>Wash it off in the morning in the shower and my skin is as good as new.</li>
            <li>I received this huge package of Epsoak Epsom salt very quickly.</li>
            <li>Sturdy packaging, no leaking, fine texture and quality salts.</li>
            <li>Huge bag with a strong zipper and moisture control.  </li>
            <li>These are fine &amp;#34;salt&amp;#34; crystals.</li>
            <li>packaging was fine, the shipping was on time.</li>
            <li>Love Epsom salt baths and buying in bulk has been super helpful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m also really enjoying the quantity, which allows me to super salt</li>
            <li>These salts seem to dissolve more quickly too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The most important thing for this great buy is that they truly work for sore muscles after a workout or long day.  </li>
            <li>While our family does prefer the San Francisco Salt Muscle Soak the Epsom Salt Soak is a great alternative for anyone who does not like fragrances (and especially not mints) - the Epsom Salt Soak is an easy recommendation</li>
            <li>The large size is nice, too.  </li>
            <li>Love the large bag so your not always going to the store to buy more.</li>
            <li>Love to be able to purchase a large bag for soaking.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a HUGE bag of epsom salts.</li>
            <li>Its a huge bag of epsom salt.</li>
            <li>but it is what it is...a huge bag of epsom salt</li>
            <li>Huge quantity for such a great price.</li>
            <li>Fabulous price</li>
            <li>Also great fertilizer for the conifer trees, mainly blue spruce, in the spring.</li>
            <li>The quality is fantastic and is always delivered on time.  </li>
            <li>They also sent a free gift of bath salts with my order.</li>
            <li>I was contacted by the San Francisco Salt Company and I have to commend them on their fabulous customer service.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price especially if you have Amazon Prime membership.  </li>
            <li>If you enjoy fragrance in your bath</li>
            <li>It is a great addition to essential oils and baking soda.</li>
            <li>So my review is really just focused on the value of this product, which is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I do have an amazon prime account, so it ships for free.</li>
            <li>the 20lb bag is a great deal, compared to what you&#x27;re paying in the local supermarket.</li>
            <li>Great for bath for big bearded men!</li>
            <li>Cheaper to buy Epsom salt this way then the cheap cartons at Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li>Mosquitos love me, this product is worth it.  </li>
            <li>What a deal and free shipping with Prime.  </li>
            <li>This bulk bag is especially nice that it has a vent so moisture will not get trapped inside.</li>
            <li>relaxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, $30 for 20lbs, even with free delivery seems a bit over priced.  </li>
            <li>my bath guilt free.</li>
            <li>great price...would definitely order it again.  </li>
            <li>It makes a great facial scrub when combined with honey.</li>
            <li>Package arrived on time and damage free.</li>
            <li>Great buy - I will definitely be purchasing this item again.</li>
            <li>The book is available on Amazon and one of the instructions is to ingest a water/epson salt solution.  </li>
            <li>only thing they couldn’t speak intelligently on was the price.  </li>
            <li>Using this salt for essential oil/epsom  salt baths blends and it is great.</li>
            <li>Great customer service as well, only bought this purchase one</li>
            <li>BTW, their dead sea salts are great too!</li>
            <li>Great product and will be my go to vendor for my salt scrub in future.</li>
            <li>It has stayed clump free ever since.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to scents this could be a good thing.</li>
            <li>For me, I like good old fashioned akin to medium-to-large grain sea-salt, odorless Epsom.</li>
            <li>the salt is wonderful for bathing and soaking to remove toxins from the body and this salt seems to be more pure and legit than the other ones you buy at the drug store or wal mart.</li>
            <li>Btw- right after a bath I feel more energized and refreshed immediately.  </li>
            <li>It is great to have as much epsom salt as I want ready to add to a hot tub and soak my sore muscles, I will be getting this again that is for sure.</li>
            <li>Plus, they look so clean and glitter in the light.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if it really helps with my soreness, but it&#x27;s a good price and it dissolves well under hot water.</li>
            <li>This dissolved quickly and easily worked into the water.  </li>
            <li>Nice product in bulk for a decent price.</li>
            <li>The quality is good and it&#x27;s easy to seal the package back up.</li>
            <li>The grains are fine and it dissolves quickly in water.  </li>
            <li>I am an avid epsom salt soaker, and I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love epsom salt baths after working out or in the middle of winter, and this is a great package of high quality salts!</li>
            <li>and I get exactly what I want quickly and easily (and speaking of savings I&#x27;m saving gas to drive to another store!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to see what else it can help with.</li>
            <li>and I feel great after a long soak.</li>
            <li>Having 20 lb bag arrive at my house beats carrying home small options from grocery store and these salts are great!</li>
            <li>Need to add more hot water?</li>
            <li>Remember how great your skin looked and felt after a long swim at the beach in salty waters?</li>
            <li>Useful salt for weed killing!</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>The San Francisco Salts are of a consistent size and appear more \\&quot;pure\\&quot; in color...</li>
            <li>* Original Review**&lt;br</li>
            <li>The epsom salt is fine and dissolves quickly in the tub...</li>
            <li>Neither is familiar with the grocery store or prices.  </li>
            <li>Love that, first of all.</li>
            <li>Interesting product that I added to my Hot Tub for relaxing muscles.</li>
            <li>You will be super clean and feel fantastic..</li>
            <li>If you will be using epsom salts on a regular basis, this is the most cost effective way to go.  </li>
            <li>With amazon prime, 2-day shipping is free so you really can&#x27;t find a better deal anywhere</li>
            <li>I place one of my Amazon purchased foot scrubbers in the bottom of the box and my feet are clean too.  </li>
            <li>Much more cost effective than what is sold in local stores.</li>
            <li>It dissolves quickly and leaves your skin feeling soothed and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for all the states that are suffering drought right now!!!</li>
            <li>Love the large bath.</li>
            <li>this large size is a much better value</li>
            <li>I appreciate being able to buy Epsom salt in the large 20-pound size.</li>
            <li>I have a large garden tub requiring more then 2 cups of salt per bath.  </li>
            <li>AND it comes in bulk RIGHT TO MY DOOR!</li>
            <li>Just what I expected - great for everything from weed killing to soaking.</li>
            <li>I first realized it was a wonderful alternative to drawing salve when I was having trouble dealing with an infected fire ant bite.  </li>
            <li>5 stars cause its the most affordable epsom on Amazon, but I will say the first bag I got had finer salt crystals that absorbed faster.  </li>
            <li>Good value, would definitely order again&lt;</li>
            <li>The muscles become very relaxed and I sleep much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Third -- the bag is awesome, thick, doesn&#x27;t tear, recluses with ease, and is liftable and movable&lt;br /&gt;Fourth --</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and simple, no artificial additives, and I&#x27;m sure those with fragrance sensitivities will appreciate that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and simple, no artificial additives, and I&#x27;m sure those with fragrance sensitivities will appreciate that.</li>
            <li>It really seems to make my feet feel better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use any and don&#x27;t feel any difference when I use it , but my husband seems to love it.</li>
            <li>arrived in good condition and am relaxing with my foot baths daily.</li>
            <li>It is a good product, the bag is solid and comes with a one way air valve to keep out moisture</li>
            <li>tub full of ~100 degrees Fahrenheit water&lt;</li>
            <li>Good price for a big, sturdy bag.</li>
            <li>Thanks SFSC :)</li>
            <li>The one think I REALLY liked was the fact that you can see the quality and size of the grain in the clear bag.  </li>
            <li>It is well packaged, clean and melts quickly in the bathtub.</li>
            <li>Used it a  couple times for them without really noticing a difference, maybe sleeping better?</li>
            <li>Also since the crystals are stored in a nice jar near my tub they look nicer.  </li>
            <li>Visited  the local doctor whom I thought checked me out fairly well...</li>
            <li>They are non-scented, which is good because they won&#x27;t overpower, especially if you are using soaps and bubble baths with the salts.</li>
            <li>Probably not a bad idea to get some oils if you are looking for an aroma.</li>
            <li>It is a good quality and size with great clarity and really helps the soreness in my muscles after a tense workout.</li>
            <li>price is right, arrived quickly, packaged securely.</li>
            <li>I take an epsom salt bath almost every other night and it feels great</li>
            <li>works great, salt if finer than other brands which helps it dissolve faster.</li>
            <li>2 cups in the tub full of hot water makes for a great soak after a long bike ride</li>
            <li>I use this in the bath; it dissolves in the water very fast, after a great workout or a long run to help with the muscles.  </li>
            <li>This is seriously the best value.</li>
            <li>Quick deleivery too.</li>
            <li>You now have a loyal customer</li>
            <li>/&gt;The salts &amp;#34;cake up&amp;#34; fairly quickly even when sealed.</li>
            <li>My only regret is i wish i had more and didn&#x27;t have to pay for more.</li>
            <li>This is the best value I have found so far, and I also use the brand&#x27;s pink Himalayan salt for cooking/ seasoning.</li>
            <li>Package was received quickly.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery and exceeded expectations.</li>
            <li>Product dissolves quickly in water and provides that</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and the bag was hefty.</li>
            <li>the epsom salts arrived quickly and as promised.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how quickly this got here.</li>
            <li>I love using the Epsom salts for pretty much everything!</li>
            <li>It dissolved quickly and works wonders.</li>
            <li>Affordable, shipped quickly, arrived intact.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and arrived intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dissolves quickly and provides me with immediate relief from soreness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>price &amp; product and speedy delivery are huge positives on their own, but truth be told, it&#x27;s the customer service that is going to keep me coming back!</li>
            <li>This product shipped quickly, was packaged well, and is just what I needed for soaking baths after surgery.</li>
            <li>Ships quickly and conveniently.</li>
            <li>salts work wonders and my baths are super relaxing.</li>
            <li>Personally, I have only used the Epsoak in a foot bath, but it has worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have fibromyalgia and soaking in a tub with Epsom salts helps tremendously.  </li>
            <li>They shipped it quickly, I had it within three days.</li>
            <li>Product as advertised, and shipped quickly</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m pregnant I take Epsom salt bath once a week after working 12hr shifts on my feet</li>
            <li>This way I don’t run out as quickly.  </li>
            <li>Got package quick.  </li>
            <li>and I love, love, love the new packaging style because it not only looks sleek</li>
            <li>I have reordered this product many times because it is much more economical to buy in bulk than to buy the smaller packages at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of getting used to--the first time I did it, my heart starting beating like crazy!--but an excellent way to get healthy and to reduce stress a bit (relaxing in a long, hot bath).</li>
            <li>I take baths on a regular basis and very pleased.  </li>
            <li>But, the finer crystals as really nice and dissolve much better than other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>just put in your bath and enjoy it, not expensive the shipment arrived on time</li>
            <li>Salts are good, it seems that you have to put lots of them to feel any kind of effect, compared to the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I find them cleansing, relaxing and good for sore muscles after a long day of hearty exercise.</li>
            <li>Large bag has zip lock for easy resealing between uses.</li>
            <li>The crystals are large but dissolve easily.</li>
            <li>After a hard days work I always look forward to a warm relaxing Epsom salt bath and feel so relaxed afterwards!!  </li>
            <li>Great product  for soaking sore muscles &amp; helping  dislodge foreign objects in your body!  </li>
            <li>could easily go through this much Epsom in a month--</li>
            <li>Easy way to get much need magnesium levels in my body.</li>
            <li>Just received my package, was super excited for a nice relaxing soak after a long day but that won&#x27;t be happening.</li>
            <li>thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>The hot epsom salt baths for me are a must!  </li>
            <li>I suggest making the switch from whichever brand you may be using now to these, and enjoy a nice long soak!</li>
            <li>I will be back to buy more once I&#x27;m done with my 20 lbs of epsom salts!</li>
            <li>This was a good economical purchase, but the big bag turned out to be kind of a pain in the long run.</li>
            <li>It is cheaper that way, but I really prefer these fine grains.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and fine grain--better quality than others that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this  fine product I no longer carry around a pebble in my knee &amp;  also change doctors because of it.  </li>
            <li>Great, except the little hole in the bag.</li>
            <li>The salt is more fine than the CVS quarts of epsoms I had been used to buying, so it goes further.</li>
            <li>The older I get, the more I appreciate this product in a really hot bath tub...</li>
            <li>A nice day of what I hoped would be dedicated to relaxing has now turned into a fine day of sweeping, vacuuming and meticulously finding every last granule as my freshly crawling baby has a tendency to ingest absolutely anything she can find.</li>
            <li>Fantastic quality, dissolves fast and will always be part of our household.</li>
            <li>This may sound crazy to some folks but if you look it up online you will see that Epsom salts make a great plant food/fertilizer (and an inexpensive but effective one).  </li>
            <li>now, what with my own kids and one going to preschool for the first time I&#x27;ve been looking into supporting and strengthening their immune systems naturally.</li>
            <li>It comes in a re-sealable bag so it stays fresh.</li>
            <li>I make my own bath salts with essential oils.</li>
            <li>Like the nice big bag.</li>
            <li>I love how soft my skin feels after taking Epsom salt baths.  </li>
            <li>- how people adore sea salt soaks because it helps our skin be soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>My hair has improved greatly since switching to washing it only with soft water.</li>
            <li>They have said that this is perfect for their tired feet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a bigger size and not be putting it on my shopping list every week.</li>
            <li>so I can mix my own essential oils depending on necessity.</li>
            <li>Buying the epsom salt in bulk is well worth it.</li>
            <li>Well, you can get the same thing just bathing in your own tub using these salts..</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag has an effective reseal so that clumping has been held off during several weeks of this routine.</li>
            <li>a nice translucent white.  </li>
            <li>Nice to buy Epsom salt in a &#x27;bulk&#x27; package rather than the smaller cartons at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as good as you expected.</li>
            <li>It also arrived a couple days after I ordered it via standard shipping, which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>But to me, the price is worth the effort though and</li>
            <li>Such a great value for those people who talk frequent baths or who make scented bath salts.</li>
            <li>the Epsoak and the Muscle Soak are fantastic and can turn a normal bath into a super relaxing experience....</li>
            <li>I was happy to see that the salt wasn&#x27;t stuck together in big clumps like many other brands.</li>
            <li>I had a really great PT who recommended epsom to me, not sure if it works, but he seemed very hot on it</li>
            <li>They dissolve pretty quickly in my bath.</li>
            <li>and I can fall asleep pretty quickly after I soaked for a bit.  </li>
            <li>The salts are clean and pure.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, flat bottom</li>
            <li>At the time I thought, &#x27;Yeah, right.</li>
            <li>, it sets right there</li>
            <li>My son gets a kick out of pouring the right amount in the tub every night.</li>
            <li>But it dissolves right away</li>
            <li>I was concerned about purchasing a 20 lb bag, but now that I have it I can see I picked the right one.  </li>
            <li>I love the 20lb packaging, which lasts a long time and it&#x27;s a huge convenience to have it arrive on my doorstep.  </li>
            <li>But I was happy enough with the product, and how quickly it was delivered that I&#x27;ve just made a second order.  </li>
            <li>This Epsom salt is just as good (if not better) than any other I&#x27;ve tried and for 20lbs, this is a great price.  </li>
            <li>On a positive note, it dissolved quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more likely to fall asleep quickly.</li>
            <li>I have arthritis, and have to soak nightly for the pains in order to get to sleep this epsom slats is great quality and large bag keeps me from having to have all those little boxes setting around.</li>
            <li>The large bag is economical and useful.  </li>
            <li>As a busy full time yoga teacher, a luxurious soak at the end of the day is key to waking up bright eyed and bushy tailed, ready to myself and my clients on the mat.</li>
            <li>I was looking for pure Epsom salts, and I&#x27;ve found it!  </li>
            <li>Epsom salt is such a great product to have especially if your A vigorous athlete.</li>
            <li>20 pounds may sound a lot, but I enjoy 20-minute soaks in the bath daily.</li>
            <li>Its hard to find some decent reviews for epson salts, but this is a very good brand.  </li>
            <li>Epsom salt is a killer detox and very gentle.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>but I go through it very fast.  </li>
            <li>Always a very fast and cost-effective delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rather large container, but the price is worth it.  </li>
            <li>and she said I had great feet, and she hardly had to scrape anything.  </li>
            <li>They look like little sparkly diamonds and make a beautiful presentation in a clear container.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually thinking about ordering some for holiday gifts because I&#x27;m enjoying it so very much.</li>
            <li>The grains were nice, a little more clear...</li>
            <li>Really helpful with Fybromyalgia pain, after a long day, soaking in hot water with these salts is very therapeutic!!!!!</li>
            <li>The salt itself is a more of a fine granule than the previous brand I used.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think much of it but upon unboxing and taking out the epsoak package--salt everywhere!</li>
            <li>Great product it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>Table spoons of skin safe essential oils</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m just not going to spend so much more than I have too for an American made product.  </li>
            <li>Hot bath with Epsom salt</li>
            <li>Glad that it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance like the brand at my local Walgreens does.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance is pretty toxic stuff (despite the innocuous sounding name).</li>
            <li>the salt kind of slumps and makes the opening wide.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I have this product and would definitely recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This epsom salt makes a very relaxing bath salt!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>

            <li>and when I woke the next morning I felt more rested</li>
            <li>I use 2 cups in my bath with 1/2 cup of baking soda and 10 drops of lavender oil as a stress relieving bath in my claw foot tub as hot as I can take it.</li>
            <li>Most people do not get enough magnesium in their diet.</li>
            <li>The ziploc part works the first time every time.</li>
            <li>Thanks Epsoak and SFSC!</li>
            <li>but, Its not my favorite brand for personal use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There was only one issue I had with the latest order I had with this company.</li>
            <li>So, a winning product and one I would have problem buying in the future.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more when I start to run low.</li>
            <li>If I am detoxing, I put Two cups of Epsom Salt and two cups of Baking soda in a hot bath and soak for 40 minutes.  </li>
            <li>He soaks with 1 cup every night for 20 minutes and comes out calm and ready for bed.</li>
            <li>My first time using Epsom salt.</li>
            <li>Love this product it is good for everyday soaking and actually softens your skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Super fast shipping, too!</li>
            <li>great size.. this will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>I love to use and make bath salts (not the illegal drug kind!).</li>
            <li>This is by far the cheapest Epsom salt I have been able to find, and I use it a few times a week for a nice relaxing detox bath.  </li>
            <li>These guys had it, and it was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I love this epsom salt and have almost finished one bag in only a couple months.  </li>
            <li>I love when I find a company that treats me like a human being instead of a transaction.</li>
            <li>I love Epsom salts in my bath and have tried multiple kinds.</li>
            <li>At first I was going to decline the opportunity to review these salt baths, but I mentioned them to my wife and she wanted to give them a try.</li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>So I threw in a couple handfuls into a hot bath and soaked away.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I never got to use it.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what the description describes.</li>
            <li>The salt grains are fine and dissolve quickly, which is a big improvement over the epsom salt I&#x27;ve been buying at the drug store.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can buy it in a big bag.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Epsom salt really works for tired achy muscles and swollen feet which is great for me because I spend a lot of time on my fit at works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These salts are more crystallized rather than big rock salt pieces.  </li>
            <li>So I decided to start taking epsom salt baths, and this helps with the pain so much!</li>
            <li>I read all the cautions on everything from adverse reactions to chlorine added to destruction of the pump, motor and heater in the Hot Tub (Spa).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t add the Chlorine granules at the same time as the Epson Salt to just be on the safe side.</li>
            <li>Will be back for more.</li>
            <li>Use for a hot soaking bath.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for to make my bath salts.</li>
            <li>I would in the future  order more.  </li>
            <li>can just add them right in with your detergent.&lt;br /&gt;It softens hard water, and makes your clothes smell amazing!</li>
            <li>Product arrived more quickly than I expected in a resealable bag.  </li>
            <li>It is high quality and really help to dilate the cells to clean the, out.</li>
            <li>Great for the price, and large amount that will last a long time.</li>
            <li>With this size, it&#x27;s extremely cost effective.</li>
            <li>I initially thought it was too big but find I am using it at a pretty good pace.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>It dissolves much more quickly than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>But after try this brand for several time, it Work as described, and I can enjoy a nice long soak, helping to relief my leg sprains and bruises!</li>
            <li>So while I had a good experience with this, next time I&#x27;ll just buy locally and save the money.  </li>
            <li>This Epson Salt from the San Francisco Salt Company seems much cleaner and more pure than the stuff I have bought at the local food or pharmacy stores.  </li>
            <li>It is the pricing that deserves the positive review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had nothing but positive experiences.</li>
            <li>and I do feel a positive difference when I am done.</li>
            <li>Thanks much!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not planning on using the whole bag have another container ready because this resealing bag is the biggest pain in the world to close, IF it closes at all!</li>
            <li>As an avid runner soaking 3 days a week really helps the achy muscles.  </li>
            <li>(I usually take baths once in a while) but packaging and everything is good.</li>
            <li>and it works just as good as the high priced little bags do that you get in the drug store.</li>
            <li>These salts are high quality and were delivered right when they said they would be.</li>
            <li>Super convienent to get such a large bag!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, and I don&#x27;t know how they do that, but they&#x27;re certainly pretty in the huge apothecary jar next to the tub where I keep them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I use it daily in my bath, it easily lasted me a month.&lt;br /&gt;Basically</li>
            <li>They are scent-free, coarse but dissolve easily and quickly, and leave my skin soft and exfoliated.</li>
            <li>the grains are small (it looks like granulated sugar) and easily absorbed into warm water.</li>
            <li>I put 2 cups in my large bath with some lavender oil before bed, and I sleep like a baby.</li>
            <li>I take a lot of epsom salts soaks during marathon training, so I thought a 20-lb bag would be a smart investment.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d certainly sign up for it.</li>
            <li>The crystals are somewhat large and it takes some swishing to get them to dissolve in the tub</li>
            <li>I bought this large bag for the garden.</li>
            <li>It is pure epsom salt.  </li>
            <li>I repeatedly order this large bag.</li>
            <li>so we sought to have a large quantity.</li>
            <li>The large quantity reduces both cost ahd shopping actions.  </li>
            <li>I prepared his bath, I was immediately struck by how large the grains were.  </li>
            <li>and I think buy it like this, in the large bag, is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found this salt purely by accident on Amazon.</li>
            <li>found the grain size to be more consistent in this SF Salt Co. epsom salt than in other epsom salt products that I&#x27;ve purchased at grocery and discount stores.  </li>
            <li>was gone, and by the next day he was fine.</li>

            <li>It really helps to relieve some of the muscle soreness.</li>
            <li>Thanks for help my day start or end nicer</li>
            <li>Really helps to reduce the aches and pains.</li>
            <li>A real cost saver if you use epsom salt a lot as I do.</li>
            <li>It seems to really make a difference.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product Sept. 19 with the only available shipping 3 - 5 days.</li>
            <li>I am unable to give it five stars because unless you have a chisel handy you may not be able to use this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>first thing I&#x27;ll note is that while the lavender comes in a pretty, fold-over-top plastic container, the Epsom Salt comes in essence in a clear baggie with a ziplock closure.</li>
            <li>It helps you live in a culture that is all about fast fast fast worry worry!  </li>
            <li>I also love being able to customize what essential oils I use when I want to with this plain salt.  </li>
            <li>The product came in a cheap bag, even after letting air out through a vacuum seal moisture still got in which made some of the salt clump together.</li>
            <li>Each day, I use a new cat litter box while sitting on the edge of my tub with a generous sprinkle and hot water and, ah, the pain goes away.</li>
            <li>It seems to dissolve much better than other salts I have tried.</li>
            <li>In that respect, it works better than other products that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I have used other epsom salt products not as satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Not sure how much shipping is without it, or how cost effective it would be.</li>
            <li>I mix it with shampoo every couple weeks to get a deep clean on the hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>I really find that it relaxes me after a long day and makes my skin feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>After sitting in the bath for at least 10 minutes your muscles are relieved from any aches or pains and the fact that you get such a huge bag for such a great price is a win-win.</li>
            <li>I add a small amount to my hair conditioner and it does amazing things for my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this economical pack of epsom salt - minus one star ONLY because it doesn&#x27;t seem resealable.</li>
            <li>When I drain the Hot Tub water each month I add the Chlorine to clear the water, wait an hour, and then add the two cups of Epson Salt.</li>
            <li>Is the same true for magnesium sulfate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This same company produces a dead sea salt as well which makes your skin feel really good (but doesn&#x27;t do much for relaxing my muscles as this epsom does).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure if Epsom salts work, to be honest.</li>
            <li>Before you buy, please read the full following articles:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 11 year old son was the first to claim the salts.  </li>
            <li>Better than other brands and cheaper, can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li>Great stuff big bag to hard to handle though</li>
            <li>I emerge from my bath more relaxed, less achey, and my skin feels softer.</li>
            <li>Costs less than most bath salts.</li>
            <li>This has a very relaxing smell to it, and is great for relaxing your tired muscles!  </li>
            <li>I transitioned from using lavender infused to this with lavender essential oils, tremendous savings.</li>
            <li>I am glad to know that this bag will last for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li>Of course it isn&#x27;t the only way to heal, but it helps tremendously.  </li>
            <li>It just makes bath time much more relaxing, especially when combined with a drop or two of essential oil.</li>
            <li>I am older and play raquetball and work out at the gym.  </li>
            <li>That left about another cup in the bag – just enough for one more</li>
            <li>The Epsoak did leave our skin feeling very soft - much softer than just using a moisturizing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great price for a simple (and heavy!) product!  </li>
            <li>The bag is more tightly compressed, too.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality, non toxic  alternative to the products sold in stores with &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; added.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it since my days playing High School football and it still works wonders for aches and pains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Epsoak from San Francisco Salt Company.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Just by looking at it one can tell that it&#x27;s a high quality product.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone seeking high quality epsom salt</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product to those seeking bulk epsom salt.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The seller was very responsive &amp; it also came with a free sample of other salts they make.</li>
            <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve used it repeatedly on other insect bites, imbedded rose thorns, slivers, cactus needles and such.  </li>
            <li>it lasts me a month, and this way -- I mean buying it this way from these people, and they seem very nice, btw, I am not constantly running out.  </li>
            <li>But in the larger question of whether buying ANY epsom salts are worth it - I highly suggest you do some research.</li>
            <li>But in the larger question of whether buying ANY epsom salts are worth it - I highly suggest you do some research.</li>
            <li>It really helps with aches and pains, and it also helps keep my skin clear of eczema, with which I have struggled since childhood.  </li>
            <li>really helps to relax and clear you</li>
            <li>I was using topical steriods to calm my itchy skin and after awhile it stopped working.</li>
            <li>It was nice to not have to constantly purchase smaller bags, but this big bag was a pain to store.</li>
            <li>you normally would.</li>
            <li>I tried this last night for the first time, because my muscles REALLY ached.</li>
            <li>but we like the Dead Sea bath salt way better.</li>
            <li>Love to soak my feet in it with a few drops of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>I feel tired much more quickly</li>
            <li>Bag is resealable and watertight so it can be kept right next to the tub.</li>
            <li>The product at first seemed a bit sketchy to me because of the low price for 20 lbs of Epsom salt, I&#x27;m used to paying a lot more for a little.</li>
            <li>The product at first seemed a bit sketchy because of the low price for 20 lbs of Epsom salt, I&#x27;m used to paying a lot more for a little.</li>
            <li>This very large bag of salt now stays next to the bathtub.</li>
            <li>I have a very tiny bathroom, but it fits just fine next to the tub.</li>
            <li>If it works so very well on poisons and impurities large enough to see, just think how it must be tackling all those impurities and toxins in your skin that are invisible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will be getting htis product again once this HUGE bag gets empty!</li>
            <li>I also added a few drops of sweet orange essential oil to enjoy a fragrant and relaxing soak.  </li>
            <li>when I was bathing 3 times a day in recovery this gave me the smoothest skin you could imagine, so ladies, bathe twice a day in this stuff and you&#x27;ll not have to use any other creams or lotions to get that smooth skin.</li>
            <li>, I noticed in other customer reviews that some people got a free sample with their purchase.  </li>
            <li>The amount (20lbs,) the packing, and the price made far more sense than those little boxes you can sometimes pick up at the supermarket.  </li>
            <li>you want a new way of using epsom salt, here it is.</li>
            <li>THEY LIVE ANOTHER YEAR.,</li>
            <li>I enjoy experimenting with various essential oils to add to my Epson Salt bath treatments</li>
            <li>The seller even included a little bamboo scoop for the salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived intact, quickly, and exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I found myself very sensitive to this product.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and using this works like a charm.</li>
            <li>The shipment of these salts was fast and efficient- as a very \\&quot;green\\&quot; person, I appreciated there was minimal packing materials  used with the delivery of this product.</li>
            <li>I take hot baths almost daily.</li>
            <li>, it now has a Double sealing/closing strip that is much improved!  </li>
            <li>In fact there&#x27;s apparently a study on this very topic - look on the NIH website for PMID 19216298 - and they found the magnesium sulfate did NOT get through the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact there&#x27;s apparently a study on this very topic - look on the NIH website for PMID 19216298 - and they found the magnesium sulfate did NOT get through the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it for daily aches and pains and I really believe it helps!</li>
            <li>You can find so many reasons to order Epsom salt, it&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
            <li>what this product in general does, i really dont have a clue.</li>
            <li>I love how big this is, it last such along time.</li>
            <li>It made my feet feel so soft!  </li>
            <li>I was going through way too many small containers.</li>
            <li>And they didn&#x27;t make my dry skin even more dry.</li>
            <li>one day in the ocean fixes me right up for a long time, and then I thought, &amp;#34;hey, Epsom salt&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>This is a huge bag, so it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I usually buy it at Costco, but I need to take frequent detox baths and thought this would be a better deal.  </li>
            <li>My products were shipped extremely quickly, and delivered faster than I expected.</li>
            <li>Being able to buy this large bag saves me money and the effort of going to the store constantly to buy small bags.  </li>
            <li>SF&#x27;s epsom salt has mostly nice clear grains, while other brands have a lot of opaque white grains mixed in.  </li>
            <li>Although the smaller packages of bath salts is a bit more expensive, the bulk packages are actually fairly comparablein price per pound to other store bought</li>
            <li>The salt itself is good, but trouble getting it out of the bag made me mark it down to 2 stars.  </li>
            <li>I get lower back pain, and using this in a hot bath before bed really helps.. it definitely relaxes your muscles.  </li>
            <li>At first I wondered if I needed a bag this big, but it really isn&#x27;t all that big, and I like that</li>
            <li>was full of chemicals, fragrance and other stuff</li>
            <li>which were full of chaff and other things that make cleaning the tub a problem.</li>
            <li>Will certainly re-order again in future.</li>
            <li>Returning such a large bag is pain in the neck anyways, so we didn&#x27;t even consider that option.</li>
            <li>to handle for such a large size.</li>
            <li>I just keep a large apothecary jar of it next to my soaking tub.</li>
            <li>The biggest challenge with this product is finding a large enough space in the bathroom for the bag.</li>
            <li>Buying in such a large quantity saves a lot of money.</li>
            <li>only complaint is that i wished the bag closed more easily.</li>
            <li>But same bath in the end, just a little more mixing together.</li>
            <li>All the bath salts I&#x27;ve tried by The San Francisco Salt Co. seem to be a cut above the rest, very high end.</li>
            <li>We would love to suggest using a hemp bag for packaging as plastic is toxic and we have cut enough trees down on this planet!</li>
            <li>The salt comes in a clear, resealable bag.</li>
            <li>Also is such a great price; you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Salt works\\&quot; and others clearly state what is and is not in every salt product they sell (as well as country of origin)  </li>
            <li>someone told me to soak in this, it would help clear up my acne.</li>
            <li>Because I like the look of the SF clear grains, it makes for a nicer experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Old fashioned.&#x27;</li>
            <li>Really wish they had options for different fragrances though as I also find that a therapeutic experience.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than my local pharmacy.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using it for about a week, but I really like it.</li>
            <li>Was surprised when I received a 20 pound brick chunk of Epsom salt</li>
            <li>ready to use for my bath, next to the tub.  </li>
            <li>I began running my bath water and cut open the bag and had my cup ready to measure out two cups</li>
            <li>The soarness in my body had released almost completely.</li>
            <li>I wish the bag had handles but as far as the product is concerned I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Or an old lady&#x27;s underwear</li>
            <li>I have been consistently ordering 40lbs this product from this seller for a long time.</li>
            <li>Added plus- my doctor just commented on how soft my skin is.</li>
            <li>Though Epsom salt is dirt-cheap, no research supports any direct effect on injury recovery, and none of the theories forwarded about how Epsom salt might help in indirect ways</li>
            <li>My wife and I use this in our Japanese Soaking Tub and it really does make a difference.  </li>
            <li>Epsom salt in my bath keeps my feet soft.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so soft.</li>
            <li>Old folks experience increasing feet problems for which Epsom Salts soaking is recommended by my Podiatrist.  </li>
            <li>I just keep it near the tub and no moisture seems to be getting in.  </li>
            <li>So far I have found a 2 bag case at a wholesale store</li>
            <li>But anyhow my son, 2years old, had a fever of 102</li>
            <li>I was surprised by just how big the bag was, and definitely had to move things around in my bathroom to make space for it, but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li>The Epsom Salts dissolved instantly and made my bath very relaxing after a stressful day at work.</li>
            <li>Just a few drops of your favorite essential oil</li>
            <li>Nothing like a hot bath w/ these salts after a long day of working!</li>
            <li>I am so excited to have a stash big enough to last me a while.</li>
            <li>The plastic bag is also not very fragrant when it comes (unless shipped in a box with something fragrant), so it can be stored in my bathroom right</li>
            <li>(we have an unusually hot and dry summer--</li>
            <li>crystal size is small and it dissolves very quickly.</li>
            <li>It was clumped solid when I received it, but I simply dropped the bag on the concrete which broke up a lot of it, then I put it in a large glass apothecary jar and used an ice pick to break up the rest.  </li>
            <li>i frequently buy this product, it works as expected and it&#x27;s a high quality salt at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Folk remedies are often generally neglected by researchers, but not usually so completely.\\&quot; -- Paul Ingraham</li>
            <li>definitely worth every penny spent!</li>
            <li>Not sure how to compare one brand of Epsom Salts to another, but this seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using different brands of epsom salts for years (mainly for a full-body, muscle-ache soak).</li>
            <li>Just be aware that the bag really is 20 lbs (its heavy).</li>
            <li>I just recently got to thinking if I use the Epsom salts under the hostas not only will they be fed but the higher salt in the dirt might discourage slug traffic.  </li>
            <li>This large bag has lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this several times now and the quality has always been high.</li>
            <li>I took two baths with these (at a high concentration of salts), but found that my aches and pains weren&#x27;t relieved as they were with some generic Epsom salt I had picked up from the store.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality product and I use it daily.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the book as well especially if you have gallbladder issues and even if you don&#x27;t .</li>
            <li>Was so tired of spending $5-8 at the store for much smaller bags that lasted only a few baths… this one was perfect at almost 20 pounds!  </li>
            <li>The no-name store brands have a lot of tiny grains, even some dust, mixed in with the large grains.</li>
            <li>I got a large piece loose that looked to be about the size of a cup and chucked it into my bath.  </li>
            <li>The company saw my initial review and sent me a new bag.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a habitual epsom salt bath taker, because it really helps my low back pain and insomnia.  </li>
            <li>Add a couple drops of your fav essential oil to bath water for some really sweet down time.</li>
            <li>Epsom salts from the store did not bring me any major reactions like this product did.</li>
            <li>Epsom Salt is also fantastic for soaking your body when you have sore muscles from a hard workout.</li>
            <li>At least I know now that I will have to plan ahead and break a chunk off of the boulder before the bath has filled with water.  </li>
            <li>HUGE resealable bag that is thick plastic.</li>
            <li>As a bonus they sent me a sample of French grey gourmet food salt - I really like it too.</li>
            <li>Even helps clear up bug bits and itchy skin in the same fashion.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
            <li>In searching for epsom salt, I found product after product with fragrance - which is a big problem for me, since I&#x27;m sensitive to it.  </li>
            <li>The value per pound of this bag far surpasses any tiny drugstore box I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Apparently Epsoak Epsom Salt has been around for quite a while.</li>
            <li>No heavy lifting beyond the initial delivery.</li>
            <li>It has also been shown to help replace magnesium which most of us are deficient in.  </li>
            <li>After two broken ribs, I decided I needed to pay more attention to my bones.  </li>
            <li>Love these for bathing my magnesium deficient son.</li>
            <li>Practically pruning every day!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to point out that instead of a harsh bleach bath that Drs recommend for eczema, Epsom salts with baking soda and coconut oil is worth considering.</li>
            <li>The first night I soaked for half an hour just before bed</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a lot of petri dishes disguised as little cute little kiddos running around.</li>
            <li>There was a small hole in the bag so some of it had come out of the bag during shipping but other than that it was fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen other brands at grocery stores that were much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t thinking it would be that much, but I take baths at least once a week</li>
            <li>Why bother, buy this big old sack and have a ton around for a very low price.</li>
            <li>Relaxing after a hard workout or just a long day- dissolves easily</li>
            <li>My partner and I both takes epsom salt and baking soda baths regularly (both for general relaxation and for recovery from training) and this bag has lasted me almost 6 months.</li>
            <li>have an old back injury that flares up from time to time and gets sore for no apparent reason.  </li>
            <li>I think that the price is VERY comparable to other manufacturers that sell similar quality.  </li>
            <li>Two cups of this salt + one cup of baking soda + a few drops of lavender oil + one bathtub of hot water, soak for 40 minutes &#x3D;</li>
            <li>/&gt;First things first, THIS IS HEAVY because you&#x27;re getting A LOT of epsom salt.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t pushing and prolapsing anyome, on the down side, if I do exurt myself too much</li>
            <li>Well, it is hard to say if this is super Epsom salt.</li>
            <li>It helps clear up minor skin irritations almost instantly...</li>
            <li>(pretty much everyone is deficient in mg nowadays).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d bought some Dead Sea salts via Amazon in the past and they were okay but definitely overpriced.</li>
            <li>Large bag is heavy duty without any breakage problems.</li>
            <li>Combine with mineral salts and essential oils to create very cheap custom versions of normally expensive bath salts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good quality but a little expensive for epsom salt.</li>
            <li>Whenever I get a delivery of it via Amazon Prime Fresh, I have a hard time lugging it from the door to my bathroom.</li>

            <li> The package closes easily with the ziploc-type top.  </li>
            <li> Also I love that it has a zipper closure, makes it easy to store if I run out of containers.</li>

            <li> with daily use, i go through epsom salts quickly - makes my bath time awesome!</li>
            <li> I use a lot of epsom salt, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to order a large amount.</li>
            <li> And the most economical!</li>
            <li> I originally bought Epsoak Epson Salt for my gardening needs, but the more I read about it</li>
            <li> Putting this in a bath and soaking in it for 20 minutes is an easy way to absorb some.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very mild, but soothing.  </li>
            <li> Epsoak epsom salt works great for epsom salt baths; I take baths with hot water (as hot as I can get it) and about two cups of the epsom salt.</li>
            <li> It came super fast (4 days) and the bag the salt comes in has a good re-sealable top for storage.</li>
            <li> The packaging held up through shipping and the design of the package allows for easy storage.</li>
            <li> This comes in a resealable plastic bag which makes the storage easy.</li>
            <li> My family goes through this stuff very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I use this to make my own scented bath soak and am glad to have found a reliable source at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> We all need to detox and this is one way to easily do just that.  </li>
            <li> I received 20 lbs of epsom salt that easily dissolves.  </li>
            <li> Refreshing, clean and sparkly</li>
            <li> Would happily buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Good quality and a decent price at approx $1.50 per pound.</li>
            <li> super fast delivery and perfect size because we use to much of this.  </li>
            <li> I strongly suggest you be ware.</li>
            <li> Dissolves quickly in both cool and warm</li>
            <li> He is on the spectrum and I will say this seems to relax him quite nicely - I would say more so then just a regular warm bath.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Throw a cup of this into a nice hot bubble bath, add a glass of wine and you got yourself relaxation and relief that no medicine can come close to, and</li>
            <li> It comes in a giant ziploc-style bag and the grains are beautifully separate.</li>
            <li> These salts are beautiful and don&#x27;t clump like the regular Epsom salts you would buy at the store.</li>
            <li> Just when I am about to be productive, one of their bath salts tempts me and calls me to a nice hot soaking salt bath.  </li>
            <li> These are good things in that it was working and detoxing my body, but I&#x27;ll take more precautions next time like drinking more water/tea, before and after, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also thrown a handful or two into the soil with my tomato plants and man</li>
            <li> Wash it off in the morning in the shower and my skin is as good as new.</li>
            <li> I received this huge package of Epsoak Epsom salt very quickly.</li>
            <li> Sturdy packaging, no leaking, fine texture and quality salts.</li>
            <li> Huge bag with a strong zipper and moisture control.  </li>
            <li> These are fine &amp;#34;salt&amp;#34; crystals.</li>
            <li> packaging was fine, the shipping was on time.</li>
            <li> Love Epsom salt baths and buying in bulk has been super helpful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m also really enjoying the quantity, which allows me to super salt</li>
            <li> These salts seem to dissolve more quickly too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The most important thing for this great buy is that they truly work for sore muscles after a workout or long day.  </li>
            <li> While our family does prefer the San Francisco Salt Muscle Soak the Epsom Salt Soak is a great alternative for anyone who does not like fragrances (and especially not mints) - the Epsom Salt Soak is an easy recommendation</li>
            <li> The large size is nice, too.  </li>
            <li> Love the large bag so your not always going to the store to buy more.</li>
            <li> Love to be able to purchase a large bag for soaking.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a HUGE bag of epsom salts.</li>
            <li> Its a huge bag of epsom salt.</li>
            <li> but it is what it is...a huge bag of epsom salt</li>
            <li> Huge quantity for such a great price.</li>
            <li> Fabulous price</li>
            <li> Also great fertilizer for the conifer trees, mainly blue spruce, in the spring.</li>
            <li> The quality is fantastic and is always delivered on time.  </li>
            <li> They also sent a free gift of bath salts with my order.</li>
            <li> I was contacted by the San Francisco Salt Company and I have to commend them on their fabulous customer service.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great price especially if you have Amazon Prime membership.  </li>
            <li> If you enjoy fragrance in your bath</li>
            <li> It is a great addition to essential oils and baking soda.</li>
            <li> So my review is really just focused on the value of this product, which is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I do have an amazon prime account, so it ships for free.</li>
            <li> the 20lb bag is a great deal, compared to what you&#x27;re paying in the local supermarket.</li>
            <li> Great for bath for big bearded men!</li>
            <li> Cheaper to buy Epsom salt this way then the cheap cartons at Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li> Mosquitos love me, this product is worth it.  </li>
            <li> What a deal and free shipping with Prime.  </li>
            <li> This bulk bag is especially nice that it has a vent so moisture will not get trapped inside.</li>
            <li> relaxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, $30 for 20lbs, even with free delivery seems a bit over priced.  </li>
            <li> my bath guilt free.</li>
            <li> great price...would definitely order it again.  </li>
            <li> It makes a great facial scrub when combined with honey.</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time and damage free.</li>
            <li> Great buy - I will definitely be purchasing this item again.</li>
            <li> The book is available on Amazon and one of the instructions is to ingest a water/epson salt solution.  </li>
            <li> only thing they couldn’t speak intelligently on was the price.  </li>
            <li> Using this salt for essential oil/epsom  salt baths blends and it is great.</li>
            <li> Great customer service as well, only bought this purchase one</li>
            <li> BTW, their dead sea salts are great too!</li>
            <li> Great product and will be my go to vendor for my salt scrub in future.</li>
            <li> It has stayed clump free ever since.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to scents this could be a good thing.</li>
            <li> For me, I like good old fashioned akin to medium-to-large grain sea-salt, odorless Epsom.</li>
            <li> the salt is wonderful for bathing and soaking to remove toxins from the body and this salt seems to be more pure and legit than the other ones you buy at the drug store or wal mart.</li>
            <li> Btw- right after a bath I feel more energized and refreshed immediately.  </li>
            <li> It is great to have as much epsom salt as I want ready to add to a hot tub and soak my sore muscles, I will be getting this again that is for sure.</li>
            <li> Plus, they look so clean and glitter in the light.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if it really helps with my soreness, but it&#x27;s a good price and it dissolves well under hot water.</li>
            <li> This dissolved quickly and easily worked into the water.  </li>
            <li> Nice product in bulk for a decent price.</li>
            <li> The quality is good and it&#x27;s easy to seal the package back up.</li>
            <li> The grains are fine and it dissolves quickly in water.  </li>
            <li> I am an avid epsom salt soaker, and I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I love epsom salt baths after working out or in the middle of winter, and this is a great package of high quality salts!</li>
            <li> and I get exactly what I want quickly and easily (and speaking of savings I&#x27;m saving gas to drive to another store!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to see what else it can help with.</li>
            <li> and I feel great after a long soak.</li>
            <li> Having 20 lb bag arrive at my house beats carrying home small options from grocery store and these salts are great!</li>
            <li> Need to add more hot water?</li>
            <li> Remember how great your skin looked and felt after a long swim at the beach in salty waters?</li>
            <li> Useful salt for weed killing!</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> The San Francisco Salts are of a consistent size and appear more \\&quot;pure\\&quot; in color...</li>
            <li> * Original Review**&lt;br</li>
            <li> The epsom salt is fine and dissolves quickly in the tub...</li>
            <li> Neither is familiar with the grocery store or prices.  </li>
            <li> Love that, first of all.</li>
            <li> Interesting product that I added to my Hot Tub for relaxing muscles.</li>
            <li> You will be super clean and feel fantastic..</li>
            <li> If you will be using epsom salts on a regular basis, this is the most cost effective way to go.  </li>
            <li> With amazon prime, 2-day shipping is free so you really can&#x27;t find a better deal anywhere</li>
            <li> I place one of my Amazon purchased foot scrubbers in the bottom of the box and my feet are clean too.  </li>
            <li> Much more cost effective than what is sold in local stores.</li>
            <li> It dissolves quickly and leaves your skin feeling soothed and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for all the states that are suffering drought right now!!!</li>
            <li> Love the large bath.</li>
            <li> this large size is a much better value</li>
            <li> I appreciate being able to buy Epsom salt in the large 20-pound size.</li>
            <li> I have a large garden tub requiring more then 2 cups of salt per bath.  </li>
            <li> AND it comes in bulk RIGHT TO MY DOOR!</li>
            <li> Just what I expected - great for everything from weed killing to soaking.</li>
            <li> I first realized it was a wonderful alternative to drawing salve when I was having trouble dealing with an infected fire ant bite.  </li>
            <li> 5 stars cause its the most affordable epsom on Amazon, but I will say the first bag I got had finer salt crystals that absorbed faster.  </li>
            <li> Good value, would definitely order again&lt;</li>
            <li> The muscles become very relaxed and I sleep much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third -- the bag is awesome, thick, doesn&#x27;t tear, recluses with ease, and is liftable and movable&lt;br /&gt;Fourth --</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and simple, no artificial additives, and I&#x27;m sure those with fragrance sensitivities will appreciate that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and simple, no artificial additives, and I&#x27;m sure those with fragrance sensitivities will appreciate that.</li>
            <li> It really seems to make my feet feel better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use any and don&#x27;t feel any difference when I use it , but my husband seems to love it.</li>
            <li> arrived in good condition and am relaxing with my foot baths daily.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, the bag is solid and comes with a one way air valve to keep out moisture</li>
            <li> tub full of ~100 degrees Fahrenheit water&lt;</li>
            <li> Good price for a big, sturdy bag.</li>
            <li> Thanks SFSC :)</li>
            <li> The one think I REALLY liked was the fact that you can see the quality and size of the grain in the clear bag.  </li>
            <li> It is well packaged, clean and melts quickly in the bathtub.</li>
            <li> Used it a  couple times for them without really noticing a difference, maybe sleeping better?</li>
            <li> Also since the crystals are stored in a nice jar near my tub they look nicer.  </li>
            <li> Visited  the local doctor whom I thought checked me out fairly well...</li>
            <li> They are non-scented, which is good because they won&#x27;t overpower, especially if you are using soaps and bubble baths with the salts.</li>
            <li> Probably not a bad idea to get some oils if you are looking for an aroma.</li>
            <li> It is a good quality and size with great clarity and really helps the soreness in my muscles after a tense workout.</li>
            <li> price is right, arrived quickly, packaged securely.</li>
            <li> I take an epsom salt bath almost every other night and it feels great</li>
            <li> works great, salt if finer than other brands which helps it dissolve faster.</li>
            <li> 2 cups in the tub full of hot water makes for a great soak after a long bike ride</li>
            <li> I use this in the bath; it dissolves in the water very fast, after a great workout or a long run to help with the muscles.  </li>
            <li> This is seriously the best value.</li>
            <li> Quick deleivery too.</li>
            <li> You now have a loyal customer</li>
            <li> /&gt;The salts &amp;#34;cake up&amp;#34; fairly quickly even when sealed.</li>
            <li> My only regret is i wish i had more and didn&#x27;t have to pay for more.</li>
            <li> This is the best value I have found so far, and I also use the brand&#x27;s pink Himalayan salt for cooking/ seasoning.</li>
            <li> Package was received quickly.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery and exceeded expectations.</li>
            <li> Product dissolves quickly in water and provides that</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and the bag was hefty.</li>
            <li> the epsom salts arrived quickly and as promised.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how quickly this got here.</li>
            <li> I love using the Epsom salts for pretty much everything!</li>
            <li> It dissolved quickly and works wonders.</li>
            <li> Affordable, shipped quickly, arrived intact.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly and arrived intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dissolves quickly and provides me with immediate relief from soreness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> price &amp; product and speedy delivery are huge positives on their own, but truth be told, it&#x27;s the customer service that is going to keep me coming back!</li>
            <li> This product shipped quickly, was packaged well, and is just what I needed for soaking baths after surgery.</li>
            <li> Ships quickly and conveniently.</li>
            <li> salts work wonders and my baths are super relaxing.</li>
            <li> Personally, I have only used the Epsoak in a foot bath, but it has worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have fibromyalgia and soaking in a tub with Epsom salts helps tremendously.  </li>
            <li> They shipped it quickly, I had it within three days.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised, and shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m pregnant I take Epsom salt bath once a week after working 12hr shifts on my feet</li>
            <li> This way I don’t run out as quickly.  </li>
            <li> Got package quick.  </li>
            <li> and I love, love, love the new packaging style because it not only looks sleek</li>
            <li> I have reordered this product many times because it is much more economical to buy in bulk than to buy the smaller packages at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of getting used to--the first time I did it, my heart starting beating like crazy!--but an excellent way to get healthy and to reduce stress a bit (relaxing in a long, hot bath).</li>
            <li> I take baths on a regular basis and very pleased.  </li>
            <li> But, the finer crystals as really nice and dissolve much better than other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> just put in your bath and enjoy it, not expensive the shipment arrived on time</li>
            <li> Salts are good, it seems that you have to put lots of them to feel any kind of effect, compared to the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I find them cleansing, relaxing and good for sore muscles after a long day of hearty exercise.</li>
            <li> Large bag has zip lock for easy resealing between uses.</li>
            <li> The crystals are large but dissolve easily.</li>
            <li> After a hard days work I always look forward to a warm relaxing Epsom salt bath and feel so relaxed afterwards!!  </li>
            <li> Great product  for soaking sore muscles &amp; helping  dislodge foreign objects in your body!  </li>
            <li> could easily go through this much Epsom in a month--</li>
            <li> Easy way to get much need magnesium levels in my body.</li>
            <li> Just received my package, was super excited for a nice relaxing soak after a long day but that won&#x27;t be happening.</li>
            <li> thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> The hot epsom salt baths for me are a must!  </li>
            <li> I suggest making the switch from whichever brand you may be using now to these, and enjoy a nice long soak!</li>
            <li> I will be back to buy more once I&#x27;m done with my 20 lbs of epsom salts!</li>
            <li> This was a good economical purchase, but the big bag turned out to be kind of a pain in the long run.</li>
            <li> It is cheaper that way, but I really prefer these fine grains.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and fine grain--better quality than others that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this  fine product I no longer carry around a pebble in my knee &amp;  also change doctors because of it.  </li>
            <li> Great, except the little hole in the bag.</li>
            <li> The salt is more fine than the CVS quarts of epsoms I had been used to buying, so it goes further.</li>
            <li> The older I get, the more I appreciate this product in a really hot bath tub...</li>
            <li> A nice day of what I hoped would be dedicated to relaxing has now turned into a fine day of sweeping, vacuuming and meticulously finding every last granule as my freshly crawling baby has a tendency to ingest absolutely anything she can find.</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality, dissolves fast and will always be part of our household.</li>
            <li> This may sound crazy to some folks but if you look it up online you will see that Epsom salts make a great plant food/fertilizer (and an inexpensive but effective one).  </li>
            <li> now, what with my own kids and one going to preschool for the first time I&#x27;ve been looking into supporting and strengthening their immune systems naturally.</li>
            <li> It comes in a re-sealable bag so it stays fresh.</li>
            <li> I make my own bath salts with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Like the nice big bag.</li>
            <li> I love how soft my skin feels after taking Epsom salt baths.  </li>
            <li> - how people adore sea salt soaks because it helps our skin be soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> My hair has improved greatly since switching to washing it only with soft water.</li>
            <li> They have said that this is perfect for their tired feet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a bigger size and not be putting it on my shopping list every week.</li>
            <li> so I can mix my own essential oils depending on necessity.</li>
            <li> Buying the epsom salt in bulk is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Well, you can get the same thing just bathing in your own tub using these salts..</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag has an effective reseal so that clumping has been held off during several weeks of this routine.</li>
            <li> a nice translucent white.  </li>
            <li> Nice to buy Epsom salt in a &#x27;bulk&#x27; package rather than the smaller cartons at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good as you expected.</li>
            <li> It also arrived a couple days after I ordered it via standard shipping, which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> But to me, the price is worth the effort though and</li>
            <li> Such a great value for those people who talk frequent baths or who make scented bath salts.</li>
            <li> the Epsoak and the Muscle Soak are fantastic and can turn a normal bath into a super relaxing experience....</li>
            <li> I was happy to see that the salt wasn&#x27;t stuck together in big clumps like many other brands.</li>
            <li> I had a really great PT who recommended epsom to me, not sure if it works, but he seemed very hot on it</li>
            <li> They dissolve pretty quickly in my bath.</li>
            <li> and I can fall asleep pretty quickly after I soaked for a bit.  </li>
            <li> The salts are clean and pure.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, flat bottom</li>
            <li> At the time I thought, &#x27;Yeah, right.</li>
            <li> , it sets right there</li>
            <li> My son gets a kick out of pouring the right amount in the tub every night.</li>
            <li> But it dissolves right away</li>
            <li> I was concerned about purchasing a 20 lb bag, but now that I have it I can see I picked the right one.  </li>
            <li> I love the 20lb packaging, which lasts a long time and it&#x27;s a huge convenience to have it arrive on my doorstep.  </li>
            <li> But I was happy enough with the product, and how quickly it was delivered that I&#x27;ve just made a second order.  </li>
            <li> This Epsom salt is just as good (if not better) than any other I&#x27;ve tried and for 20lbs, this is a great price.  </li>
            <li> On a positive note, it dissolved quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more likely to fall asleep quickly.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis, and have to soak nightly for the pains in order to get to sleep this epsom slats is great quality and large bag keeps me from having to have all those little boxes setting around.</li>
            <li> The large bag is economical and useful.  </li>
            <li> As a busy full time yoga teacher, a luxurious soak at the end of the day is key to waking up bright eyed and bushy tailed, ready to myself and my clients on the mat.</li>
            <li> I was looking for pure Epsom salts, and I&#x27;ve found it!  </li>
            <li> Epsom salt is such a great product to have especially if your A vigorous athlete.</li>
            <li> 20 pounds may sound a lot, but I enjoy 20-minute soaks in the bath daily.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find some decent reviews for epson salts, but this is a very good brand.  </li>
            <li> Epsom salt is a killer detox and very gentle.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much</li>
            <li> but I go through it very fast.  </li>
            <li> Always a very fast and cost-effective delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rather large container, but the price is worth it.  </li>
            <li> and she said I had great feet, and she hardly had to scrape anything.  </li>
            <li> They look like little sparkly diamonds and make a beautiful presentation in a clear container.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually thinking about ordering some for holiday gifts because I&#x27;m enjoying it so very much.</li>
            <li> The grains were nice, a little more clear...</li>
            <li> Really helpful with Fybromyalgia pain, after a long day, soaking in hot water with these salts is very therapeutic!!!!!</li>
            <li> The salt itself is a more of a fine granule than the previous brand I used.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think much of it but upon unboxing and taking out the epsoak package--salt everywhere!</li>
            <li> Great product it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Table spoons of skin safe essential oils</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m just not going to spend so much more than I have too for an American made product.  </li>
            <li> Hot bath with Epsom salt</li>
            <li> Glad that it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance like the brand at my local Walgreens does.  </li>
            <li> Fragrance is pretty toxic stuff (despite the innocuous sounding name).</li>
            <li> the salt kind of slumps and makes the opening wide.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I have this product and would definitely recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This epsom salt makes a very relaxing bath salt!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>

            <li> and when I woke the next morning I felt more rested</li>
            <li> I use 2 cups in my bath with 1/2 cup of baking soda and 10 drops of lavender oil as a stress relieving bath in my claw foot tub as hot as I can take it.</li>
            <li> Most people do not get enough magnesium in their diet.</li>
            <li> The ziploc part works the first time every time.</li>
            <li> Thanks Epsoak and SFSC!</li>
            <li> but, Its not my favorite brand for personal use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There was only one issue I had with the latest order I had with this company.</li>
            <li> So, a winning product and one I would have problem buying in the future.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more when I start to run low.</li>
            <li> If I am detoxing, I put Two cups of Epsom Salt and two cups of Baking soda in a hot bath and soak for 40 minutes.  </li>
            <li> He soaks with 1 cup every night for 20 minutes and comes out calm and ready for bed.</li>
            <li> My first time using Epsom salt.</li>
            <li> Love this product it is good for everyday soaking and actually softens your skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Super fast shipping, too!</li>
            <li> great size.. this will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I love to use and make bath salts (not the illegal drug kind!).</li>
            <li> This is by far the cheapest Epsom salt I have been able to find, and I use it a few times a week for a nice relaxing detox bath.  </li>
            <li> These guys had it, and it was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I love this epsom salt and have almost finished one bag in only a couple months.  </li>
            <li> I love when I find a company that treats me like a human being instead of a transaction.</li>
            <li> I love Epsom salts in my bath and have tried multiple kinds.</li>
            <li> At first I was going to decline the opportunity to review these salt baths, but I mentioned them to my wife and she wanted to give them a try.</li>
            <li> ;-)  </li>
            <li> So I threw in a couple handfuls into a hot bath and soaked away.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I never got to use it.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what the description describes.</li>
            <li> The salt grains are fine and dissolve quickly, which is a big improvement over the epsom salt I&#x27;ve been buying at the drug store.  </li>
            <li> I love that I can buy it in a big bag.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Epsom salt really works for tired achy muscles and swollen feet which is great for me because I spend a lot of time on my fit at works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These salts are more crystallized rather than big rock salt pieces.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to start taking epsom salt baths, and this helps with the pain so much!</li>
            <li> I read all the cautions on everything from adverse reactions to chlorine added to destruction of the pump, motor and heater in the Hot Tub (Spa).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t add the Chlorine granules at the same time as the Epson Salt to just be on the safe side.</li>
            <li> Will be back for more.</li>
            <li> Use for a hot soaking bath.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for to make my bath salts.</li>
            <li> I would in the future  order more.  </li>
            <li> can just add them right in with your detergent.&lt;br /&gt;It softens hard water, and makes your clothes smell amazing!</li>
            <li> Product arrived more quickly than I expected in a resealable bag.  </li>
            <li> It is high quality and really help to dilate the cells to clean the, out.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, and large amount that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> With this size, it&#x27;s extremely cost effective.</li>
            <li> I initially thought it was too big but find I am using it at a pretty good pace.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> It dissolves much more quickly than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> But after try this brand for several time, it Work as described, and I can enjoy a nice long soak, helping to relief my leg sprains and bruises!</li>
            <li> So while I had a good experience with this, next time I&#x27;ll just buy locally and save the money.  </li>
            <li> This Epson Salt from the San Francisco Salt Company seems much cleaner and more pure than the stuff I have bought at the local food or pharmacy stores.  </li>
            <li> It is the pricing that deserves the positive review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had nothing but positive experiences.</li>
            <li> and I do feel a positive difference when I am done.</li>
            <li> Thanks much!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not planning on using the whole bag have another container ready because this resealing bag is the biggest pain in the world to close, IF it closes at all!</li>
            <li> As an avid runner soaking 3 days a week really helps the achy muscles.  </li>
            <li> (I usually take baths once in a while) but packaging and everything is good.</li>
            <li> and it works just as good as the high priced little bags do that you get in the drug store.</li>
            <li> These salts are high quality and were delivered right when they said they would be.</li>
            <li> Super convienent to get such a large bag!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, and I don&#x27;t know how they do that, but they&#x27;re certainly pretty in the huge apothecary jar next to the tub where I keep them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I use it daily in my bath, it easily lasted me a month.&lt;br /&gt;Basically</li>
            <li> They are scent-free, coarse but dissolve easily and quickly, and leave my skin soft and exfoliated.</li>
            <li> the grains are small (it looks like granulated sugar) and easily absorbed into warm water.</li>
            <li> I put 2 cups in my large bath with some lavender oil before bed, and I sleep like a baby.</li>
            <li> I take a lot of epsom salts soaks during marathon training, so I thought a 20-lb bag would be a smart investment.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d certainly sign up for it.</li>
            <li> The crystals are somewhat large and it takes some swishing to get them to dissolve in the tub</li>
            <li> I bought this large bag for the garden.</li>
            <li> It is pure epsom salt.  </li>
            <li> I repeatedly order this large bag.</li>
            <li> so we sought to have a large quantity.</li>
            <li> The large quantity reduces both cost ahd shopping actions.  </li>
            <li> I prepared his bath, I was immediately struck by how large the grains were.  </li>
            <li> and I think buy it like this, in the large bag, is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found this salt purely by accident on Amazon.</li>
            <li> found the grain size to be more consistent in this SF Salt Co. epsom salt than in other epsom salt products that I&#x27;ve purchased at grocery and discount stores.  </li>
            <li> was gone, and by the next day he was fine.</li>
            <li> I use it faithfully every night, especially while pregnant!</li>
            <li> Very high quality epsom slats.</li>

            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> This is a much cheaper way of buying Epsom salts if you use much of it.  </li>

            <li> first thing I&#x27;ll note is that while the lavender comes in a pretty, fold-over-top plastic container, the Epsom Salt comes in essence in a clear baggie with a ziplock closure.</li>
            <li> It helps you live in a culture that is all about fast fast fast worry worry!  </li>
            <li> I also love being able to customize what essential oils I use when I want to with this plain salt.  </li>
            <li> The product came in a cheap bag, even after letting air out through a vacuum seal moisture still got in which made some of the salt clump together.</li>
            <li> Each day, I use a new cat litter box while sitting on the edge of my tub with a generous sprinkle and hot water and, ah, the pain goes away.</li>
            <li> It seems to dissolve much better than other salts I have tried.</li>
            <li> In that respect, it works better than other products that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I have used other epsom salt products not as satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how much shipping is without it, or how cost effective it would be.</li>
            <li> I mix it with shampoo every couple weeks to get a deep clean on the hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I really find that it relaxes me after a long day and makes my skin feel smooth.  </li>
            <li> After sitting in the bath for at least 10 minutes your muscles are relieved from any aches or pains and the fact that you get such a huge bag for such a great price is a win-win.</li>
            <li> I add a small amount to my hair conditioner and it does amazing things for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this economical pack of epsom salt - minus one star ONLY because it doesn&#x27;t seem resealable.</li>
            <li> When I drain the Hot Tub water each month I add the Chlorine to clear the water, wait an hour, and then add the two cups of Epson Salt.</li>
            <li> Is the same true for magnesium sulfate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This same company produces a dead sea salt as well which makes your skin feel really good (but doesn&#x27;t do much for relaxing my muscles as this epsom does).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if Epsom salts work, to be honest.</li>
            <li> Before you buy, please read the full following articles:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 11 year old son was the first to claim the salts.  </li>
            <li> Better than other brands and cheaper, can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Great stuff big bag to hard to handle though</li>
            <li> I emerge from my bath more relaxed, less achey, and my skin feels softer.</li>
            <li> Costs less than most bath salts.</li>
            <li> This has a very relaxing smell to it, and is great for relaxing your tired muscles!  </li>
            <li> I transitioned from using lavender infused to this with lavender essential oils, tremendous savings.</li>
            <li> I am glad to know that this bag will last for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> Of course it isn&#x27;t the only way to heal, but it helps tremendously.  </li>
            <li> It just makes bath time much more relaxing, especially when combined with a drop or two of essential oil.</li>
            <li> I am older and play raquetball and work out at the gym.  </li>
            <li> That left about another cup in the bag – just enough for one more</li>
            <li> The Epsoak did leave our skin feeling very soft - much softer than just using a moisturizing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great price for a simple (and heavy!) product!  </li>
            <li> The bag is more tightly compressed, too.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality, non toxic  alternative to the products sold in stores with &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; added.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it since my days playing High School football and it still works wonders for aches and pains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Epsoak from San Francisco Salt Company.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just by looking at it one can tell that it&#x27;s a high quality product.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone seeking high quality epsom salt</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product to those seeking bulk epsom salt.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The seller was very responsive &amp; it also came with a free sample of other salts they make.</li>
            <li> Since then, I&#x27;ve used it repeatedly on other insect bites, imbedded rose thorns, slivers, cactus needles and such.  </li>
            <li> it lasts me a month, and this way -- I mean buying it this way from these people, and they seem very nice, btw, I am not constantly running out.  </li>
            <li> But in the larger question of whether buying ANY epsom salts are worth it - I highly suggest you do some research.</li>
            <li> But in the larger question of whether buying ANY epsom salts are worth it - I highly suggest you do some research.</li>
            <li> It really helps with aches and pains, and it also helps keep my skin clear of eczema, with which I have struggled since childhood.  </li>
            <li> really helps to relax and clear you</li>
            <li> I was using topical steriods to calm my itchy skin and after awhile it stopped working.</li>
            <li> It was nice to not have to constantly purchase smaller bags, but this big bag was a pain to store.</li>
            <li> you normally would.</li>
            <li> I tried this last night for the first time, because my muscles REALLY ached.</li>
            <li> but we like the Dead Sea bath salt way better.</li>
            <li> Love to soak my feet in it with a few drops of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I feel tired much more quickly</li>
            <li> Bag is resealable and watertight so it can be kept right next to the tub.</li>
            <li> The product at first seemed a bit sketchy to me because of the low price for 20 lbs of Epsom salt, I&#x27;m used to paying a lot more for a little.</li>

            <li> This very large bag of salt now stays next to the bathtub.</li>
            <li> I have a very tiny bathroom, but it fits just fine next to the tub.</li>
            <li> If it works so very well on poisons and impurities large enough to see, just think how it must be tackling all those impurities and toxins in your skin that are invisible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be getting htis product again once this HUGE bag gets empty!</li>
            <li> I also added a few drops of sweet orange essential oil to enjoy a fragrant and relaxing soak.  </li>
            <li> when I was bathing 3 times a day in recovery this gave me the smoothest skin you could imagine, so ladies, bathe twice a day in this stuff and you&#x27;ll not have to use any other creams or lotions to get that smooth skin.</li>
            <li> , I noticed in other customer reviews that some people got a free sample with their purchase.  </li>
            <li> The amount (20lbs,) the packing, and the price made far more sense than those little boxes you can sometimes pick up at the supermarket.  </li>
            <li> you want a new way of using epsom salt, here it is.</li>
            <li> THEY LIVE ANOTHER YEAR.,</li>
            <li> I enjoy experimenting with various essential oils to add to my Epson Salt bath treatments</li>
            <li> The seller even included a little bamboo scoop for the salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived intact, quickly, and exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I found myself very sensitive to this product.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and using this works like a charm.</li>
            <li> The shipment of these salts was fast and efficient- as a very \\&quot;green\\&quot; person, I appreciated there was minimal packing materials  used with the delivery of this product.</li>
            <li> I take hot baths almost daily.</li>
            <li> , it now has a Double sealing/closing strip that is much improved!  </li>
            <li> In fact there&#x27;s apparently a study on this very topic - look on the NIH website for PMID 19216298 - and they found the magnesium sulfate did NOT get through the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact there&#x27;s apparently a study on this very topic - look on the NIH website for PMID 19216298 - and they found the magnesium sulfate did NOT get through the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it for daily aches and pains and I really believe it helps!</li>
            <li> You can find so many reasons to order Epsom salt, it&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
            <li> what this product in general does, i really dont have a clue.</li>
            <li> I love how big this is, it last such along time.</li>
            <li> It made my feet feel so soft!  </li>
            <li> I was going through way too many small containers.</li>
            <li> And they didn&#x27;t make my dry skin even more dry.</li>
            <li> one day in the ocean fixes me right up for a long time, and then I thought, &amp;#34;hey, Epsom salt&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> This is a huge bag, so it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy it at Costco, but I need to take frequent detox baths and thought this would be a better deal.  </li>
            <li> My products were shipped extremely quickly, and delivered faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> Being able to buy this large bag saves me money and the effort of going to the store constantly to buy small bags.  </li>
            <li> SF&#x27;s epsom salt has mostly nice clear grains, while other brands have a lot of opaque white grains mixed in.  </li>
            <li> Although the smaller packages of bath salts is a bit more expensive, the bulk packages are actually fairly comparablein price per pound to other store bought</li>
            <li> The salt itself is good, but trouble getting it out of the bag made me mark it down to 2 stars.  </li>
            <li> I get lower back pain, and using this in a hot bath before bed really helps.. it definitely relaxes your muscles.  </li>
            <li> At first I wondered if I needed a bag this big, but it really isn&#x27;t all that big, and I like that</li>
            <li> was full of chemicals, fragrance and other stuff</li>
            <li> which were full of chaff and other things that make cleaning the tub a problem.</li>
            <li> Will certainly re-order again in future.</li>
            <li> Returning such a large bag is pain in the neck anyways, so we didn&#x27;t even consider that option.</li>
            <li> to handle for such a large size.</li>
            <li> I just keep a large apothecary jar of it next to my soaking tub.</li>
            <li> The biggest challenge with this product is finding a large enough space in the bathroom for the bag.</li>
            <li> Buying in such a large quantity saves a lot of money.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that i wished the bag closed more easily.</li>
            <li> But same bath in the end, just a little more mixing together.</li>
            <li> All the bath salts I&#x27;ve tried by The San Francisco Salt Co. seem to be a cut above the rest, very high end.</li>
            <li> We would love to suggest using a hemp bag for packaging as plastic is toxic and we have cut enough trees down on this planet!</li>
            <li> The salt comes in a clear, resealable bag.</li>
            <li> Also is such a great price; you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Salt works\\&quot; and others clearly state what is and is not in every salt product they sell (as well as country of origin)  </li>
            <li> someone told me to soak in this, it would help clear up my acne.</li>
            <li> Because I like the look of the SF clear grains, it makes for a nicer experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Old fashioned.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Really wish they had options for different fragrances though as I also find that a therapeutic experience.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than my local pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using it for about a week, but I really like it.</li>
            <li> Was surprised when I received a 20 pound brick chunk of Epsom salt</li>
            <li> ready to use for my bath, next to the tub.  </li>
            <li> I began running my bath water and cut open the bag and had my cup ready to measure out two cups</li>
            <li> The soarness in my body had released almost completely.</li>
            <li> I wish the bag had handles but as far as the product is concerned I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Or an old lady&#x27;s underwear</li>
            <li> I have been consistently ordering 40lbs this product from this seller for a long time.</li>
            <li> Added plus- my doctor just commented on how soft my skin is.</li>
            <li> Though Epsom salt is dirt-cheap, no research supports any direct effect on injury recovery, and none of the theories forwarded about how Epsom salt might help in indirect ways</li>
            <li> My wife and I use this in our Japanese Soaking Tub and it really does make a difference.  </li>
            <li> Epsom salt in my bath keeps my feet soft.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so soft.</li>
            <li> Old folks experience increasing feet problems for which Epsom Salts soaking is recommended by my Podiatrist.  </li>
            <li> I just keep it near the tub and no moisture seems to be getting in.  </li>
            <li> So far I have found a 2 bag case at a wholesale store</li>
            <li> But anyhow my son, 2years old, had a fever of 102</li>
            <li> I was surprised by just how big the bag was, and definitely had to move things around in my bathroom to make space for it, but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> The Epsom Salts dissolved instantly and made my bath very relaxing after a stressful day at work.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops of your favorite essential oil</li>
            <li> Nothing like a hot bath w/ these salts after a long day of working!</li>
            <li> I am so excited to have a stash big enough to last me a while.</li>
            <li> The plastic bag is also not very fragrant when it comes (unless shipped in a box with something fragrant), so it can be stored in my bathroom right</li>
            <li> (we have an unusually hot and dry summer--</li>
            <li> crystal size is small and it dissolves very quickly.</li>
            <li> It was clumped solid when I received it, but I simply dropped the bag on the concrete which broke up a lot of it, then I put it in a large glass apothecary jar and used an ice pick to break up the rest.  </li>
            <li> i frequently buy this product, it works as expected and it&#x27;s a high quality salt at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Folk remedies are often generally neglected by researchers, but not usually so completely.\\&quot; -- Paul Ingraham</li>
            <li> definitely worth every penny spent!</li>
            <li> Not sure how to compare one brand of Epsom Salts to another, but this seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using different brands of epsom salts for years (mainly for a full-body, muscle-ache soak).</li>
            <li> Just be aware that the bag really is 20 lbs (its heavy).</li>
            <li> I just recently got to thinking if I use the Epsom salts under the hostas not only will they be fed but the higher salt in the dirt might discourage slug traffic.  </li>
            <li> This large bag has lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this several times now and the quality has always been high.</li>
            <li> I took two baths with these (at a high concentration of salts), but found that my aches and pains weren&#x27;t relieved as they were with some generic Epsom salt I had picked up from the store.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product and I use it daily.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the book as well especially if you have gallbladder issues and even if you don&#x27;t .</li>
            <li> Was so tired of spending $5-8 at the store for much smaller bags that lasted only a few baths… this one was perfect at almost 20 pounds!  </li>
            <li> The no-name store brands have a lot of tiny grains, even some dust, mixed in with the large grains.</li>
            <li> I got a large piece loose that looked to be about the size of a cup and chucked it into my bath.  </li>
            <li> The company saw my initial review and sent me a new bag.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a habitual epsom salt bath taker, because it really helps my low back pain and insomnia.  </li>
            <li> Add a couple drops of your fav essential oil to bath water for some really sweet down time.</li>
            <li> Epsom salts from the store did not bring me any major reactions like this product did.</li>
            <li> Epsom Salt is also fantastic for soaking your body when you have sore muscles from a hard workout.</li>
            <li> At least I know now that I will have to plan ahead and break a chunk off of the boulder before the bath has filled with water.  </li>
            <li> HUGE resealable bag that is thick plastic.</li>
            <li> As a bonus they sent me a sample of French grey gourmet food salt - I really like it too.</li>
            <li> Even helps clear up bug bits and itchy skin in the same fashion.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
            <li> In searching for epsom salt, I found product after product with fragrance - which is a big problem for me, since I&#x27;m sensitive to it.  </li>
            <li> The value per pound of this bag far surpasses any tiny drugstore box I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Apparently Epsoak Epsom Salt has been around for quite a while.</li>
            <li> No heavy lifting beyond the initial delivery.</li>
            <li> It has also been shown to help replace magnesium which most of us are deficient in.  </li>
            <li> After two broken ribs, I decided I needed to pay more attention to my bones.  </li>
            <li> Love these for bathing my magnesium deficient son.</li>
            <li> Practically pruning every day!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to point out that instead of a harsh bleach bath that Drs recommend for eczema, Epsom salts with baking soda and coconut oil is worth considering.</li>
            <li> The first night I soaked for half an hour just before bed</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a lot of petri dishes disguised as little cute little kiddos running around.</li>
            <li> There was a small hole in the bag so some of it had come out of the bag during shipping but other than that it was fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other brands at grocery stores that were much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t thinking it would be that much, but I take baths at least once a week</li>
            <li> Why bother, buy this big old sack and have a ton around for a very low price.</li>
            <li> Relaxing after a hard workout or just a long day- dissolves easily</li>
            <li> My partner and I both takes epsom salt and baking soda baths regularly (both for general relaxation and for recovery from training) and this bag has lasted me almost 6 months.</li>
            <li> have an old back injury that flares up from time to time and gets sore for no apparent reason.  </li>
            <li> I think that the price is VERY comparable to other manufacturers that sell similar quality.  </li>
            <li> Two cups of this salt + one cup of baking soda + a few drops of lavender oil + one bathtub of hot water, soak for 40 minutes &#x3D;</li>
            <li> /&gt;First things first, THIS IS HEAVY because you&#x27;re getting A LOT of epsom salt.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t pushing and prolapsing anyome, on the down side, if I do exurt myself too much</li>
            <li> Well, it is hard to say if this is super Epsom salt.</li>
            <li> It helps clear up minor skin irritations almost instantly...</li>
            <li> (pretty much everyone is deficient in mg nowadays).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d bought some Dead Sea salts via Amazon in the past and they were okay but definitely overpriced.</li>
            <li> Large bag is heavy duty without any breakage problems.</li>
            <li> Combine with mineral salts and essential oils to create very cheap custom versions of normally expensive bath salts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good quality but a little expensive for epsom salt.</li>
            <li> Whenever I get a delivery of it via Amazon Prime Fresh, I have a hard time lugging it from the door to my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Its not easy to find bags this large where I am.  </li>
            <li> I bought it mainly for baths (relax tight muscles and such).  </li>
            <li> The bag is vacuum sealed.  </li>
            <li> in terms of these epsom salts being better or worse than other epsom salts, I&#x27;ll give it a 4/5.</li>
            <li> in terms of these epsom salts being better or worse than other epsom salts, I&#x27;ll give it a 4/5.</li>
            <li> the new drug called BATH SALTS has hit the market &amp; is driving people to eat each other, maybe they should rethink the company name!</li>
            <li> Magnesium helps you absorb other nutrients, it relaxes your muscles and promotes clear skin.</li>
            <li> I use the salt nearly every day for soaking away the muscle aching I experience due to fibromyalgia.</li>
            <li> For one, the salts actually dissolve completely, which, if you use bath salts, you know that the salts not dissolving can leave you with a less than desirable experience overall.</li>
            <li> As somebody with a litany of long term sports related injuries, and a long bath with these salts helped to ease the constant soreness in my knees, feet, and back.</li>
            <li> My treat after a really hard weight and cardio workout is a hot bath with 2 cups of this in it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately ordering online is becoming over priced.</li>
            <li> Of course, how much of that weight loss can be contributed to the salt versus the lack of junk food, I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> In moderate humidity, it stays loose/not clumped a long time.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Long lasting product and storage bag!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a big bag of salt and lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> Last for a long time.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was the fact that the box was labled \\&quot;San Francisco BATH Salt Company\\&quot;!I live in the country &amp; have to pick up my packages from the local small market.</li>
            <li> Barring future research, it&#x27;s very hard to justify an Epsom salt bath over a traditional ice bath or hot water bath for treating an injury.</li>
            <li> My whole family bathes in these salts at least once a week for overall feeling of well being.</li>
            <li> If you soak your hair though while using it I would recommend extra conditioner because it will dry your hair out.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that the resealable bag isn&#x27;t very resealable.  </li>
            <li> You spend forever getting it closed, check it twice, and come back to it open with rocks forming in the bag from the moisture that seeped in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times which surprised me since i</li>
            <li> There are so many poor products or harsh products on the market with warnings all over.  </li>
            <li> complete, put in an air tight container.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even after a difficult workout, I feel fine.</li>
            <li> Especially if you are someone who uses it to make bath solutions, laundry, or other various things.</li>
            <li> It is relaxing, but I mostly started to bath in Epsom salt because I have acne on my shoulders, and at my age it is just crazy that I should still be having acne problems.  </li>
            <li> And the 20lb bag lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for soaking my feet after a long day.</li>
            <li> Use it for both foot baths after a long day tromping around my place, and for adding to garden plants that require magnesium....tomatoes, peppers, etc.  </li>
            <li> Only thing that I would improve is to have a slid closure, since it hurts my arthritis to press the bag closed.</li>
            <li> few nights later, strangely enough, the husband was suffering from similar aches and pains and he took it upon himself to soak them away with the remainder of my salts.  </li>
            <li> Adding two cups Epsom Salts along with one cup hydrogen peroxide to the tub can go a long way to help detox.</li>
            <li> But it isn&#x27;t a big enough problem for me to mark it down for it.  </li>
            <li> This magic combo has replaced my previous ritual of expensive and boutique bath salts.</li>
            <li> Bag came ripped open and spilled over the other items in my order.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m open to hearing from people who have found other research</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m open to hearing from people who have found other research</li>
            <li> The crystals are about the same size as any other epsom salt and there is no scent to it.</li>
            <li> I was going to say, see the other review as I purchased another brand in the same quantity as this one.</li>
            <li> I finally might have enough to last a few months!</li>
            <li> The Epsom Salts allow my muscles to relax, and I add several other things for aromatherapy and skin</li>
            <li> It was a bargain at $26.99 and comparable to other bath salts sold locally.</li>
            <li> (very minor plus).</li>
            <li> It makes me mad that companies and sellers are at times tripling prices for their own gain and people like me our forced to deal with these prices when we have no other options.</li>
            <li> well, leave out to dry for about 2-3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Many ole timers and disabled who are unable to get in and out of the tub will benefit from this procedure..</li>
            <li> I use two cups of this every single day and it lasts me about a month.  </li>
            <li> single.</li>
            <li> Ok, I will admit that I was very skeptical about the San Francisco Salts Epson Soak baths.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to know what to expect when you&#x27;re ordering from someone new and the shipment is 20 pounds.</li>
            <li> Later in the evening I noticed when I looked down at my leg</li>
            <li> My 5-year-old started developing a minor tic and we nipped it in the bud with epsom salt soaks!!</li>
            <li> Keeps for a very long time!  </li>
            <li> However, you can purchase epsom salt at your local Costco at $8 or $9 for 12 pounds ---less than $1.00 a pound.</li>
            <li> I recently tried the Morton Epson salts, and the quality of the salt seems much less.  </li>
            <li> I use about a half cup with essential oils and some carrier oil.</li>
            <li> I take epsom salt baths on a regular basis to soak my muscles from all the training of half marathons I do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it hardened up this time because the last purchase of the same product did not have this problem.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a larger container of epsom salt than what you can typically get in a store.  </li>
            <li> Epsom salt can cost a fortune when placed in a tiny little foo foo box.  </li>
            <li> I use this to mix with my hard water to make it soft.</li>
            <li> I was always a little skeptical about whether epsom salt soaks really worked, but I had a tough workout recently and my muscles really hurt the next day.  </li>
            <li> After a lovely and painful surgery called a hemorrhoid-ectomy with a pull through.</li>
            <li> Great salts,  HORRIBLE packaging!</li>
            <li> I use at least 1-2 cups of Epsom salt per tub of water and it dissolves completely in about 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li> This time, there was multiple holes in the plastic bag, literally 5-6 dime sized round holes.</li>
            <li> We use them for our plants to Green them up, especially our palms.  </li>
            <li> Have used it for rough feet, hornet stings, infections.  </li>
            <li> this bag of salt is heavy at 20 pounds but it should last a while.</li>
            <li> However, at 25 years of age, and after 12+ years of not knowing I was allergic to dairy, or grains I spent a lot of time on the pot pushing and grunting which lead to a prolapse rectum.</li>
            <li> There is no real scientific proof epsom salt helps.</li>
            <li> I have Multiple Sclerosis and try to do a soak a few times a week to help with muscle pain.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different flavors of their salts</li>
            <li> /&gt;Downside: they need sturdier bags since my bag partially opened and leaked out in transit.  </li>
            <li> Outside of being heavy and bulky</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never really heard of detox baths growing up, but</li>
            <li> I recently ordered these when the Dead Sea bath salts by Masada we out of stock on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My expected date of delivery was Sept 25-27.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve certainly never seen anything comparable in drugstores.</li>
            <li> and I will probably order some of their other products that are not readily available locally.</li>
            <li> Apparently he had a rough day at school and martial arts and needed to soak his tired muscles.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have found I stay in the bath for too long</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, but a little less like a &amp;#34;spa experience&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is permanently in my bathroom for epsom salt baths that I have every other night.</li>
            <li> Not sure I can tell if it helps my back pain</li>
            <li> Not witchcraft - I have TMJ / chronically sore muscles due to stress /</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product and will continue ordering a bag every other months.</li>
            <li> My husband says they don&#x27;t, other people swear they do.</li>
            <li> Also, it was a larger grain than what I usually get.</li>
            <li> So rather than teach him to stay away from other kids that have runny noses we teach him to give them a healing hug if they need one.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t see the usual double zip function</li>
            <li> If you do any comparison shopping, you will see that other reviewers agree.</li>
            <li> I decided to trust the other reviews</li>
            <li> Epsom Salt that I&#x27;ve bought in the past from local shops has been clumpy or melted.</li>
            <li> about once every other month or so.  </li>
            <li> Arrived as expected!</li>
            <li> My father has extreme itching of the lower part of his legs.</li>
            <li> then other brands that I used before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so pretty, it looks fake.  </li>
            <li> THe one I used to buy in other stores had instructions on how to use it as laxative on both sides.</li>
            <li> I make my homemade lavender salt scrubs and was buying small amounts of Epsom Salts from my local store.</li>
            <li> Recently wrecked my bicycle and landed in tar and small pebbles.  </li>
            <li> Using a cup for each Palm once a month to add acidity and other necessities to the ground.  </li>
            <li> Refreshing in cold water during the hot months, and comforting and cozy when arthritis strikes me in the cold and clammy</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried Epson Salts to soothe dry itchy skin you are missing out.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re whitish with a slight twinkle of pink in there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite it being a Saturday, I heard back immediately from a customer service rep who was, to say the least, extremely gracious and truly made me feel like a valued customer.</li>
            <li> Less clumps than I had with other brands.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the bag had a tear and salt was going on my bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> This bag lasts a long time and is a bargain compared to buying the small boxes of epsom salt at the drug store.</li>
            <li> I would at least think Amazon.com would have similar prices.</li>
            <li> So much can go wrong.</li>
            <li> With hammers we broke it down to sakt form again.</li>
            <li> Even bashing it down on the floor didn&#x27;t break it up.  </li>
            <li> It helps keep the moisture in the soil in places with dry climates and keeps your lawn green even when everyone elses is turning brown!</li>
            <li> , they weren’t very sorry and each offered me a handful of mildly descriptive words to help me when I did write it.  </li>
            <li> I have previously used this salt</li>
            <li> He gets about half to one cup for each bath</li>
            <li> i noticed a slight difference in my acne.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty expensive in the small quantities you get from the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Seems odd to be recommending... salt.  </li>
            <li> I think I paid about $30 for it or less.</li>
            <li> had previously written that I bought it for $18.99 in February 2013.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately my mother and I have a chronic illness and require numerous aids to assist with our constant symptoms, pains, fatigue, etc.</li>
            <li> Slight headache and muscle aches.</li>
            <li> I seriously cannot get enough of this product.</li>
            <li> We are a very active family and often after our renovations or yard work, gardening, working out etc..</li>
            <li> We are both marathon runners and use this as a soak after long runs and races, no more swelling or sore muscles!</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness, this stuff was a solid  piece of rock hard epsom salt!  </li>
            <li> ( Not in an insane, OCD way but-- some salts dissolve better; I have found some have a strange medicinal odor to them; some are too fine--almost like a powdery dust, which manages to get everywhere.)</li>
            <li> While moving the package into my bedroom, I noticed little bits of salt sifting out of one of the corners of the box.</li>
            <li> use it in the bath to help relax muscles and detox a little.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but is what it is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wish they would include some little spoon</li>
            <li> Other salts have not done this in the past.</li>
            <li> The package arrived promptly and with a little bonus packet of gourmet cooking salt.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL.....use it with some lavender oil and a little bubble bath.....</li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> Now the whole town thinks that we are crazy bath salts</li>
            <li> And after trying there cold &amp; flu variety last night, I decided to try tonight the regular Epson Salt that they provided to me as a sample for review.  </li>
            <li> After a few days of soaking my foot the pain and swelling subsided and gave me time to schedule an appointment with my Podiatrist.</li>
            <li> the package is so heavy that it takes some thinking and organizational skills to use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If they have one I could not find it, and that is why I went with \\&quot;salt works\\&quot; for my dead sea salt products.</li>
            <li> The bag is heavy but compact.  </li>
            <li> We have the healthiest, green lawn by using the magnesium with turf builder.</li>
            <li> It is shipped in a heavy duty plastic bag</li>
            <li> Salt arrived in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Use a lot of epsom salts and was getting tired of buying a 4 lb bag at the local grocery store once a month.</li>
            <li> few drops of NOW</li>
            <li> company packages the salt in what looks like a custom-type heavy plastic bag with a built-in \\&quot;thing?\\&quot; that prevents moisture from getting trapped in the bag and dissolving the salts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The salt arrived packed in a heavy duty zip lock bag, packed in a card board box.  </li>
            <li> It was heavily scented.</li>
            <li> I had no problems with the bag the product comes in, it is a heavy duty zipper pouch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this brand a few times now and turned a couple of friends onto it as well.</li>
            <li> I will use it in my bath in the evening, leaving the dried salt on my skin.</li>
            <li> I add a few cups to my bath water and soak for 15-20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Heavy,</li>
            <li> They dissolve like a dream and seem to heal my eczema and sore muscles after exercise just as well as the Dead Sea bath salts.</li>
            <li> The bag it comes in is resealable and heavy duty.  </li>
            <li> Has lasted me about 2 months and not even half way done with the bag!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;(OPTIONAL) Leave plain, or use 3-4 drops food coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What a mess!  </li>
            <li> Buying the salt in bulk from SF Salt Co is less expensive than buying it from local pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> This Epsom Salt bag has a thin recloseable seal on the very thick plastic bag, and the salt crystal dissolves completely after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> No more lugging this in from the grocery store every few days.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday in my bath water and the bags in the retail stores are small.  </li>
            <li> Can follow with either raw Shea butter, Vaseline, or Aquaphor.</li>
            <li> A little hard to lift and</li>
            <li> The crystals are rectangular and glistening white with none of the dirty looking flakes I have seen in other Epsom salt.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have a small cup of it in my shower</li>
            <li> Go figure :/</li>
            <li> I use Epsom salt in the bath at least a few times a week</li>
            <li> The baths seem to help relieve a lot of stress (I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of the epsom salt or just because I&#x27;m getting some time with just myself and my thoughts).</li>
            <li> The healing has something to do with magnesium and methylation, and I&#x27;ve read stuff about it, but I am not really able to distill it all here, but it is super-good for humans to do this.  </li>
            <li> check out the small bags of Dr. Teal&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> then I usually do.</li>
            <li> I have small areas of psoriasis on both knees and both elbows.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in a 20lb bag this past summer 2013 for $26.99 and now it is #34.99</li>
            <li> I did not realize how heavy this would be for the size of the bag!</li>
            <li> I always use Epsom salts in my bath, but local pricing has gotten too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Seems like a small thing</li>
            <li> too heavy to bring in my suitcase!</li>
            <li> I was provided a small sample by The San Francisco Bath Salt Co.</li>
            <li> The salt comes in a very heavy duty zip lock bag so no worries about storage.</li>
            <li> Seriously though yo u get a lot for a little in this case.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find even a single scientific paper studying their effect on body pain.</li>
            <li> Reason to Buy This Salt and Take Baths -- slipping into a bath at the end of a long day is such a boring thing to do</li>
            <li> This stuff really helps reduce soreness after especially tough wrestling practices.</li>
            <li> Plus the rest of it was hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> However, this stuff is hard as a rock.  </li>
            <li> I use this product about twice a week after my hard workouts.</li>
            <li> These Epsom salts are literally like none I&#x27;ve ever seen before: they&#x27;re shiny, uniformly-shaped crystals versus the dull, rocky chunks from the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I use it to soak my achy muscle after hard work.</li>
            <li> Had lots of hard chunky pieces in it.  </li>
            <li> and I have a hard time closing the bag.</li>
            <li> Recommend to anyone who works hard.</li>
            <li> The bag seals well and lets air out so that the epsom salt doesn&#x27;t get rock hard.</li>
            <li> The bag can be hard to close as the salt gets into the locking strip .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suffer from the pain and detoxing effects of treatment for chronic late stage Lyme Disease/Fibromyalgia/Chronic Fatigue, etc.</li>
            <li> I take at least one epsom salt bath a week.</li>
            <li> He wasn&#x27;t crazy about how tiny the salt is.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always afraid that if I tip it over it&#x27;s going to make a big</li>
            <li> I take baths regularly (at least 1x/week).</li>
            <li> Toss in a cup of salt and a cup of Backing Soda and soak for at least 20 min.</li>
            <li> The bag it comes in is a thick plastic resealable bag</li>
            <li> Bag made of thick plastic with zip-lock closure.</li>
            <li> Also, the bag is thick plastic and has a ziplock type of closure so you can store the salts in the bag with ease.</li>
            <li> I found ordering in a 20 lb bag with Amazon Prime is less expensive than buying the cartons at the store (plus, delivery to my door).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously, I thought I was just ordering some epsom salt for my yard &amp; garden...</li>
            <li> I am shocked that a company actually listened and did something about my problem so that I can and WILL order from them in the future!!!&lt;br /&gt;BTW</li>
            <li> you use it every other day or so , like you have to during cold months or after workouts -&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> We have dancers in the house, and we use it often to soak sore and tired muscles in the tub.  </li>
            <li> The package was broken when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Soothes tired and achy muscles.</li>
            <li> We used them to make bath salts for gifts and for soaking our tired feet.</li>
            <li> Seriously the toppest notch salt out there!</li>
            <li> Hard water is bad for your hair.</li>
            <li> You can buy ones already premixed but they are expensive.</li>
            <li> in case you are skeptical like me.</li>
            <li> Maybe I opened it wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this from the San Francisco Salt Company in the past and have never been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> maybe that makes them worse!)</li>
            <li> Frustrating!</li>
            <li> and you can’t go wrong with any of their bath salts.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Epsom Salts.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive for my wallet.</li>
            <li> brick of epsom salt and has been extremely difficult to break up.  </li>
            <li> Purchasing it in the drug store or else where is terribly expensive comparatively speaking.  </li>
            <li> I hated having to wait for the epsom salt to dissolve with other brands.</li>
            <li> I was unhappy when I realized the Target brand Epsom salt</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;My search for scientific evidence concerning Epsom salt baths was disappointing.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend thought I was CRAZY when this 20 lb bag of bath salt arrived.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad...</li>
            <li> The pain isn&#x27;t gone when I get out of the tub, but it isn&#x27;t as bad</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to this foot soak.  </li>
            <li> I have painful and debilitating fibromyalgia and 45 minutes before bed, I soak with 2 cups of it for 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was fairly shocked when I got out of the tub and stepped on the pebble and wondered where it came from.  </li>
            <li> At least dont put that on the BOX!!!!</li>
            <li> for how they work: they&#x27;re just as relaxing as the grocery stuff store without the nasty fake fragrance.</li>
            <li> Slightly disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was very inconvenient.</li>
            <li> So, I have abused the crap out of my feet.  </li>
            <li> Helps soothe my skin in the bath when my eczema is bad!</li>
            <li> I am a man, hated baths... until I smelled the hall in front of the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Quite annoying!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> SO AWESOME! Love the large bath. This is permanently in my bathroom for epsom salt baths that I have every other night. I also have a small cup of it in my shower so I can rub it over my body when I need some extra exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Great product great price. This stuff really helps reduce soreness after especially tough wrestling practices. Reduces recovery time noticeably. At this price it&#x27;s reasonably affordable to use a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I take baths nightly to help combat back pain. This works great to help with that. Only complaint is that the bag had a tear and salt was going on my bathroom floor. I was happy to see that the salt wasn&#x27;t stuck together in big clumps like many other brands. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I take hot baths almost daily. The magnesium in the Epsom Salt aids my recovery from recent back surgery. It works.</li>
            <li> Accidentally shipped this to my ex bf as his address was stored on my amazon account. So I never got to use it. But he says he loves it and it brought him good luck. Go figure :/</li>
            <li> Just received my package, was super excited for a nice relaxing soak after a long day but that won&#x27;t be happening. While moving the package into my bedroom, I noticed little bits of salt sifting out of one of the corners of the box. Didn&#x27;t think much of it but upon unboxing and taking out the epsoak package--salt everywhere! All over my carpet, clothes, and hands. A nice day of what I hoped would be dedicated to relaxing has now turned into a fine day of sweeping, vacuuming and meticulously finding every last granule as my freshly crawling baby has a tendency to ingest absolutely anything she can find.</li>
            <li> Great product. Arrived on time</li>
            <li> This has a very relaxing smell to it, and is great for relaxing your tired muscles!  Great for the price, and large amount that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It is okay but doesn&#x27;t work too well in a shaker</li>
            <li> Great, except the little hole in the bag.</li>
            <li> Amazing salts try a bath today so many health benefits</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Great deal!</li>
            <li> Great for homemade bath salts and this large bag can make a lot for giving to friends.</li>
            <li> As a massage therapist this product offers great value! You cant beat the price for the amount of Salts you get (almost 20lbs)</li>
            <li> I use Epsom in my bath once a week and was very happy to find it so affordable. Great product it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Epsom Salt!! It&#x27;s great for taking the soreness out, having a spa night, their very multipurpose.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a new way of using epsom salt, here it is. (If you love purex crystals, or downy beads, you&#x27;ll LOVE this)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a 4 pound bag of epsom salt.&lt;br /&gt;2 Table spoons of skin safe essential oils&lt;br /&gt;(OPTIONAL) Leave plain, or use 3-4 drops food coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix well, leave out to dry for about 2-3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;After complete, put in an air tight container.&lt;br /&gt;Use 1/8 cup on medium loads of laundry.&lt;br /&gt;You can just add them right in with your detergent.&lt;br /&gt;It softens hard water, and makes your clothes smell amazing!</li>
            <li> I used this salt as snow in my wedding centerpieces - very economical!</li>
            <li> These Epsoak Epsom salts are great! I learned about Epsom salts 50 years ago from my great grandma who used to soak in them nightly. At the time I thought, &#x27;Yeah, right. Old fashioned.&#x27; But since buying some for myself I see her point. They are scent-free, coarse but dissolve easily and quickly, and leave my skin soft and exfoliated. I highly recommend them. San Francisco Salt Company is a company that is dedicated to customer satisfaction and does what they say they&#x27;ll do when they say they&#x27;ll do it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful quality epsom salt in a HUGE bag!</li>
            <li> Great value for money. I use Epsom salt in the bath at least a few times a week and it&#x27;s a great way to relax the muscles. Really wish they had options for different fragrances though as I also find that a therapeutic experience. Will certainly re-order again in future.</li>
            <li> Great price, works well for baths to absorb magnesium. I put 2 cups in my large bath with some lavender oil before bed, and I sleep like a baby. Great for foot baths as well. Fabulous price</li>
            <li> Good deal for buying Epsom Salts in bulk.  Much cheaper than my local pharmacy.  It&#x27;s too bad... this is why local Mom and Pops are going out of business... but I&#x27;m just not going to spend so much more than I have too for an American made product.  Made in China would be another story.  I will always and GLADLY pay more for made in USA.</li>
            <li> This is a much cheaper way of buying Epsom salts if you use much of it.  It comes in a re-sealable bag so it stays fresh.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price.  I take a bath almost every night using 2 cups of Epsoak. It really helps with aches and pains, and it also helps keep my skin clear of eczema, with which I have struggled since childhood.  I have reordered this product many times because it is much more economical to buy in bulk than to buy the smaller packages at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy epsom salt at the drugstore or grocery store ever again! This is a much more affordable way to buy it. Quick deleivery too.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Arrived fast works great</li>
            <li> The Epsom Salts are great - packaged very nicely - The company has many other products I plan to try including the cooking salts.</li>
            <li> I have a osteoporosis arthritis knees and many sore muscles.  I soak 12-15 min 3 times a week with 1 cup of Epsom salt and I can tell the difference when I don&#x27;t.  The pain isn&#x27;t gone when I get out of the tub, but it isn&#x27;t as bad and it is very relaxing and helps me sleep.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and value.  I transitioned from using lavender infused to this with lavender essential oils, tremendous savings.</li>
            <li> I can really feel the difference. I emerge from my bath more relaxed, less achey, and my skin feels softer. My soaps and cleansers seem to work more effectively when I had epson salt in the water, than without. I have only been using it for about a week, but I really like it. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. My back acne seems to be improving too.</li>
            <li> package received on time with no damage, the price is good for the quantity. it&#x27;s actually working for releasing aching muscles problems like it said</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, and its really cheap too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I like mixing this with Village Naturals therapy bath salt. It gives the bath a bit more kick.</li>
            <li> really helps to relax and clear you</li>
            <li> I ordered the 19.75 pound bag of these Epsom salts to make Foot/bath soaks for Christmas gifts. I haven&#x27;t found a better deal on Epsom salts in bulk. These are great quality and my gift receivers have complimented me on how much they loved the Epsom salt mix.</li>
            <li> I make my own bath salts with essential oils. You can buy ones already premixed but they are expensive. With this size, it&#x27;s extremely cost effective.</li>
            <li> good value.  Making some bath salts for the spouse myself.</li>
            <li> take bathes with 1 cup of salts. helps with daily stress</li>
            <li> Hot bath with Epsom salt really does work for sore muscles in the tub. Also great fertilizer for the conifer trees, mainly blue spruce, in the spring. Good price for a multi-purpose product. Like the nice big bag. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This Epsom Salt bag has a thin recloseable seal on the very thick plastic bag, and the salt crystal dissolves completely after a few minutes.  I used 2 cups and sprinkled it under very warm water as soon as there was a couple of inches in the tub.  I also added a few drops of sweet orange essential oil to enjoy a fragrant and relaxing soak.  I love how soft my skin feels after taking Epsom salt baths.  It does help give relief from fibromyalgia muscle pain, and the warm water helps a lot.  I enjoy experimenting with various essential oils to add to my Epson Salt bath treatments so I prefer unscented Epsom salt. I greatly appreciate the convenience of door-to-door delivery with this heavy bag and the savings is incredible buying it in bulk size like this!  I have a very tiny bathroom, but it fits just fine next to the tub. Great product and convenient size and delivery!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED: 5/30/15  Just received my second bag and I love, love, love the new packaging style because it not only looks sleek, it now has a Double sealing/closing strip that is much improved!  The bag is more tightly compressed, too.  Same great quality, even better on sale!  lol  I&#x27;ve changed this from 4 stars to 5 stars now.&lt;br /&gt;Updated 12/7/15:  Still wonderful to have this delivered right to my front door!  I go through a bag of these about every 2 months, although I don&#x27;t bother to update my review each time, since Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow for multiple &amp;#34;recent&amp;#34; reviews.  Highly recommended product!</li>
            <li> It really is 19.75 lbs of Epsom salts...in case you are skeptical like me. They work great will definitely be buying these again you really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Sturdy packaging, no leaking, fine texture and quality salts. Good value, would definitely order again&lt;br /&gt;when making bath products for gifts.</li>
            <li> Great stuff..all of their bath salts...luxury becomes affordable.</li>
            <li> I love this economical pack of epsom salt - minus one star ONLY because it doesn&#x27;t seem resealable. Maybe I opened it wrong. :) This is definitely on my &amp;#34;purchase again&amp;#34; list!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Edit update 25 Jul 16: bumped up to 5 stars from 4 because they offered a replacement bag. Thank you for the thought!]</li>
            <li> I have previously used this salt and I liked it. This time, there was multiple holes in the plastic bag, literally 5-6 dime sized round holes. When my husband took bag out from the box, part of the salt leaked all over the box and the floor. Plus the rest of it was hard as a rock. With hammers we broke it down to sakt form again. It was very inconvenient. Returning such a large bag is pain in the neck anyways, so we didn&#x27;t even consider that option.</li>
            <li> Great price for a simple (and heavy!) product!  Glad that it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance like the brand at my local Walgreens does.  Fragrance is pretty toxic stuff (despite the innocuous sounding name).</li>
            <li> Magnesium is great for relaxing and dilating the blood vessels--therefore reducing blood pressure and heart rate.  Putting this in a bath and soaking in it for 20 minutes is an easy way to absorb some.</li>
            <li> I found myself very sensitive to this product.  Epsom salts from the store did not bring me any major reactions like this product did.</li>
            <li> Great great value for the price. Bag is resealable and watertight so it can be kept right next to the tub. Seriously though yo u get a lot for a little in this case.</li>
            <li> Good quality product.  Good, sturdy plastic zipper bag.  I&#x27;ve never actually managed to reseal it after opening; the salt kind of slumps and makes the opening wide.  Maybe one of those plastic zipper pulls would help?  But it isn&#x27;t a big enough problem for me to mark it down for it.  I just store it where stuff (like water!) won&#x27;t fall in.  In moderate humidity, it stays loose/not clumped a long time.&lt;br /&gt;For me, one really good feature is that there is no fragrance.  In searching for epsom salt, I found product after product with fragrance - which is a big problem for me, since I&#x27;m sensitive to it.  The plastic bag is also not very fragrant when it comes (unless shipped in a box with something fragrant), so it can be stored in my bathroom right away.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the bath to help relax muscles and detox a little.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if it really helps with my soreness, but it&#x27;s a good price and it dissolves well under hot water.</li>
            <li> Incredibly priced, high quality epsom salts DELIVERED TO MY DOOR!  Love a soak after a stressful day at the job!</li>
            <li> I take a lot of epsom salts soaks during marathon training, so I thought a 20-lb bag would be a smart investment. It was nice to not have to constantly purchase smaller bags, but this big bag was a pain to store. It also got punctured somewhere along the way, so I had salt trickling out here and there throughout the time I used it. I think it&#x27;s great quality epsom salt (a finer grain, easier to dissolve). This was a good economical purchase, but the big bag turned out to be kind of a pain in the long run.</li>
            <li> I have found when I am achy or can&#x27;t sleep. Just take a bath with the epsom salts and night night.</li>
            <li> BEST epsom salt I have ever used and trust me I have used a lot of them.  This ES dissolves so nicely and doesnt leave any wax in my tub.  This is top quality epsom salt, get it and you too will notice the difference from others. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> In the Shower:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a wash cloth and your choice of soap, add 1 tablespoon of San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s Epsoak Epsom Salt. Lather up the wash cloth, add a tablespoon of salt , mix with water..Use it everywhere you normally would. Rinse wash cloth and repeat several times. Many ole timers and disabled who are unable to get in and out of the tub will benefit from this procedure..You will be super clean and feel fantastic..What say you?</li>
            <li> A little pricey but is what it is.</li>
            <li> Such a great deal! Great shipping! Great product! I love using this. There are awesome healing waters receipes online that I use. Long lasting product and storage bag!</li>
            <li> Great product from a fabulous seller.  I&#x27;ve ordered this from the San Francisco Salt Company in the past and have never been disappointed.  The quality is fantastic and is always delivered on time.  Looking forward to seeing what else the San Francisco Salt Company has to offer!</li>
            <li> The SEpsom Salt from the San Francisco Salt Company is a great product to help you relax. The packaging on all of San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s products looks great, which makes it a great gift. I have used there products before and have always enjoyed them. I am glad I have this product and would definitely recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation.</li>
            <li> This epsom salt makes a very relaxing bath salt! I think it might be the best bath salt on the market AND it comes in bulk RIGHT TO MY DOOR!</li>
            <li> The product came in a cheap bag, even after letting air out through a vacuum seal moisture still got in which made some of the salt clump together.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality salts.</li>
            <li> These are great-and the most affordable salts per pound I&#x27;ve encountered. The bag could seal easier. Combine with mineral salts and essential oils to create very cheap custom versions of normally expensive bath salts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 cup epsom&lt;br /&gt;1 cup mineral salts&lt;br /&gt;2 to 3 ml essential oils</li>
            <li> It is the pricing that deserves the positive review.</li>
            <li> After a hard days work I always look forward to a warm relaxing Epsom salt bath and feel so relaxed afterwards!!  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Good quality salts and good sturdy packaging with zip top.</li>
            <li> I loves me some epsom salt baths! Might as well buy in bulk since you&#x27;re supposed to use 1-2 cups per bath. Add some lavender oil for relaxation or a citrus or geranium oil for revitalization.</li>
            <li> great product I used 20lbs on my palm trees and they all greened up,and I soaked in a nice bath to get rid of my pains</li>
            <li> The large bag is economical and useful.  Will definitely buy again.  Shipping was very quick!</li>
            <li> product is excellent quality makes your feel relaxed when you soak in bath. you get a lot for the price better than what you can get at a drug store. I would suggest when buying epson salts get it in bulk so you dont have to go out and buy it. it will always be on hand when you need it.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality, non toxic  alternative to the products sold in stores with &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; added.  I was looking for pure Epsom salts, and I&#x27;ve found it!  The large size is nice, too.  Since I use it daily in my bath, it easily lasted me a month.&lt;br /&gt;Basically $1/day for relaxation!</li>
            <li> Awesome product, used it last night for a bath. The salt comes in a clear, resealable bag. They also sent a free gift of bath salts with my order. Wonderful product and wonderfully low price. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Thank you!</li>
            <li> why not buy the best in bulk and get a better price? i like to take detox baths and the stuff in drugstores is the same price for a couple baths. plus perfumes and over packaged</li>
            <li> very good quality very pure..&lt;br /&gt;fun for weekend science project ...&lt;br /&gt;What is lifted when to take a bath...&lt;br /&gt;fun product to play with ..&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> I have purchased several bags of this salt over the years.  The fragrance is very mild, but soothing.  At the time of my purchase, pricing was competitive with Target.</li>
            <li> Big bag of luscious salts!! Great value and great product. Was told to use epsom salt soaks for healing a sprained knee by my massage therapist, and it&#x27;s worked VERY well. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Epsoak epsom salt works great for epsom salt baths; I take baths with hot water (as hot as I can get it) and about two cups of the epsom salt. The baths seem to help relieve a lot of stress (I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of the epsom salt or just because I&#x27;m getting some time with just myself and my thoughts). The epsom salts definitely help with relieving achy muscles.</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality, dissolves fast and will always be part of our household. Epsom Salt + your own added essential oil always makes for a wonderful bath time. I use Coconut Oil afterwards to keep my skin hydrated and that is all I allow to come close to my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works well on canine&#x27;s with yest infections for a topical treatment in combination with Apple cider vinegar and Kefir for internal use.</li>
            <li> Excellent therapy aid for arithic and rheumatologic conditions.</li>
            <li> Not sure I can tell if it helps my back pain (I usually take baths once in a while) but packaging and everything is good.</li>
            <li> as stated with good service</li>
            <li> I have been ordering this brand for about a year now and it&#x27;s the best. I have painful and debilitating fibromyalgia and 45 minutes before bed, I soak with 2 cups of it for 15-20 minutes. The muscles become very relaxed and I sleep much better.</li>
            <li> This is a great value and excellent product, helps with dry cracking winter skin. I have ordered it three times.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for a huge bag of Epsom Salt! I try to always keep some Epsom Salt around just in case it is needed. This time I needed it to treat an infected ingrown toenail that was driving me nuts. After a few days of soaking my foot the pain and swelling subsided and gave me time to schedule an appointment with my Podiatrist. Epsom Salt is also fantastic for soaking your body when you have sore muscles from a hard workout. I have been using it since my days playing High School football and it still works wonders for aches and pains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bag is definitely a lot bigger than I imagined. I am glad to know that this bag will last for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy, and I make up my own bath soaks by adding essential oils.  Can&#x27;t beat it for those days you need a nice relaxing soak........</li>
            <li> what can I say? It is epsom salt</li>
            <li> I have a lot of issues with back and muscle pain.  Soaking in an epsom salt bath along with some essential oils and it helps to ease the pain and tension away.</li>
            <li> Good quality salt. Works great in baths.</li>
            <li> I love the size that was available. We use them for our plants to Green them up, especially our palms.  So it&#x27;s very nice that it&#x27;s resealable</li>
            <li> Was surprised when I received a 20 pound brick chunk of Epsom salt</li>
            <li> I have arthritis, and have to soak nightly for the pains in order to get to sleep this epsom slats is great quality and large bag keeps me from having to have all those little boxes setting around. the bag is very pleasing to the eye so I don&#x27;t have to hide it, it sets right there ready to use for my bath, next to the tub.  Than you for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for a great product!  The salt dissolves easily and makes for a nice relaxing bath time.</li>
            <li> This bag is huge and really good value for the price.</li>
            <li> The older I get, the more I appreciate this product in a really hot bath tub...</li>
            <li> Great product. If you haven&#x27;t tried Epson Salts to soothe dry itchy skin you are missing out. I was using topical steriods to calm my itchy skin and after awhile it stopped working. I just switched over to Epson salts and so far the results are great.</li>
            <li> After being hospitalized for Ulcerative Colitis last August 2014, I learned that I can heal myself with Epsom Salt Baths.  The healing has something to do with magnesium and methylation, and I&#x27;ve read stuff about it, but I am not really able to distill it all here, but it is super-good for humans to do this.  Of course it isn&#x27;t the only way to heal, but it helps tremendously.  So I started taking these baths last summer, and now, a year later, I am Superwoman!  Well, maybe not, but I am healed.  I am doing well.  I still take a nightly bath, and I love it.  And this EPSOAK EPSOM SALT is the best of all I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;First -- best price anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Second -- great salt that doesn&#x27;t clump too much (occasionally under extreme humidity, but not usually, which is important)&lt;br /&gt;Third -- the bag is awesome, thick, doesn&#x27;t tear, recluses with ease, and is liftable and movable&lt;br /&gt;Fourth -- it is so good for you -- anyone and everyone should take a salt bath before bed every night or almost every night if possible -- it helps you sleep!  It helps you detox!  It helps you live in a culture that is all about fast fast fast worry worry!  And I, for one, am so done with that!&lt;br /&gt;Fifth Reason to Buy This Salt and Take Baths -- slipping into a bath at the end of a long day is such a boring thing to do even your children will ignore you!&lt;br /&gt;Six -- helps you catch up on reading or sudoku (I do not recommend knitting in the bath or using electronic devices)&lt;br /&gt;Seven -- it just feels great! Do it!&lt;br /&gt;AND it lasts me a month, and this way -- I mean buying it this way from these people, and they seem very nice, btw, I am not constantly running out.  so it makes my shopping easier.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and price.  I soak regularly as part of Detox protocol for Lyme disease.</li>
            <li> Easier than hauling it home from the store. Great product if you go through a lot like using it in baths.</li>
            <li> We would love to suggest using a hemp bag for packaging as plastic is toxic and we have cut enough trees down on this planet!</li>
            <li> Great bargain, good packaging.</li>
            <li> We like the salt it self, but&lt;br /&gt;we also like the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to handle for such a large size.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the quantity of this package and Amazon&#x27;s super fast delivery.  However, this stuff is hard as a rock.  I began running my bath water and cut open the bag and had my cup ready to measure out two cups thinking I could just pour it out of the bag.  Oh my goodness, this stuff was a solid  piece of rock hard epsom salt!  Ran into the kitchen in search of an ice pick.  Couldn&#x27;t find one so I grabbed some scissors and proceeded to stab into the stuff to try to break off a chunk.  I got a large piece loose that looked to be about the size of a cup and chucked it into my bath.  On a positive note, it dissolved quickly.  At least I know now that I will have to plan ahead and break a chunk off of the boulder before the bath has filled with water.  I am unable to give it five stars because unless you have a chisel handy you may not be able to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I was contacted by the San Francisco Salt Company and I have to commend them on their fabulous customer service.  This is a company that values it&#x27;s customers.  I see no reason to ever buy epsom salts from anywhere else.  You now have a loyal customer and I would definitely recommend to friends and family!  Thanks much!</li>
            <li> A Big Bang for your buck. Nothing bad to say. It&#x27;s a big bag of salt and lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> LOVE this epson salt. Have reordered it numerous times. I just keep a large apothecary jar of it next to my soaking tub. The crystals are bigger than the epson salt you find at the drug store....more like a sanding sugar for cookies. Also is such a great price; you can&#x27;t go wrong. Love the large bag so your not always going to the store to buy more.</li>
            <li> I received it and it is an excellent product</li>
            <li> good deal and the packaging is much better looking than that in the picture (very minor plus). Not witchcraft - I have TMJ / chronically sore muscles due to stress / the medication I take. This + hot bath &amp;#62; hot bath alone for achieving some alleviation.</li>
            <li> I regularly use this salt for my bath.  It&#x27;s a great price especially if you have Amazon Prime membership.  I will definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> Bag came ripped open and spilled over the other items in my order.  I had to repair the package before I could even move it because it would have kept spilling all over my house.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using different brands of epsom salts for years (mainly for a full-body, muscle-ache soak). I tried this last night for the first time, because my muscles REALLY ached. I soaked for 30 minutes, &amp; couldn&#x27;t believe how much better I felt! The soarness in my body had released almost completely. I&#x27;m a new fan of this brand, &amp; consider it to be the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It also dissolves almost immediately when it&#x27;s in warm water. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It is great to have as much epsom salt as I want ready to add to a hot tub and soak my sore muscles, I will be getting this again that is for sure.</li>
            <li> ... take an epsoak, soak. I&#x27;m a massage therapist, LOVE it! and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great salt, but the package is so heavy that it takes some thinking and organizational skills to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would include some little spoon inside.&lt;br /&gt;I use my own cup and keep it inside.&lt;br /&gt;I buy it because of the quality of the salt and because of the reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;If you use it every other day or so , like you have to during cold months or after workouts -&lt;br /&gt;the price becomes an issue.&lt;br /&gt;they are doing good on the price, need to rethink the convenience though.</li>
            <li> Before trying this product, I always purchased Epsom salt at the dollar store...never again!!! This salt is great quality, no clumping. I like having a big bag.</li>
            <li> Bought this for making a detox bath. It seems to dissolve much better than other salts I have tried. Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
            <li> I will reorder this again. I initially thought it was too big but find I am using it at a pretty good pace.&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I use this product about twice a week after my hard workouts. It really helps my muscles to relax. I will be getting htis product again once this HUGE bag gets empty! lol</li>
            <li> I ordered 20lbs for $23.90, WHAT A DEAL! It came super fast (4 days) and the bag the salt comes in has a good re-sealable top for storage. I use at least 1-2 cups of Epsom salt per tub of water and it dissolves completely in about 1-2 minutes. The first night I soaked for half an hour just before bed and when I woke the next morning I felt more rested than I had all week. I will be ordering again when my supply is diminished.</li>
            <li> The San Franciso Salt Company makes a variety of fragrant bath salts, and I adore their lavender, which is made with sea salt. I was quite intrigued to see how their &#x27;Epsoak&#x27; Bpsom Salt bath salt compared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I&#x27;ll note is that while the lavender comes in a pretty, fold-over-top plastic container, the Epsom Salt comes in essence in a clear baggie with a ziplock closure. Not a big deal, but a little less like a &amp;#34;spa experience&amp;#34;. It has no aroma at all - its ingredients are solely epsom salt / magnesium sulfate. If you are sensitive to scents this could be a good thing. If you enjoy fragrance in your bath it means you&#x27;ll have to add something to this to get the experience you crave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salts &amp;#34;cake up&amp;#34; fairly quickly even when sealed. They need to be bashed to loosen them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My big question, though, is what is epsom salt vs sea salt. Most of us know about the wonders of sea salt - how people adore sea salt soaks because it helps our skin be soft and healthy. The water feels softer and more relaxing. Is the same true for magnesium sulfate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intriguingly, in the research I&#x27;ve done, I can&#x27;t find how having salt on the outside of your skin has any effect at all on your muscles within the skin. Your skin exists to keep objects out of your body. The salt content outside might impact that outer layer of skin to soften it - but it doesn&#x27;t somehow permeate the skin barrier and then move in a targeted fashion to the muscles. When I do research on baths I do find information, for example, about oatmeal baths helping with poison ivy. I&#x27;ve had poison ivy many times and can vouch for it helping. But I can&#x27;t find any research that indicates salts in the bath water get into your muscles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently the skin DOES let in some fats - and this is how researchers create things like the nicotine patch which lets chemicals in through your skin in a controlled fashion. But I can&#x27;t find that salts can pass through. In fact there&#x27;s apparently a study on this very topic - look on the NIH website for PMID 19216298 - and they found the magnesium sulfate did NOT get through the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in terms of these epsom salts being better or worse than other epsom salts, I&#x27;ll give it a 4/5. It&#x27;s nice and simple, no artificial additives, and I&#x27;m sure those with fragrance sensitivities will appreciate that. But in the larger question of whether buying ANY epsom salts are worth it - I highly suggest you do some research. Yes, soaking in hot water helps relax muscles which is a good thing. But I&#x27;m not finding that adding any salts into the water make a difference. It&#x27;s not somehow making the bath water &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; at soaking those muscles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m open to hearing from people who have found other research, that having magnesium sulfate in your blood system is a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a review bag of these salts in order to provide an honest review..

            <li> Awesome product.  Have used it for rough feet, hornet stings, infections.  Works every time.</li>
            <li> Good quality, great price.</li>
            <li> This was shipped to us quickly, and it&#x27;s a great product.  We have dancers in the house, and we use it often to soak sore and tired muscles in the tub.  The large bag is perfect for us.</li>
            <li> Wonderful deal for the amount of salt you get.</li>
            <li> Epsom salts ARE really good for improving your magnesium levels since the best way to absorb it is topically.  However, you can purchase epsom salt at your local Costco at $8 or $9 for 12 pounds ---less than $1.00 a pound.</li>
            <li> Is soak in a tub of Epsom salts.  Good for your skin, muscles, joints, and, soul.  Put a cup or two in your bath, and, enjoy some quiet time.  You will be buying more of this!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great - I get lower back pain, and using this in a hot bath before bed really helps.. it definitely relaxes your muscles.  It doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor to it at all.  This same company produces a dead sea salt as well which makes your skin feel really good (but doesn&#x27;t do much for relaxing my muscles as this epsom does).</li>
            <li> Excellent Product as I am on my 3rd bag now. Will always buy this Brand. Large bag is heavy duty without any breakage problems.</li>
            <li> Large bag has zip lock for easy resealing between uses. I use 2 cups in my bath with 1/2 cup of baking soda and 10 drops of lavender oil as a stress relieving bath in my claw foot tub as hot as I can take it. Make sure you hydrate with drinking water as the Epsom salts can draw water out of your body. Less clumps than I had with other brands.</li>
            <li> Great product I order it all the time.</li>
            <li> I love this Epsom Salt.  The grains are fine and it dissolves quickly in water.  I take baths 3-4 nights per week and add about 2 cups o these epsom salts &amp; about 1 cup of baking soda.  It helps me sleep and relax.  Others recommend buying Safe Step (ice de-melter) to add Magnesium to your bath.  It is cheaper that way, but I really prefer these fine grains.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected - great for everything from weed killing to soaking.</li>
            <li> My only regret is i wish i had more and didn&#x27;t have to pay for more. It really seems to make my feet feel better.</li>
            <li> This is a great high-quality product at a very reasonable price. I used to be an occasional user of bath salts. When I was diagnosed with a health condition it became a way of life. It is a very pleasant way to help support my immune system and it relaxes too. A winning combination. The product is very clean. I have ordered this several times now and the quality has always been high. Soaking in Epsom salt is a great was to boost your magnesium level. Most people do not get enough magnesium in their diet. Magnesium helps you absorb other nutrients, it relaxes your muscles and promotes clear skin. It also promotes regularity and helps if you are constipated. It put and end to my nightly leg and foot cramps. Soaking in Epsom helps prevent and relieve sourness from athletic actives. I highly recommend Epsoak from San Francisco Salt Company.</li>
            <li> We are a big fan of epsom salt baths in our house! My husband and I both add epsom salt to every bath. It is a great addition to essential oils and baking soda. Great for detox baths and achy muscles. This was the best price I could find for the quality.</li>
            <li> I use this to mix with my hard water to make it soft. Hard water is bad for your hair. My hair has improved greatly since switching to washing it only with soft water. I also add it to my toddlers bath water. This is the best value I have found so far, and I also use the brand&#x27;s pink Himalayan salt for cooking/ seasoning. I would recommend this product and will continue ordering a bag every other months.</li>
            <li> I am an avid epsom salt soaker, and I absolutely love this product. The salts are clean and pure. I also like to feed them to my roses during bloom. My 5-year-old started developing a minor tic and we nipped it in the bud with epsom salt soaks!! (pretty much everyone is deficient in mg nowadays). Mg is so important for your muscles and almost everywhere else in your body! GREAT PRODUCT, will order again!</li>
            <li> I was unhappy when I realized the Target brand Epsom salt I&#x27;d been bathing my toddler in was full of chemicals, fragrance and other stuff I didn&#x27;t want.  This brand is just Epsom salt. And it&#x27;s way more cost effective than anything else I&#x27;ve seen.  Really big bag for under $20.  Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this Epsom salt many times. It is a good quality and size with great clarity and really helps the soreness in my muscles after a tense workout. The value per pound of this bag far surpasses any tiny drugstore box I&#x27;ve found. It just makes bath time much more relaxing, especially when combined with a drop or two of essential oil. I add eucalyptus for extra muscle relief or lavender to lull into a restful nights sleep.</li>
            <li> Awesome amount for the price.</li>
            <li> I take an epsom salt bath almost every other night and it feels great and this is a good price for the quantity.</li>
            <li> Great price. We use Epsom salt nightly in our baths.</li>
            <li> LOVE these epsom salts. The shipping was fast (with Prime) and the salts were well packaged. I love epsom salt baths after working out or in the middle of winter, and this is a great package of high quality salts!</li>
            <li> Use this every night.  Great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if Epsom salts work, to be honest. My husband says they don&#x27;t, other people swear they do. So my review is really just focused on the value of this product, which is AMAZING. This is the best price I have found to have Epsom salts shipped to me. The packaging held up through shipping and the design of the package allows for easy storage.</li>
            <li> I compete in powerlifting.  I use two cups of this every single day and it lasts me about a month.  Without it I&#x27;d be a beat up wreck.  I&#x27;m amazed that San Francisco hasn&#x27;t pushed out all but the largest corporations.  I thought any company with a brain would&#x27;ve already moved to Nevada or TX.  But nope, these guys are here and they&#x27;re great.  And the packaging even has a one way valve that allows you to push air out.  My only tip for them is to please switch to packaging that is easier to re-seal.  Tip:  check out the small bags of Dr. Teal&#x27;s.  The ziploc part works the first time every time.</li>
            <li> Just be aware that the bag really is 20 lbs (its heavy). ALso, you will probably want some sort of measuring cup, as it doesn&#x27;t come with anything to help you portion out the salt. You can save a lot of $$$ and get great use out of it though if you work it right. I had a really great PT who recommended epsom to me, not sure if it works, but he seemed very hot on it and he was very well-regarded (worked with pro athletes et al).</li>
            <li> I love this product and getting it from San Francisco Salt Co. Great for soaking injuries or nightly. I keep an 8 oz scoop in mine and put 2 in every evening. As a busy full time yoga teacher, a luxurious soak at the end of the day is key to waking up bright eyed and bushy tailed, ready to myself and my clients on the mat. Thanks Epsoak and SFSC!</li>
            <li> I went to the web site to find a certificate of authenticity saying they use zero caking agents.  If they have one I could not find it, and that is why I went with \\&quot;salt works\\&quot; for my dead sea salt products. \\&quot;Salt works\\&quot; and others clearly state what is and is not in every salt product they sell (as well as country of origin)  Others seem to rave about it but, Its not my favorite brand for personal use. I got it on sale, odds are its going in flower beds.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product.  I buy this regularly, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This comes in a resealable plastic bag which makes the storage easy.I bought it from the vendor&#x27;s website,where it was 10 bucks cheaper.They sent it next day by priority mail.Overall,very pleased with the company and quality of the product.I bought it to mix it with my fertilizer and use it in my spreader,for the lawn.It does work magic to the grass.Makes it greener and healthier.So a definite must for the lawn everyone envies.</li>
            <li> I am so grateful I found this. What a great deal! I keep it next to my bathtub and scoop it in by the handful. Its the same stuff you buy at the store, but WAY cheaper per pound. Do the math. I do have an amazon prime account, so it ships for free. Not sure how much shipping is without it, or how cost effective it would be. There are numerous health benefits to epsom salts, google it. I notice when I take a bath with them before bed I feel tired much more quickly then I usually do.</li>
            <li> MgSO4-7H2O is the stuff. the 20lb bag is a great deal, compared to what you&#x27;re paying in the local supermarket.</li>
            <li> Epsom salt baths (in combination with baking soda and essential oils) have been a lifesaver for me at the end of the day to help with aches and sore joints.  It has also been shown to help replace magnesium which most of us are deficient in.  I&#x27;m so happy to have found such a good sized bag at a great price.</li>
            <li> great for relaxing in a hot bath, or for soaking feet. Bulk packaging makes for a good buy without running to drug store and paying 3 times as much.</li>
            <li> Amazing that you get 20lbs of salt for this price. It works well and has no odor at all. Personally, I use it in the jacuzzi to help alleviate muscle pain etc... Probably not a bad idea to get some oils if you are looking for an aroma.</li>
            <li> this bag of salt is heavy at 20 pounds but it should last a while. The crystals are about the same size as any other epsom salt and there is no scent to it.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best value. The bag is huge!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best! We love it. We use it every night in our boys bath for growing pains. I use it to soak my feet in. I will buy it over and over.</li>
            <li> Seriously the toppest notch salt out there! Great for bath for big bearded men!</li>
            <li> quick delivery, great price.  Love it.</li>
            <li> The crystals are large but dissolve easily. My son gets a kick out of pouring the right amount in the tub every night. He is on the spectrum and I will say this seems to relax him quite nicely - I would say more so then just a regular warm bath. I wish the bag had handles but as far as the product is concerned I give it 5 stars. I use it for daily aches and pains and I really believe it helps! The price is so much better than anything in the drug stores too.</li>
            <li> It is a great deal for the amount of epsom salt you get. Has lasted me about 2 months and not even half way done with the bag!</li>
            <li> I have small areas of psoriasis on both knees and both elbows. Nightly soaks in the tub do wonders to help with the itching and scales, and such soaks also help dramatically with my arthritis pain. I&#x27;d been buying epsom salts from the grocery store, but they&#x27;ve started selling only scented stuff and I don&#x27;t like the scents they choose. (Who wants to smell like a candy cane? Or an old lady&#x27;s underwear drawer?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d bought some Dead Sea salts via Amazon in the past and they were okay but definitely overpriced. When I saw this, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. These Epsom salts are literally like none I&#x27;ve ever seen before: they&#x27;re shiny, uniformly-shaped crystals versus the dull, rocky chunks from the grocery store. I don&#x27;t know why, and I don&#x27;t know how they do that, but they&#x27;re certainly pretty in the huge apothecary jar next to the tub where I keep them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how they work: they&#x27;re just as relaxing as the grocery stuff store without the nasty fake fragrance. These seem to almost be a bit effervescent, although that might be my imagination. I like them. I&#x27;ve ordered them twice. I wish they had a Subscribe &amp; Save option because, as someone who uses 2 cups in her bath every. single. night., I&#x27;d certainly sign up for it.</li>
            <li> I take a lot of detox baths and you cannot beat this value. It is high quality and really help to dilate the cells to clean the, out. Also a great muscle relaxer. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s what we need it .</li>
            <li> 20 pounds of epsom salt in a resealable bag? YES! This is pretty much perfect. The salt is great, and the packaging makes it ideal for home use. I just have to put the salt in a smaller container for daily use though.</li>
            <li> I order this regularly, as it is the best value that I have found for epsom salts. I add aromotherapy oil to my bath, and have the benefits of scented salts without the cost, and can choose the oil that I want for a given mood.</li>
            <li> After two broken ribs, I decided I needed to pay more attention to my bones.  Once or twice a week, I take an Epsom salt bath to raise my magnesium (and sulfate) levels.  It takes a bit of getting used to--the first time I did it, my heart starting beating like crazy!--but an excellent way to get healthy and to reduce stress a bit (relaxing in a long, hot bath).</li>
            <li> I have orderer this several times and all has gone smoothly.  The bag sits solidly under my bathroom sink and I then scoop out 2 cups for my bath.  Works well to relax my sore muscles.</li>
            <li> Great! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> This was a good buy for a fair price. I use it to soak my achy muscle after hard work. It helps...</li>
            <li> Great product from a great company.</li>
            <li> You can find so many reasons to order Epsom salt, it&#x27;s unbelievable. However, at 25 years of age, and after 12+ years of not knowing I was allergic to dairy, or grains I spent a lot of time on the pot pushing and grunting which lead to a prolapse rectum. After a lovely and painful surgery called a hemorrhoid-ectomy with a pull through. (they go up in your bo-bo and cut out about 2 inches of skin then stable it to the bottom of your butt) I wasn&#x27;t pushing and prolapsing anyome, on the down side, if I do exurt myself too much there&#x27;s some pain now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throw a cup of this into a nice hot bubble bath, add a glass of wine and you got yourself relaxation and relief that no medicine can come close to, and I know since I&#x27;m prescribed the highest they can give you without you passing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a lighter note, when I was bathing 3 times a day in recovery this gave me the smoothest skin you could imagine, so ladies, bathe twice a day in this stuff and you&#x27;ll not have to use any other creams or lotions to get that smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased three times and won&#x27;t buy anywhere else.  It&#x27;s a great deal, quality product, and arrives quickly. I&#x27;ve had nothing but positive experiences.</li>
            <li> I buy this to make my homemade bath salt with essential oils.  We use a lot of this and I will be reordering soon.</li>
            <li> This may sound crazy to some folks but if you look it up online you will see that Epsom salts make a great plant food/fertilizer (and an inexpensive but effective one).  I love being natural and knowing what I am using and having a great inexpensive way to feed the plants.  It seems to work on veggies as well as flowering plants.  I have had a lot of problems with slugs this year (we have an unusually hot and dry summer--maybe that makes them worse!) and they have turned hostas into lace eating them to smithereens.  I just recently got to thinking if I use the Epsom salts under the hostas not only will they be fed but the higher salt in the dirt might discourage slug traffic.  Guess I&#x27;ll know soon!  There are so many poor products or harsh products on the market with warnings all over.  I wonder at using them safely.  But with this solution (no pun intended!) I can feed easily and safely and the plants seem to love it (if you don&#x27;t look it up it is a simple 1 tablespoon to a gallon of water ratio).  Try it out!!  Thanks, guys, for another great buy to save me $$ and time shopping around and I get exactly what I want quickly and easily (and speaking of savings I&#x27;m saving gas to drive to another store!)</li>
            <li> Very good price for bulk Epsom Salts.  The bag is heavy but compact.  The crystals are somewhat large and it takes some swishing to get them to dissolve in the tub but they all do dissolve eventually.  These are not for internal use.</li>
            <li> We have the healthiest, green lawn by using the magnesium with turf builder.</li>
            <li> Just regular epsom salt for my son&#x27;s baths.  He gets about half to one cup for each bath so we tend to go through epsom salt like water.  This is the best price I have found and I love that it comes in a strong plastic bag.</li>
            <li> I have been using this in my bath for a couple of years now. I suffer from the pain and detoxing effects of treatment for chronic late stage Lyme Disease/Fibromyalgia/Chronic Fatigue, etc. This is the very best epsom salt that I have ever used. And the most economical! I highly recommend it. It also ships very quickly. :-)</li>
            <li> Huge size and just lovely to soak in…high quality epsoms. Better than the &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; stores. Do yourself a favor and order from San Francisco Salt Company. I always feel like I have had a spa experience in my own home! Just Great!</li>
            <li> Excellent product at an excellent price. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I originally bought Epsoak Epson Salt for my gardening needs, but the more I read about it the more I love it for every day household uses. I&#x27;m so excited to see what else it can help with.</li>
            <li> This bag lasts a long time and is a bargain compared to buying the small boxes of epsom salt at the drug store.</li>
            <li> I only order my salts from San Francisco Salt Co. and I am always impressed. Not only by the quality of the salts, but the speed in which it arrives to my house. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Good quality but a little expensive for epsom salt. I can get a better deal buying from cvs. Might buy again.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for a parent who is on their feet all day.  They have said that this is perfect for their tired feet.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase. I love the fact that it was affordable, but it also appears to be good quality Epsom salt.</li>
            <li> Used it to make bath fizzes and bath salts. Had lots of hard chunky pieces in it.  Was necessary to sift it every time I used it, without exception. Also, it was a larger grain than what I usually get. Worked well in the bath salts but had to buy Epson Salt in the carton from the store that was a finer grain for the bath fizzes.</li>
            <li> Awesome awesome awesome! I have been consistently ordering 40lbs this product from this seller for a long time. The quality is the best I&#x27;ve found and it dissolves quickly so you are not sitting on chunky rocks. My family goes through this stuff very quickly.  This detox is safe to do servers times a week.  I totally owe this seller a review.  i take regular Epsom salt baths to stay healthy--with a child who recently started school there&#x27;s a lot of petri dishes disguised as little cute little kiddos running around. :). I add 4 cups to my regular sized bath.  I&#x27;ll add 1/2 cup to my sons bath.  Both my son and I are huggers. So rather than teach him to stay away from other kids that have runny noses we teach him to give them a healing hug if they need one.  Epsom salt is a killer detox and very gentle.  Added plus- my doctor just commented on how soft my skin is. (I don&#x27;t scrub or exfoliate- just soak).  Btw- right after a bath I feel more energized and refreshed immediately.  Add a couple drops of your fav essential oil to bath water for some really sweet down time.</li>
            <li> my husband loves this and uses 1-2 cups in his nightly bath.  I don&#x27;t really use any and don&#x27;t feel any difference when I use it , but my husband seems to love it.</li>
            <li> I must say I really like these salts and the fact I can buy them in bulk. I run and it&#x27;s a great way to soak after a run. They dissolve very quickly which is great as I think that will help reduce any chance of irritation.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  It&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping for. This very large bag of salt now stays next to the bathtub. My mini bath heaven involves a deep soaking tub, one cup of this salt and quarter cup of Algemarin Bubble Bath.  This magic combo has replaced my previous ritual of expensive and boutique bath salts.</li>
            <li> Arrived at expected and was wonderful in the bath.  Very happy with the purchase and now we have enough for quite a while! We love using this for our kids and ourselves as detox baths.</li>
            <li> Salts are good, it seems that you have to put lots of them to feel any kind of effect, compared to the more expensive brands. Anyone had the same thought?</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Epsom salt in my gardens. Was so great to find this large bag and great price. Saves me a lot of money. Will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> Huge bag with a strong zipper and moisture control.  Keeps for a very long time!  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Wonderful quality Epsom salt - the grains are small (it looks like granulated sugar) and easily absorbed into warm water. Cheaper to buy Epsom salt this way then the cheap cartons at Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li> 5 out of 5. Great deal. Been buying the same product for a while now.</li>
            <li> Love soaking in the tub at night with this stuff!</li>
            <li> Great packaging. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I like it; it is not clumpy and it is a good price for a lot of Epsom Salt. I use Epsom Salt in bath 4 to 5 days a week. It&#x27;s nice to have a bigger size and not be putting it on my shopping list every week.</li>
            <li> HUGE resealable bag that is thick plastic. I think this was a great deal!</li>
            <li> I was going to say, see the other review as I purchased another brand in the same quantity as this one. I am a man, hated baths... until I smelled the hall in front of the bathroom. My wife was taking a bath and convinced me to try it... ok, I still take showers but this has changed my view and I feel great after a long soak. I bring my iPad with me and I never want to come out. Great product and I smell great after using this!</li>
            <li> Mosquitos love me, this product is worth it.  Better price than buying 19lbs at store.  Great company</li>
            <li> Great product.  You get a lot of value for the money.  If you will be using epsom salts on a regular basis, this is the most cost effective way to go.  Quality is great. Comes in a handy bag.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now and love it.  It seems to work really well for aching muscles.  A 10 to 15 minute soak is all it takes.  Just by looking at it one can tell that it&#x27;s a high quality product.  And the 20lb bag lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to use in my company&#x27;s body scrub/bath salts and everyone raves that they&#x27;re the best they&#x27;ve ever had. I will continue to purchase- I love this company (and the price point!)</li>
            <li> someone told me to soak in this, it would help clear up my acne. i really didnt see much of a change. but for the amount i got for the price was good. i just wish it i noticed a slight difference in my acne. what this product in general does, i really dont have a clue.</li>
            <li> I use it for a soak when my workout gets too intensed and it helped to ease the pain and allow me to sleep well after. With amazon prime, 2-day shipping is free so you really can&#x27;t find a better deal anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was only one issue I had with the latest order I had with this company. I wasn&#x27;t sure if the packaging had changed but I didn&#x27;t see the usual double zip function and I have a hard time closing the bag.</li>
            <li> I used this for some bath salts I was giving away for a class and I was very happy with how it all turned out.</li>
            <li> Great find for me. We use Epsom salt in the yard, the bath and in our laundry this large size is a much better value</li>
            <li> thank you so much!! excellent</li>
            <li> I bought this for soaking my feet after a long day. There is no real scientific proof epsom salt helps. All I can say is it seems to work for me soaking in a bucket of warm water.  This bag is definitely a better deal than the store price.</li>
            <li> Great buy, I recommend this to my clients all the time, and use it myself</li>
            <li> This is the second time I order this product. I love it and will continue to add this item to my list.  The bag usually last me 3 months.</li>
            <li> Great salts,  HORRIBLE packaging! If you&#x27;re not planning on using the whole bag have another container ready because this resealing bag is the biggest pain in the world to close, IF it closes at all! You spend forever getting it closed, check it twice, and come back to it open with rocks forming in the bag from the moisture that seeped in. Frustrating!</li>
            <li> Package was received quickly.  The bag is a great heavyduty re-sealable bag.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I could not find bulk Epsom salts at my garden supply store so I was very happy to find this.</li>
            <li> When this massive bag of Epsom salts arrived, I thought I had made a mistake in buying it. I&#x27;m now very happy that I did. The price was really good for the size of the bag and it works just as you&#x27;d expect Epsom salts to work. I&#x27;m a distance runner and soaking in this salt minimizes sore muscles. The biggest challenge with this product is finding a large enough space in the bathroom for the bag. Despite that dilemma, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Helps soothe my skin in the bath when my eczema is bad!</li>
            <li> ahh my feet feel great</li>
            <li> This huge bag is going to last a while!  I was always a little skeptical about whether epsom salt soaks really worked, but I had a tough workout recently and my muscles really hurt the next day.  That night, I took a soak, and the next morning, I woke up ache free.  It was fantastic!</li>
            <li> THEY LIVE ANOTHER YEAR.,</li>
            <li> Grateful this is relatively affordable. Grateful this is made in the US. Grateful this helps soothe my chronically aching body.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this was one of three different bath salts sent to me over the last couple months to try out. This is a no frills bag of course, as it is just straight up Epsom Salts. That said, they were still noticeably better than your run of the mill store brands. For one, the salts actually dissolve completely, which, if you use bath salts, you know that the salts not dissolving can leave you with a less than desirable experience overall. For my wife and I though, the real telling factor was how we felt after using them. As somebody with a litany of long term sports related injuries, and a long bath with these salts helped to ease the constant soreness in my knees, feet, and back. So, a winning product and one I would have problem buying in the future.</li>
            <li> Really helpful with Fybromyalgia pain, after a long day, soaking in hot water with these salts is very therapeutic!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent salts! Nothing like a hot bath w/ these salts after a long day of working! Recommend to anyone who works hard.</li>
            <li> I have not used many types but this is nice and dissolves quickly, kids love it I their bath and ask for it.</li>
            <li> Use this to soak or mix it with your yard fertilizer. I bought this large bag for the garden. You can even add a teaspoon to warm water and drink it for constipation.</li>
            <li> My title says it all! This product is awesome! WAy easier to buy in bulk and I will definitely be back!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price for this much epsom salt.  And the quality is great, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> works great, salt if finer than other brands which helps it dissolve faster. It is shipped in a heavy duty plastic bag so no worries about it ripping and spilling out during shipping. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very high quality epsom slats. Its hard to find some decent reviews for epson salts, but this is a very good brand.  I take baths on a regular basis and very pleased.  My only concern is that this product is cheaper for the company&#x27;s website. I would at least think Amazon.com would have similar prices.</li>
            <li> Good quality for a good price.  I use this to make my own scented bath soak and am glad to have found a reliable source at a reasonable price.  Deliver was quick and packaging was good.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> I have been using epsom salts for many years.  I first realized it was a wonderful alternative to drawing salve when I was having trouble dealing with an infected fire ant bite.  It was almost miraculous how an epsom salt soak drew out the poison.  Since then, I&#x27;ve used it repeatedly on other insect bites, imbedded rose thorns, slivers, cactus needles and such.  If it works so very well on poisons and impurities large enough to see, just think how it must be tackling all those impurities and toxins in your skin that are invisible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the grain size to be more consistent in this SF Salt Co. epsom salt than in other epsom salt products that I&#x27;ve purchased at grocery and discount stores.  The no-name store brands have a lot of tiny grains, even some dust, mixed in with the large grains. SF&#x27;s epsom salt has mostly nice clear grains, while other brands have a lot of opaque white grains mixed in.  Does it make a difference in the soak?  I don&#x27;t know. What I do know is this:  Because I like the look of the SF clear grains, it makes for a nicer experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it as a foot and hand soak:  Refreshing in cold water during the hot months, and comforting and cozy when arthritis strikes me in the cold and clammy months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from SF Salt Company.  If not for them sending me a sample, I would never have experienced the difference between a quality epsom salt and what I got locally at the store.</li>
            <li> The package was broken when it arrived.</li>
            <li> It is pure epsom salt.  Working on my second bag.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and exceeded expectations. I will be ordering more when I start to run low.</li>
            <li> Use with my foot spa and the product works great</li>
            <li> Use this for myself and my dog, to help ease his joint pain.  Works wonders for swelling in his paws.</li>
            <li> Good product, Delivered in a timely fashion and priced competitively.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Mine and my 4 year old&#x27;s skins are so happy! Great company!</li>
            <li> Works great and so impressed with the quality and look of the crystals.</li>
            <li> would buy these again</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone.  I have used it for sore muscles and for detoxing.  If I am detoxing, I put Two cups of Epsom Salt and two cups of Baking soda in a hot bath and soak for 40 minutes.  This is a great product to get all the toxins out your system by sweating them out.  This also helps create blood flow to help the healing process of sore muscles as well.</li>
            <li> Quickly shipped and great quality.  I am older and play raquetball and work out at the gym.  The hot epsom salt baths for me are a must!  Product dissolves quickly in water and provides that oh so welcome relaxing relief.  I recommend this product and company.</li>
            <li> Cures anything - if you are homeopathic inclined - get it!  Buying in bulk is key.</li>
            <li> reliable shipping. great deal for the ounce! with daily use, i go through epsom salts quickly - makes my bath time awesome!</li>
            <li> I repeatedly order this large bag. It&#x27;s the best value going, and makes sure I never run out of epsom salts!</li>
            <li> There is no scientific evidence to support Epsom Salt relieving muscle pain or speeding healing.  Before you buy, please read the full following articles:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RunnersConnect Website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are Epsom Salt Baths an Effective Treatment for Running Injuries? by John Davis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Conclusion...Barring future research, it&#x27;s very hard to justify an Epsom salt bath over a traditional ice bath or hot water bath for treating an injury. Though Epsom salt is dirt-cheap, no research supports any direct effect on injury recovery, and none of the theories forwarded about how Epsom salt might help in indirect ways hold up to any scrutiny either.\\&quot; -- John Davis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PainScience Website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do Epsom Salts Work? by Paul Ingraham&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;My search for scientific evidence concerning Epsom salt baths was disappointing. I was unable to find even a single scientific paper studying their effect on body pain. Folk remedies are often generally neglected by researchers, but not usually so completely.\\&quot; -- Paul Ingraham</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start out by saying I LOVE Epsom Salt baths. I find them cleansing, relaxing and good for sore muscles after a long day of hearty exercise. That said- I am very critical about my salts. ( Not in an insane, OCD way but-- some salts dissolve better; I have found some have a strange medicinal odor to them; some are too fine--almost like a powdery dust, which manages to get everywhere.) For me, I like good old fashioned akin to medium-to-large grain sea-salt, odorless Epsom. I find this size the most useable for pre-scrub, soak and storing.&lt;br /&gt;SF Salt company hit all my loves on the nose-- these 20lbs of Epsom are heaven sent! Perfect in every way that I like: Fast delivery, great grain size, no odor, immaculately clean, hearty storage bag for easy accessibility.&lt;br /&gt;I could easily go through this much Epsom in a month--but I will try my darndest to hold off to two.&lt;br /&gt;Other thoughts: The shipment of these salts was fast and efficient- as a very \\&quot;green\\&quot; person, I appreciated there was minimal packing materials  used with the delivery of this product. </li>
            <li> Detox soak at a fabulous price!  We all need to detox and this is one way to easily do just that.  Make sure you have filtered water in the tub too.  26 seconds on your skin and whatever it is goes through your whole body.  Epsom salt bath will assist your detox regime.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! It dissolves much more quickly than other brands I&#x27;ve tried. And my aching muscle are grateful. Even after a difficult workout, I feel fine. I didn&#x27;t used to feel that way before I started using Epsom salts.</li>
            <li> Love Epsom salt baths and buying in bulk has been super helpful. arrived in good condition and am relaxing with my foot baths daily.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a HUGE bag of epsom salts. I keep it in the cupboard nearest the tub and add some to each bath. It relieves muscle soreness and also the magnesium relaxes the body.</li>
            <li> This bag will last forever !</li>
            <li> I finally might have enough to last a few months! I love soaking in epsom salt baths and using it around the garen and house. I am so excited to have a stash big enough to last me a while. I also combine with Magnesium Chloride flakes and a bath dechlorinator, add baking soda and lavender essential oil...best baths ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the bag is nice, it reseals easily and the salts are relatiely fine compared to others I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;yay epsom salts!</li>
            <li> This was a pretty good deal. Shipping was quick and the bag was hefty. It was good quality salts and I have ordered from them more than once.</li>
            <li> Nice product and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I expected this to have some sort of smell to it, but when I opened the huge thick plastic bag, nothing. This is just great, because as a dude I didn’t want one.  I use this in the bath; it dissolves in the water very fast, after a great workout or a long run to help with the muscles.  It relaxes and helps take out the aches and pain.  The only negative thing I have found I stay in the bath for too long it dries out my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> This salt is very fine and shinny. Looks like a bag of diamonds sitting in the cabinet. I am enjoying my baths now.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this twice now and am quite happy with it. Good quality and a decent price at approx $1.50 per pound. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it were even cheaper.</li>
            <li> Having 20 lb bag arrive at my house beats carrying home small options from grocery store and these salts are great! the epsom salts arrived quickly and as promised. the grain size is ideal for baths - dissolves quickly and easily even in lukewarm water.</li>
            <li> This product is well priced and was delivered in a very timely manner. Great for bath soaks, with drops of lavender oil.  Also excellent to add to water for geraniums to encourage blooming.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how quickly this got here. I made scented bath salts for Christmas presents. The Epsoak Epsom Salts worked wonderfully!</li>
            <li> These are fine &amp;#34;salt&amp;#34; crystals. They dissolve pretty quickly in my bath.</li>
            <li> Love these for bathing my magnesium deficient son. He soaks with 1 cup every night for 20 minutes and comes out calm and ready for bed.</li>
            <li> Good price. This stuff is pretty expensive in the small quantities you get from the drugstore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a runner and taking a bath in this helps me walk easier the next day. Happy to have found this. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great value. I love using the Epsom salts for pretty much everything!</li>
            <li> Arrived with salt bag busted and leaking all over</li>
            <li> What a deal and free shipping with Prime.  My wife loves to soak and now she can do it every bath.</li>
            <li> These epsom salts are a great value. If you do any comparison shopping, you will see that other reviewers agree. I use these salts several times a week in my baths to help with a magnesium deficiency. I also sometimes use the salts as a mix in with my conditioner as a volumizer​.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bag will generally last me a month or so.</li>
            <li> 2 cups in the tub full of hot water makes for a great soak after a long bike ride</li>
            <li> I took two baths with these (at a high concentration of salts), but found that my aches and pains weren&#x27;t relieved as they were with some generic Epsom salt I had picked up from the store. I&#x27;ll give these another shot. The price can&#x27;t be beat, however.</li>
            <li> Took a wonderful soak right away! This bulk bag is especially nice that it has a vent so moisture will not get trapped inside.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, the bag is solid and comes with a one way air valve to keep out moisture etc.  My wife and I use this in our Japanese Soaking Tub and it really does make a difference.  Soothes out a lot of the aches and pains and relaxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, $30 for 20lbs, even with free delivery seems a bit over priced.  I&#x27;ve seen other brands at grocery stores that were much cheaper.  So while I had a good experience with this, next time I&#x27;ll just buy locally and save the money.  In the end it is just Magnesium Sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 11/20/14&lt;br /&gt;Upgraded from 3 to 4 stars as they did leave a nice comment addressing my review and I will probably order some of their other products that are not readily available locally.</li>
            <li> Really good deal but we like the Dead Sea bath salt way better.</li>
            <li> I love how big this is, it last such along time.</li>
            <li> My first time using Epsom salt. It dissolved quickly and works wonders. I use it to help relax my back and my wrists. I sleep like a baby after a good hot bath.</li>
            <li> Cheap, bulk quantity, good price.  What more could you want?  I wish they offered a scented version.</li>
            <li> Great seller! I love that this is just the salts with no added scents or oils so I can mix my own essential oils depending on necessity. Love my jacuzzi epsom salt baths!</li>
            <li> The best value out there. I use a lot of epsom salt and it was costing too much money. I am grateful I found this brand.</li>
            <li> Great price, good &amp;#34;salt&amp;#34;,exactly what I wanted and way cheaper than everywhere else.</li>
            <li> Affordable, shipped quickly, arrived intact. Salt works like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> Got it, used it, works great. Better than I&#x27;d have imagined, in fact. Yes, would purchase again, too. Helped my herniated disc challenge. Like the company.</li>
            <li> Love this product it is good for everyday soaking and actually softens your skin</li>
            <li> Great product, Great price!</li>
            <li> My whole family loves a good soak! I do think  these disolve better then Dr TEals</li>
            <li> Awesome job! The product at first seemed a bit sketchy to me because of the low price for 20 lbs of Epsom salt, I&#x27;m used to paying a lot more for a little. I decided to trust the other reviews and I am very happy that I did. The bag it comes in is a thick plastic resealable bag so you don&#x27;t have to worry about puncturing the bag or finding resealable bags to use it. The salts themselves are of very nice quality, medium grain, and dissolve easily. I suggest making the switch from whichever brand you may be using now to these, and enjoy a nice long soak!</li>
            <li> Using this to make scrubs. Wonderful!</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly. Just as listed.</li>
            <li> This is a whole bunch of salt. Like, I could probably make a tiny ocean with all this salt. And I do, kind of, whenever I take a bath! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This salt is a great product at a good price. Epsom Salt that I&#x27;ve bought in the past from local shops has been clumpy or melted. Not so with this salt! It comes in a giant ziploc-style bag and the grains are beautifully separate. It feels good just to run my hand through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also really enjoying the quantity, which allows me to super salt my bath guilt free. Need to add more hot water? No worries - toss in a bit more salt. I&#x27;m actually thinking about ordering some for holiday gifts because I&#x27;m enjoying it so very much. Epsom salts are truly wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping, too! Salt arrived in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Great quality epsom salt without many impurities. I bought this in order to make scented bath salts to give as gifts for the holidays. I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Use a lot of epsom salts and was getting tired of buying a 4 lb bag at the local grocery store once a month. This 20 lb bag is a great product at a great value.</li>
            <li> Buying the epsom salt in bulk is well worth it. The salt dissolved almost immediately. Good product, and it feels so good for my fibromyalgia. Great for relaxation as well, and a good source of magnesium. 2 cups for each bath.</li>
            <li> Love this. Will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> This salt is wonderful. I use it with every bath, just adding a couple drops of my choice of essential oil.</li>
            <li> Geez is this a big bag of salt! When the description was for almost 20lbs of salt I really wasn&#x27;t thinking it would be that much, but I take baths at least once a week so it&#x27;s nice to have a stock of this stuff rather than paying by the jar.</li>
            <li> Great Product. A real cure all for skin conditions, aches and pains and has even lowered my husbands blood pressure.</li>
            <li> great size.. this will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> fast shipping great price</li>
            <li> I will continue to order this product.  I like having plenty at all times.  It works well on my pain.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery and a good price!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Just bought 20 pounds on sale for $19.20 from the vendor&#x27;s website.&lt;br /&gt;The regular price is $22.99.</li>
            <li> Product arrived more quickly than I expected in a resealable bag.  The salts dissolve quickly and provide a very nice bath. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love to use and make bath salts (not the illegal drug kind!). These salts are high quality and were delivered right when they said they would be. Next time I need some, I will order again. Great product and customer service</li>
            <li> Great product at an even better price!  This is by far the cheapest Epsom salt I have been able to find, and I use it a few times a week for a nice relaxing detox bath.  I will definitely be purchasing on a regular basis!</li>
            <li> What a value! I just received this and took a soak. It&#x27;s a great product. This is some of the best salts I have used. Also it comes in a sturdy re-sealable bag. You can&#x27;t beat the value.</li>
            <li> works very well, so I like it very much</li>
            <li> I was looking for bulk magnesium sulfate.  These guys had it, and it was exactly what I was looking for.  I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
            <li> BATHS!  In theory that should be all you need to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~20lbs. of Epsom Salt has lasted me four months and counting.  It was shipped quickly and arrived intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My job entails about 10k - 15k steps a day at what amounts to high intensity interval training!  When I get home I often have a BATH (yes, they deserve caps).  The Epsom Salts allow my muscles to relax, and I add several other things for aromatherapy and skin care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recipe:&lt;br /&gt;A tub full of ~100 degrees Fahrenheit water&lt;br /&gt;2 cups San Francisco Salt Company Epsom Salts&lt;br /&gt;1 cup Baking Soda&lt;br /&gt;1 teaspoon BulkSupplements.com Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) Powder&lt;br /&gt;1/2 cup Dr, Teal&#x27;s Lavender Foaming Bath&lt;br /&gt;A few drops of NOW Foods Eucalyptus Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;20-30 minutes of AHH...</li>
            <li> Very pleased! Gorgeous crystal salt</li>
            <li> Soothes tired and achy muscles.</li>
            <li> I take at least one epsom salt bath a week. This large bag has lasted a long time. The bag seals well and lets air out so that the epsom salt doesn&#x27;t get rock hard.</li>
            <li> Easy way to get much need magnesium levels in my body.</li>
            <li> Use it for both foot baths after a long day tromping around my place, and for adding to garden plants that require magnesium....tomatoes, peppers, etc.  Good price for a big, sturdy bag.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 19.75 lb. bag and boy, it&#x27;s huge! Great price for so much Epsom Salt. I have Multiple Sclerosis and try to do a soak a few times a week to help with muscle pain. I add a couple cups to my bath and I do feel a positive difference when I am done.</li>
            <li> I usually buy it at Costco, but I need to take frequent detox baths and thought this would be a better deal.  I was in a Lyme-brain fog when I did the math on this purchase.  Not even close to the cost of 12 lbs at Costco.  The product is the same anywhere.</li>
            <li> did not do anything to help with my psoriases , good price if using just for relaxing in  a bathtub</li>
            <li> I am so glad I ordered this bag of Epsom salts! I wanted to use Epsom salts because of their magnesium content. At first I wondered if I needed a bag this big, but it really isn&#x27;t all that big, and I like that I won&#x27;t run out too soon. As a bonus they sent me a sample of French grey gourmet food salt - I really like it too.</li>
            <li> I love to soak in Epsom salt.  The grains were nice, a little more clear...great price...would definitely order it again.  Epsom salt in my bath keeps my feet soft.  I am 35, I get a pedicure about once every other month or so.  I bartend and prior to bartending I was a dancer.  So, I have abused the crap out of my feet.  I got a pedi last week and she said I had great feet, and she hardly had to scrape anything.  I soak in Epsom salt twice a week.</li>
            <li> Our massage therapist suggested we soak in Epsom salt so we sought to have a large quantity. This product fits the bill and dissolves nicely into bath water when swished about by the hands.</li>
            <li> I use it for a my tub bath. Seems like it is good quality. No issues</li>
            <li> I love this epsom salt and have almost finished one bag in only a couple months.  You can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> What is there to say, it&#x27;s epsom salt....  I received 20 lbs of epsom salt that easily dissolves.  In that respect, it works better than other products that I&#x27;ve tried.  The seller even included a little bamboo scoop for the salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived intact, quickly, and exactly as described.  I would purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Epsom salt is such a great product to have especially if your A vigorous athlete. After sitting in the bath for at least 10 minutes your muscles are relieved from any aches or pains and the fact that you get such a huge bag for such a great price is a win-win.</li>
            <li> Second order of this product. Love the size option. Arrived as expected!</li>
            <li> Just as expected. The salt is used in our spa to promote musle relaxation. It works great.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use the salts for bathing, cleaning and even for hair conditioning. I add a small amount to my hair conditioner and it does amazing things for my hair. Last week my hair dresser told me to keep using them because she couldn&#x27;t even begin to offer a product that could match what I was doing at home with simple Epson salts and conditioner. It makes a great facial scrub when combined with honey. This is a high quality product and I use it daily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The San Francisco Salt Company&#x27;s Epsom salt is pure, clean, sparkling (and yes, beautiful) as well as effective. It dissolves quickly and provides me with immediate relief from soreness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company packages the salt in what looks like a custom-type heavy plastic bag with a built-in \\&quot;thing?\\&quot; that prevents moisture from getting trapped in the bag and dissolving the salts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and company!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Epsom salt to help with sounder sleep.  I like the size of the bag and the results.  Only thing that I would improve is to have a slid closure, since it hurts my arthritis to press the bag closed.</li>
            <li> Seems odd to be recommending... salt.  But I was happy enough with the product, and how quickly it was delivered that I&#x27;ve just made a second order.  The salt arrived packed in a heavy duty zip lock bag, packed in a card board box.  The amount (20lbs,) the packing, and the price made far more sense than those little boxes you can sometimes pick up at the supermarket.  I&#x27;m very pleased to have found these guys.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so impressed with this company! The salts arrived promptly and I&#x27;m super thrilled because I&#x27;ve just started a workout routine and these are a godsend to aching muscles and DOMS. Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price &amp; product and speedy delivery are huge positives on their own, but truth be told, it&#x27;s the customer service that is going to keep me coming back! The plastic bag containing the salts had torn in transit somehow (leading to some salt leaking in the postage box).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite it being a Saturday, I heard back immediately from a customer service rep who was, to say the least, extremely gracious and truly made me feel like a valued customer. I love when I find a company that treats me like a human being instead of a transaction. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> It was heavily scented.</li>
            <li> Awesome for body scrubs, nice fine grain salts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times which surprised me since i though with 20 lbs of this stuff it&#x27;d be gone by now.</li>
            <li> Dang, that&#x27;s *a lot* of salt! But, the finer crystals as really nice and dissolve much better than other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Awesome job! The product at first seemed a bit sketchy because of the low price for 20 lbs of Epsom salt, I&#x27;m used to paying a lot more for a little. But after try this brand for several time, it Work as described, and I can enjoy a nice long soak, helping to relief my leg sprains and bruises!</li>
            <li> I love Epsom salts in my bath and have tried multiple kinds. This one dissolves well and was good value.</li>
            <li> I go through 10 to 12 cups of Epsom Salts a week so I really appreciate the large package.  The package closes easily with the ziploc-type top.  I throw the salt into the bathtub as I am filling it up and it is perfectly dissolved when I get into the bath when the tub is filled.  Not sure how to compare one brand of Epsom Salts to another, but this seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> My father has extreme itching of the lower part of his legs. All he wanted to do was tear them apart till they would bleed. I read online that this product will help if not stop the itching. He takes blood thinner and I think this may be part of it. I was extremely please to find the product well package, nice crystals and of excellent quality. Amazingly my father stoped tearing his lower legs apart after soaking 3 times in Epsoak Epsom Salts...&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The Salt was great! There was a small hole in the bag so some of it had come out of the bag during shipping but other than that it was fantastic!</li>
            <li> Two cups of this salt + one cup of baking soda + a few drops of lavender oil + one bathtub of hot water, soak for 40 minutes &#x3D; heaven on earth.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and product.</li>
            <li> Purchased product for my garden. Package arrived on time and damage free. Bag made of thick plastic with zip-lock closure. I did notice that it did desolved better (as advertised) then other brands that I used before.</li>
            <li> This product shipped quickly, was packaged well, and is just what I needed for soaking baths after surgery. The price is excellent as well, will order again!</li>
            <li> Good price, and good quality salt.  No more lugging this in from the grocery store every few days.  well packed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit - only issue is that this salt is leaving a colored film around the tub when I run the whirlpool. Other salts have not done this in the past. still 4/5.</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff I use it in my foot baths and bath salt making just really great salt.&lt;br /&gt;^_^</li>
            <li> Refreshing, clean and sparkly</li>
            <li> I have used this product and shared with my friends as well. I had no problems with the bag the product comes in, it is a heavy duty zipper pouch. I would recommend to anyone seeking high quality epsom salt and I would purchase again. Thanks SFSC :)</li>
            <li> This is an excellent value for Epsom Salt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resealable bag protects salt from moisture and prevents clumping (I use to soak after the gym, and thus keep it in the bathroom).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping is fast as well.</li>
            <li> Big savings with this purchase. Will be reordering for sure</li>
            <li> Great service and great sale price</li>
            <li> Great price, great product! So happy to have found this wonderful buy on line. Ships quickly and conveniently.</li>
            <li> It made my feet feel so soft!  The seller was very responsive &amp; it also came with a free sample of other salts they make. I will DEFINITELY be buying from again.  It helps my feet feel much better after work. Epsom salt baths are so good for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also not to mention  amazon said my bath salts wouldn&#x27;t come  until  Friday!!  Almost a whole week.. well this salt company  impressed me when i  ordered it on the 23rd.. and it was here by the 25th!&lt;br /&gt;I think i  have a  favorite company lol</li>
            <li> Great value for such a wonderful product. Resealable bag makes it work in the humid bathroom. Used it for sitzbaths and it disolves great.</li>
            <li> I used this product, any kind pain, sore stress relieve. just put in your bath and enjoy it, not expensive the shipment arrived on time</li>
            <li> fast shipping, will use again.</li>
            <li> Huge bag but great product. Love to soak my feet in it with a few drops of tea tree oil. Haven&#x27;t really used it for anything else</li>
            <li> I think this is officially the best deal I&#x27;ve ever seen for epsom salts. I&#x27;ve certainly never seen anything comparable in drugstores. The package arrived promptly and with a little bonus packet of gourmet cooking salt. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Aside from carrying it up to my third floor apartment, this is a great deal!  price is right, arrived quickly, packaged securely.</li>
            <li> We are both marathon runners and use this as a soak after long runs and races, no more swelling or sore muscles! It even helps us both recover faster from leg injuries. Better than other brands and cheaper, can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I enjoy putting in my own oil essence and enjoy mixing this product.  it dissolves great and works well to rejuvenate me.</li>
            <li> Best thing I did last fall was buy this bulk bag of salts and the NOW lavendar oil drops. I mix about 1.5 cups salts with just one or two drops of oil and put in the tub... total relaxation!</li>
            <li> This salt is fantastic! It is wonderful on my skin, and really is great for my muscle recovery. This is also high-quality and an excellent value at that. A must buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this brand a few times now and turned a couple of friends onto it as well. Great quality salts by far. Fairly good prices too considering they ship huge bags! My whole family bathes in these salts at least once a week for overall feeling of well being. It&#x27;s a great cleanser and detox as well as helping to pull out any sicknesses lingering around. When any of us aren&#x27;t feeling well it&#x27;s a salt bath to cure of ailments. Never felt so relaxed. I don&#x27;t know how I survived without all these years. I also use it as a facial exfoliator and deep hair cleanser. I mix it with shampoo every couple weeks to get a deep clean on the hair and scalp. I mix with coconut oil as a good scrub for the face ever two weeks or so. My skin has never felt so soft. Remember how great your skin looked and felt after a long swim at the beach in salty waters? Well, you can get the same thing just bathing in your own tub using these salts.. maybe even better.</li>
            <li> Love these - I order every month or so.... go on subscription????</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I use it almost daily for my baths. I have very sensitive skin and using this works like a charm. It helps clear up minor skin irritations almost instantly... okay, overnight is more accurate. I will use it in my bath in the evening, leaving the dried salt on my skin. Wash it off in the morning in the shower and my skin is as good as new. Even helps clear up bug bits and itchy skin in the same fashion.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
            <li> Love the size and value! Excellent product. I use weekly to ease muscle and joint pain. Costs less than most bath salts.</li>
            <li> 5 stars cause its the most affordable epsom on Amazon, but I will say the first bag I got had finer salt crystals that absorbed faster.  But same bath in the end, just a little more mixing together.</li>
            <li> 20 lbs of epsom salt is a LOT of product for the money! i will be purchasing this again through the san fransisco salt company without a doubt. the salt is wonderful for bathing and soaking to remove toxins from the body and this salt seems to be more pure and legit than the other ones you buy at the drug store or wal mart.</li>
            <li> Old folks experience increasing feet problems for which Epsom Salts soaking is recommended by my Podiatrist.  I use this 20 pound bag as my reserve. I use a sealable containor to scoop out a week&#x27;s supply while doing my pill reloads. Each day, I use a new cat litter box while sitting on the edge of my tub with a generous sprinkle and hot water and, ah, the pain goes away. I place one of my Amazon purchased foot scrubbers in the bottom of the box and my feet are clean too.  Upturn the box in the tub and no fuss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag has an effective reseal so that clumping has been held off during several weeks of this routine. The large quantity reduces both cost ahd shopping actions.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend thought I was CRAZY when this 20 lb bag of bath salt arrived. &amp;#34;why would you ever need that much salt??!&amp;#34; he said. I have been taking salt baths 2-3 times a week since it has arrived and it has done WONDERS to my skin. This mixed with some bubble bath is all you need. and this is like a YEAR supply! I think I paid about $30 for it or less. definitely worth every penny spent!</li>
            <li> These epsom salts are very high quality.  They seem to be more potent, that is relaxing than the kind one buys in the drugstore.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I love taking baths with Epsom salts. I found ordering in a 20 lb bag with Amazon Prime is less expensive than buying the cartons at the store (plus, delivery to my door).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These salts work wonders and my baths are super relaxing. Also, the bag is thick plastic and has a ziplock type of closure so you can store the salts in the bag with ease.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Was so tired of spending $5-8 at the store for much smaller bags that lasted only a few baths… this one was perfect at almost 20 pounds!  We are a very active family and often after our renovations or yard work, gardening, working out etc.. we are very sore.  This does the trick!  I add a few cups to my bath water and soak for 15-20 minutes.  I feel so much better and sleep better as well.  Great detox too.  highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great stuff; close able bag....Useful salt for weed killing!</li>
            <li> Ok, I will admit that I was very skeptical about the San Francisco Salts Epson Soak baths. At first I was going to decline the opportunity to review these salt baths, but I mentioned them to my wife and she wanted to give them a try. I happy to say, that for (about) the millionth time I am happy that I listened to my wife and accepted this product for review. I used that same intro in my review of the San Francisco Salt Muscle Soak, but it is also fits perfectly for the Epsoak Salt as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the Epsoak and the Muscle Soak are fantastic and can turn a normal bath into a super relaxing experience.... or so my wife tells me. Personally, I have only used the Epsoak in a foot bath, but it has worked perfectly. My feet felt relieved and the bottoms of my feet were softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The Epsoak did leave our skin feeling very soft - much softer than just using a moisturizing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Dissolves quickly in both cool and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Does not leave any residue in the tub&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Does help relax your muscles while in the bath tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Helps to soften any callouses that you may have on the bottoms of your feet. My wife and I both found that the Epsom Soak was great for our easing or achey feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict - While our family does prefer the San Francisco Salt Muscle Soak the Epsom Salt Soak is a great alternative for anyone who does not like fragrances (and especially not mints) - the Epsom Salt Soak is an easy recommendation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Note - I received this product for reviewing purposes</li>
            <li> These salts dissolve very well and work great. I use them for saoking in tub to ease sore muscles and also with my face wash as a pore cleanser</li>
            <li> I love this epsom salt.  I have ordered it several times, and will continue to order it again.  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> These salts are beautiful and don&#x27;t clump like the regular Epsom salts you would buy at the store. They look like little sparkly diamonds and make a beautiful presentation in a clear container.</li>
            <li> Great stuff big bag to hard to handle though</li>
            <li> My husband likes epsom salt when he&#x27;s sore from working.  He wasn&#x27;t crazy about how tiny the salt is.  He likes the bigger chunks to lie on. So I&#x27;m using it, and I like it!</li>
            <li> it helps for my back pain</li>
            <li> super fast delivery and perfect size because we use to much of this.  Also I love that it has a zipper closure, makes it easy to store if I run out of containers.</li>
            <li> Came with salt all over packaging box...coming out of plastic bag</li>
            <li> This Epson Salt from the San Francisco Salt Company seems much cleaner and more pure than the stuff I have bought at the local food or pharmacy stores.  The company seems dedicated to customer satisfaction and even included a small sample of one of their exotic table salts and small note thanking me for the purchase.  I will be buying again from them.  A+++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I had previously written that I bought it for $18.99 in February 2013.  I was mistaken, as I was looking at my invoice after I had applied $10 in credits.  The price is still the same as then at about $29 for 20 pounds.  Although this is about $9 more than the Morton brand, the quality is much better.  I recently tried the Morton Epson salts, and the quality of the salt seems much less.  The Morton granules are of varying size and color.  The San Francisco Salts are of a consistent size and appear more \\&quot;pure\\&quot; in color...a nice translucent white.  I think I will switch back the the San Franscisco salt on my next order.  Their customer service was excellent.</li>
            <li> Love this. Last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love these bath salts! Came in a giant bag. Perfect for detox bath every day! I use about a half cup with essential oils and some carrier oil.</li>
            <li> **UPDATED REVIEW**&lt;br /&gt;I had origionally given them 3 stars &amp; posted the following review with the title...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;WARNING town may think your a drug addict!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was fine, the shipping was on time. The only problem I had was the fact that the box was labled \\&quot;San Francisco BATH Salt Company\\&quot;!I live in the country &amp; have to pick up my packages from the local small market. Now the whole town thinks that we are crazy bath salts addicts!Since the new drug called BATH SALTS has hit the market &amp; is driving people to eat each other, maybe they should rethink the company name! At least dont put that on the BOX!!!! Seriously, I thought I was just ordering some epsom salt for my yard &amp; garden...I NEVER thought I was ordering something that would make my whole family the object of town gossip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the company got this review I was sent an e-mail thanking me for bringing that concern to their attention and letting me know that they have now changed their packaging to read \\&quot;San Francisco Salt Company\\&quot;. I am shocked that a company actually listened and did something about my problem so that I can and WILL order from them in the future!!!&lt;br /&gt;BTW Epsom Salt is not only wonderful for baths &amp; aches &amp; pains, but it does WONDERS for your yard &amp; garden! It helps keep the moisture in the soil in places with dry climates and keeps your lawn green even when everyone elses is turning brown! I highly recommend it for all the states that are suffering drought right now!!!</li>
            <li> makes a relaxing bath.</li>
            <li> I take epsom salt baths 3 times a week and use a lot. Buying in such a large quantity saves a lot of money.</li>
            <li> What a deal!  I have fibromyalgia and soaking in a tub with Epsom salts helps tremendously.  Being able to buy this large bag saves me money and the effort of going to the store constantly to buy small bags.  These salts seem to dissolve more quickly too.</li>
            <li> You know SF Salt Company does not let me get my work done and I will tell you why.  Just when I am about to be productive, one of their bath salts tempts me and calls me to a nice hot soaking salt bath.  Then next thing you know I am napping with shriveled fingers and wondering where I am and what time it is. ;-)  And after trying there cold &amp; flu variety last night, I decided to try tonight the regular Epson Salt that they provided to me as a sample for review.  (I will finish my review later... I have some soaking to do)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the regular Epson Salt (this is unscented) they sell is a good quality bath salt and they have always provided with every product they sell a printout describing the salt and its usage suggestions.  In addition, they guarantee the quality of their salt.  Although the smaller packages of bath salts is a bit more expensive, the bulk packages are actually fairly comparablein price per pound to other store bought brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an old back injury that flares up from time to time and gets sore for no apparent reason.  So I threw in a couple handfuls into a hot bath and soaked away.  This dissolved quickly and easily worked into the water.  And after soaking my achy back felt better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints with the quality of SF Salts and you can’t go wrong with any of their bath salts.  I have tried a few different flavors of their salts and I have been happy with each one I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars</li>
            <li> I purchased this in a 20lb bag this past summer 2013 for $26.99 and now it is #34.99 6 months later (Jan 2014). Slightly disappointed. It was a bargain at $26.99 and comparable to other bath salts sold locally. Unfortunately my mother and I have a chronic illness and require numerous aids to assist with our constant symptoms, pains, fatigue, etc. We our home bound and have to order online for our needs for home delivering. Unfortunately ordering online is becoming over priced. It makes me mad that companies and sellers are at times tripling prices for their own gain and people like me our forced to deal with these prices when we have no other options. Now Walmart here I come $20 for 20lbs (includes shipping) - online of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use arm and hammer in my baths to help detox w/ the salt btw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Original Review**&lt;br /&gt;Title: Very Impressed by the Quality and Quick Ship!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to those seeking bulk epsom salt. The epsom salt is fine and dissolves quickly in the tub...I like it a lot. I hated having to wait for the epsom salt to dissolve with other brands. This is perfect this dissolves almost immediately and works great...I would have to say it is the best epsom salt I have ever purchased. I would like to see them (San Francisco Salt Company) actually make a scented epsom salt and offer it in bulk. They shipped it quickly, I had it within three days. Very happy with the product and the seller plus with free shipping you can&#x27;t beat it. The best deal. Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> I like to soak in my deep garden tub with a couple of cups of epsom salts along with baking powder, essential oils, a bit of powdered ginger, and oatmeal. The epsom salts work to alleviate sore muscles while drawing toxins out of the skin. I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in the appearance of acne that recently started popping up on my back. I thought a 20 lb bag would be too much, but I&#x27;m finding that I use quite a bit of it when I soak twice a week. Great buy - I will definitely be purchasing this item again.</li>
            <li> Good Product. I like how it dissolves with just swirling your hand in the tub a couple times.  I bought it mainly for baths (relax tight muscles and such).  I really like how my skin feels after I take a bath with epsom salt. I would purchase again.  Oh, and I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
            <li> This is definitely quality bulk buying at its finest.  I truly believe these salts are premium quality just by looking at the crystals.  They&#x27;re whitish with a slight twinkle of pink in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important thing for this great buy is that they truly work for sore muscles after a workout or long day.  Just a few drops of your favorite essential oil and you have an aroma/hydrotherapy bath to go.  Thank you San Francisco Salt company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside: they need sturdier bags since my bag partially opened and leaked out in transit.  Not big enough for me to return this but they should consider going to the kinds of bags used for rice.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it yet, looking forward for my relaxing bath :)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and fine grain--better quality than others that I&#x27;ve tried. which were full of chaff and other things that make cleaning the tub a problem.</li>
            <li> I used this product because it &amp;#34;seemed&amp;#34; the most consumable, &amp;#34;as in&amp;#34; to be taken orally.  I used this as part of a liver cleanse outlined in the book &amp;#34;The Liver and Gallbladder Miracle Cleanse: An All-Natural, At-Home Flush to Purify and Rejuvenate Your Body&amp;#34;. The book is available on Amazon and one of the instructions is to ingest a water/epson salt solution.  I did so with great results.  You probably won&#x27;t need 20lbs of epson salts as the recipe only calls for 4 tablespoons.  I highly recommend the book as well especially if you have gallbladder issues and even if you don&#x27;t .</li>
            <li> I am a repeat customer.  These salts are the best value around, and there&#x27;s nothing like a hot epsom salt bath to ease those muscles.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best it&#x27;s consistency is great. Works great for pain relief when soaking in tub. Thumbs up from me</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Love the quantity.  Nice to buy Epsom salt in a &#x27;bulk&#x27; package rather than the smaller cartons at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Awesome great product feel 100% what a difference</li>
            <li> I take epsom salt baths on a regular basis to soak my muscles from all the training of half marathons I do.  Buying the salt in bulk from SF Salt Co is less expensive than buying it from local pharmacy.  I&#x27;ve already bought a second 20lbs bag from this company.</li>
            <li> We use epsom salt on a very regular basis, so it was a no-brainer to try to find it in bulk.  It&#x27;s so pretty, it looks fake.  I thought it was plastic.  But it dissolves right away and I even like the plastic bag it comes in.  I just keep it near the tub and no moisture seems to be getting in.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Epsom Salts.  I use it everyday in my bath water and the bags in the retail stores are small.  So far I have found a 2 bag case at a wholesale store but I go through it very fast.  This allows me plenty of Salts at a great price.  Outside of being heavy and bulky it&#x27;s worth the price.  Especially if you are someone who uses it to make bath solutions, laundry, or other various things.</li>
            <li> I think it works. I use these after workouts and it helps relaxes me. I really like these. I would recommend</li>
            <li> very convent size.  i own a 2 acre garden and use this as fertilizer so i don&#x27;t polluted the river and wildlife.</li>
            <li> Great product! Looks completely different than the box stuff.</li>
            <li> I did not realize how heavy this would be for the size of the bag! So be warned!. Very good epsom salts.  We used them to make bath salts for gifts and for soaking our tired feet.</li>
            <li> best salt you Can buy. ....</li>
            <li> I received this product in the 2lb bag size, from the manufacturer, in exchange for an honest review.  I would like to say that I could do that, 100%.  Unfortunately, I never got to use it.  My 11 year old son was the first to claim the salts.  Apparently he had a rough day at school and martial arts and needed to soak his tired muscles.  According to the directions I was provided it was one cup of salt per bath.  That left about another cup in the bag – just enough for one more bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I prepared his bath, I was immediately struck by how large the grains were.  My bag noted they were medium size, but they were bigger than any I’d ever purchased at the local discount store.  They dissolved nicely and he claimed it was a relaxing soak and his muscles were much improved.  It was just what he needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few nights later, strangely enough, the husband was suffering from similar aches and pains and he took it upon himself to soak them away with the remainder of my salts.  Again, I was told what a nice relaxing soak he had and how good he felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I explained to the two men in my life that I was supposed to review the product they had used up, they weren’t very sorry and each offered me a handful of mildly descriptive words to help me when I did write it.  I asked “would you use this product again?”  Both said, “Yes.”  Then I asked them if they would gift it to someone, again they both replied yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing they couldn’t speak intelligently on was the price.  Neither is familiar with the grocery store or prices.  That’s the one thing I can tell you.  I think that the price is VERY comparable to other manufacturers that sell similar quality.  The one think I REALLY liked was the fact that you can see the quality and size of the grain in the clear bag.  There is nothing to hide.  Of you take delivery of this product and it’s all powder you know if before you open it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying these again, but enough for ALL of us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cherise Everhard, January 2014ain, but enough for ALL of us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cherise Everhard, January 2014</li>
            <li> Using this salt for essential oil/epsom  salt baths blends and it is great.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised, and shipped quickly</li>
            <li> I have discovered this product recently. Apparently Epsoak Epsom Salt has been around for quite a while. 20 pounds may sound a lot, but I enjoy 20-minute soaks in the bath daily. I also bring it with me in smaller containers, when I travel out of town. I am really pleased with Epsoak Epsom Salt. It makes my skin feel great, helps aches, relax. It comes in a resealable bag and ships fast despite&lt;br /&gt;the weight. I will order again.</li>
            <li> Bought Epson salt, pure salt, perfect packaged and dissolves easily in running warm water. It is exactly what the description describes. Great customer service as well, only bought this purchase one and I will continue again when my big bag will finish.</li>
            <li> If you like Epsom salt baths- this is the product to buy!  A little hard to lift and pour- but it is a 20lb bag!</li>
            <li> Only thing docking them a star is for transportation. The bag came with a rip in it so I lost about 15% of it when I opened the box.</li>
            <li> This Epsom salt is just as good (if not better) than any other I&#x27;ve tried and for 20lbs, this is a great price.  I really find that it relaxes me after a long day and makes my skin feel smooth.  If you soak your hair though while using it I would recommend extra conditioner because it will dry your hair out.  Wonderful product and wonderful company!</li>
            <li> Love this Epson Salt!  This is a large amount of salt but perfect for baths.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Great volume. Great quality. Great price. I can finally afford to enjoy Epsom soaks as often as I would like.</li>
            <li> I got my salt within couple of days and am very satisfied with the product. It is well packaged, clean and melts quickly in the bathtub. Since I&#x27;m pregnant I take Epsom salt bath once a week after working 12hr shifts on my feet and it really relaxes my body and mind. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Get price for very high quality product...crystal size is small and it dissolves very quickly.</li>
            <li> Its a huge bag of epsom salt. only complaint is that i wished the bag closed more easily. but it is what it is...a huge bag of epsom salt</li>
            <li> good for taking baths.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Huge quantity for such a great price. ((Though Costco has Dr. Teals I think for a lower price-quantity ratio)) Kinda awesome idea of this stuff. I&#x27;d never really heard of detox baths growing up, but now, what with my own kids and one going to preschool for the first time I&#x27;ve been looking into supporting and strengthening their immune systems naturally. Used it a  couple times for them without really noticing a difference, maybe sleeping better? But anyhow my son, 2years old, had a fever of 102 and I gave him a bath before bed with some lavender essential oil and his fever was gone, and by the next day he was fine. I took one with some added coconut oil, and baking soda and man I could tell I was detoxing after. Slight headache and muscle aches. These are good things in that it was working and detoxing my body, but I&#x27;ll take more precautions next time like drinking more water/tea, before and after, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also thrown a handful or two into the soil with my tomato plants and man they grew like weeds. Practically pruning every day!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to point out that instead of a harsh bleach bath that Drs recommend for eczema, Epsom salts with baking soda and coconut oil is worth considering. It&#x27;s soothing and really hydrates the skin. Can follow with either raw Shea butter, Vaseline, or Aquaphor.</li>
            <li> Part of my bath salt recipe.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I opened the box and all the salt was out of the bag and all over the box.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to know what to expect when you&#x27;re ordering from someone new and the shipment is 20 pounds. So much can go wrong. I was pleasantly surprised at the quick shipping, nice packaging and perfect epsom salts. Well done.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.  Arrived as scheduled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a habitual epsom salt bath taker, because it really helps my low back pain and insomnia.  I love the 20lb packaging, which lasts a long time and it&#x27;s a huge convenience to have it arrive on my doorstep.  The salt grains are fine and dissolve quickly, which is a big improvement over the epsom salt I&#x27;ve been buying at the drug store.  BTW, their dead sea salts are great too!</li>
            <li> Good product and value! Love this in the bath, to soak feet etc. Much more cost effective than what is sold in local stores. I mix this with a scented product as those are generally overwhelming to me. With this unscented product I can get the amount of scent perfectly balanced.</li>
            <li> I love that I can buy it in a big bag. The packaging is nice. THe one I used to buy in other stores had instructions on how to use it as laxative on both sides. That is not something I want to display in my bathroom. Imagine, my guests thinking I am constipated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared prices around and I think buy it like this, in the large bag, is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epsom salt really works for tired achy muscles and swollen feet which is great for me because I spend a lot of time on my fit at works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have love it if it came with its own scoop. The bag can be hard to close as the salt gets into the locking strip .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow this Epsom salt smell better than others I use.</li>
            <li> I make my homemade lavender salt scrubs and was buying small amounts of Epsom Salts from my local store. I dcided to invest in buying in bulk and came across this product. I loved the ease of ordering in bulk, the suprior and great quality of these salts for my scrub and the shipping was fast. Great product and will be my go to vendor for my salt scrub in future.</li>
            <li> WHat can I say. It&#x27;s as good as you expected. Relaxing after a hard workout or just a long day- dissolves easily</li>
            <li> I always use Epsom salts in my bath, but local pricing has gotten too expensive.  It&#x27;s a rather large container, but the price is worth it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Great for full body soaks or just foot soaks.  Great way to get more magnesium into your body...which is extremely important!</li>
            <li> Great value!  Ive been using this as part of a ten day detox diet.  I put two cups of Epsom salt in my bath every night. So this bag is a perfect size.  I will probably use almost all of it by the time my detox is done.  I&#x27;m currently on day six of my detox, and I&#x27;ve lost five pounds!  Of course, how much of that weight loss can be contributed to the salt versus the lack of junk food, I&#x27;m not sure. But  I&#x27;d like to think that the salt has pulled out some toxins and water weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the resealable bag isn&#x27;t very resealable.  I try to reseal and it just pops open again. I&#x27;m always afraid that if I tip it over it&#x27;s going to make a big mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I noticed in other customer reviews that some people got a free sample with their purchase.  I would have loved a free sample.... :-)</li>
            <li> Best epsom salts out there and great price too!  Love the San Francisco Salt Company!</li>
            <li> between this product and the 9pound bags they sell at costco this is a better and more fine epsom salt. It&#x27;s got a solid silky feel.</li>
            <li> I am  on my second bag of 20lbs. of this stuff and it works just as good as the high priced little bags do that you get in the drug store. If you want a fragrance, just add some essential oil to your bath and relax. Ahhhhhh</li>
            <li> Love to be able to purchase a large bag for soaking. I was going through way too many small containers. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Perfect size, so you aren&#x27;t buying weekly bags of salt. Heavy, but we keep it by the bathtub, with a cup to measure with. No heavy lifting beyond the initial delivery.</li>
            <li> I bought these not knowing much about what I would be getting.  These salts are more crystallized rather than big rock salt pieces.  They dissolve very nicely and have a great texture.  Plus, they look so clean and glitter in the light.</li>
            <li> Best epsom salt. Best price. Period.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, great price, great buy!!! :)</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to this foot soak.  I broke out with water blisters on my hands and feet after soaking with this foot soak. I went to the doctor only to find that I am alergic to the sulfiate in it.  I did not notice it had sulfiate in it. So if you are alergic to sulfa, I suggest you do not use this foot soak.  The doctor said, it wil take about a month for my skin to heel. What a mess!  I strongly suggest you be ware.</li>
            <li> Big fan of this product, makes a wonderful soak in the tub. I garden a lot, so it&#x27;s a must for me.</li>
            <li> Ordered it one day and got it the next! Love that, first of all. Secondly, I get migraines and neck and back pain daily. So I decided to start taking epsom salt baths, and this helps with the pain so much! I can actually function. I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon!&lt;br /&gt;-Chanel</li>
            <li> I use this for making bath bombs and bath salts. The quality is good and it&#x27;s easy to seal the package back up. It shipped quickly and arrived in good condition. No complaints. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I read that adding Epsom salt to garden soil really benefits the health of the plants as well as sweetens berries so I bought this size and added the recommended amount. Since I just planted, I won&#x27;t know the outcome for awhile but the quality and price are both great and the heavy duty resealable bag is very nice as well.</li>
            <li> Best quality Epsom salt EVER!  You won&#x27;t find this quality or price anywere else!  Solid bag, and being a prime member... best price you will ever get!</li>
            <li> the best at a great price</li>
            <li> Great for making bath salts. Very good quality espcially for the price. Will buy again when we run out.</li>
            <li> Interesting product that I added to my Hot Tub for relaxing muscles. I read all the cautions on everything from adverse reactions to chlorine added to destruction of the pump, motor and heater in the Hot Tub (Spa).  2 cups to a standard size hot tub is what I used and no adverse &amp;#34;anything &amp;#34;  After sitting in the water for 10 minutes my muscles are relaxed and I feel great. I don&#x27;t add the Chlorine granules at the same time as the Epson Salt to just be on the safe side. I wait 30 minutes..  When I drain the Hot Tub water each month I add the Chlorine to clear the water, wait an hour, and then add the two cups of Epson Salt.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this product. I was surprised by just how big the bag was, and definitely had to move things around in my bathroom to make space for it, but it&#x27;s so worth it. My partner and I both takes epsom salt and baking soda baths regularly (both for general relaxation and for recovery from training) and this bag has lasted me almost 6 months. I&#x27;m buying another bag now. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Fabulous! Takes up the same amount of space as 2 of the half-gallon boxes, but lasts a LOT longer!</li>
            <li> Beautiful product.  Makes my baths luxurious aroma therapy and makes my back, hips, knees, ankles and feet feel wonderful.  Really heals and removes pain.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL.....use it with some lavender oil and a little bubble bath.....very relaxing and sleep so well !!!!!</li>
            <li> Great value for the money!  A nice easy to seal bag with an air valve to force out air.</li>
            <li> Best value. Doesn&#x27;t taste good on eggs though... :-)</li>
            <li> This product is great for my evening baths.  It was clumped solid when I received it, but I simply dropped the bag on the concrete which broke up a lot of it, then I put it in a large glass apothecary jar and used an ice pick to break up the rest.  It has stayed clump free ever since.</li>
            <li> One bath, and my skin feels so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed this.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for my wallet.</li>
            <li> Nice product in bulk for a decent price. Works great for Epsom salt baths!</li>
            <li> This 19.25 lb bog of Epsom Salts comes in a heavy-duty plastic ziplock bag.  It has a nice, flat bottom so it stands upright.  I have found this to be the least-expensive way to buy ES on Amazon.  With Amazon Prime and the free shipping, this arrived well-packaged and in perfect condition for an excellent price to boot!  I saved a curvy plastic orange juice bottle from the recycling bin to fill and keep at the bathside to make it easier to handle and pour.&lt;br /&gt;Epsom Salt can be added to a bath to help relieve sore muscles, and/or the discomfort from a Herxeimer reaction during Lyme disease treatment.  Adding two cups Epsom Salts along with one cup hydrogen peroxide to the tub can go a long way to help detox.</li>
            <li> Epsom salt can cost a fortune when placed in a tiny little foo foo box.  Why bother, buy this big old sack and have a ton around for a very low price.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly.  Best buy on bulk epsom salt I found.</li>
            <li> Love adding a cup or two to my bath!  Have added it to my garden...have even used this to kill unwanted weeds with a mixture of vinegar and blue Dawn dish soap!  LOVE this product!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The bag is basically a 20 lb. brick of epsom salt and has been extremely difficult to break up.  I&#x27;m not sure why it hardened up this time because the last purchase of the same product did not have this problem.  I am dissappointed.</li>
            <li> Well, it is hard to say if this is super Epsom salt. I bought for the size (lbs.) I only use about 3/4 cup. I was directed to use the salts by an MD that said they help to relax muscles. Perhaps.</li>
            <li> I needed a big ol bag of Epsom salt, I got a big ol bag of Epsom salt. Five stars!</li>
            <li> I am delighted with my purchase. My products were shipped extremely quickly, and delivered faster than I expected. I will be back to buy more once I&#x27;m done with my 20 lbs of epsom salts!</li>
            <li> We love this salt. I think this is a really good deal for the amount of epsom salt we get. We use it for all kinds of purposes.</li>
            <li> I love the product, though the bag was packaged in over sized box and as a result busted during traveling, otherwise it would get 5 stars! Great product!!</li>
            <li> I recently ordered these when the Dead Sea bath salts by Masada we out of stock on Amazon. What a great value these are, and so clean! I have to agree with another reviewer that called these beautiful; they sparkle and glow in their sturdy plastic bag. They dissolve like a dream and seem to heal my eczema and sore muscles after exercise just as well as the Dead Sea bath salts. And the price for these was much better! Love.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this salt!  I was looking for a larger container of epsom salt than what you can typically get in a store.  This is an amazing salt and I love being able to get it in 20 pounds.  This way I don’t run out as quickly.  I also love being able to customize what essential oils I use when I want to with this plain salt.  My treat after a really hard weight and cardio workout is a hot bath with 2 cups of this in it.  It really helps to relieve some of the muscle soreness.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase. I take baths regularly (at least 1x/week). I bought this bag in December and still have 3/4 of it left. It&#x27;s a great value for the money. The salt is more fine than the CVS quarts of epsoms I had been used to buying, so it goes further. It also arrived a couple days after I ordered it via standard shipping, which was a nice surprise. Would happily buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Best value for Epsom salt out there. I use it in baths several days a week for sore muscles!</li>
            <li> Since I use the product to soak in the tub I like the shiny crystals.  Seems like a small thing but it feels more luxurious when the crystals are shiny.  Also since the crystals are stored in a nice jar near my tub they look nicer.  I have used other epsom salt products not as satisfied.  I also like being able to buy in bulk and have it shipped for my convenience. Thanks for help my day start or end nicer&lt;br /&gt;Gj</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended soaking in Epsom salt baths. I found this salt purely by accident on Amazon. However, I am so glad I did - the salt is of excellent grade. Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed when receiving this product.  The bag it comes in is resealable and heavy duty.  The salt itself is a more of a fine granule than the previous brand I used.  That&#x27;s a good thing.  It dissolves quickly and leaves your skin feeling soothed and smooth.  The best thing for winter dry skin!</li>
            <li> Great product  for soaking sore muscles &amp; helping  dislodge foreign objects in your body!  Recently wrecked my bicycle and landed in tar and small pebbles.  Visited  the local doctor whom I thought checked me out fairly well... But after my knee did not heal up after a week I decided that maybe a soak in this great product would help my problem.  It did!  Little did I know there was a kidney beans sized pebble still in my skin that the doctor had missed and was causing my leg not to heal and have infection.  I was fairly shocked when I got out of the tub and stepped on the pebble and wondered where it came from.  Later in the evening I noticed when I looked down at my leg I had quite a gaping hole from where the rock had fallen out.  Thanks to this  fine product I no longer carry around a pebble in my knee &amp;  also change doctors because of it.  I would add a photo but is rather gross.  Trust me!</li>
            <li> A great product. Really helps to reduce the aches and pains. Always a very fast and cost-effective delivery. Good people.</li>
            <li> This is a huge bag, so it will last a long time.  It works to relax and soothe muscles.  I use these when I am having muscle and nerve pain for Fibromyalgia.  When I can&#x27;t sleep, I get up and run a bath with epsom and I can fall asleep pretty quickly after I soaked for a bit.  They are non-scented, which is good because they won&#x27;t overpower, especially if you are using soaps and bubble baths with the salts.</li>
            <li> I received this huge package of Epsoak Epsom salt very quickly. The contents comes in a very strong, durable package. A real cost saver if you use epsom salt a lot as I do. As an avid runner soaking 3 days a week really helps the achy muscles.  Joan</li>
            <li> Best deal on epsom salt! Great experience all around.</li>
            <li> great product and great delivery.</li>
            <li> Great price and wonderful product to use for a full bath of soaking muscles. Truly pulls the soreness out. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Smaller grind, easier to mix and dissolve.  Purchased for use as ingredient in household cleaning recipes and for bath and foot soaks.  So many ways benefit from epsom salts. Great price and great product.  Will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I take Epsom baths every day to help achy joints.  It seems to really make a difference.  I keep a big jar of this in the bathroom and put one cup in my bath water and soak for 15 - 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I seriously cannot get enough of this product. It was recommended to me in my 7th month of pregnancy and I wish I had discovered it sooner. I was going through cartons of much more expensively priced epsom salt at the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first, THIS IS HEAVY because you&#x27;re getting A LOT of epsom salt. Whenever I get a delivery of it via Amazon Prime Fresh, I have a hard time lugging it from the door to my bathroom. But to me, the price is worth the effort though and convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epsom salt works and this product does not disappoint helping me relax my muscles in tub or soak my feet in the shower. It definitely has helped me with my chronic aches and pains. I use it faithfully every night, especially while pregnant!</li>
            <li> too heavy to bring in my suitcase!, had to return it!!</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price!</li>
            <li> Use for a hot soaking bath.  Fertilize the plants.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for to make my bath salts. The quality is excellent and I will definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> Timely Shipping and good product</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best I have used. I will always order this in the future.</li>
            <li> Great product with great price</li>
            <li> Got package quick.  Perfect use to keep my palm trees nice and green.  Using a cup for each Palm once a month to add acidity and other necessities to the ground.  Would recommend buying from them.</li>
            <li> Amazing salts that create an amazing bath!!!  My muscles and body feel great after a good soak!!  Great Price!  Super convienent to get such a large bag!!</li>
            <li> A great way to relax. Toss in a cup of salt and a cup of Backing Soda and soak for at least 20 min.</li>
            <li> All the bath salts I&#x27;ve tried by The San Francisco Salt Co. seem to be a cut above the rest, very high end. These are no exception. The Epsom Salts dissolved instantly and made my bath very relaxing after a stressful day at work. And they didn&#x27;t make my dry skin even more dry. I was provided a small sample by The San Francisco Bath Salt Co.</li>
            <li> Great value!  Its not easy to find bags this large where I am.  So I am grateful.</li>
            <li> Great product and price is extremely good.  Will purchase Epsoak Epsom Salts from now on.  Could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> i frequently buy this product, it works as expected and it&#x27;s a high quality salt at a reasonable price. I use a lot of epsom salt, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to order a large amount. I use this for sore/achey muscles, and sometimes even hangovers. It also is really great for preparing me for sleep, if I take a bath with this before bed I&#x27;m more likely to fall asleep quickly.</li>
            <li> Product arrived exactly as advertised and on time very pleased</li>
            <li> Epsoms salts with essential oils are awesome! I love this stuff</li>
            <li> Resealable top of the bag is kind of a nightmare, but the price is good and I didn&#x27;t have to haul it home :)</li>
            <li> Great deal and great product and fast ship!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great salt. No big crystals to break up.</li>
            <li> The salt itself is good, but trouble getting it out of the bag made me mark it down to 2 stars.  The bag is vacuum sealed.  This caused the salt to congeal into 1 big sold chunk.  I&#x27;ve had to use a pick to break it up so that I can use it.  Quite annoying!  Even bashing it down on the floor didn&#x27;t break it up.  My next purchase will be something else easier to get out of the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED 12/14/2014  The company saw my initial review and sent me a new bag.  The new bag was perfect.  Not all stuck together in one big lump.  I really appreciate this customer service and the product is great!</li>
            <li> Great product, resealable bag.  I use all the time.</li>
            <li> Such a great value for those people who talk frequent baths or who make scented bath salts.</li>
            <li> great, great product!!</li>
            <li> I appreciate being able to buy Epsom salt in the large 20-pound size. I use the salt nearly every day for soaking away the muscle aching I experience due to fibromyalgia. The relief is temporary, but welcome, and comes with no side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that you care about the appearance of the salt that you will dissolve in your bath water, but this salt is truly beautiful. The crystals are rectangular and glistening white with none of the dirty looking flakes I have seen in other Epsom salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A superior product, and packaged well in a sturdy plastic bag.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product Sept. 19 with the only available shipping 3 - 5 days. My expected date of delivery was Sept 25-27. I found the package on my doorstep Sept. 22! I immediately  bathed in the salt after my afternoon workout. I woke up the next day like nothing happened. Normally my upper body is in pain for the next 2 days after a session. This stuff works great and I am impressed with the speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> I  loved the easy to open pouch and the epsoms  salts were great.  I would in the future  order more.  I use them almost daily!  In the tub, in my garden... etc.</li>
            <li> I love soaking in baths. Epsom salts are the way to go to soften the water, and keep your skin feeling great. Not to mention that it&#x27;s a good way to pull some toxins out of the skin. The Epsoak brand of Epsom salts was great. The price was quite fair - compared to what I&#x27;ve seen in stores - and the product itself is exactly what you would expect. Great brand, great salts. These salts do the trick and I plan to buy them regularly.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get enough! I love it</li>
            <li> awesome deal - I will buy my epsom salts from Amazon going forward!</li>
            <li> Awesome price, great product....I need to order more before this option is no longer available! No need to be stingy with my bath salts ever again...I have plenty to spare. :)</li>
            <li> I have a large garden tub requiring more then 2 cups of salt per bath.  I was concerned about purchasing a 20 lb bag, but now that I have it I can see I picked the right one.  I am no expert on Epsom salts.  I shopped around and found this to be a fair price.  Purchasing it in the drug store or else where is terribly expensive comparatively speaking.  This is the way to go.  As I said I&#x27;m no expert, but I do think this to be a quality salt because it does the job I want it to do, and the medium grain dissolves immediately.  One swish of the water and dissolved.  It leaves no residue.  It is relaxing, but I mostly started to bath in Epsom salt because I have acne on my shoulders, and at my age it is just crazy that I should still be having acne problems.  I started thinking I need to hit the beach, one day in the ocean fixes me right up for a long time, and then I thought, &amp;#34;hey, Epsom salt&amp;#34;.  So I&#x27;m trying it.  It&#x27;s no cure in a day, but it does seem to be working nicely, clearing up my acne and not drying my skin out.  I&#x27;m pleased.  The salt comes in a very heavy duty zip lock bag so no worries about storage. So there&#x27;s the review from the novice Epsom bather.</li>
