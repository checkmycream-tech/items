            <li>We love the sizes too!</li>
            <li>These toothbrush heads are great quality - and compared to the competitors such at phillips sonic care etc, Oral B has the best!</li>
            <li>The heads are not hard and are perfect for people who has gum problem like me.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for kids as they have a soft buzz.</li>

            <li>These heads are great, fit perfectly and half the cost.</li>
            <li>I was able to let him use these for a couple weeks</li>
            <li>the I had to purchase more.</li>
            <li>I find that brush head to be effective and more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to return them if I could.</li>
            <li>Love the YouTube</li>
            <li>My pearly whites are gleaming! :)</li>
            <li>They also fits many sizes in the market.</li>
            <li>Glad that it comes in a set of four</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!!!</li>
            <li>This set of electric tooth brush heads are a great alternative to going to the store and buying a set of new heads which will cost you much more money.</li>
            <li>These brushes, though not are from the original brands, they do very fine.</li>
            <li>Great product, super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>These brushes are pretty good compare to the original.</li>
            <li>These work better that the original brushes that came with my Braun tooth brush.</li>
            <li>But they work just fine and the price is phenomenal!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I looked for a listing that said Genuine Oral B and ordered for that reason.  </li>
            <li>Initial inspection compared to the brand name, these looked great.</li>
            <li>The quality does not feel cheap at all</li>
            <li>First time ordering product and it exceeded our expectations to what we were expecting and the pricing is so much better than what is ordered</li>
            <li>These are real great, I was desperate for a set of replacement tooth brush heads and these ones are just great, had absolutely no problems and they&#x27;re much better than any alternatives, I just love them!</li>
            <li>My husband is using this product and says that he is amazed at how clean his teeth feel after using them with his rechargeable Oral B.  </li>
            <li>very fast delivery and overall really great product, gets my 10/10</li>
            <li>These work really well for minimizing plaque buildup, cleaning gum pockets and keeping gums healthy etc.  </li>
            <li>This could be an adequate and cheaper alternative to the Bruan brushes.  </li>
            <li>The quality of this product seemed much better than the cheapest generic head and in fact it spun better.</li>
            <li>In the future I&#x27;d probably end up spending more money for a better product.</li>
            <li>Will be sure to buy more in the future!</li>
            <li>Prompt, cheap price, and exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>They fit in my three year old&#x27;s mouth just fine</li>
            <li>So far they seem fine, and the price was MUCH more reasonable.</li>
            <li>So far it has been an ok experience.  </li>
            <li>Worth a try, I guess.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the more expensive ones, but for cheap!</li>
            <li>It was worth trying tho.</li>
            <li>My kids also love it because it is soft for their teeth.</li>
            <li>They are especially good for children or adults with small jaws as the heads are easily maneuvered around the close confines of back teeth without causing a gag reflex.</li>
            <li>It really deeps cleans your teeth and leaves your mouth fresh and clean</li>
            <li>They hold up good and they are a fraction of the cost compared to other brush heads.</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>Checked them all to make sure they worked and they do, and I&#x27;ve been using the first one for several weeks without any problems!</li>
            <li>The same quality brush cost more at either Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li>Within 3 days of using the first head it broke.</li>
            <li>- You will really notice a difference using these toothbrush heads!</li>
            <li>I will most definitely be ordering these again.</li>
            <li>One broke on the first use.  </li>
            <li>The first brush head lasted about 3 days before it stopped spinning.</li>
            <li>After 1 week of use, I felt I was doing more work pushing the brush head around and realized the head was not actually moving.</li>
            <li>The first one I used broke in a week.</li>
            <li>Basically about half or more end up breaking pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>great so far ... far better than the other generic ones I had tried</li>
            <li>The bristles are not harsh so (specially) kids won&#x27;t have problem using them.</li>
            <li>The 2nd head has been working fine.</li>
            <li>They break fast, don&#x27;t bother with such cheap quality.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li>I really like these and would buy them again.</li>
            <li>These are absolutely junk.</li>
            <li>really like these heads, inspired me to get some for me and my bf.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;splurge&amp;#34; and get the real oral-b ones.</li>
            <li>Very durable</li>
            <li>I will go back to the original Oral-B brush head after I use them.</li>
            <li>The other head has held up a bit better</li>
            <li>They are packaged in a generic package but to me they are original brushheads.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve only used two of the four heads so far, and have only had them for about a week, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised when I attached my first toothbrush head to my Oral B 1000 electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Down to one more of these.</li>
            <li>Braun Oral B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Head - Small Pulse Bristles Provide a Floss-like Clean - Sensitive Teeth - Deep Cleaning - High Quality and Affordable]]These heads are great and a fraction of the cost of heads purchased at the drug store.  </li>
            <li>The seller does try to keep the star rating high.</li>
            <li>I do not like flossing, so I purchased this with high hopes that would help...but also knowing it would not take the place of flossing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure all the 5 star reviews are fake (as are many 5 star reviews on Amazon), the only Verified Purchasers give 1 or 2 stars.  </li>
            <li>I broke three heads just through normal brushing (they stop oscillating) in a matter of weeks, should have lasted a year.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made, one broke and the other got stuck, would not recommend verses buying at a box store</li>
            <li>After a couple months of daily use, I&#x27;m not crazy about the little plastic arms that supposedly give this brush head the &amp;#34;floss action.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m glad I only purchased this item once.</li>
            <li>I had to buy a new Oral machine due that current one was breaking but with the new machine these electric tooth brushes worked with this new machine just fine.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t compare, but these have worked beautifully so far.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the quality and how well they were made.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised these toothbrush heads are a knock off.  </li>
            <li>The price is much cheaper then at my local store, which is always a plus.</li>
            <li>Regardless if just a random one in the package of 4 that wasn&#x27;t good, it broke too soon</li>
            <li>Just as good as the expensive ones.</li>
            <li>Why pay more for the name brand product when you can have the same thing for less money and achieve similar results?  </li>
            <li>The first stopped spinning on the second use and the second one stopped within five uses.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a bit larger than the all purpose head the toothbrush came with, but not ridiculously so.</li>
            <li>very high quality toothbrush heads here, lasted a long time however I did buy 8 of them</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re bulkier than the original Oral-B brushes and the bristles are MUCH stiffer, even painful, compared to the original brushes.</li>
            <li>and I personally think a little bit better than the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>Used one week and messed up my gums - could barely chew.  </li>
            <li>I used to use old manual tooth brushes but they did not really do enough cleaning.</li>
            <li>First toothbrush head quit rotating/working in less than 10 days of use.</li>
            <li>No more trying to cram a larger toothbrush head between your cheek and gums while trying to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li>The spring in one of the heads broke in the first few days.</li>
            <li>Yes, they are cheaply made but they also only cost a fraction of the name brand toothbrush heads, so you&#x27;re seriously getting what you pay for with these.</li>
            <li>I thought they were decent at first but after changing heads several times after that I&#x27;ve determined they are no good.</li>

            <li> I used to use old manual tooth brushes but they did not really do enough cleaning.</li>
            <li> First toothbrush head quit rotating/working in less than 10 days of use.</li>
            <li> No more trying to cram a larger toothbrush head between your cheek and gums while trying to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li> The spring in one of the heads broke in the first few days.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are cheaply made but they also only cost a fraction of the name brand toothbrush heads, so you&#x27;re seriously getting what you pay for with these.</li>
            <li> I thought they were decent at first but after changing heads several times after that I&#x27;ve determined they are no good.</li>
            <li> Definitely will recommend to my friends and be a long time customer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these replacement heads break easily.  </li>
            <li> The original brand named head was so expensive, so I wanted to get something cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> These brushes came in generic packaging in a foreign language.  </li>
            <li> Very hard bristles and 2 broke within the first 3 days.</li>
            <li> Because the heads are small you can clean behind back teeth and massage the gum line in comfort and ease.  </li>
            <li> Two of them have broken in the first 8 days.</li>
            <li> Two of the four broke within days, (Spring came loose).  </li>
            <li> but this one is very soft and delicate.</li>
            <li> They are small enough to get into the little spots in your mouth, but big enough that you do not feel like you are wasting your time!</li>
            <li> Some have lasted a few weeks, but some only days.</li>
            <li> One should go for these first before trying the expensive options,</li>
            <li> Other electric toothbrush&#x27;s would potentionally hurt children teeth</li>
            <li> I was a little leery of buying them with the negative reviews, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one brush head over the past month and a half, but it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to be doing</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first buying non OEM toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li> Not worth your time or money.</li>
            <li> Two prior negative reviews have been deleted.</li>
            <li> These generic heads work just like the Oral B &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; heads that are at least two to three times the price.</li>
            <li> All 4 brushes lasted less than a month.</li>
            <li> Three of four stopped spinning in less than 10 uses.  </li>
            <li> We have had them for less than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I recommend the Electric Toothbrush Heads for anyone trying out new brand and not paying the expensive price.</li>
            <li> so I got these for him hoping to save a little money on toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> and she hasn&#x27;t complained about the size or sensation of the little rubber tooth picks.</li>
            <li> all of these broke in a few days of use - two heads broke the day after I used them!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;d buy these again.</li>
            <li> Bristles are very stiff.</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads are way to hard.</li>
            <li> The brushes are hard and leaves your teeth feeling like they&#x27;d be sandpapered.</li>
            <li> Poorly made; will buy from oral-b at this point.</li>
            <li> Breaks in half when attached to toothbrush base.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BEWARE:  they break immediately, and should be removed from Amazon website because of fake reviews.</li>
            <li> No Bueno, unfortunately...</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, unbelievably bad</li>
            <li> products and I am disappointed before even using the produce.</li>
            <li> These are horrible.  </li>
            <li> horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Each of the heads broke in about 2 days. Not worth your time or money.</li>
            <li> My son has braces and has to use a spinner toothbrush so I got these for him hoping to save a little money on toothbrush heads. They worked great for about a week then they quit spinning or the bristles just didn&#x27;t hold up to his braces. I was able to let him use these for a couple weeks the I had to purchase more. Back to searching again thank you</li>
            <li> So far it has been an ok experience.  One of the four pieces broke within 3 weeks and ceased to spin.  The others have been working properly.  This could be an adequate and cheaper alternative to the Bruan brushes.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> perfect for braun oral b</li>
            <li> Well, that&#x27;s my 3rd time trying to leave a review for this product. Two prior negative reviews have been deleted. The seller does try to keep the star rating high. The product itself is junk! All 4 brushes lasted less than a month. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!!!</li>
            <li> No problems with the ordering process or delivery, but I tried two of the heads before giving up. The first stopped spinning on the second use and the second one stopped within five uses. Worth a try, I guess.</li>
            <li> I do not like flossing, so I purchased this with high hopes that would help...but also knowing it would not take the place of flossing. After a couple months of daily use, I&#x27;m not crazy about the little plastic arms that supposedly give this brush head the &amp;#34;floss action.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m glad I only purchased this item once. I will go back to the original Oral-B brush head after I use them. I find that brush head to be effective and more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Used one week and messed up my gums - could barely chew.  Switched to the brand name Oral B head and my gums cleared up. These toothbrush heads are way to hard.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a new Oral machine due that current one was breaking but with the new machine these electric tooth brushes worked with this new machine just fine.</li>
            <li> These things work great! Checked them all to make sure they worked and they do, and I&#x27;ve been using the first one for several weeks without any problems! Will buy these again!!</li>
            <li> Excellent Value! The same quality brush cost more at either Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li> These heads are great, fit perfectly and half the cost. Would recommend to anyone needing replacement heads. Fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> First time ordering product and it exceeded our expectations to what we were expecting and the pricing is so much better than what is ordered elsewhere&lt;br /&gt;.  thank you very much</li>
            <li> These are horrible.  They&#x27;re bulkier than the original Oral-B brushes and the bristles are MUCH stiffer, even painful, compared to the original brushes.</li>
            <li> all of these broke in a few days of use - two heads broke the day after I used them!  I&#x27;m pretty sure all the 5 star reviews are fake (as are many 5 star reviews on Amazon), the only Verified Purchasers give 1 or 2 stars.  You get what you pay for, unbelievably bad product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE:  they break immediately, and should be removed from Amazon website because of fake reviews.</li>
            <li> Bit noisy - not as good as the original.</li>
            <li> These are not officially made by Oral-B, and are sold in Germany or someplace based on the language on the packaging.  But they seem to work the same.  Based on the price, I&#x27;ll probably order again.</li>
            <li> Add says buy one get one. I only got one misleading</li>
            <li> Three out of the four broke and wouldn&#x27;t rotate.</li>
            <li> I think these are a good blend of quality and price. They hold up good and they are a fraction of the cost compared to other brush heads.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve only used two of the four heads so far, and have only had them for about a week, but so far so good. These generic heads work just like the Oral B &amp;#34;floss action&amp;#34; heads that are at least two to three times the price.</li>
            <li> Prompt, cheap price, and exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> These work better that the original brushes that came with my Braun tooth brush.</li>
            <li> The shipper did great with the delivery but the product sucked. Within 3 days of using the first head it broke. With in 2 days of using the the 2nd head it broke. The 3rd head broke within one minute of using it. Down to one more of these. Hope the Oral-B ones come soon. Do not buy this product you are wasting your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried the name brand for this type of head so I can&#x27;t compare, but these have worked beautifully so far. They&#x27;re a bit larger than the all purpose head the toothbrush came with, but not ridiculously so. They fit in my three year old&#x27;s mouth just fine and she hasn&#x27;t complained about the size or sensation of the little rubber tooth picks. I really like these and would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Very similar to the OEM in appearence. Overall they work and I cant see paying the difference for the OEM items. These are 1/3 the price.</li>
            <li> Breaks in half when attached to toothbrush base. Poorly made; will buy from oral-b at this point.</li>
            <li> They break fast, don&#x27;t bother with such cheap quality.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely junk. Two of them have broken in the first 8 days. If I could give this product zero stars I would. I have never had a tooth brush break before.</li>
            <li> 2 out of four have already quit spinning.</li>
            <li> The spring in one of the heads broke in the first few days. The other head has held up a bit better but I feel like the bristles are a lot stiffer than the Oral-B heads (maybe it&#x27;s just me though). I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;d buy these again.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first buying non OEM toothbrush heads.  However, I was pleasantly surprised when I attached my first toothbrush head to my Oral B 1000 electric toothbrush.  I have been using this for about two weeks now without any issues.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the more expensive ones, but for cheap!</li>
            <li> These toothbrush heads are great quality - and compared to the competitors such at phillips sonic care etc, Oral B has the best! It really deeps cleans your teeth and leaves your mouth fresh and clean - You will really notice a difference using these toothbrush heads!</li>
            <li> I looked for a listing that said Genuine Oral B and ordered for that reason.  I received generic &amp;#34;comparable to&amp;#34; products and I am disappointed before even using the produce.</li>
            <li> My husband is using this product and says that he is amazed at how clean his teeth feel after using them with his rechargeable Oral B.  I like the compact head design of this product.  The price is great too.</li>
            <li> These brushheads seem to be oem. They are packaged in a generic package but to me they are original brushheads. A+</li>
            <li> Very hard bristles and 2 broke within the first 3 days. I will try to get a refund but...you get what you pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> great so far ... far better than the other generic ones I had tried</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00N9D30T8 Electric Toothbrush Heads - Set of 4 - compatible with Braun Oral B Professional Floss Action Replacement Brush Head - Small Pulse Bristles Provide a Floss-like Clean - Sensitive Teeth - Deep Cleaning - High Quality and Affordable]]These heads are great and a fraction of the cost of heads purchased at the drug store.  They are especially good for children or adults with small jaws as the heads are easily maneuvered around the close confines of back teeth without causing a gag reflex. Because the heads are small you can clean behind back teeth and massage the gum line in comfort and ease.  No more trying to cram a larger toothbrush head between your cheek and gums while trying to clean your teeth.  These heads are identical in every respect to the more expensive name brand electric toothbrush heads, I could detect no difference when I did a close inspection and comparison.  Why pay more for the name brand product when you can have the same thing for less money and achieve similar results?  I will most definitely be ordering these again.</li>
            <li> My children has some electric toothbrush, but we had problems with the heads, because you all know, children like doing anything with those toothbrush heads. The original brand named head was so expensive, so I wanted to get something cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush head is a good quality one, and it fits perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I really like these heads, inspired me to get some for me and my bf.</li>
            <li> I find that these heads do not work well with my Oral B electric toothbrush (type: 3756F412). I definitely do not get the &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; power like I do from the Oral B heads, plus it drains my battery after 4-5 uses. I&#x27;d love to return them if I could.</li>
            <li> horrible. &amp;#34;splurge&amp;#34; and get the real oral-b ones. these don&#x27;t rotate/brush as well at all!</li>
            <li> These brushes, though not are from the original brands, they do very fine. The bristles are not harsh so (specially) kids won&#x27;t have problem using them. One should go for these first before trying the expensive options,</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, one broke and the other got stuck, would not recommend verses buying at a box store</li>
            <li> I used to use old manual tooth brushes but they did not really do enough cleaning. I got an automatic tooth brush with these head and boy these just do the trick. I have been cleaning and scrubbing and of course no cavities.</li>
            <li> These are real great, I was desperate for a set of replacement tooth brush heads and these ones are just great, had absolutely no problems and they&#x27;re much better than any alternatives, I just love them!</li>
            <li> Great product, super fast delivery. Love the YouTube thank you video. Definitely will recommend to my friends and be a long time customer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these replacement heads break easily.  Some have lasted a few weeks, but some only days.</li>
            <li> Three of four stopped spinning in less than 10 uses.  One broke on the first use.  Bristles are very stiff.</li>
            <li> This set of electric tooth brush heads are a great alternative to going to the store and buying a set of new heads which will cost you much more money. I have used both and this set works just as good and I personally think a little bit better than the more expensive ones. These are built very nicely and fits on to your existing electric toothbrush and is well worth a purchase. I recommend this product to all of my family so they can save themselves some money on a great product.</li>
            <li> The 4th head of the 4pack just broke. We have had them for less than 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Two of the four broke within days, (Spring came loose).  I&#x27;m sticking with the brand name stuff.</li>
            <li> The first brush head lasted about 3 days before it stopped spinning. I am on brush head #2 and hop it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product seemed much better than the cheapest generic head and in fact it spun better. I was very happy and planned to buy more until today. It only took 9 days that the head stopped spinning. I used it three times a day for about 3 minutes each. Oh well. It was worth trying tho.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a few uses.  Will stick with the brand name ones instead.</li>
            <li> These work great. I was a little leery of buying them with the negative reviews, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems so far. I&#x27;ve only used one brush head over the past month and a half, but it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to be doing which is all you can ask for!</li>
            <li> Initial inspection compared to the brand name, these looked great. After 1 week of use, I felt I was doing more work pushing the brush head around and realized the head was not actually moving. For comparison I put a brand name one on it and the brush head moved back and forth rapidly. Regardless if just a random one in the package of 4 that wasn&#x27;t good, it broke too soon and I won&#x27;t risk a purchase of these again.</li>
            <li> I am really happy I decided to purchase these.  I was surprised at the quality and how well they were made.  These work really well for minimizing plaque buildup, cleaning gum pockets and keeping gums healthy etc.  My pearly whites are gleaming! :)</li>
            <li> The first one I used broke in a week. Yes, they are cheaply made but they also only cost a fraction of the name brand toothbrush heads, so you&#x27;re seriously getting what you pay for with these. In the future I&#x27;d probably end up spending more money for a better product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay the exorbitant price for the name brand replacements, so I decided to try these. So far they seem fine, and the price was MUCH more reasonable.</li>
            <li> I was surprised these toothbrush heads are a knock off.  But they work just fine and the price is phenomenal!&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely re-order.</li>
            <li> These could not have been any better! The price is much cheaper then at my local store, which is always a plus. My teeth are whiter then ever, and it comes with 4, so I can split them with my wife! We love the sizes too! They are small enough to get into the little spots in your mouth, but big enough that you do not feel like you are wasting your time! Will be sure to buy more in the future!</li>
            <li> very high quality toothbrush heads here, lasted a long time however I did buy 8 of them so ye. very fast delivery and overall really great product, gets my 10/10</li>
            <li> These brushes are pretty good compare to the original. The heads are not hard and are perfect for people who has gum problem like me. My kids also love it because it is soft for their teeth. They also fits many sizes in the market. I recommend the Electric Toothbrush Heads for anyone trying out new brand and not paying the expensive price.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for kids as they have a soft buzz. Other electric toothbrush&#x27;s would potentionally hurt children teeth but this one is very soft and delicate. My kids have been using this for awhile now and they tell me that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Changing my review. Basically about half or more end up breaking pretty quickly. I thought they were decent at first but after changing heads several times after that I&#x27;ve determined they are no good. I will buy OEM heads from now on. I even gave these a second try with a second order. No Bueno, unfortunately...</li>
            <li> I have been using this type of toothbrush for over 8 years. These brushes came in generic packaging in a foreign language.  I broke three heads just through normal brushing (they stop oscillating) in a matter of weeks, should have lasted a year.  Never had these problems with the name brand.</li>
            <li> First toothbrush head quit rotating/working in less than 10 days of use. The 2nd head has been working fine.</li>
            <li> Best heads I&#x27;ve used. Very durable and you can just feel that it properly brushes your teeth. Glad that it comes in a set of four so I won&#x27;t run out of these for some time. The quality does not feel cheap at all and over it&#x27;s the ideal product.</li>
            <li> The only verified purchases give this product one or two stars. All 5 star reviews are not verified and probably bogus.    Shame on Amazon for allowing this to happen. I almost fell for it.</li>
            <li> I am in the process of returning this product. The brushes are hard and leaves your teeth feeling like they&#x27;d be sandpapered. I do not recommend this product. Plus this was not manufactured in the United States. Should be stated somewhere.</li>
            <li> Will buy these in the future.  Just as good as the expensive ones.</li>
